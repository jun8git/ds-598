We shrunk the dimensions <eol> of this technology <eob> from the micron scale <eol> to the true nanoscale. <eob>
So how does it work? <eob>
In a nutshell, <eob> a set of tiny pillars <eol> separated by nanoscopic gaps <eob> are arranged in such a way <eob> that the system divides <eol> the fluid into streamlines, <eob> with the larger cancer-related <eol> nanoparticles being separated <eob> through a process of redirection <eol> from the smaller, healthier ones, <eob> which can in contrast <eob> move around the pillars <eol> in a zigzag-type motion <eob> in the direction of fluid flow. <eob>
The net result is a complete separation <eol> of these two particle populations. <eob>
You can visualize this separation process <eob> similar to traffic on a highway <eol> that separates into two roads, <eob> with one road going into <eol> a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain, <eob> and the other road going around it. <eob>
Here, smaller cars <eol> can go through the tunnel <eob> while larger trucks, <eol> carrying potentially hazardous material, <eob> are forced to take the detour route. <eob>
Traffic is effectively separated <eol> by size and contents <eob> without impeding its flow. <eob>
And this is exactly how our system works <eol> on a much, much smaller scale. <eob>
The idea here is that <eol> the separation process for screening <eob> could be as simple as processing <eol> a sample of urine, blood or saliva, <eob> which is a near-term possibility <eol> within the next few years. <eob>
Ultimately, it could be used <eol> to isolate and detect target exosomes <eob> associated with <eol> a particular type of cancer, <eob> sensing and reporting <eol> their presence within minutes. <eob>
This would make rapid diagnostics <eol> virtually painless. <eob>
Broadly speaking, <eob> the ability to separate <eol> and enrich biomarkers <eob> with nanoscale precision <eol> in an automated way, <eob> opens the door to better understanding <eol> diseases such as cancer, <eob> with applications ranging <eol> from sample preparation to diagnostics, <eob> and from drug resistance <eol> monitoring to therapeutics. <eob>
Even before my wife's bout with cancer, <eob> it was a dream of mine to facilitate <eol> the automation of this process -- <eob> to make regular screening more accessible, <eob> similar to the way Henry Ford <eol> made the automobile accessible <eob> to the general population <eob> through development of the assembly line. <eob>
Automation is the key to accessibility. <eob>
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream, <eob> "a chicken in every pot <eol> and a car in every garage," <eob> we're developing a technology <eob> that could ultimately place <eol> an early-warning cancer detection system <eob> in every home. <eob>
This would allow <eol> every man, woman and child <eob> the opportunity to be regularly tested <eol> while they're still healthy, <eob> catching cancer when it first emerges. <eob>
It is my hope and dream <eob> to help people around the world <eol> avoid the high costs -- <eob> physical, financial and emotional -- <eob> faced by today's cancer patients, <eob> hardships that I'm well acquainted with. <eob>
I'm also happy to report that because <eol> we caught my wife's cancer early, <eob> her treatment was successful, <eob> and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It is an outcome that I would like to see <eol> for everyone with a cancer diagnosis. <eob>
With the work that my team <eol> has already done <eob> on separation of nanoscale biomarkers <eob> for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics, <eob> I am optimistic <eol> that within the next decade, <eob> this type of technology will be available, <eob> helping protect our friends, <eol> our family and future generations. <eob>
Even if we are so unlucky <eol> as to be diagnosed with cancer, <eob> that early-stage alarm <eol> will provide a strong beacon of hope. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The last time I heard my son's voice <eob> was when he walked out the front door <eob> on his way to school. <eob>
He called out one word in the darkness: <eob> "Bye." <eob>
It was April 20, 1999. <eob>
Later that morning, <eol> at Columbine High School, <eob> my son Dylan and his friend Eric <eob> killed 12 students and a teacher <eob> and wounded more than 20 others <eol> before taking their own lives. <eob>
Thirteen innocent people were killed, <eob> leaving their loved ones <eol> in a state of grief and trauma. <eob>
Others sustained injuries, <eob> some resulting in disfigurement <eol> and permanent disability. <eob>
But the enormity of the tragedy <eob> can't be measured only by the number <eol> of deaths and injuries that took place. <eob>
There's no way to quantify <eol> the psychological damage <eob> of those who were in the school, <eob> or who took part <eol> in rescue or cleanup efforts. <eob>
There's no way to assess <eol> the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine, <eob> especially when it can be a blueprint <eob> for other shooters who go on <eol> to commit atrocities of their own. <eob>
Columbine was a tidal wave, <eob> and when the crash ended, <eob> it would take years <eol> for the community and for society <eob> to comprehend its impact. <eob>
It has taken me years <eol> to try to accept my son's legacy. <eob>
The cruel behavior <eol> that defined the end of his life <eob> showed me that he was a completely <eol> different person from the one I knew. <eob>
Afterwards people asked, <eob> "How could you not know? <eob>
What kind of a mother were you?" <eob> I still ask myself those same questions. <eob>
Before the shootings, <eol> I thought of myself as a good mom. <eob>
Helping my children become caring, <eob> healthy, responsible adults <eob> was the most important role of my life. <eob>
But the tragedy convinced me <eol> that I failed as a parent, <eob> and it's partially this sense of failure <eol> that brings me here today. <eob>
Aside from his father, <eob> I was the one person <eol> who knew and loved Dylan the most. <eob>
If anyone could have known <eol> what was happening, <eob> it should have been me, right? <eob>
But I didn't know. <eob>
Today, I'm here to share the experience <eob> of what it's like to be the mother <eol> of someone who kills and hurts. <eob>
For years after the tragedy, <eol> I combed through memories, <eob> trying to figure out <eol> exactly where I failed as a parent. <eob>
But there are no simple answers. <eob>
I can't give you any solutions. <eob>
All I can do <eob> is share what I have learned. <eob>
When I talk to people <eol> who didn't know me before the shootings, <eob> I have three challenges to meet. <eob>
First, when I walk into a room like this, <eob> I never know if someone there <eol> has experienced loss <eob> because of what my son did. <eob>
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering <eol> caused by a member of my family <eob> who isn't here to do it for himself. <eob>
So first, with all of my heart, <eob> I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain. <eob>
The second challenge I have <eob> is that I must ask for understanding <eol> and even compassion <eob> when I talk about <eol> my son's death as a suicide. <eob>
Two years before he died, <eob> he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook <eob> that he was cutting himself. <eob>
He said that he was in agony <eob> and wanted to get a gun <eol> so he could end his life. <eob>
I didn't know about any of this <eol> until months after his death. <eob>
When I talk about his death as a suicide, <eob> I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness <eol> he showed at the end of his life. <eob>
I'm trying to understand <eob> how his suicidal thinking <eob> led to murder. <eob>
After a lot of reading <eol> and talking with experts, <eob> I have come to believe <eob> that his involvement in the shootings <eol> was rooted not in his desire to kill <eob> but in his desire to die. <eob>
The third challenge I have <eol> when I talk about my son's murder-suicide <eob> is that I'm talking about mental health -- <eob> excuse me -- <eob> is that I'm talking about mental health, <eob> or brain health, as I prefer to call it, <eol> because it's more concrete. <eob>
And in the same breath, <eol> I'm talking about violence. <eob>
The last thing I want to do <eol> is to contribute to the misunderstanding <eob> that already exists around mental illness. <eob>
Only a very small percent of those <eol> who have a mental illness <eob> are violent toward other people, <eob> but of those who die by suicide, <eob> it's estimated that about 75 <eol> to maybe more than 90 percent <eob> have a diagnosable <eol> mental health condition of some kind. <eob>
As you all know very well, <eob> our mental health care system <eol> is not equipped to help everyone, <eob> and not everyone with destructive thoughts <eob> fits the criteria <eob> for a specific diagnosis. <eob>
Many who have ongoing feelings <eob> of fear or anger or hopelessness <eob> are never assessed or treated. <eob>
Too often, they get our attention <eol> only if they reach a behavioral crisis. <eob>
If estimates are correct <eob> that about one <eol> to two percent of all suicides <eob> involves the murder of another person, <eob> when suicide rates rise, <eol> as they are rising for some populations, <eob> the murder-suicide rates <eol> will rise as well. <eob>
I wanted to understand what was going on <eol> in Dylan's mind prior to his death, <eob> so I looked for answers <eol> from other survivors of suicide loss. <eob>
I did research and volunteered <eol> to help with fund-raising events, <eob> and whenever I could, <eob> I talked with those who had <eol> survived their own suicidal crisis <eob> or attempt. <eob>
One of the most helpful <eol> conversations I had <eob> was with a coworker <eob> who overheard me talking to someone else <eob> in my office cubicle. <eob>
She heard me say <eol> that Dylan could not have loved me <eob> if he could do something <eol> as horrible as he did. <eob>
Later, when she found me alone, <eob> she apologized for overhearing <eol> that conversation, <eob> but told me that I was wrong. <eob>
She said that when she was <eol> a young, single mother <eob> with three small children, <eob> she became severely depressed <eol> and was hospitalized to keep her safe. <eob>
At the time, she was certain <eob> that her children <eol> would be better off if she died, <eob> so she had made a plan to end her life. <eob>
She assured me that a mother's love <eol> was the strongest bond on Earth, <eob> and that she loved her children <eol> more than anything in the world, <eob> but because of her illness, <eob> she was sure that they <eol> would be better off without her. <eob>
What she said and what <eol> I've learned from others <eob> is that we do not make <eol> the so-called decision or choice <eob> to die by suicide <eob> in the same way <eol> that we choose what car to drive <eob> or where to go on a Saturday night. <eob>
When someone is <eol> in an extremely suicidal state, <eob> they are in a stage four <eol> medical health emergency. <eob>
Their thinking is impaired and they've <eol> lost access to tools of self-governance. <eob>
Even though they can <eol> make a plan and act with logic, <eob> their sense of truth <eol> is distorted by a filter of pain <eob> through which they <eol> interpret their reality. <eob>
Some people can be very good <eol> at hiding this state, <eob> and they often have <eol> good reasons for doing that. <eob>
Many of us have <eol> suicidal thoughts at some point, <eob> but persistent, <eol> ongoing thoughts of suicide <eob> and devising a means to die <eob> are symptoms of pathology, <eob> and like many illnesses, <eob> the condition has to be <eol> recognized and treated <eob> before a life is lost. <eob>
But my son's death <eol> was not purely a suicide. <eob>
It involved mass murder. <eob>
I wanted to know <eob> how his suicidal thinking <eob> became homicidal. <eob>
But research is sparse <eol> and there are no simple answers. <eob>
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression. <eob>
He had a personality <eol> that was perfectionistic and self-reliant, <eob> and that made him less likely <eol> to seek help from others. <eob>
He had experienced <eol> triggering events at the school <eob> that left him feeling <eol> debased and humiliated and mad. <eob>
And he had a complicated friendship <eob> with a boy who shared his feelings <eol> of rage and alienation, <eob> and who was seriously disturbed, <eob> controlling and homicidal. <eob>
And on top of this period in his life <eob> of extreme vulnerability and fragility, <eob> Dylan found access to guns <eob> even though we'd never <eol> owned any in our home. <eob>
It was appallingly easy <eol> for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns, <eob> both legally and illegally, <eol> without my permission or knowledge. <eob>
And somehow, 17 years <eol> and many school shootings later, <eob> it's still appallingly easy. <eob>
What Dylan did that day broke my heart, <eob> and as trauma so often does, <eob> it took a toll on my body and on my mind. <eob>
Two years after the shootings, <eol> I got breast cancer, <eob> and two years after that, <eol> I began to have mental health problems. <eob>
On top of the constant, perpetual grief <eob> I was terrified that I would run <eol> into a family member <eob> of someone Dylan had killed, <eob> or be accosted by the press <eob> or by an angry citizen. <eob>
I was afraid to turn on the news, <eob> afraid to hear myself being called <eol> a terrible parent or a disgusting person. <eob>
I started having panic attacks. <eob>
The first bout started <eol> four years after the shootings, <eob> when I was getting ready <eol> for the depositions <eob> and would have to meet <eol> the victims' families face to face. <eob>
The second round started <eol> six years after the shootings, <eob> when I was preparing <eol> to speak publicly about murder-suicide <eob> for the first time at a conference. <eob>
Both episodes lasted several weeks. <eob>
The attacks happened everywhere: <eob> in the hardware store, in my office, <eob> or even while reading a book in bed. <eob>
My mind would suddenly lock <eol> into this spinning cycle of terror <eob> and no matter how I hard I tried <eob> to calm myself down <eol> or reason my way out of it, <eob> I couldn't do it. <eob>
It felt as if my brain <eol> was trying to kill me, <eob> and then, being afraid of being afraid <eob> consumed all of my thoughts. <eob>
That's when I learned firsthand <eob> what it feels like <eol> to have a malfunctioning mind, <eob> and that's when I truly <eol> became a brain health advocate. <eob>
With therapy and medication and self-care, <eob> life eventually returned <eob> to whatever could be thought of <eol> as normal under the circumstances. <eob>
When I looked back <eol> on all that had happened, <eob> I could see that my son's <eol> spiral into dysfunction <eob> probably occurred <eol> over a period of about two years, <eob> plenty of time to get him help, <eob> if only someone had known <eol> that he needed help <eob> and known what to do. <eob>
Every time someone asks me, <eob> "How could you not have known?", <eob> it feels like a punch in the gut. <eob>
It carries accusation <eol> and taps into my feelings of guilt <eob> that no matter how much therapy I've had <eob> I will never fully eradicate. <eob>
But here's something I've learned: <eob> if love were enough <eob> to stop someone who is suicidal <eob> from hurting themselves, <eob> suicides would hardly ever happen. <eob>
But love is not enough, <eob> and suicide is prevalent. <eob>
It's the second leading cause of death <eob> for people age 10 to 34, <eob> and 15 percent of American youth <eob> report having made a suicide plan <eob> in the last year. <eob>
I've learned that no matter <eol> how much we want to believe we can, <eob> we cannot know or control <eob> everything our loved ones think and feel, <eob> and the stubborn belief <eol> that we are somehow different, <eob> that someone we love <eol> would never think of hurting themselves <eob> or someone else, <eob> can cause us to miss <eob> what's hidden in plain sight. <eob>
And if worst case scenarios <eol> do come to pass, <eob> we'll have to learn <eol> to forgive ourselves for not knowing <eob> or for not asking the right questions <eob> or not finding the right treatment. <eob>
We should always assume <eob> that someone we love may be suffering, <eob> regardless of what they say <eob> or how they act. <eob>
We should listen with our whole being, <eob> without judgments, <eob> and without offering solutions. <eob>
I know that I will live with this tragedy, <eob> with these multiple tragedies, <eob> for the rest of my life. <eob>
I know that in the minds of many, <eob> what I lost can't compare <eol> to what the other families lost. <eob>
I know my struggle <eol> doesn't make theirs any easier. <eob>
I know there are even some who think <eol> I don't have the right to any pain, <eob> but only to a life of permanent penance. <eob>
In the end what I know comes down to this: <eob> the tragic fact is that even <eol> the most vigilant and responsible of us <eob> may not be able to help, <eob> but for love's sake, <eob> we must never stop trying <eob> to know the unknowable. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I'm here to talk to you <eol> about the walkable city. <eob>
What is the walkable city? <eob>
Well, for want of a better definition, <eob> it's a city in which the car <eol> is an optional instrument of freedom, <eob> rather than a prosthetic device. <eob>
And I'd like to talk about <eol> why we need the walkable city, <eob> and I'd like to talk about <eol> how to do the walkable city. <eob>
Most of the talks I give these days <eol> are about why we need it, <eob> but you guys are smart. <eob>
And also I gave that talk <eol> exactly a month ago, <eob> and you can see it at TED.com. <eob> So today I want to talk <eol> about how to do it. <eob>
In a lot of time thinking about this, <eob> I've come up with what I call <eol> the general theory of walkability. <eob>
A bit of a pretentious term, <eol> it's a little tongue-in-cheek, <eob> but it's something <eol> I've thought about for a long time, <eob> and I'd like to share <eol> what I think I've figured out. <eob>
In the American city, <eol> the typical American city -- <eob> the typical American city <eol> is not Washington, DC, <eob> or New York, or San Francisco; <eob> it's Grand Rapids or Cedar <eol> Rapids or Memphis -- <eob> in the typical American city <eol> in which most people own cars <eob> and the temptation <eol> is to drive them all the time, <eob> if you're going to get them to walk, <eol> then you have to offer a walk <eob> that's as good as a drive or better. <eob>
What does that mean? <eob> It means you need to offer <eol> four things simultaneously: <eob> there needs to be a proper reason to walk, <eob> the walk has to be safe and feel safe, <eob> the walk has to be comfortable <eob> and the walk has to be interesting. <eob>
You need to do all four <eol> of these things simultaneously, <eob> and that's the structure of my talk today, <eob> to take you through each of those. <eob>
The reason to walk <eol> is a story I learned from my mentors, <eob> Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, <eob> the founders of the New Urbanism movement. <eob>
And I should say half the slides <eol> and half of my talk today <eob> I learned from them. <eob>
It's the story of planning, <eob> the story of the formation <eol> of the planning profession. <eob>
When in the 19th century <eol> people were choking <eob> from the soot of the dark, satanic mills, <eob> the planners said, hey, let's move <eol> the housing away from the mills. <eob>
And lifespans increased <eol> immediately, dramatically, <eob> and we like to say <eob> the planners have been trying to repeat <eol> that experience ever since. <eob>
So there's the onset of what we call <eol> Euclidean zoning, <eob> the separation of the landscape <eol> into large areas of single use. <eob>
And typically when I arrive <eol> in a city to do a plan, <eob> a plan like this already awaits me <eol> on the property that I'm looking at. <eob>
And all a plan like this guarantees <eob> is that you will not have a walkable city, <eob> because nothing is located <eol> near anything else. <eob>
The alternative, of course, <eol> is our most walkable city, <eob> and I like to say, you know, <eol> this is a Rothko, <eob> and this is a Seurat. <eob>
It's just a different way -- <eol> he was the pointilist -- <eob> it's a different way of making places. <eob>
And even this map of Manhattan <eol> is a bit misleading <eob> because the red color <eol> is uses that are mixed vertically. <eob>
So this is the big story <eol> of the New Urbanists -- <eob> to acknowledge that there <eol> are only two ways <eob> that have been tested by the thousands <eob> to build communities, <eol> in the world and throughout history. <eob>
One is the traditional neighborhood. <eob>
You see here several neighborhoods <eol> of Newburyport, Massachusetts, <eob> which is defined as being compact <eol> and being diverse -- <eob> places to live, work, shop, <eol> recreate, get educated -- <eob> all within walking distance. <eob>
And it's defined as being walkable. <eob>
There are lots of small streets. <eob>
Each one is comfortable to walk on. <eob>
And we contrast that to the other way, <eob> an invention that happened <eol> after the Second World War, <eob> suburban sprawl, <eob> clearly not compact, clearly not diverse, <eol> and it's not walkable, <eob> because so few of the streets connect, <eob> that those streets that do connect <eol> become overburdened, <eob> and you wouldn't let your kid out on them. <eob>
And I want to thank Alex Maclean, <eol> the aerial photographer, <eob> for many of these beautiful pictures <eol> that I'm showing you today. <eob>
So it's fun to break sprawl down <eol> into its constituent parts. <eob>
It's so easy to understand, <eob> the places where you only live, <eol> the places where you only work, <eob> the places where you only shop, <eob> and our super-sized public institutions. <eob>
Schools get bigger and bigger, <eob> and therefore, further <eol> and further from each other. <eob>
And the ratio of the size <eol> of the parking lot <eob> to the size of the school <eob> tells you all you need to know, <eob> which is that no child <eol> has ever walked to this school, <eob> no child will ever walk to this school. <eob>
The seniors and juniors are driving <eol> the freshmen and the sophomores, <eob> and of course we have <eol> the crash statistics to prove it. <eob>
And then the super-sizing <eol> of our other civic institutions <eob> like playing fields — <eob> it's wonderful that Westin in the Ft. <eob>
Lauderdale area <eob> has eight soccer fields <eol> and eight baseball diamonds <eob> and 20 tennis courts, <eob> but look at the road <eol> that takes you to that location, <eob> and would you let your child bike on it? <eob>
And this is why we have <eol> the soccer mom now. <eob>
When I was young, I had one soccer field, <eob> one baseball diamond and one tennis court, <eob> but I could walk to it, <eol> because it was in my neighborhood. <eob>
Then the final part of sprawl <eol> that everyone forgot to count: <eob> if you're going to separate everything <eol> from everything else <eob> and reconnect it <eol> only with automotive infrastructure, <eob> then this is what your landscape <eol> begins to look like. <eob>
The main message here is: <eob> if you want to have a walkable city, <eol> you can't start with the sprawl model. <eob> you need the bones of an urban model. <eob>
This is the outcome <eol> of that form of design, <eob> as is this. <eob>
And this is something <eol> that a lot of Americans want. <eob>
But we have to understand <eol> it's a two-part American dream. <eob>
If you're dreaming for this, <eob> you're also going to be dreaming of this, <eol> often to absurd extremes, <eob> when we build our landscape <eol> to accommodate cars first. <eob>
And the experience of being in these places — <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
This is not Photoshopped. <eob> Walter Kulash took this slide. <eob>
It's in Panama City. <eob>
This is a real place. <eob>
And being a driver <eol> can be a bit of a nuisance, <eob> and being a pedestrian <eol> can be a bit of a nuisance <eob> in these places. <eob>
This is a slide that epidemiologists <eol> have been showing for some time now, <eob> (Laughter) <eob> The fact that we have a society <eol> where you drive to the parking lot <eob> to take the escalator to the treadmill <eob> shows that we're doing something wrong. <eob>
But we know how to do it better. <eob> Here are the two models contrasted. <eob>
I show this slide, <eob> which has been a formative document <eol> of the New Urbanism now <eob> for almost 30 years, <eob> to show that sprawl and the traditional <eol> neighborhood contain the same things. <eob>
It's just how big are they, <eob> how close are they to each other, <eob> how are they interspersed together <eob> and do you have a street network, <eol> rather than a cul-de-sac <eob> or a collector system of streets? <eob>
So when we look at a downtown area, <eob> at a place that has a hope <eol> of being walkable, <eob> and mostly that's our downtowns <eol> in America's cities <eob> and towns and villages, <eob> we look at them and say <eol> we want the proper balance of uses. <eob>
So what is missing or underrepresented? <eob>
And again, in the typical American cities <eol> in which most Americans live, <eob> it is housing that is lacking. <eob>
The jobs-to-housing balance is off. <eob>
And you find that when <eol> you bring housing back, <eob> these other things start to come back too, <eob> and housing is usually first <eol> among those things. <eob>
And, of course, the thing <eol> that shows up last and eventually <eob> is the schools, <eob> because the people have to move in, <eob> the young pioneers have to move in, <eol> get older, have kids <eob> and fight, and then the schools <eol> get pretty good eventually. <eob>
The other part of this part, <eob> the useful city part, <eob> is transit, <eob> and you can have a perfectly <eol> walkable neighborhood without it. <eob>
But perfectly walkable cities <eol> require transit, <eob> because if you don't have access <eol> to the whole city as a pedestrian, <eob> then you get a car, <eob> and if you get a car, <eob> the city begins to reshape itself <eol> around your needs, <eob> and the streets get wider <eol> and the parking lots get bigger <eob> and you no longer have a walkable city. <eob>
So transit is essential. <eob>
But every transit experience, <eol> every transit trip, <eob> begins or ends as a walk, <eob> and so we have to remember to build <eol> walkability around our transit stations. <eob>
Next category, the biggest one, <eol> is the safe walk. <eob>
It's what most walkability <eol> experts talk about. <eob>
It is essential, but alone not enough <eol> to get people to walk. <eob>
And there are so many moving parts <eol> that add up to a walkable city. <eob> The first is block size. <eob>
This is Portland, Oregon, <eob> famously 200-foot blocks, <eol> famously walkable. <eob>
This is Salt Lake City, <eob> famously 600-foot blocks, <eob> famously unwalkable. <eob>
If you look at the two, <eol> it's almost like two different planets, <eob> but these places were both built by humans <eob> and in fact, the story is that when <eol> you have a 200-foot block city, <eob> you can have a two-lane city, <eob> or a two-to-four lane city, <eob> and a 600-foot block city <eol> is a six-lane city, and that's a problem. <eob> These are the crash statistics. <eob> When you double the block size -- <eob> this was a study <eol> of 24 California cities -- <eob> when you double the block size, <eob> you almost quadruple <eol> the number of fatal accidents <eob> on non-highway streets. <eob>
So how many lanes do we have? <eob>
This is where I'm going to tell you <eol> what I tell every audience I meet, <eob> which is to remind you <eol> about induced demand. <eob>
Induced demand applies <eol> both to highways and to city streets. <eob>
And induced demand tells us <eol> that when we widen the streets <eob> to accept the congestion <eol> that we're anticipating, <eob> or the additional trips <eol> that we're anticipating <eob> in congested systems, <eol> it is principally that congestion <eob> that is constraining demand, <eob> and so that the widening comes, <eob> and there are all of these latent trips <eol> that are ready to happen. <eob>
People move further from work <eob> and make other choices <eol> about when they commute, <eob> and those lanes fill up <eol> very quickly with traffic, <eob> so we widen the street again, <eol> and they fill up again. <eob> And we've learned that <eol> in congested systems, <eob> we cannot satisfy the automobile. <eob>
This is from Newsweek Magazine -- <eol> hardly an esoteric publication: <eob> "Today's engineers acknowledge <eob> that building new roads <eol> usually makes traffic worse." <eob> My response to reading this was, <eol> may I please meet some of these engineers, <eob> because these are not the ones that I -- <eob> there are great exceptions <eol> that I'm working with now -- <eob> but these are not the engineers <eol> one typically meets working in a city, <eob> where they say, "Oh, that road <eol> is too crowded, we need to add a lane." <eob> So you add a lane, and the traffic comes, <eob> and they say, "See, I told you <eol> we needed that lane." <eob> This applies both to highways <eol> and to city streets if they're congested. <eob>
But the amazing thing <eol> about most American cities that I work in, <eob> the more typical cities, <eob> is that they have a lot of streets <eol> that are actually oversized <eob> for the congestion <eol> they're currently experiencing. <eob>
This was the case in Oklahoma City, <eob> when the mayor came running <eol> to me, very upset, <eob> because they were named <eol> in Prevention Magazine <eob> the worst city for pedestrians <eol> in the entire country. <eob>
Now that can't possibly be true, <eob> but it certainly is enough <eol> to make a mayor do something about it. <eob> We did a walkability study, <eob> and what we found, looking <eol> at the car counts on the street -- <eob> these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts <eob> and we know that two lanes <eol> can handle 10,000 cars per day. <eob>
Look at these numbers -- <eol> they're all near or under 10,000 cars, <eob> and these were the streets <eol> that were designated <eob> in the new downtown plan <eob> to be four lanes to six lanes wide. <eob>
So you had a fundamental disconnect <eol> between the number of lanes <eob> and the number of cars <eol> that wanted to use them. <eob>
So it was my job to redesign <eol> every street in the downtown <eob> from curb face to curb face, <eob> and we did it for 50 blocks of streets, <eob> and we're rebuilding it now. <eob>
So a typical oversized street to nowhere <eob> is being narrowed, and now <eol> under construction, <eob> and the project is half done. <eob>
The typical street like this, you know, <eob> when you do that, <eol> you find room for medians. <eob>
You find room for bike lanes. <eob>
We've doubled the amount <eol> of on-street parking. <eob>
We've added a full bike network <eol> where one didn't exist before. <eob>
But not everyone has the money <eol> that Oklahoma City has, <eob> because they have an extraction <eol> economy that's doing quite well. <eob>
The typical city is more <eol> like Cedar Rapids, <eob> where they have an all four-lane <eol> system, half one-way system. <eob>
And it's a little hard to see, <eob> but what we've done -- what we're doing; <eol> it's in process right now, <eob> it's in engineering right now -- <eob> is turning an all four-lane <eol> system, half one-way <eob> into an all two-lane system, all two-way, <eob> and in so doing, we're adding <eol> 70 percent more on-street parking, <eob> which the merchants love, <eob> and it protects the sidewalk. <eob>
That parking makes the sidewalk safe, <eob> and we're adding a much more <eol> robust bicycle network. <eob>
Then the lanes themselves. <eol> How wide are they? <eob>
That's really important. <eob>
The standards have changed <eol> such that, as Andrés Duany says, <eob> the typical road <eol> to a subdivision in America <eob> allows you to see <eol> the curvature of the Earth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is a subdivision <eol> outside of Washington from the 1960s. <eob>
Look very carefully <eol> at the width of the streets. <eob>
This is a subdivision from the 1980s. <eob> 1960s, 1980s. <eob> The standards have changed <eol> to such a degree <eob> that my old neighborhood of South Beach, <eob> when it was time to fix the street <eol> that wasn't draining properly, <eob> they had to widen it <eol> and take away half our sidewalk, <eob> because the standards were wider. <eob>
People go faster on wider streets. <eob> People know this. <eob> The engineers deny it, <eol> but the citizens know it, <eob> so that in Birmingham, Michigan, <eol> they fight for narrower streets. <eob>
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable, <eob> instituted its "Skinny Streets" program <eol> in its residential neighborhood. <eob>
We know that skinny streets are safer. <eob>
The developer Vince Graham, <eol> in his project I'On, <eob> which we worked on in South Carolina, <eob> he goes to conferences and he shows <eol> his amazing 22-foot roads. <eob> These are two-way roads, very narrow rights of way, <eob> and he shows this well-known philosopher, <eob> who said, "Broad is the road <eol> that leads to destruction... <eob> narrow is the road <eol> that leads to life." <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But where you build it, they come. <eob>
As a planner, I hate to say that, <eol> but the one thing I can say <eob> is that bicycle population <eol> is a function of bicycle infrastructure. <eob> I asked my friend Tom Brennan <eol> from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland <eob> to send me some pictures <eol> of the Portland bike commute. <eob>
He sent me this. I said, <eol> "Was that bike to work day?" <eob> He said, "No, that was Tuesday." <eob> When you do what Portland did and spend <eol> money on bicycle infrastructure -- <eob> New York City has doubled the number <eol> of bikers in it several times now <eob> by painting these bright green lanes. <eob> Even automotive cities <eol> like Long Beach, California: <eob> vast uptick in the number of bikers <eol> based on the infrastructure. <eob> And of course, what really does it, <eob> if you know 15th Street <eol> here in Washington, DC -- <eob> please meet Rahm Emanuel's <eol> new bike lanes in Chicago, <eob> the buffered lane, the parallel parking <eol> pulled off the curb, <eob> the bikes between the parked <eol> cars and the curb -- <eob> these mint cyclists. <eob>
If, however, as in Pasadena, <eol> every lane is a bike lane, <eob> then no lane is a bike lane. <eob>
And this is the only bicyclist <eol> that I met in Pasadena, so... (Laughter) <eob> The parallel parking I mentioned — <eob> it's an essential barrier of steel <eob> that protects the curb and pedestrians <eol> from moving vehicles. <eob> This is Ft. Lauderdale; one side of the street, <eol> you can park, <eob> the other side of the street, <eol> you can't. <eob> This is happy hour on the parking side. <eob>
This is sad hour on the other side. <eob>
And then the trees themselves <eol> slow cars down. <eob> They move slower when trees <eol> are next to the road, <eob> and, of course, sometimes <eol> they slow down very quickly. <eob>
All the little details -- <eol> the curb return radius. <eob>
Is it one foot or is it 40 feet? <eob>
How swoopy is that curb to determine <eol> how fast the car goes <eob> and how much room you have to cross. <eob>
And then I love this, because this <eol> is objective journalism. <eob> "Some say the entrance to CityCenter <eol> is not inviting to pedestrians." <eob> When every aspect <eol> of the landscape is swoopy, <eob> is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics, <eob> it says: "This is a vehicular place." <eob> So no one detail, no one speciality, <eol> can be allowed to set the stage. <eob>
And here, you know, this street: <eob> yes, it will drain within a minute <eol> of the hundred-year storm, <eob> but this poor woman <eol> has to mount the curb every day. <eob>
So then quickly, the comfortable walk <eol> has to do with the fact <eob> that all animals seek, simultaneously, <eol> prospect and refuge. <eob>
We want to be able to see our predators, <eob> but we also want to feel <eol> that our flanks are covered. <eob> And so we're drawn to places <eol> that have good edges, <eob> and if you don't supply the edges, <eol> people won't want to be there. <eob>
What's the proper ratio <eol> of height to width? <eob>
Is it one to one? Three to one? <eob> If you get beyond one to six, <eol> you're not very comfortable anymore. <eob>
You don't feel enclosed. <eob>
Now, six to one in Salzburg <eol> can be perfectly delightful. <eob>
The opposite of Salzburg is Houston. <eob>
The point being the parking lot <eol> is the principal problem here. <eob>
However, missing teeth, those empty lots <eol> can be issues as well, <eob> and if you have a missing corner <eol> because of an outdated zoning code, <eob> then you could have a missing nose <eol> in your neighborhood. <eob>
That's what we had in my neighborhood. <eob>
This was the zoning code that said <eol> I couldn't build on that site. <eob> As you may know, Washington, DC <eol> is now changing its zoning <eob> to allow sites like this <eol> to become sites like this. <eob>
We needed a lot of variances to do that. <eob>
Triangular houses <eol> can be interesting to build, <eob> but if you get one built, <eol> people generally like it. <eob>
So you've got to fill those missing noses. <eob>
And then, finally, the interesting walk: <eob> signs of humanity. <eob>
We are among the social primates. <eob>
Nothing interests us more <eol> than other people. <eob>
We want signs of people. <eob>
So the perfect one-to-one ratio, <eol> it's a great thing. <eob>
This is Grand Rapids, <eol> a very walkable city, <eob> but nobody walks on this street <eob> that connects the two <eol> best hotels together, <eob> because if on the left, <eol> you have an exposed parking deck, <eob> and on the right, <eol> you have a conference facility <eob> that was apparently designed <eol> in admiration for that parking deck, <eob> then you don't attract that many people. <eob>
Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term, <eol> Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina, <eob> taught us it only takes <eol> 25 feet of building <eob> to hide 250 feet of garage. <eob>
This one I call the Chia Pet Garage. <eob>
It's in South Beach. <eob> That active ground floor. <eob> I want to end with this project <eol> that I love to show. <eob>
It's by Meleca Architects. <eob>
It's in Columbus, Ohio. <eob>
To the left is the convention center <eol> neighborhood, full of pedestrians. <eob>
To the right is the Short North <eol> neighborhood -- ethnic, <eob> great restaurants, <eol> great shops, struggling. <eob>
It wasn't doing very well <eol> because this was the bridge, <eob> and no one was walking <eol> from the convention center <eob> into that neighborhood. <eob>
Well, when they rebuilt the highway, <eol> they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge. <eob>
Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge <eol> over the highway. <eob>
The city paid 1.9 million dollars, <eob> they gave the site to a developer, <eob> the developer built this <eob> and now the Short North <eol> has come back to life. <eob>
And everyone says, the newspapers, <eol> not the planning magazines, <eob> the newspapers say <eol> it's because of that bridge. <eob>
So that's it. That's the general <eol> theory of walkability. <eob>
Think about your own cities. <eob>
Think about how you can apply it. <eob>
You've got to do all four things at once. <eob>
So find those places where you <eol> have most of them <eob> and fix what you can, <eob> fix what still needs fixing <eol> in those places. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> I really appreciate your attention, <eob> and thank you for coming today. <eob>
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people <eol> experience armed conflict. <eob>
In response, people are forced <eol> to flee their country, <eob> leaving over 15 million refugees. <eob>
Children, without a doubt, <eob> are the most innocent <eol> and vulnerable victims ... <eob> but not just from <eol> the obvious physical dangers, <eob> but from the often unspoken effects <eol> that wars have on their families. <eob>
The experiences of war <eol> leave children at a real high risk <eob> for the development <eol> of emotional and behavioral problems. <eob>
Children, as we can only imagine, <eob> will feel worried, threatened and at risk. <eob>
But there is good news. <eob>
The quality of care <eol> that children receive in their families <eob> can have a more significant <eol> effect on their well-being <eob> than from the actual experiences of war <eol> that they have been exposed to. <eob>
So actually, children can be protected <eob> by warm, secure parenting <eol> during and after conflict. <eob>
In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student <eob> in the University of Manchester <eol> School of Psychological Sciences. <eob>
Like many of you here, <eob> I watched the crisis in Syria <eol> unfold in front of me on the TV. <eob>
My family is originally from Syria, <eob> and very early on, <eob> I lost several family members <eol> in really horrifying ways. <eob>
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family <eol> and watch the TV. <eob>
We've all seen those scenes: <eob> bombs destroying buildings, <eob> chaos, destruction <eob> and people screaming and running. <eob>
It was always the people screaming <eol> and running that really got me the most, <eob> especially those <eol> terrified-looking children. <eob>
I was a mother to two young, <eol> typically inquisitive children. <eob>
They were five and six then, <eob> at an age where they typically <eol> asked lots and lots of questions, <eob> and expected real, convincing answers. <eob>
So, I began to wonder <eol> what it might be like <eob> to parent my children <eol> in a war zone and a refugee camp. <eob> Would my children change? <eob> Would my daughter's bright, <eol> happy eyes lose their shine? <eob>
Would my son's really relaxed and carefree <eol> nature become fearful and withdrawn? <eob> How would I cope? <eob> Would I change? <eob>
As psychologists and parent trainers, <eob> we know that arming parents <eol> with skills in caring for their children <eob> can have a huge effect <eol> on their well-being, <eob> and we call this parent training. <eob>
The question I had was, <eob> could parent training programs <eol> be useful for families <eob> while they were still in war zones <eol> or refugee camps? <eob>
Could we reach them <eol> with advice or training <eob> that would help them <eol> through these struggles? <eob>
So I approached my PhD supervisor, <eob> Professor Rachel Calam, <eob> with the idea of using my academic skills <eol> to make some change in the real world. <eob>
I wasn't quite sure <eol> what exactly I wanted to do. <eob>
She listened carefully and patiently, <eob> and then to my joy she said, <eob> "If that's what you want to do, <eol> and it means so much to you, <eob> then let's do it. <eob>
Let's find ways to see if parent programs <eob> can be useful for families <eol> in these contexts." <eob> So for the past five years, <eol> myself and my colleagues -- <eob> Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright -- <eob> have been working <eol> on ways to support families <eob> that have experienced <eol> war and displacement. <eob>
Now, to know how to help families <eol> that have been through conflict <eob> support their children, <eob> the first step must obviously be <eol> to ask them what they're struggling with, <eob> right? <eob>
I mean, it seems obvious. <eob>
But it's often those <eol> that are the most vulnerable, <eob> that we're trying to support, <eob> that we actually don't ask. <eob>
How many times have we just assumed <eol> we know exactly the right thing <eob> that's going to help someone or something <eol> without actually asking them first? <eob>
So I travelled to refugee camps <eol> in Syria and in Turkey, <eob> and I sat with families, and I listened. <eob>
I listened to their parenting challenges, <eob> I listened to their parenting struggles <eob> and I listened to their call for help. <eob>
And sometimes that was just paused, <eob> as all I could do was hold hands with them <eob> and just join them <eol> in silent crying and prayer. <eob>
They told me about their struggles, <eob> they told me about the rough, <eol> harsh refugee camp conditions <eob> that made it hard to focus <eol> on anything but practical chores <eob> like collecting clean water. <eob>
They told me how they watched <eol> their children withdraw; <eob> the sadness, depression, anger, <eob> bed-wetting, thumb-sucking, <eol> fear of loud noises, <eob> fear of nightmares -- <eob> terrifying, terrifying nightmares. <eob>
These families had been through <eol> what we had been watching on the TV. <eob>
The mothers -- <eob> almost half of them <eol> were now widows of war, <eob> or didn't even know <eol> if their husbands were dead or alive -- <eob> described how they felt <eol> they were coping so badly. <eob>
They watched their children change <eol> and they had no idea how to help them. <eob>
They didn't know how to answer <eol> their children's questions. <eob>
What I found incredibly astonishing <eol> and so motivational <eob> was that these families were so motivated <eol> to <eob> support their children. <eob>
Despite all these challenges they faced, <eob> they were trying to help their children. <eob>
They were making attempts <eol> at seeking support from NGO workers, <eob> from refugee camp teachers, <eob> professional medics, <eob> other parents. <eob>
One mother I met had only been <eol> in a camp for four days, <eob> and had already made two attempts <eob> at seeking support <eol> for her eight-year-old daughter <eob> who was having terrifying nightmares. <eob>
But sadly, these attempts <eol> are almost always useless. <eob>
Refugee camp doctors, when available, <eob> are almost always too busy, <eob> or don't have the knowledge or the time <eol> for basic parenting supports. <eob>
Refugee camp teachers and <eob> other parents <eob> are just like them — <eob> part of a new refugee community <eol> who's struggling with new needs. <eob>
So then we began to think. <eob>
How could we help these families? <eob>
The families were struggling with things <eol> much bigger than they could cope with. <eob>
The Syrian crisis made it clear <eob> how incredibly impossible it would be <eol> to reach families on an individual level. <eob>
How else could we help them? <eob>
How would we reach families <eol> at a population level <eob> and low costs <eob> in these terrifying, terrifying times? <eob>
After hours of speaking to NGO workers, <eob> one suggested a fantastic innovative idea <eob> of distributing parenting <eol> information leaflets via bread wrappers -- <eob> bread wrappers that were being delivered <eol> to families in a conflict zone in Syria <eob> by humanitarian workers. <eob>
So that's what we did. <eob>
The bread wrappers haven't changed <eol> at all in their appearance, <eob> except for the addition <eol> of two pieces of paper. <eob>
One was a parenting information leaflet <eol> that had basic advice and information <eob> that normalized to the parent <eol> what they might be experiencing, <eob> and what their child <eol> might be experiencing. <eob>
And information on how they could <eol> support themselves and their children, <eob> such as information like spending <eol> time talking to your child, <eob> showing them more affection, <eob> being more patient with your child, <eob> talking to your children. <eob>
The other piece of paper <eol> was a feedback questionnaire, <eob> and of course, there was a pen. <eob>
So is this simply leaflet distribution, <eob> or is this actually a possible means <eol> of delivering psychological first aid <eob> that provides warm, <eol> secure, loving parenting? <eob>
We managed to distribute <eol> 3,000 of these in just one week. <eob>
What was incredible was <eol> we had a 60 percent response rate. <eob>
60 percent of the 3,000 <eol> families responded. <eob>
I don't know how many <eol> researchers we have here today, <eob> but that kind of response <eol> rate is fantastic. <eob>
To have that in Manchester <eol> would be a huge achievement, <eob> let alone in a conflict zone in Syria -- <eob> really highlighting how important <eol> these kinds of messages were to families. <eob>
I remember how excited and eager we were <eol> for the return of the questionnaires. <eob>
The families had left <eol> hundreds of messages -- <eob> most incredibly positive and encouraging. <eob>
But my favorite has got to be, <eob> "Thank you for not forgetting <eol> about us and our children." <eob> This really illustrates <eol> the potential means <eob> of the delivery of psychological <eol> first aid to families, <eob> and the return of feedback, too. <eob>
Just imagine replicating this <eol> using other means <eob> such as baby milk distribution, <eol> or female hygiene kits, <eob> or even food baskets. <eob>
But let's bring this closer to home, <eob> because the refugee crisis <eob> is one that is having an effect <eol> on every single one of us. <eob>
We're bombarded with images daily <eol> of statistics and of photos, <eob> and that's not surprising, <eob> because by last month, <eob> over one million refugees <eol> had reached Europe. <eob> One million. <eob> Refugees are joining our communities, <eob> they're becoming our neighbors, <eob> their children are attending <eol> our children's schools. <eob>
So we've adapted the leaflet <eol> to meet the needs of European refugees, <eob> and we have them online, open-access, <eob> in areas with a really high <eol> refugee influx. <eob>
For example, the Swedish healthcare <eol> uploaded it onto their website, <eob> and within the first 45 minutes, <eob> it was downloaded 343 times -- <eob> really highlighting how important it is <eob> for volunteers, practitioners <eol> and other parents <eob> to have open-access, <eol> psychological first-aid messages. <eob>
In 2013, I was sitting on the cold, <eol> hard floor of a refugee camp tent <eob> with mothers sitting around me <eol> as I was conducting a focus group. <eob>
Across from me stood an elderly lady <eob> with what seemed to be <eol> a 13-year-old girl lying beside her, <eob> with her head on the elderly lady's knees. <eob>
The girl stayed quiet <eol> throughout the focus group, <eob> not talking at all, <eob> with her knees <eol> curled up against her chest. <eob>
Towards the end of the focus group, <eob> and as I was thanking the mothers for their time, <eob> the elderly lady looked at me <eol> while pointing at the young girl, <eob> and said to me, "Can you help us with...?" <eob> Not quite sure what she expected me to do, <eob> I looked at the young girl and smiled, <eob> and in Arabic I said, <eob> "Salaam alaikum. <eob>
Shu-ismak? "" What's your name? <eob> "She looked at me really confused <eol> and unengaged, <eob> but then said," Halul. <eob> "Halul is the pet's name for the Arabic <eol> female name, Hala, <eob> and is only really used to refer <eol> to really young girls. <eob>
At that point I realized that actually <eol> Hala was probably much older than 13. <eob>
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old <eol> mother to three young children. <eob>
Hala had been a confident, <eol> bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother <eob> to her children, <eob> but the war had changed all of that. <eob>
She had lived through bombs <eol> being dropped in her town; <eob> she had lived through explosions. <eob>
When fighter jets <eol> were flying around their building, <eob> dropping bombs, <eob> her children would be screaming, <eol> terrified from the noise. <eob>
Hala would frantically grab pillows <eol> and cover her children's ears <eob> to block out the noise, <eob> all the while screaming herself. <eob>
When they reached the refugee camp <eob> and she knew they were finally <eol> in some kind of safety, <eob> she completely withdrew <eol> to acting like her old childhood self. <eob>
She completely rejected her family -- <eob> her children, her husband. <eob>
Hala simply could no longer cope. <eob>
This is a parenting struggle <eol> with a really tough ending, <eob> but sadly, it's not uncommon. <eob>
Those who experience <eol> armed conflict and displacement <eob> will face serious emotional struggles. <eob>
And that's something we can all relate to. <eob>
If you have been through <eol> a devastating time in your life, <eob> if you have lost someone <eol> or something you really care about, <eob> how would you continue to cope? <eob>
Could you still be able <eol> to care for yourself and for your family? <eob>
Given that the first years <eol> of a child's life are crucial <eob> for healthy physical <eol> and emotional development, <eob> and that 1.5 billion people <eol> are experiencing armed conflict -- <eob> many of whom are now <eol> joining our communities -- <eob> we cannot afford to turn a blind eye <eob> to the needs of those <eol> who are experiencing war and displacement. <eob>
We must prioritize <eol> these families' needs -- <eob> both those who are internally displaced, <eol> and those who are refugees worldwide. <eob>
These needs must be prioritized <eol> by NGO workers, policy makers, <eob> the WHO, the UNHCR <eol> and every single one of us <eob> in whatever capacity it is <eol> that we function in our society. <eob>
When we begin to recognize <eol> the individual faces of the conflict, <eob> when we begin to notice <eol> those intricate emotions on their faces, <eob> we begin to see them as humans, too. <eob>
We begin to see <eol> the needs of these families, <eob> and these are the real human needs. <eob>
When these family needs are prioritized, <eob> interventions for children <eol> in humanitarian settings <eob> will prioritize and recognize the primary <eol> role of the family in supporting children. <eob>
Family mental health <eol> will be shouting loud and clear <eob> in global, international agenda. <eob>
And children will be less likely <eol> to enter social service systems <eob> in resettlement countries <eob> because their families <eol> would have had support earlier on. <eob>
And we will be more open-minded, <eob> more welcoming, more caring <eob> and more trusting to those <eol> who are joining our communities. <eob>
We need to stop wars. <eob>
We need to build a world where children <eol> can dream of planes dropping gifts, <eob> and not bombs. <eob>
Until we stop armed conflicts <eol> raging throughout the world, <eob> families will continue to be displaced, <eob> leaving children vulnerable. <eob>
But by improving parenting <eol> and caregiver support, <eob> it may be possible to weaken the links <eol> between war and psychological difficulties <eob> in children and their families. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
People have been using media <eol> to talk about sex for a long time. <eob> Love letters, phone sex, racy Polaroids. <eob>
There's even a story of a girl who eloped <eol> with a man that she met over the telegraph <eob> in 1886. <eob>
Today we have sexting, <eol> and I am a sexting expert. <eob> Not an expert sexter. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I have been studying sexting since <eol> the media attention to it began in 2008. <eob>
I wrote a book on the moral <eol> panic about sexting. <eob>
And here's what I found: <eob> most people are worrying <eol> about the wrong thing. <eob>
They're trying to just prevent <eol> sexting from happening entirely. <eob>
But let me ask you this: <eob> As long as it's completely consensual, <eol> what's the problem with sexting? <eob>
People are into all sorts of things <eol> that you may not be into, <eob> like blue cheese or cilantro. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Sexting is certainly risky, <eol> like anything that's fun, <eob> but as long as you're not sending an image to someone <eol> who doesn't want to receive it, <eob> there's no harm. <eob>
What I do think is a serious problem <eob> is when people share <eol> private images of others <eob> without their permission. <eob>
And instead of worrying about sexting, <eob> what I think we need to do <eol> is think a lot more about digital privacy. <eob>
The key is consent. <eob> Right now most people <eol> are thinking about sexting <eob> without really thinking <eol> about consent at all. <eob>
Did you know that we currently <eol> criminalize teen sexting? <eob>
It can be a crime because <eol> it counts as child pornography, <eob> if there's an image of someone under 18, <eob> and it doesn't even matter <eob> if they took that image of themselves <eol> and shared it willingly. <eob>
So we end up with this <eol> bizarre legal situation <eob> where two 17-year-olds <eol> can legally have sex in most US states <eob> but they can't photograph it. <eob>
Some states have also tried <eol> passing sexting misdemeanor laws <eob> but these laws repeat the same problem <eob> because they still <eol> make consensual sexting illegal. <eob>
It doesn't make sense <eob> to try to ban all sexting <eol> to try to address privacy violations. <eob>
This is kind of like saying, <eob> let's solve the problem of date rape <eol> by just making dating completely illegal. <eob>
Most teens don't get arrested for sexting, <eol> but can you guess who does? <eob>
It's often teens who are disliked <eol> by their partner's parents. <eob>
And this can be because of class bias, <eol> racism or homophobia. <eob>
Most prosecutors are, <eol> of course, smart enough <eob> not to use child pornography charges <eol> against teenagers, but some do. <eob>
According to researchers <eol> at the University of New Hampshire <eob> seven percent of all child pornography <eol> possession arrests are teens, <eob> sexting consensually with other teens. <eob>
Child pornography is a serious crime, <eob> but it's just not <eol> the same thing as teen sexting. <eob>
Parents and educators <eol> are also responding to sexting <eob> without really thinking <eol> too much about consent. <eob>
Their message to teens is often: <eol> just don't do it. <eob>
And I totally get it -- <eol> there are serious legal risks <eob> and of course, that potential <eol> for privacy violations. <eob>
And when you were a teen, <eob> I'm sure you did exactly <eol> as you were told, right? <eob>
You're probably thinking, <eol> my kid would never sext. <eob>
And that's true, your little angel <eol> may not be sexting <eob> because only 33 percent <eob> of 16- and 17-year-olds are sexting. <eob>
But, sorry, by the time they're older, <eol> odds are they will be sexting. <eob>
Every study I've seen puts the rate <eol> above 50 percent for 18- to 24-year-olds. <eob>
And most of the time, nothing goes wrong. <eob>
People ask me all the time things like, <eol> isn't sexting just so dangerous, though? <eob>
It's like you wouldn't <eol> leave your wallet on a park bench <eob> and you expect it's going to get stolen <eol> if you do that, right? <eob>
Here's how I think about it: <eob> sexting is like leaving your wallet <eol> at your boyfriend's house. <eob>
If you come back the next day <eob> and all the money is just gone, <eob> you really need to dump that guy. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So instead of criminalizing sexting <eob> to try to prevent these privacy violations, <eob> instead we need to make consent central <eob> to how we think about the circulation <eol> of our private information. <eob>
Every new media technology <eol> raises privacy concerns. <eob>
In fact, in the US the very first <eol> major debates about privacy <eob> were in response to technologies <eol> that were relatively new at the time. <eob> In the late 1800s, <eol> people were worried about cameras, <eob> which were just suddenly <eol> more portable than ever before, <eob> and newspaper gossip columns. <eob>
Does this sound familiar? <eob> It's exactly what we're worrying about <eol> now with social media and drone cameras, <eob> and, of course, sexting. <eob>
And these fears about technology, <eob> they make sense <eob> because technologies <eol> can amplify and bring out <eob> our worst qualities and behaviors. <eob>
But there are solutions. <eob>
And we've been here before <eol> with a dangerous new technology. <eob>
In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T car. <eob> Traffic fatality rates were rising. <eob>
It was a serious problem -- <eol> it looks so safe, right? <eob>
Our first response <eol> was to try to change drivers' behavior, <eob> so we developed speed limits <eol> and enforced them through fines. <eob>
But over the following decades, <eob> we started to realize the technology <eol> of the car itself is not just neutral. <eob>
We could design the car to make it safer. <eob>
So in the 1920s, we got <eol> shatter-resistant windshields. <eob>
In the 1950s, seat belts. <eob>
And in the 1990s, airbags. <eob>
All three of these areas: <eob> laws, individuals and industry <eol> came together over time <eob> to help solve the problem <eol> that a new technology causes. <eob>
And we can do the same thing <eol> with digital privacy. <eob>
Of course, it comes back to consent. <eob>
Here's the idea. <eob> Before anyone can distribute <eol> your private information, <eob> they should have to get your permission. <eob>
This idea of affirmative consent <eol> comes from anti-rape activists <eob> who tell us that we need consent <eol> for every sexual act. <eob>
And we have really high standards <eol> for consent in a lot of other areas. <eob>
Think about having surgery. <eob> Your doctor has to make sure <eob> that you are meaningfully and knowingly <eol> consenting to that medical procedure. <eob>
This is not the type of consent <eol> like with an iTunes Terms of Service <eob> where you just scroll to the bottom <eol> and you're like, agree, agree, whatever. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> If we think more about consent, <eol> we can have better privacy laws. <eob>
Right now, we just don't have <eol> that many protections. <eob>
If your ex-husband or your ex-wife <eol> is a terrible person, <eob> they can take your nude photos <eol> and upload them to a porn site. <eob>
It can be really hard <eol> to get those images taken down. <eob>
And in a lot of states, <eob> you're actually better off <eol> if you took the images of yourself <eob> because then you can file a copyright claim. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Right now, if someone <eol> violates your privacy, <eob> whether that's an individual <eol> or a company or the NSA, <eob> you can try filing a lawsuit, <eob> though you may not be successful <eob> because many courts assume <eol> that digital privacy is just impossible. <eob>
So they're not willing <eol> to punish anyone for violating it. <eob>
I still hear people <eol> asking me all the time, <eob> isn't a digital image somehow blurring <eol> the line between public and private <eob> because it's digital, right? <eob> No! No! <eob> Everything digital <eol> is not just automatically public. <eob>
That doesn't make any sense. <eob>
As NYU legal scholar <eol> Helen Nissenbaum tells us, <eob> we have laws and policies and norms <eob> that protect all kinds <eol> of information that's private, <eob> and it doesn't make a difference <eol> if it's digital or not. <eob>
All of your health records are digitized <eob> but your doctor can't <eol> just share them with anyone. <eob>
All of your financial information <eol> is held in digital databases, <eob> but your credit card company can't <eol> just post your purchase history online. <eob>
Better laws could help address <eol> privacy violations after they happen, <eob> but one of the easiest things <eol> we can all do is make personal changes <eob> to help protect each other's privacy. <eob>
We're always told that privacy <eob> is our own, sole, <eol> individual responsibility. <eob>
We're told, constantly monitor <eol> and update your privacy settings. <eob>
We're told, never share anything <eol> you wouldn't want the entire world to see. <eob>
This doesn't make sense. <eob>
Digital media are social environments <eob> and we share things <eol> with people we trust all day, every day. <eob>
As Princeton researcher <eol> Janet Vertesi argues, <eob> our data and our privacy, <eol> they're not just personal, <eob> they're actually interpersonal. <eob>
And so one thing you can do <eol> that's really easy <eob> is just start asking for permission before <eol> you share anyone else's information. <eob>
If you want to post a photo of someone <eol> online, ask for permission. <eob>
If you want to forward an email thread, <eob> ask for permission. <eob>
And if you want to share <eol> someone's nude selfie, <eob> obviously, <eob> ask for permission. <eob>
These individual changes can really <eol> help us protect each other's privacy, <eob> but we need technology companies <eol> on board as well. <eob>
These companies have very little <eol> incentive to help protect our privacy <eob> because their business models <eol> depend on us sharing everything <eob> with as many people as possible. <eob>
Right now, if I send you an image, <eob> you can forward that <eol> to anyone that you want. <eob>
But what if I got to decide <eol> if that image was forwardable or not? <eob>
This would tell you, you don't <eol> have my permission to send this image out. <eob>
We do this kind of thing all the time <eol> to protect copyright. <eob>
If you buy an e-book, you can't just <eol> send it out to as many people as you want. <eob>
So why not try this with mobile phones? <eob>
What you can do is we can demand <eol> that tech companies add these protections <eob> to our devices and our platforms <eol> as the default. <eob>
After all, you can choose <eol> the color of your car, <eob> but the airbags are always standard. <eob>
If we don't think more <eol> about digital privacy and consent, <eob> there can be serious consequences. <eob>
There was a teenager from Ohio -- <eob> let's call her Jennifer, <eol> for the sake of her privacy. <eob>
She shared nude photos of herself <eol> with her high school boyfriend, <eob> thinking she could trust him. <eob>
Unfortunately, he betrayed her <eob> and sent her photos <eol> around the entire school. <eob>
Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated, <eob> but instead of being compassionate, <eol> her classmates harassed her. <eob>
They called her a slut and a whore <eob> and they made her life miserable. <eob>
Jennifer started missing school <eol> and her grades dropped. <eob>
Ultimately, Jennifer decided <eol> to end her own life. <eob>
Jennifer did nothing wrong. <eob> All she did was share a nude photo <eob> with someone she thought <eol> that she could trust. <eob>
And yet our laws tell her <eob> that she committed a horrible crime <eol> equivalent to child pornography. <eob>
Our gender norms tell her <eob> that by producing <eol> this nude image of herself, <eob> she somehow did the most <eol> horrible, shameful thing. <eob>
And when we assume that privacy <eol> is impossible in digital media, <eob> we completely write off and excuse <eol> her boyfriend's bad, bad behavior. <eob>
People are still saying all the time <eol> to victims of privacy violations, <eob> "What were you thinking? <eob>
You should have never sent that image." <eob> If you're trying to figure out <eol> what to say instead, try this. <eob>
Imagine you've run into your friend <eol> who broke their leg skiing. <eob>
They took a risk to do something fun, <eol> and it didn't end well. <eob>
But you're probably <eol> not going to be the jerk who says, <eob> "Well, I guess you shouldn't <eol> have gone skiing then." <eob> If we think more about consent, <eob> we can see that victims <eol> of privacy violations <eob> deserve our compassion, <eob> not criminalization, shaming, <eol> harassment or punishment. <eob>
We can support victims, <eol> and we can prevent some privacy violations <eob> by making these legal, <eol> individual and technological changes. <eob>
Because the problem is not sexting, <eol> the issue is digital privacy. <eob>
And one solution is consent. <eob>
So the next time a victim <eol> of a privacy violation comes up to you, <eob> instead of blaming them, <eol> let's do this instead: <eob> let's shift our ideas <eol> about digital privacy, <eob> and let's respond with compassion. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Most of you can probably relate <eol> to what I'm feeling right now. <eob>
My heart is racing in my chest. <eob>
My palms are a little bit clammy. <eob> I'm sweating. <eob> And my breath is a little bit shallow. <eob>
Now, these familiar sensations <eol> are obviously the result <eob> of standing up <eol> in front of a thousand of you <eob> and giving a talk <eol> that might be streamed online <eob> to perhaps a million more. <eob>
But the physical sensations <eol> I'm experiencing right now <eob> are actually the result of a much more <eol> basic mind-body mechanism. <eob>
My nervous system is sending <eol> a flood of hormones <eob> like cortisol and adrenaline <eol> into my bloodstream. <eob>
It's a very old and very necessary <eol> response that sends blood and oxygen <eob> to the organs and muscles <eol> that I might need <eob> to respond quickly to a potential threat. <eob>
But there's a problem with this response, <eob> and that is, it can get over-activated. <eob>
If I face these kinds of stressors <eol> on a daily basis, <eob> particularly over an extended <eol> period of time, <eob> my system can get overloaded. <eob>
So basically, if this response <eol> happens infrequently: super-necessary <eob> for my well-being and survival. <eob>
But if it happens too much, <eob> it can actually make me sick. <eob>
There's a growing body of research <eol> examining the relationship <eob> between chronic stress and illness. <eob>
Things like heart disease and even cancer <eob> are being shown to have <eol> a relationship to stress. <eob>
And that's because, over time, <eol> too much activation from stress <eob> can interfere with my body's processes <eol> that keep me healthy. <eob>
Now, let's imagine for a moment <eol> that I was pregnant. <eob>
What might this kind of stress, <eob> particularly over the length <eol> of my pregnancy, <eob> what kind of impact might that have <eob> on the health of my developing fetus? <eob>
You probably won't be surprised <eol> when I tell you <eob> that this kind of stress <eol> during pregnancy is not good. <eob>
It can even cause the body <eol> to initiate labor too early, <eob> because in a basic sense, <eol> the stress communicates <eob> that the womb is no longer <eol> a safe place for the child. <eob>
Stress during pregnancy is linked <eol> with things like high blood pressure <eob> and low infant birth weight, <eob> and it can begin a cascade <eol> of health challenges <eob> that make birth much more dangerous <eob> for both parent and child. <eob>
Now of course stress, <eol> particularly in our modern lifestyle, <eob> is a somewhat universal experience, right? <eob>
Maybe you've never stood up <eol> to give a TED Talk, <eob> but you've faced a big <eol> presentation at work, <eob> a sudden job loss, <eob> a big test, <eob> a heated conflict <eol> with a family member or friend. <eob>
But it turns out that the kind <eol> of stress we experience <eob> and whether we're able to stay <eol> in a relaxed state long enough <eob> to keep our bodies working properly <eob> depends a lot on who we are. <eob>
There's also a growing body of research <eob> showing that people who experience <eol> more discrimination <eob> are more likely to have poor health. <eob>
Even the threat of discrimination, <eob> like worrying you might be stopped <eol> by police while driving your car, <eob> can have a negative impact on your health. <eob>
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams, <eob> the person who pioneered <eol> the tools that have proven these linkages, <eob> says that the more marginalized <eol> groups in our society <eob> experience more discrimination <eol> and more impacts on their health. <eob>
I've been interested in these issues <eol> for over a decade. <eob>
I became interested in maternal health <eob> when a failed premed trajectory <eol> instead sent me down a path <eob> looking for other ways <eol> to help pregnant people. <eob>
I became a doula, <eob> a lay person trained to provide support <eob> to people during pregnancy and childbirth. <eob>
And because I'm Latina <eol> and a Spanish speaker, <eob> in my first volunteer doula gig <eol> at a public hospital in North Carolina, <eob> I saw clearly how race and class <eol> impacted the experiences <eob> of the women that I supported. <eob>
If we take a look at the statistics <eol> about the rates of illness <eob> during pregnancy and childbirth, <eob> we see clearly the pattern <eol> outlined by Dr. Williams. <eob> African-American women in particular <eob> have an entirely different <eol> experience than white women <eob> when it comes to whether <eol> their babies are born healthy. <eob>
In certain parts of the country, <eol> particularly the Deep South, <eob> the rates of mother <eol> and infant death for black women <eob> actually approximate <eol> those rates in Sub-Saharan African. <eob>
In those same communities, <eob> the rates for white women are near zero. <eob>
Even nationally, black women <eol> are four times more likely <eob> to die <eob> during pregnancy <eol> and childbirth <eob> than white women. <eob>
Four times more likely to die. <eob>
They're also twice as likely <eol> for their infants to die <eob> before the first year of life <eob> than white infants, <eob> and two to three times more likely <eob> to give birth too early or too skinny -- <eob> a sign of insufficient development. <eob>
than white women. <eob> Native women are also more likely <eol> to have higher rates of these problems <eob> as are some groups of Latinas. <eob>
For the last decade as a doula <eol> turned journalist and blogger, <eob> I've been trying to raise the alarm <eob> about just how different <eol> the experiences of women of color, <eob> but particularly black women, <eob> are when it comes to pregnancy <eol> and birth in the US. <eob>
But when I tell people <eol> about these appalling statistics, <eob> I'm usually met with an assumption <eol> that it's about either poverty <eob> or lack of access to care. <eob>
But it turns out, neither of these things <eol> tell the whole story. <eob>
Even middle-class black women <eol> still have much worse outcomes <eob> than their middle-class <eol> white counterparts. <eob>
The gap actually widens among this group. <eob>
And while access to care <eol> is definitely still a problem, <eob> even women of color who receive <eol> the recommended prenatal care <eob> still suffer from these high rates. <eob>
And so we come back to the path <eob> from discrimination to stress <eol> to poor health, <eob> and it begins to paint a picture <eol> that many people of color know to be true: <eob> racism is actually making us sick. <eob>
Still sound like a stretch? <eob>
Consider this: immigrants, <eol> particularly black and Latina immigrants, <eob> actually have better health when <eol> they first arrive in the United States. <eob>
But the longer they stay in this country, <eol> the worse their health becomes. <eob>
People like me, born in the United States <eol> to Cuban immigrant parents, <eob> are actually more likely to have <eol> worse health than my grandparents did. <eob>
It's what researchers call <eol> "the immigrant paradox," <eob> and it further illustrates <eob> that there's something <eol> in the US environment <eob> that is making us sick. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> this problem, that racism <eol> is making people of color, <eob> but especially black <eol> women and babies, sick, is vast. <eob>
I could spend all of my time <eol> with you talking about it, <eob> but I won't, because I want to make sure <eol> to tell you about one solution. <eob>
And the good news is, it's a solution <eol> that isn't particularly expensive, <eob> and doesn't require <eol> any fancy drug treatments <eob> or new technologies. <eob>
The solution is called, "The JJ Way." <eob>
Meet Jennie Joseph. <eob> She's a midwife <eol> in the Orlando, Florida area <eob> who has been serving <eol> pregnant women for over a decade. <eob>
In what she calls her easy-access clinics, <eob> Jennie and her team provide prenatal care <eol> to over 600 women per year. <eob>
Her clients, most of whom are black, <eol> Haitian and Latina, <eob> deliver at the local hospital. <eob> But by providing accessible <eol> and respectful prenatal care, <eob> Jennie has achieved something remarkable: <eob> almost all of her clients give birth <eol> to healthy, full-term babies. <eob>
Her method is deceptively simple. <eob>
Jennie says that all of her appointments <eol> start at the front desk. <eob>
Every member of her team, <eol> and every moment a women is at her clinic, <eob> is as supportive as possible. <eob>
No one is turned away <eol> due to lack of funds. <eob>
The JJ Way is to make the finances work <eol> no matter what the hurdles. <eob>
No one is chastised for showing up <eol> late to their appointments. <eob>
No one is talked down to or belittled. <eob>
Jennie's waiting room feels more like <eol> your aunt's living room than a clinic. <eob>
She calls this space <eol> "a classroom in disguise." <eob> With the plush chairs <eol> arranged in a circle, <eob> women wait for their appointments <eol> in one-on-one chats <eob> with a staff educator, <eob> or in group prenatal classes. <eob>
When you finally are called back <eol> to your appointment, <eob> you are greeted by Alexis or Trina, <eob> two of Jennie's medical assistants. <eob>
Both are young, African-American <eol> and moms themselves. <eob>
Their approach is casual and friendly. <eob>
During one visit I observed, <eob> Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom <eob> while she took her blood pressure. <eob>
This Latina mom was having trouble <eol> keeping food down due to nausea. <eob>
As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff, <eob> she said, "We'll see about changing <eol> your prescription, OK? <eob>
We can't have you not eating." <eob> That "we" is actually a really crucial <eol> aspect of Jennie's model. <eob>
She sees her staff as part of a team that, <eol> alongside the woman and her family, <eob> has one goal: <eob> get mom to term with a healthy baby. <eob>
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis <eol> are actually the center of her care model, <eob> and that her role as a provider <eol> is just to support their work. <eob>
Trina spends a lot of her day <eol> on her cell phone, <eob> texting with clients <eol> about all sorts of things. <eob>
One woman texted to ask if a medication <eol> she was prescribed at the hospital <eob> was OK to take while pregnant. <eob>
The answer was no. <eob>
Another woman texted with pictures <eol> of an infant born under Jennie's care. <eob>
Lastly, when you finally are called back <eol> to see the provider, <eob> you've already taken your own weight <eol> in the waiting room, <eob> and done your own pee test <eol> in the bathroom. <eob>
This is a big departure <eol> from the traditional medical model, <eob> because it places <eol> responsibility and information <eob> back in the woman's hands. <eob>
So rather than a medical setting <eol> where you might be chastised <eob> for not keeping up <eol> with provider recommendations -- <eob> the kind of settings often available <eol> to low-income women -- <eob> Jennie's model is to be <eol> as supportive as possible. <eob>
And that support provides a crucial buffer <eob> to the stress of racism and discrimination <eol> facing these women every day. <eob>
But here's the best thing <eol> about Jennie's model: <eob> it's been incredibly successful. <eob>
Remember those statistics I told you, <eob> that black women are more likely <eol> to give birth too early, <eob> to give birth to low birth weight babies, <eob> to even die due to complications <eol> of pregnancy and childbirth? <eob>
Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely <eol> eliminated those problems, <eob> starting with what Jennie calls <eol> "skinny babies." <eob> She's been able to get almost all <eol> her clients to term <eob> with healthy, chunky babies like this one. <eob>
Audience: Aw! <eob>
Miriam Zoila Pérez: <eol> This is a baby girl <eob> born to a client of Jennie's <eol> this past June. <eob>
A similar demographic <eol> of women in Jennie's area <eob> who gave birth at the same <eol> hospital her clients did <eob> were three times more likely to give birth <eob> to a baby below a healthy weight. <eob>
Jennie is making headway <eol> into what has been seen for decades <eob> as an almost intractable problem. <eob>
Some of you might be thinking, <eob> all this one-on-one attention <eol> that The JJ Way requires <eob> must be too expensive to scale. <eob> Well, you'd be wrong. <eob>
The visit with the provider <eol> is not the center of Jennie's model, <eob> and for good reason. <eob> Those visits are expensive, <eol> and in order to maintain her model, <eob> she's got to see a lot <eol> of clients to cover costs. <eob>
But Jennie doesn't have to spend <eol> a ton of time with each woman, <eob> if all of the members of her team <eol> can provide the support, information <eob> and care that her clients need. <eob>
The beauty of Jennie's model <eol> is that she actually believes <eob> it can be implemented <eol> in pretty much any health care setting. <eob>
It's a revolution in care <eol> just waiting to happen. <eob>
These problems I've been sharing <eol> with you are big. <eob>
They come from long histories <eol> of racism, classism, <eob> a society based on race <eol> and class stratification. <eob>
They involve elaborate <eol> physiological mechanisms <eob> meant to protect us, <eob> that, when overstimulated, <eol> actually make us sick. <eob>
But if there's one thing I've learned <eol> from my work as a doula, <eob> it's that a little bit of unconditional <eol> support can go a really long way. <eob>
History has shown that people <eol> are incredibly resilient, <eob> and while we can't eradicate racism <eob> or the stress that results <eol> from it overnight, <eob> we might just be able to create <eol> environments that provide a buffer <eob> to what people of color <eol> experience on a daily basis. <eob>
And during pregnancy, <eol> that buffer can be an incredible tool <eob> towards shifting the impact of racism <eob> for generations to come. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Five years ago, I had my dream job. <eob>
I was a foreign correspondent <eol> in the Middle East <eob> reporting for ABC News. <eob>
But there was a crack in the wall, <eob> a problem with our industry, <eob> that I felt we needed to fix. <eob>
You see, I got to the Middle East <eol> right around the end of 2007, <eob> which was just around the midpoint <eob> of the Iraq War. <eob>
But by the time I got there, <eol> it was already nearly impossible <eob> to find stories about Iraq on air. <eob>
Coverage had dropped across the board, <eob> across networks. <eob>
And of the stories that did make it, <eob> more than 80 percent <eol> of them were about us. <eob>
We were missing the stories about Iraq, <eob> the people who live there, <eob> and what was happening to them <eol> under the weight of the war. <eob>
Afghanistan had already <eol> fallen off the agenda. <eob>
There were less than one percent <eol> of all news stories in 2008 <eob> that went to the war in Afghanistan. <eob>
It was the longest war in US history, <eob> but information was so scarce <eob> that schoolteachers we spoke to <eob> told us they had trouble <eol> explaining to their students <eob> what we were doing there, <eob> when those students had parents <eob> who were fighting <eol> and sometimes dying overseas. <eob>
We had drawn a blank, <eob> and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan. <eob>
From conflict zones to climate change <eob> to all sorts of issues <eol> around crises in public health, <eob> we were missing what I call <eol> the species-level issues, <eob> because as a species, <eol> they could actually sink us. <eob>
And by failing to understand <eol> the complex issues of our time, <eob> we were facing certain <eol> practical implications. <eob>
How were we going to solve problems <eob> that we didn't fundamentally understand, <eob> that we couldn't track in real time, <eob> and where the people working on the issues <eob> were invisible to us <eob> and sometimes invisible to each other? <eob>
When you look back on Iraq, <eob> those years when we <eol> were missing the story, <eob> were the years when the society <eol> was falling apart, <eob> when we were setting the conditions <eol> for what would become the rise of ISIS, <eob> the ISIS takeover of Mosul <eob> and terrorist violence that would spread <eob> beyond Iraq's borders <eol> to the rest of the world. <eob>
Just around that time <eol> where I was making that observation, <eob> I looked across the border of Iraq <eob> and noticed there was another <eol> story we were missing: <eob> the war in Syria. <eob>
If you were a Middle-East specialist, <eol> you knew that Syria was that important <eob> from the start. <eob>
But it ended up being, really, <eob> one of the forgotten stories <eol> of the Arab Spring. <eob>
I saw the implications up front. <eob>
Syria is intimately tied <eol> to regional security, <eob> to global stability. <eob>
I felt like we couldn't let that become <eob> another one of the stories we left behind. <eob>
So I left my big TV job to start <eol> a website, called "Syria Deeply." <eob> It was designed to be a news <eol> and information source <eob> that made it easier to understand <eol> a complex issue, <eob> and for the past four years, <eol> it's been a resource <eob> for policymakers and professionals <eol> working on the conflict in Syria. <eob>
We built a business model <eob> based on consistent, <eol> high-quality information, <eob> and convening the top minds on the issue. <eob>
And we found it was a model that scaled. <eob>
We got passionate requests <eol> to do other things "Deeply." <eob> So we started to work our way <eol> down the list. <eob>
I'm just one of many entrepreneurs, <eob> and we are just one of many start-ups <eob> trying to fix what's wrong with news. <eob>
All of us in the trenches know <eob> that something is wrong <eol> with the news industry. <eob> It's broken. <eob> Trust in the media <eol> has hit an all-time low. <eob>
And the statistic you're seeing up there <eol> is from September -- <eob> it's arguably gotten worse. <eob>
But we can fix this. <eob>
We can fix the news. <eob>
I know that that's true. <eob>
You can call me an idealist; <eol> I call myself an industrious optimist. <eob>
And I know there are <eol> a lot of us out there. <eob>
We have ideas for how <eol> to make things better, <eob> and I want to share three of them <eol> that we've picked up in our own work. <eob>
Idea number one: <eob> we need news that's built <eol> on deep-domain knowledge. <eob>
Given the waves and waves of layoffs <eol> at newsrooms across the country, <eob> we've lost the art of specialization. <eob>
Beat reporting is an endangered thing. <eob>
When it comes to foreign news, <eob> the way we can fix that <eol> is by working with more local journalists, <eob> treating them like our partners <eol> and collaborators, <eob> not just fixers who fetch us <eol> phone numbers and sound bites. <eob>
Our local reporters in Syria <eol> and across Africa and across Asia <eob> bring us stories that we certainly <eol> would not have found on our own. <eob>
Like this one from the suburbs <eol> of Damascus, about a wheelchair race <eob> that gave hope <eol> to those wounded in the war. <eob>
Or this one from Sierra Leone, <eob> about a local chief <eol> who curbed the spread of Ebola <eob> by self-organizing <eol> a quarantine in his district. <eob>
Or this one from the border of Pakistan, <eob> about Afghan refugees being forced <eol> to return home before they are ready, <eob> under the threat of police intimidation. <eob>
Our local journalists are our mentors. <eob>
They teach us something new every day, <eob> and they bring us stories <eol> that are important for all of us to know. <eob>
Idea number two: <eob> we need a kind of Hippocratic oath <eol> for the news industry, <eob> a pledge to first do no harm. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Journalists need to be tough. <eob>
We need to speak truth to power, <eob> but we also need to be responsible. <eob>
We need to live up to our own ideals, <eob> and we need to recognize <eob> when what we're doing <eol> could potentially harm society, <eob> where we lose track of journalism <eol> as a public service. <eob>
I watched us cover the Ebola crisis. <eob>
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best. <eob>
But what we saw was a public <eob> that was flooded with hysterical <eol> and sensational coverage, <eob> sometimes inaccurate, <eol> sometimes completely wrong. <eob>
Public health experts tell me <eol> that that actually cost us in human lives, <eob> because by sparking more panic <eol> and by sometimes getting the facts wrong, <eob> we made it harder for people to resolve <eob> what was actually happening on the ground. <eob>
All that noise made it harder <eol> to make the right decisions. <eob>
We can do better as an industry, <eob> but it requires us recognizing <eol> how we got it wrong last time, <eob> and deciding not to go that way next time. <eob>
It's a choice. <eob>
We have to resist the temptation <eol> to use fear for ratings. <eob>
And that decision has to be made <eol> in the individual newsroom <eob> and with the individual news executive. <eob>
Because the next deadly virus <eol> that comes around <eob> could be much worse <eol> and the consequences much higher, <eob> if we do what we did last time; <eob> if our reporting isn't responsible <eol> and it isn't right. <eob>
The third idea? <eob> We need to embrace complexity <eob> if we want to make sense <eol> of a complex world. <eob> Embrace complexity -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
not treat the world simplistically, <eol> because simple isn't accurate. <eob>
We live in a complex world. <eob>
News is adult education. <eob>
It's our job as journalists <eol> to get elbow deep in complexity <eob> and to find new ways to make it easier <eol> for everyone else to understand. <eob>
If we don't do that, <eob> if we pretend there are <eol> just simple answers, <eob> we're leading everyone off a steep cliff. <eob>
Understanding complexity <eol> is the only way to know the real threats <eob> that are around the corner. <eob>
It's our responsibility <eol> to translate those threats <eob> and to help you understand what's real, <eob> so you can be prepared and know <eol> what it takes to be ready <eob> for what comes next. <eob>
I am an industrious optimist. <eob>
I do believe we can fix what's broken. <eob>
We all want to. <eob>
There are great journalists <eol> out there doing great work -- <eob> we just need new formats. <eob>
I honestly believe <eol> this is a time of reawakening, <eob> reimagining what we can do. <eob>
I believe we can fix what's broken. <eob>
I know we can fix the news. <eob>
I know it's worth trying, <eob> and I truly believe that in the end, <eob> we're going to get this right. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So have you ever wondered <eol> what it would be like <eob> to live in a place with no rules? <eob>
That sounds pretty cool. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You wake up one morning, however, <eob> and you discover that the reason <eol> there are no rules <eob> is because there's no government, <eol> and there are no laws. <eob>
In fact, all social institutions <eol> have disappeared. <eob>
So there's no schools, <eob> there's no hospitals, <eob> there's no police, <eob> there's no banks, <eob> there's no athletic clubs, <eob> there's no utilities. <eob>
Well, I know a little bit <eol> about what this is like, <eob> because when I was <eol> a medical student in 1999, <eob> I worked in a refugee camp <eol> in the Balkans during the Kosovo War. <eob>
When the war was over, <eob> I got permission -- unbelievably -- <eol> from my medical school <eob> to take some time off <eob> and follow some of the families <eol> that I had befriended in the camp <eob> back to their village in Kosovo, <eob> and understand how they navigated life <eol> in this postwar setting. <eob>
Postwar Kosovo <eol> was a very interesting place <eob> because NATO troops were there, <eob> mostly to make sure the war <eol> didn't break out again. <eob>
But other than that, <eol> it was actually a lawless place, <eob> and almost every social institution, <eol> both public and private, <eob> had been destroyed. <eob>
So I can tell you <eob> that when you go into one <eol> of these situations and settings, <eob> it is absolutely thrilling ... <eob> for about 30 minutes, <eob> because that's about how long it takes <eol> before you run into a situation <eob> where you realize how incredibly <eol> vulnerable you are. <eob>
For me, that moment came when <eol> I had to cross the first checkpoint, <eob> and I realized as I drove up <eob> that I would be negotiating passage through this checkpoint <eob> with a heavily armed individual <eob> who, if he decided to shoot me <eol> right then and there, <eob> actually wouldn't be doing anything illegal. <eob>
But the sense of vulnerability <eol> that I had was absolutely nothing <eob> in comparison to the vulnerability <eol> of the families that I got to know <eob> over that year. <eob>
You see, life in a society where <eol> there are no social institutions <eob> is riddled with danger and uncertainty, <eob> and simple questions like, <eol> "What are we going to eat tonight?" <eob> are very complicated to answer. <eob>
Questions about security, <eol> when you don't have any security systems, <eob> are terrifying. <eob>
Is that altercation I had <eol> with the neighbor down the block <eob> going to turn into a violent episode <eol> that will end my life <eob> or my family's life? <eob>
Health concerns when there <eol> is no health system <eob> are also terrifying. <eob>
I listened as many families had to sort <eol> through questions like, <eob> "My infant has a fever. <eol> What am I going to do?" <eob> "My sister, who is pregnant, is bleeding. <eol> What should I do? <eob>
Who should I turn to?" <eob> "Where are the doctors, <eol> where are the nurses? <eob>
If I could find one, are they trustworthy? <eob>
How will I pay them? <eol> In what currency will I pay them?" <eob> "If I need medications, <eol> where will I find them? <eob>
If I take those medications, <eol> are they actually counterfeits?" <eob> And on and on. <eob>
So for life in these settings, <eob> the dominant theme, the dominant feature of life, <eob> is the incredible vulnerability <eol> that people have to manage <eob> day in and day out, <eob> because of the lack <eol> of social systems. <eob>
And it actually turns out <eob> that this feature of life <eol> is incredibly difficult to explain <eob> and be understood by people who are <eol> living outside of it. <eob>
I discovered this when I left Kosovo. <eob>
I came back to Boston, <eol> I became a physician, <eob> I became a global public health policy <eol> researcher. <eob>
I joined the Harvard <eol> Medical School <eob> and Brigham and Women's Hospital <eol> Division of Global Health. <eob>
And I, as a researcher, <eob> really wanted to get started <eol> on this problem right away. <eob>
I was like, "How do we reduce <eol> the crushing vulnerability <eob> of people living in these types <eol> of fragile settings? <eob>
Is there any way <eol> we can start to think about <eob> how to protect and quickly recover <eob> the institutions that are critical to survival, <eob> like the health system?" <eob> And I have to say, <eol> I had amazing colleagues. <eob>
But one interesting thing about it was, <eob> this was sort of an unusual question for them. <eob> They were kind of like, "Oh, if you work in war, <eob> doesn't that mean you work <eol> on refugee camps, <eob> and you work <eob> on documenting <eol> mass atrocities?" -- <eob> which is, by the way, very, very, very important. <eob>
So it took me a while to explain <eol> why I was so passionate about this issue, <eob> until about six years ago. <eob>
That's when this landmark study <eob> that looked at and described <eol> the public health consequences of war <eob> was published. <eob>
They came to an incredible, <eol> provocative conclusion. <eob>
These researchers concluded <eob> that the vast majority <eol> of death and disability from war <eob> happens after the cessation <eol> of conflict. <eob>
So the most dangerous time to be <eol> a person living in a conflict-affected state <eob> is after the cessation of hostilities; <eob> it's after the peace deal <eol> has been signed. <eob> It's when that political solution <eol> has been achieved. <eob>
That seems so puzzling, <eol> but of course it's not, <eob> because war kills people <eol> by robbing them of their clinics, <eob> of their hospitals, <eob> of their supply chains. <eob>
Their doctors are targeted, <eol> are killed; they're on the run. <eob>
And more invisible and yet more deadly <eol> is the destruction <eob> of the health governance institutions <eol> and their finances. <eob>
So this is really not <eol> surprising at all to me. <eob>
But what is surprising and somewhat dismaying, <eob> is how little impact this insight has had, <eob> in terms of how we think <eol> about human suffering and war. <eob>
Let me give you a couple examples. <eob>
Last year, you may remember, <eob> Ebola hit the West African <eol> country of Liberia. <eob>
There was a lot of reporting about this group, <eol> Doctors Without Borders, <eob> sounding the alarm <eol> and calling for aid and assistance. <eob>
But not a lot of that reporting <eol> answered the question: <eob> Why is Doctors Without Borders <eol> even in Liberia? <eob>
Doctors Without Borders <eol> is an amazing organization, <eob> dedicated and designed to provide <eol> emergency care in war zones. <eob>
Liberia's civil war <eol> had ended in 2003 -- <eob> that was 11 years before Ebola even struck. <eob>
When Ebola struck Liberia, <eob> there were less than 50 doctors <eol> in the entire country <eob> of 4.5 million people. <eob>
Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia <eob> because Liberia still <eol> doesn't really have a functioning health system, <eob> 11 years later. <eob>
When the earthquake hit Haiti <eol> in 2010, <eob> the outpouring of international <eol> aid was phenomenal. <eob>
But did you know that only two percent <eol> of that funding <eob> went to rebuild Haitian public institutions, <eob> including its health sector? <eob>
From that perspective, <eob> Haitians continue to die <eol> from the earthquake even today. <eob>
I recently met this gentleman. <eob>
This is Dr. Nezar Ismet. <eob>
He's the Minister of Health <eol> in the northern autonomous region of Iraq, <eob> in Kurdistan. <eob>
Here he is announcing that <eol> in the last nine months, <eob> his country, his region, has increased <eol> from four million people <eob> to five million people. <eob>
That's a 25 percent increase. <eob>
Thousands of these new arrivals <eol> have experienced incredible trauma. <eob>
His doctors are working <eol> 16-hour days without pay. <eob>
His budget has not increased by 25 percent; <eob> it has decreased by 20 percent, <eob> as funding has flowed to security <eol> concerns and to short-term relief efforts. <eob>
When his health sector <eol> fails -- <eob> and if history <eol> is any guide, it will -- <eob> how do you think <eol> that's going to influence <eob> the decision making of the five million people in his region <eob> as they think about whether they should flee <eob> that type of vulnerable living situation? <eob>
So as you can see, <eol> this is a frustrating topic for me, <eob> and I really try to understand: <eob> Why the reluctance to protect and support <eob> indigenous health systems and security systems? <eob>
I usually tier two concerns, <eol> two arguments. <eob>
The first concern is about corruption, <eob> and the concern that people <eol> in these settings are corrupt <eob> and they are untrustworthy. <eob>
And I will admit that I have met <eol> unsavory characters <eob> working in health sectors in these situations. <eob>
But I will tell you that the opposite <eol> is absolutely true <eob> in every case I have worked on, <eob> from Afghanistan to Libya, <eol> to Kosovo, to Haiti, to Liberia -- <eob> I have met inspiring people, <eob> who, when the chips were down <eol> for their country, <eob> they risked everything to save <eol> their health institutions. <eob>
The trick for the outsider <eol> who wants to help <eob> is identifying who those individuals are, <eob> and building a pathway <eol> for them to lead. <eob>
That is exactly what happened <eol> in Afghanistan. <eob>
One of the unsung and untold success stories <eob> of our nation-building effort in Afghanistan <eob> involved the World Bank in 2002 investing heavily <eob> in identifying, training and promoting <eol> Afghani health sector leaders. <eob>
These health sector <eol> leaders have pulled off an incredible feat <eob> in Afghanistan. <eob>
They have aggressively <eol> increased access to health care <eob> for the majority of the population. <eob>
They are rapidly improving <eol> the health status <eob> of the Afghan population, <eob> which used to be the worst in the world. <eob>
In fact, the Afghan Ministry of Health does things <eob> that I wish we would do <eol> in America. <eob>
They use things like data to make policy. <eob> It's incredible. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The other concern <eol> I hear a lot about is: <eob> "We just can't afford it, <eol> we just don't have the money. <eob>
It's just unsustainable." <eob> I would submit <eol> to you that the current situation <eob> and the current system we have <eob> is the most expensive, inefficient <eol> system we could possibly conceive of. <eob>
The current situation <eol> is that when governments like the US -- <eob> or, let's say, the collection of governments <eob> that make up the European Commission -- <eob> every year, they spend 15 billion dollars <eob> on just humanitarian and emergency <eol> and disaster relief worldwide. <eob>
That's nothing about foreign aid, <eol> that's just disaster relief. <eob>
Ninety-five percent of it goes <eol> to international relief agencies, <eob> that then have to import resources <eol> into these areas, <eob> and knit together some type <eol> of temporary health system, let's say, <eob> which they then dismantle and send away <eol> when they run out of money. <eob>
So our job, it turns out, is very clear. <eob>
We, as the global health community <eol> policy experts, <eob> our first job is to become experts <eol> in how to monitor <eob> the strengths and vulnerabilities <eol> of health systems <eob> in threatened situations. <eob>
And that's when we see doctors fleeing, <eob> when we see health resources drying up, <eob> when we see institutions crumbling -- <eob> that's the emergency. <eob>
That's when we need to sound <eol> the alarm and wave our arms. <eob> OK? <eob> Not now. <eob> Everyone can see that's an emergency, <eol> they don't need us to tell them that. <eob>
Number two: <eob> places like where I work at Harvard <eol> need to take their cue <eob> from the World Bank experience in Afghanistan, <eob> and we need to -- and we will -- <eob> build robust platforms <eol> to support health sector leaders like these. <eob>
These people risk their lives. <eob>
I think we can match their courage <eol> with some support. <eob>
Number three: <eob> we need to reach out <eol> and make new partnerships. <eob>
At our global health center, <eob> we have launched a new initiative with NATO and other security policy makers <eob> to explore with them what they can do <eol> to protect health system institutions <eob> during deployments. <eob>
We want them to see <eob> that protecting health systems <eol> and other critical social institutions <eob> is an integral part of their mission. <eob>
It's not just about avoiding <eol> collateral damage; <eob> it's about winning the peace. <eob>
But the most important partner <eol> we need to engage is you, <eob> the American public, and indeed, the world public. <eob>
Because unless you understand <eol> the value of social institutions, <eob> like health systems <eol> in these fragile settings, <eob> you won't support efforts to save them. <eob>
You won't click on that article <eob> that talks about "Hey, <eol> all those doctors are on the run in country X. <eob> I wonder what that means. <eob>
I wonder what that means. <eob> for that health system's ability to, let's say, detect influenza." <eob> "Hmm, it's probably not good." <eol> That's what I'd tell you. <eob>
Up on the screen, <eob> I've put up my three favorite American institution <eol> defenders and builders. <eob>
Over here is George C. Marshall, <eob> he was the guy <eol> that proposed the Marshall Plan <eob> to save all of Europe's economic institutions <eol> after World War II. <eob>
And this Eleanor Roosevelt. <eob>
Her work on human rights <eol> really serves as the foundation <eob> for all of our international <eol> human rights organizations. <eob>
Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin, <eob> who did many things in terms <eol> of creating institutions, <eob> but was the midwife <eol> of our constitution. <eob>
And I would say to you <eob> that these are folks who, <eol> when our country was threatened, <eob> or our world was threatened, <eob> they didn't retreat. <eob>
They didn't talk about building walls. <eob>
They talked about building <eol> institutions to protect human security, <eob> for their generation and also for ours. <eob>
And I think our generation <eol> should do the same. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
When I was a kid, <eol> I was the quintessential nerd. <eob>
I think some of you were, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you, sir, who laughed the loudest, <eol> you probably still are. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I grew up in a small town <eol> in the dusty plains of north Texas, <eob> the son of a sheriff <eol> who was the son of a pastor. <eob>
Getting into trouble was not an option. <eob>
And so I started reading <eol> calculus books for fun. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You did, too. <eob> That led me to building a laser <eol> and a computer and model rockets, <eob> and that led me to making <eol> rocket fuel in my bedroom. <eob>
Now, in scientific terms, <eob> we call this a very bad idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Around that same time, <eob> Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" <eol> came to the theaters, <eob> and my life was forever changed. <eob>
I loved everything about that movie, <eob> especially the HAL 9000. <eob>
Now, HAL was a sentient computer <eob> designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft <eob> from the Earth to Jupiter. <eob>
HAL was also a flawed character, <eob> for in the end he chose <eol> to value the mission over human life. <eob>
Now, HAL was a fictional character, <eob> but nonetheless he speaks to our fears, <eob> our fears of being subjugated <eob> by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence <eob> who is indifferent to our humanity. <eob>
I believe that such fears are unfounded. <eob>
Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time <eob> in human history, <eob> where, driven by refusal to accept <eol> the limits of our bodies and our minds, <eob> we are building machines <eob> of exquisite, beautiful <eol> complexity and grace <eob> that will extend the human experience <eob> in ways beyond our imagining. <eob>
After a career that led me <eol> from the Air Force Academy <eob> to Space Command to now, <eob> I became a systems engineer, <eob> and recently I was drawn <eol> into an engineering problem <eob> associated with NASA's mission to Mars. <eob>
Now, in space flights to the Moon, <eob> we can rely upon <eol> mission control in Houston <eob> to watch over all aspects of a flight. <eob> However, Mars is 200 times further away, <eob> and as a result it takes <eol> on average 13 minutes <eob> for a signal to travel <eol> from the Earth to Mars. <eob>
If there's trouble, <eol> there's not enough time. <eob>
And so a reasonable engineering solution <eob> calls for us to put mission control <eob> inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft. <eob>
Another fascinating idea <eol> in the mission profile <eob> places humanoid robots <eol> on the surface of Mars <eob> before the humans themselves arrive, <eob> first to build facilities <eob> and later to serve as collaborative <eol> members of the science team. <eob>
Now, as I looked at this <eol> from an engineering perspective, <eob> it became very clear to me <eol> that what I needed to architect <eob> was a smart, collaborative, <eob> socially intelligent <eol> artificial intelligence. <eob>
In other words, I needed to build <eol> something very much like a HAL <eob> but without the homicidal tendencies. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's pause for a moment. <eob>
Is it really possible to build <eol> an artificial intelligence like that? <eob> Actually, it is. <eob> In many ways, <eob> this is a hard engineering problem <eob> with elements of AI, <eob> not some wet hair ball of an AI problem <eol> that needs to be engineered. <eob>
To paraphrase Alan Turing, <eob> I'm not interested <eol> in building a sentient machine. <eob>
I'm not building a HAL. <eob>
All I'm after is a simple brain, <eob> something that offers <eol> the illusion of intelligence. <eob>
The art and the science of computing <eol> have come a long way <eob> since HAL was onscreen, <eob> and I'd imagine if his inventor <eol> Dr. Chandra were here today, <eob> he'd have a whole lot of questions for us. <eob>
Is it really possible for us <eob> to take a system of millions <eol> upon millions of devices, <eob> to read in their data streams, <eob> to predict their failures and act in advance? <eob> Yes. <eob> Can we build systems that converse <eol> with humans in natural language? <eob> Yes. <eob> Can we build systems that recognize objects, identify emotions, <eob> emote themselves, play games and even read lips? <eob> Yes. <eob> Can we build a system that sets goals, <eob> that carries out plans against those goals <eol> and learns along the way? <eob> Yes. <eob> Can we build systems that have a theory of mind? <eob>
This we are learning to do. <eob>
Can we build systems that have <eol> an ethical and moral foundation? <eob>
This we must learn how to do. <eob>
So let's accept for a moment <eob> that it's possible to build <eol> such an artificial intelligence <eob> for this kind of mission and others. <eob>
The next question <eol> you must ask yourself is, <eob> should we fear it? <eob>
Now, every new technology <eob> brings with it <eol> some measure of trepidation. <eob>
When we first saw cars, <eob> people lamented that we would see <eol> the destruction of the family. <eob>
When we first saw telephones come in, <eob> people were worried it would destroy <eol> all civil conversation. <eob>
At a point in time we saw <eol> the written word become pervasive, <eob> people thought we would lose <eol> our ability to memorize. <eob>
These things are all true to a degree, <eob> but it's also the case <eol> that these technologies <eob> brought to us things <eol> that extended the human experience <eob> in some profound ways. <eob>
So let's take this a little further. <eob>
I do not fear the creation <eol> of an AI like this, <eob> because it will eventually <eol> embody some of our values. <eob>
Consider this: building a cognitive system <eol> is fundamentally different <eob> than building a traditional <eol> software-intensive system of the past. <eob>
We don't program them. We teach them. <eob> In order to teach a system <eol> how to recognize flowers, <eob> I show it thousands of flowers <eol> of the kinds I like. <eob>
In order to teach a system <eol> how to play a game — <eob> Well, I would. <eob>
You would, too. <eob> I like flowers. Come on. <eob> To teach a system how to play <eol> a game like Go, <eob> I'd have it play thousands of games of Go, <eob> but in the process I also teach it <eob> how to discern <eol> a good game from a bad game. <eob>
If I want to create an artificially <eol> intelligent legal assistant, <eob> I will teach it some corpus of law <eob> but at the same time I am fusing with it <eob> the sense of mercy and justice <eol> that is part of that law. <eob>
In scientific terms, <eol> this is what we call ground truth, <eob> and here's the important point: <eob> in producing these machines, <eob> we are therefore teaching them <eol> a sense of our values. <eob>
To that end, I trust <eol> an artificial intelligence <eob> the same, if not more, <eol> as a human who is well-trained. <eob>
But, you may ask, <eob> what about rogue agents, <eob> some well-funded <eol> nongovernment organization? <eob>
I do not fear an artificial intelligence <eol> in the hand of a lone wolf. <eob>
Clearly, we cannot protect ourselves <eol> against all random acts of violence, <eob> but the reality is such a system <eob> requires substantial training <eol> and subtle training <eob> far beyond the resources of an individual. <eob>
And furthermore, <eob> it's far more than just injecting <eol> an internet virus to the world, <eob> where you push a button, <eol> all of a sudden it's in a million places <eob> and laptops start blowing up <eol> all over the place. <eob>
Now, these kinds of substances <eol> are much larger, <eob> and we'll certainly see them coming. <eob>
Do I fear that such <eol> an artificial intelligence <eob> might threaten all of humanity? <eob>
If you look at movies <eol> such as "The Matrix," "Metropolis," <eob> "The Terminator," <eol> shows such as "Westworld," <eob> they all speak of this kind of fear. <eob>
Indeed, in the book "Superintelligence" <eol> by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, <eob> he picks up on this theme <eob> and observes that a superintelligence <eol> might not only be dangerous, <eob> it could represent an existential threat <eol> to all of humanity. <eob>
Dr. Bostrom's basic argument <eob> is that such systems will eventually <eob> have such an insatiable <eol> thirst for information <eob> that they will perhaps learn how to learn <eob> and eventually discover <eol> that they may have goals <eob> that are contrary to human needs. <eob>
Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers. <eob>
He is supported by people <eol> such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. <eob>
With all due respect <eob> to these brilliant minds, <eob> I believe that they <eol> are fundamentally wrong. <eob>
Now, there are a lot of pieces <eol> of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack, <eob> and I don't have time to unpack them all, <eob> but very briefly, consider this: <eob> super knowing is very different <eol> than super doing. <eob>
HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew <eob> only insofar as HAL commanded <eol> all aspects of the Discovery. <eob>
So it would have to be <eol> with a superintelligence. <eob>
It would have to have dominion <eol> over all of our world. <eob>
This is the stuff of Skynet <eol> from the movie "The Terminator" <eob> in which we had a superintelligence <eob> that commanded human will, <eob> that directed every device <eol> that was in every corner of the world. <eob>
Practically speaking, <eob> it ain't gonna happen. <eob>
We are not building AIs <eol> that control the weather, <eob> that direct the tides, <eob> that command us <eol> capricious, chaotic humans. <eob>
And furthermore, <eob> if such an artificial intelligence <eol> existed, <eob> it would have to compete <eol> with human economies, <eob> and thereby compete <eol> for resources with us. <eob>
And in the end -- <eob> don't tell Siri this -- <eob> we can always unplug them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We are on an incredible journey <eob> of coevolution with our machines. <eob>
The humans we are today <eob> are not the humans we will be then. <eob>
To worry now about the rise <eol> of a superintelligence <eob> is in many ways a dangerous distraction <eob> because the rise of computing itself <eob> brings to us a number <eol> of human and societal issues <eob> to which we must now attend. <eob>
How shall I best organize society <eob> when the need for human labor diminishes? <eob>
How can I bring understanding <eol> and education throughout the globe <eob> and still respect our differences? <eob>
How might I extend and enhance human life <eol> through cognitive healthcare? <eob>
How might I use computing <eob> to help take us to the stars? <eob>
And that's the exciting thing. <eob>
The opportunities to use computing <eob> to advance the human experience <eob> are within our reach, <eob> here and now, <eob> and we are just beginning. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hi, I'm an engineer <eob> and I make robots. <eob>
Now, of course you all know <eol> what a robot is, right? <eob>
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google, <eob> and you'd ask Google what a robot is. <eob>
So let's do that. <eob>
We'll go to Google <eol> and this is what we get. <eob>
Now, you can see here there are <eol> lots of different types of robots, <eob> but they're predominantly <eol> humanoid in structure. <eob>
And they look pretty conventional <eob> because they've got plastic, <eol> they've got metal, <eob> they've got motors and gears and so on. <eob>
Some of them look quite friendly, <eob> and you could go up <eol> and you could hug them. <eob>
Some of them not so friendly, <eob> they look like they're <eol> straight out of "Terminator," <eob> in fact they may well be <eol> straight out of "Terminator." <eob> You can do lots of really cool <eol> things with these robots -- <eob> you can do really exciting stuff. <eob>
But I'd like to look <eol> at different kinds of robots -- <eob> I want to make different kinds of robots. <eob> And I take inspiration <eol> from the things that don't look like us, <eob> but look like these. <eob>
So these are natural biological organisms <eob> and they do some <eol> really cool things that we can't, <eob> and current robots can't either. <eob>
They do all sorts of great things <eol> like moving around on the floor; <eob> they go into our gardens <eol> and they eat our crops; <eob> they climb trees; <eob> they go in water, they come out of water; <eob> they trap insects and digest them. <eob>
So they do really interesting things. <eob>
They live, they breathe, they die, <eob> they eat things from the environment. <eob>
Our current robots don't really do that. <eob>
Now, wouldn't it be great <eob> if you could use some of those <eol> characteristics in future robots <eob> so that you could solve <eol> some really interesting problems? <eob>
I'm going to look at a couple of problems <eol> now in the environment <eob> where we can use <eol> the skills and the technologies <eob> derived from these animals <eob> and from the plants, <eob> and we can use them <eol> to solve those problems. <eob>
Let's have a look <eol> at two environmental problems. <eob>
They're both of our making -- <eob> this is man interacting <eol> with the environment <eob> and doing some rather unpleasant things. <eob>
The first one is to do <eol> with the pressure of population. <eob>
Such is the pressure <eol> of population around the world <eob> that agriculture and farming is required <eol> to produce more and more crops. <eob>
Now, to do that, <eob> farmers put more and more <eol> chemicals onto the land. <eob>
They put on fertilizers, <eol> nitrates, pesticides -- <eob> all sorts of things <eol> that encourage the growth of the crops, <eob> but there are some negative impacts. <eob>
One of the negative impacts is <eol> if you put lots of fertilizer on the land, <eob> not all of it goes into the crops. <eob>
Lots of it stays in the soil, <eob> and then when it rains, <eob> these chemicals go into the water table. <eob>
And in the water table, <eob> then they go into streams, <eol> into lakes, into rivers <eob> and into the sea. <eob>
Now, if you put all <eol> of these chemicals, these nitrates, <eob> into those kinds of environments, <eob> there are organisms in those environments <eol> that will be affected by that -- <eob> algae, for example. <eob>
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer, <eob> so it will take in all these chemicals, <eob> and if the conditions are right, <eol> it will mass produce. <eob>
It will produce masses <eol> and masses of new algae. <eob>
That's called a bloom. <eob>
The trouble is that <eol> when algae reproduces like this, <eob> it starves the water of oxygen. <eob>
As soon as you do that, <eob> the other organisms <eol> in the water can't survive. <eob>
So, what do we do? <eob>
We try to produce a robot <eol> that will eat the algae, <eob> consume it and make it safe. <eob>
So that's the first problem. <eob>
The second problem is also of our making, <eob> and it's to do with oil pollution. <eob>
Now, oil comes out <eol> of the engines that we use, <eob> the boats that we use. <eob>
Sometimes tankers <eol> flush their oil tanks into the sea, <eob> so oil is released into the sea that way. <eob>
Wouldn't it be nice <eol> if we could treat that in some way <eob> using robots that could eat the pollution <eol> the oil fields have produced? <eob>
So that's what we do. <eob>
We make robots that will eat pollution. <eob>
To actually make the robot, <eob> we take inspiration from two organisms. <eob>
On the right there <eol> you see the basking shark. <eob>
The basking shark is a massive shark. <eob>
It's noncarnivorous, <eol> so you can swim with it, <eob> as you can see. <eob>
And the basking shark opens its mouth, <eob> and it swims through the water, <eol> collecting plankton. <eob>
As it does that, it digests the food, <eob> and then it uses that energy <eol> in its body to keep moving. <eob>
So, could we make a robot like that -- <eob> like the basking shark <eol> that chugs through the water <eob> and eats up pollution? <eob>
Well, let's see if we can do that. <eob>
But also, we take the inspiration <eol> from other organisms. <eob>
I've got a picture here <eol> of a water boatman, <eob> and the water boatman is really cute. <eob>
When it's swimming in the water, <eob> it uses its paddle-like legs <eol> to push itself forward. <eob>
So we take those two organisms <eob> and we combine them together <eol> to make a new kind of robot. <eob>
In fact, because we're using <eol> the water boatman as inspiration, <eob> and our robot sits on top of the water, <eob> and it rows, <eob> we call it the "Row-bot." <eob> So a Row-bot is a robot that rows. <eob> OK. So what does it look like? <eob>
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot, <eob> and you'll see, <eob> it doesn't look anything like the robots <eol> we saw right at the beginning. <eob>
Google is wrong; <eol> robots don't look like that, <eob> they look like this. <eob>
So I've got the Row-bot here. <eob>
I'll just hold it up for you. <eob> It gives you a sense of the scale, <eob> and it doesn't look <eol> anything like the others. <eob>
OK, so it's made out of plastic, <eob> and we'll have a look now <eol> at the components <eob> that make up the Row-bot -- <eob> what makes it really special. <eob>
The Row-bot is made up of three parts, <eob> and those three parts are really <eol> like the parts of any organism. <eob>
It's got a brain, <eob> it's got a body <eob> and it's got a stomach. <eob>
It needs the stomach to create the energy. <eob>
Any Row-bot will have <eol> those three components, <eob> and any organism <eol> will have those three components, <eob> so let's go through them one at a time. <eob>
It has a body, <eob> and its body is made out of plastic, <eob> and it sits on top of the water. <eob>
And it's got flippers on the side here -- <eob> paddles that help it move, <eob> just like the water boatman. <eob>
It's got a plastic body, <eob> but it's got a soft rubber mouth here, <eob> and a mouth here -- <eol> it's got two mouths. <eob>
Why does it have two mouths? <eob>
One is to let the food go in <eob> and the other is to let the food go out. <eob>
So you can see really <eol> it's got a mouth and a derriere, <eob> or a — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> something where the stuff comes out, <eob> which is just like a real organism. <eob>
So it's starting to look <eol> like that basking shark. <eob>
So that's the body. <eob>
The second component might be the stomach. <eob>
We need to get the energy into the robot <eol> and we need to treat the pollution, <eob> so the pollution goes in, <eob> and it will do something. <eob>
It's got a cell in the middle here <eol> called a microbial fuel cell. <eob>
I'll put this down, <eol> and I'll lift up the fuel cell. <eob> Here. So instead of having batteries, <eob> instead of having <eol> a conventional power system, <eob> it's got one of these. <eob>
This is its stomach. <eob>
And it really is a stomach <eob> because you can put energy in this side <eol> in the form of pollution, <eob> and it creates electricity. <eob> So what is it? <eob> It's called a microbial fuel cell. <eob>
It's a little bit <eol> like a chemical fuel cell, <eob> which you might have <eol> come across in school, <eob> or you might've seen in the news. <eob>
Chemical fuel cells <eol> take hydrogen and oxygen, <eob> and they can combine them together <eol> and you get electricity. <eob>
That's well-established technology; <eol> it was in the Apollo space missions. <eob>
That's from 40, 50 years ago. <eob>
This is slightly newer. <eob>
This is a microbial fuel cell. <eob>
It's the same principle: <eob> it's got oxygen on one side, <eob> but instead of having <eol> hydrogen on the other, <eob> it's got some soup, <eob> and inside that soup <eol> there are living microbes. <eob>
Now, if you take some organic material -- <eob> could be some waste products, some food, <eob> maybe a bit of your sandwich -- <eob> you put it in there, <eol> the microbes will eat that food, <eob> and they will turn it into electricity. <eob>
Not only that, but if you select <eol> the right kind of microbes, <eob> you can use the microbial fuel cell <eol> to treat some of the pollution. <eob>
If you choose the right microbes, <eob> the microbes will eat the algae. <eob>
If you use other kinds of microbes, <eob> they will eat petroleum <eol> spirits and crude oil. <eob>
So you can see <eol> how this stomach could be used <eob> to not only treat the pollution <eob> but also to generate electricity <eol> from the pollution. <eob>
So the robot will move <eol> through the environment, <eob> taking food into its stomach, <eob> digest the food, create electricity, <eob> use that electricity <eol> to move through the environment <eob> and keep doing this. <eob>
OK, so let's see what happens <eol> when we run the Row-bot -- <eob> when it does some rowing. <eob>
Here we've got a couple of videos, <eob> the first thing you'll see -- <eol> hopefully you can see here <eob> is the mouth open. <eob>
The front mouth and the bottom mouth open, <eob> and it will stay opened enough, <eob> then the robot will start to row forward. <eob>
It moves through the water <eob> so that food goes in <eol> as the waste products go out. <eob>
Once it's moved enough, <eob> it stops and then it closes the mouth -- <eob> slowly closes the mouths -- <eob> and then it will sit there, <eob> and it will digest the food. <eob>
Of course these microbial fuel cells, <eob> they contain microbes. <eob>
What you really want is lots of energy <eob> coming out of those microbes <eol> as quickly as possible. <eob>
But we can't force the microbes <eob> and they generate a small amount <eol> of electricity per second. <eob>
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts. <eob>
Let's put that into context. <eob>
Your mobile phone for example, <eob> one of these modern ones, <eob> if you use it, it takes about one watt. <eob>
So that's a thousand or a million times <eol> as much energy that that uses <eob> compared to the microbial fuel cell. <eob>
How can we cope with that? <eob>
Well, when the Row-bot <eol> has done its digestion, <eob> when it's taken the food in, <eob> it will sit there and it will wait <eol> until it has consumed all that food. <eob>
That could take some hours, <eol> it could take some days. <eob>
A typical cycle for the Row-bot <eol> looks like this: <eob> you open your mouth, <eob> you move, <eob> you close your mouth <eob> and you sit there for a while waiting. <eob>
Once you digest your food, <eob> then you can go about <eol> doing the same thing again. <eob>
But you know what, that looks <eol> like a real organism, doesn't it? <eob>
It looks like the kind of thing we do. <eob>
Saturday night, <eol> we go out, open our mouths, <eob> fill our stomachs, <eob> sit in front of the telly and digest. <eob>
When we've had enough, <eol> we do the same thing again. <eob>
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle, <eob> at the end of the cycle <eol> we'll have enough energy left over <eob> for us to be able to do something else. <eob>
We could send a message, for example. <eob>
We could send a message saying, <eob> "This is how much pollution <eol> I've eaten recently," <eob> or, "This is the kind of stuff <eol> that I've encountered," <eob> or, "This is where I am." <eob> That ability to send a message <eol> saying, "This is where I am," <eob> is really, really important. <eob>
If you think about the oil slicks <eol> that we saw before, <eob> or those massive algal blooms, <eob> what you really want to do <eol> is put your Row-bot out there, <eob> and it eats up all of those pollutions, <eob> and then you have to go collect them. <eob> Why? <eob> Because these Row-bots at the moment, <eob> this Row-bot I've got here, <eob> it contains motors, it contains wires, <eob> it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable. <eob>
Current Row-bots contain <eol> things like toxic batteries. <eob>
You can't leave those <eol> in the environment, <eob> so you need to track them, <eob> and then when they've <eol> finished their job of work, <eob> you need to collect them. <eob>
That limits the number <eol> of Row-bots you can use. <eob>
If, on the other hand, <eob> you have robot a little bit <eol> like a biological organism, <eob> when it comes to the end of its life, <eob> it dies and it degrades to nothing. <eob>
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots, <eob> instead of being like this, <eol> made out of plastic, <eob> were made out of other materials, <eob> which when you throw them out there, <eob> they biodegrade to nothing? <eob>
That changes the way <eol> in which we use robots. <eob>
Instead of putting 10 or 100 <eol> out into the environment, <eob> having to track them, <eob> and then when they die, <eob> collect them, <eob> you could put a thousand, <eob> a million, a billion robots <eol> into the environment. <eob>
Just spread them around. <eob>
You know that at the end of their lives, <eol> they're going to degrade to nothing. <eob>
You don't need to worry about them. <eob>
So that changes the way <eol> in which you think about robots <eob> and the way you deploy them. <eob>
Then the question is: Can you do this? <eob>
Well, yes, we have shown <eol> that you can do this. <eob>
You can make robots <eol> which are biodegradable. <eob>
What's really interesting <eol> is you can use household materials <eob> to make these biodegradable robots. <eob>
I'll show you some; <eol> you might be surprised. <eob>
You can make a robot out of jelly. <eob>
Instead of having a motor, <eol> which we have at the moment, <eob> you can make things <eol> called artificial muscles. <eob>
Artificial muscles are smart materials, <eob> you apply electricity to them, <eob> and they contract, <eol> or they bend or they twist. <eob>
They look like real muscles. <eob>
So instead of having a motor, <eol> you have these artificial muscles. <eob>
And you can make <eol> artificial muscles out of jelly. <eob>
If you take some jelly and some salts, <eob> and do a bit of jiggery-pokery, <eob> you can make an artificial muscle. <eob>
We've also shown you can make <eol> the microbial fuel cell's stomach <eob> out of paper. <eob>
So you could make the whole <eol> robot out of biodegradable materials. <eob>
You throw them out there, <eol> and they degrade to nothing. <eob>
Well, this is really, really exciting. <eob>
It's going to totally change the way <eol> in which we think about robots, <eob> but also it allows you <eol> to be really creative <eob> in the way in which you think <eol> about what you can do with these robots. <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob>
If you can use jelly to make a robot -- <eob> now, we eat jelly, right? <eob>
So, why not make something like this? <eob>
A robot gummy bear. <eob>
Here, I've got some I prepared earlier. <eob> There we go. I've got a packet -- <eob> and I've got a lemon-flavored one. <eob>
I'll take this gummy bear -- <eol> he's not robotic, OK? <eob> We have to pretend. <eob>
And what you do with one of these <eol> is you put it in your mouth -- <eob> the lemon's quite nice. <eob>
Try not to chew it too much, <eol> it's a robot, it may not like it. <eob> And then you swallow it. <eob>
And then it goes into your stomach. <eob>
And when it's inside your stomach, <eol> it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends, <eob> it does something. <eob>
It could go further down <eol> into your intestines, <eob> find out whether you've got <eol> some ulcer or cancer, <eob> maybe do an injection, <eol> something like that. <eob>
You know that once <eol> it's done its job of work, <eob> it could be consumed by your stomach, <eob> or if you don't want that, <eob> it could go straight through you, <eob> into the toilet, <eob> and be degraded safely in the environment. <eob>
So this changes the way, again, <eol> in which we think about robots. <eob>
So, we started off looking <eol> at robots that would eat pollution, <eob> and then we're looking <eol> at robots which we can eat. <eob>
I hope this gives you some idea <eob> of the kinds of things <eol> we can do with future robots. <eob>
Thank you very much for your attention. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
What if I told you that time has a race, <eob> a race in the contemporary way <eol> that we understand race <eob> in the United States? <eob>
Typically, we talk about race <eol> in terms of black and white issues. <eob>
In the African-American communities <eol> from which I come, <eob> we have a long-standing <eol> multi-generational joke <eob> about what we call "CP time," <eob> or "colored people's time." <eob> Now, we no longer refer <eol> to African-Americans as "colored," <eob> but this long-standing joke <eob> about our perpetual lateness to church, <eob> to cookouts, to family events <eob> and even to our own funerals, remains. <eob>
I personally am a stickler for time. <eob>
It's almost as if my mother, <eol> when I was growing up, said, <eob> "We will not be those black people." <eob> So we typically arrive to events <eol> 30 minutes early. <eob>
But today, I want to talk to you <eol> more about the political nature of time, <eob> for if time had a race, <eob> it would be white. <eob>
White people own time. <eob>
I know, I know. <eob>
Making such "incendiary statements" <eol> makes us uncomfortable: <eob> Haven't we moved past the point <eol> where race really matters? <eob>
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept? <eob>
Shouldn't we go ahead <eol> with our enlightened, progressive selves <eob> and relegate useless concepts like race <eol> to the dustbins of history? <eob>
How will we ever get over racism <eol> if we keep on talking about race? <eob>
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts <eol> of race in a time capsule, <eob> bury them and dig them up <eol> in a thousand years, <eob> peer at them with the clearly <eol> more enlightened, <eob> raceless versions of ourselves <eol> that belong to the future. <eob>
But you see there, <eob> that desire to mitigate the impact <eol> of race and racism shows up <eob> in how we attempt to manage time, <eob> in the ways we narrate history, <eob> in the ways we attempt <eol> to shove the negative truths of the present <eob> into the past, <eob> in the ways we attempt <eol> to argue that the future that we hope for <eob> is the present in which we're currently living. <eob>
Now, when Barack Obama <eol> became President of the US in 2008, <eob> many Americans declared <eol> that we were post-racial. <eob>
I'm from the academy <eob> where we're enamored <eol> with being post-everything. <eob>
We're postmodern, we're post-structural, <eol> we're post-feminist. <eob> "Post" has become <eol> a simple academic appendage <eob> that we apply to a range of terms <eob> to mark the way we were. <eob>
But prefixes alone don't have the power <eol> to make race and racism <eob> a thing of the past. <eob>
The US was never "pre-race." <eob> So to claim that we're post-race when we <eol> have yet to grapple with the impact <eob> of race on black people, <eol> Latinos or the indigenous <eob> is disingenuous. <eob>
Just about the moment <eol> we were preparing to celebrate <eob> our post-racial future, <eob> our political conditions became <eol> the most racial they've been <eob> in the last 50 years. <eob>
So today, I want to offer to you <eol> three observations, <eob> about the past, the present <eol> and the future of time, <eob> as it relates to the combating <eol> of racism and white dominance. <eob>
First: the past. <eob> Time has a history, <eob> and so do black people. <eob>
But we treat time as though <eol> it is timeless, <eob> as though it has always been this way, <eob> as though it doesn't have <eol> a political history <eob> bound up with the plunder <eol> of indigenous lands, <eob> the genocide of indigenous people <eob> and the stealing of Africans <eol> from their homeland. <eob>
When white male European philosophers <eob> first thought to conceptualize <eol> time and history, one famously declared, <eob> "[Africa] is no historical <eol> part of the World." <eob> He was essentially saying <eob> that Africans were people <eol> outside of history <eob> who had had no impact on time <eob> or the march of progress. <eob>
This idea, that black people <eol> have had no impact on history, <eob> is one of the foundational ideas <eol> of white supremacy. <eob>
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson <eol> created "Negro History Week" in 1926. <eob> It's the reason that we continue <eol> to celebrate Black History Month <eob> in the US every February. <eob>
Now, we also see this idea <eob> that black people are people either <eol> alternately outside of the bounds of time <eob> or stuck in the past, <eob> in a scenario where, <eol> much as I'm doing right now, <eob> a black person stands up and insists <eol> that racism still matters, <eob> and a person, usually white, <eob> says to them, <eob> "Why are you stuck in the past? <eob>
Why can't you move on? <eob>
We have a black president. <eob>
We're past all that." <eob>
William Faulkner famously said, <eob> "The past is never dead. <eob>
It's not even past." <eob> But my good friend <eol> Professor Kristie Dotson says, <eob> "Our memory is longer than our lifespan." <eob> We carry, all of us, <eob> family and communal <eol> hopes and dreams with us. <eob>
We don't have the luxury <eol> of letting go of the past. <eob>
But sometimes, <eob> our political conditions are so troubling <eob> that we don't know <eol> if we're living in the past <eob> or we're living in the present. <eob>
Take, for instance, <eol> when Black Lives Matter protesters <eob> go out to protest unjust killings <eol> of black citizens by police, <eob> and the pictures that emerge <eol> from the protest <eob> look like they could have been <eol> taken 50 years ago. <eob>
The past won't let us go. <eob>
But still, let us press our way <eol> into the present. <eob>
At present, I would argue <eob> that the racial struggles <eol> we are experiencing <eob> are clashes over time and space. <eob>
What do I mean? <eob>
Well, I've already told you <eol> that white people own time. <eob>
Those in power dictate <eol> the pace of the workday. <eob>
They dictate how much money <eol> our time is actually worth. <eob>
And Professor George Lipsitz argues <eob> that white people even dictate <eol> the pace of social inclusion. <eob>
They dictate how long <eol> it will actually take <eob> for minority groups to receive the rights <eol> that they have been fighting for. <eob>
Let me loop back to the past quickly <eol> to give you an example. <eob>
If you think about <eol> the Civil Rights Movement <eob> and the cries of its leaders <eol> for "Freedom Now," <eob> they were challenging the slow pace <eol> of white social inclusion. <eob>
By 1965, the year <eol> the Voting Rights Act was passed, <eob> there had been a full 100 years <eob> between the end of the Civil War <eob> and the conferral of voting rights <eol> on African-American communities. <eob>
Despite the urgency of a war, <eob> it still took a full 100 years <eol> for actual social inclusion to occur. <eob>
Since 2012, <eob> conservative state legislatures <eol> across the US have ramped up attempts <eob> to roll back African-American <eol> voting rights <eob> by passing restrictive voter ID laws <eob> and curtailing early voting opportunities. <eob>
This past July, a federal court <eol> struck down North Carolina's voter ID law <eob> saying it "... targeted African-Americans <eol> with surgical precision." <eob>
Restricting African-American inclusion <eol> in the body politic <eob> is a primary way that we attempt <eol> to manage and control people <eob> by managing and controlling time. <eob>
But another place that we see <eol> these time-space clashes <eob> is in gentrifying cities <eol> like Atlanta, Brooklyn, <eob> Philadelphia, New Orleans <eol> and Washington, DC -- <eob> places that have had <eol> black populations for generations. <eob>
But now, in the name <eol> of urban renewal and progress, <eob> these communities are pushed out, <eob> in service of bringing them <eol> into the 21st century. <eob>
Professor Sharon Holland asked: <eob> What happens when a person <eol> who exists in time <eob> meets someone who only occupies space? <eob>
These racial struggles <eob> are battles over those <eol> who are perceived to be space-takers <eob> and those who are perceived <eol> to be world-makers. <eob>
Those who control the flow <eol> and thrust of history <eob> are considered world-makers <eol> who own and master time. <eob>
In other words: white people. <eob>
But when Hegel famously said that Africa <eol> was no historical part of the world, <eob> he implied that it was merely <eol> a voluminous land mass <eob> taking up space <eol> at the bottom of the globe. <eob> Africans were space-takers. <eob> So today, white people continue to control <eol> the flow and thrust of history, <eob> while too often treating black people <eol> as though we are merely taking up space <eob> to which we are not entitled. <eob>
in service of bringing them <eol> into the 21st century. <eob> Time and the march of progress <eol> is used to justify <eob> a stunning degree of violence <eol> towards our most vulnerable populations, <eob> who, being perceived as space-takers <eol> rather than world-makers, <eob> are moved out of the places <eol> where they live, <eob>
Shortened life span according to zip code <eol> is just one example of the ways <eob> that time and space cohere <eol> in an unjust manner <eob> in the lives of black people. <eob>
Children who are born <eol> in New Orleans zip code 70124, <eob> which is 93 percent white, <eob> can expect to live a full 25 years longer <eob> than children born <eol> in New Orleans zip code 70112, <eob> which is 60 percent black. <eob>
Children born in Washington, DC's <eol> wealthy Maryland suburbs <eob> can expect to live a full 20 years longer <eob> than children born <eol> in its downtown neighborhoods. <eob>
Ta-Nehisi Coates argues <eob> that, "The defining feature <eol> of being drafted into the Black race <eob> is the inescapable robbery of time." <eob> We experience time discrimination, <eob> he tells us, <eob> not just as structural, <eob> but as personal: <eob> in lost moments of joy, <eob> lost moments of connection, <eob> lost quality of time with loved ones <eob> and lost years of healthy quality of life. <eob>
In the future, do you see black people? <eob>
Do black people have a future? <eob>
What if you belong <eol> to the very race of people <eob> who have always been pitted against time? <eob>
What if your group is the group <eol> for whom a future was never imagined? <eob>
These time-space clashes -- <eob> between protesters and police, <eob> between gentrifiers and residents -- <eob> don't paint a very pretty picture <eob> of what America hopes <eol> for black people's future. <eob>
If the present is any indicator, <eob> our children will be under-educated, <eob> health maladies will take their toll <eob> and housing will continue <eol> to be unaffordable. <eob>
So if we're really ready <eol> to talk about the future, <eob> perhaps we should begin <eol> by admitting that we're out of time. <eob>
We black people <eol> have always been out of time. <eob>
Time does not belong to us. <eob>
Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency. <eob>
Time is used to displace us, <eob> or conversely, we are urged <eol> into complacency <eob> through endless calls to just be patient. <eob>
But if past is prologue, <eob> let us seize upon the ways in which <eol> we're always out of time anyway <eob> to demand with urgency <eob> freedom now. <eob>
I believe the future is what we make it. <eob>
But first, we have to decide <eol> that time belongs to all of us. <eob>
No, we don't all get equal time, <eob> but we can decide that the time <eol> we do get is just and free. <eob>
We can stop making your zip code <eol> the primary determinant <eob> of your lifespan. <eob>
We can stop stealing learning time <eol> from black children <eob> through excessive use <eol> of suspensions and expulsions. <eob>
We can stop stealing time <eol> from black people <eob> through long periods <eol> of incarceration for nonviolent crimes. <eob>
The police can stop <eol> stealing time and black lives <eob> through use of excessive force. <eob>
I believe the future is what we make it. <eob>
But we can't get there <eol> on colored people's time <eob> or white time <eob> or your time <eob> or even my time. <eob>
It's our time. <eob> Ours. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Twenty-eight years ago, <eol> I was a broken man. <eob>
And you probably wouldn't be able <eol> to tell that if you met me. <eob>
I had a good job at a well-respected <eol> academic institution. <eob>
I dressed well, of course. <eob>
But my insides were rotting away. <eob>
You see, I grew up in a family <eol> riddled with addiction, <eob> and as a kid, I also struggled <eob> with coming to terms <eol> with my own sexuality. <eob>
And even though I couldn't name it then, <eob> growing up as a gay kid <eob> just compounded my issues <eol> of isolation and insecurities. <eob>
But drinking took all of that away. <eob>
Like many, I drank at an early age. <eob>
I continued to drink <eol> my way through college. <eob>
And when I finally did come <eol> out in the early 1980s, <eob> about the only places to meet <eol> other gay people, <eob> to socialize, <eob> to be yourself, were gay bars. <eob>
And what do you do in gay bars? <eob> You drink. <eob> And I did -- <eob> a lot. <eob>
My story is not unique. <eob>
Like millions of Americans, <eol> my disease progressed undiagnosed. <eob> It took me to people and places and things <eob> that I never would have chosen. <eob>
It wasn't until an intersection <eol> with the law <eob> gave me an "opportunity" to get care, <eob> that I began my journey of recovery. <eob>
My journey of recovery <eol> has been filled with love and with joy, <eob> but it hasn't been without pain. <eob>
Like many of you, I've lost too many friends <eol> and family to this disease. <eob>
I've heard too many heartbreaking stories <eob> of people who've lost loved ones to addiction. <eob>
And I've also lost countless friends <eol> to HIV and AIDS. <eob>
Our current opioid epidemic <eol> and the AIDS epidemic <eob> tragically have much in common. <eob>
Right now, we are in the midst of one <eol> of the greatest health crises of our time. <eob>
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people <eob> died of drug overdoses <eol> associated with prescription drugs and heroin. <eob>
During the 1980s, scores of people <eol> were dying from HIV and AIDS. <eob>
Public officials ignored it. <eob>
Some wouldn't even utter the words. <eob>
They didn't want treatment. <eob>
And tragically, there are many parallels <eol> with our current epidemic. <eob>
Some called it the gay plague. <eob>
They called for quarantines. <eob>
They wanted to separate the innocent victims <eol> from the rest of us. <eob>
I was afraid <eol> we were losing this battle <eob> because people were blaming us <eol> for being sick. <eob>
Public policy was being held <eol> hostage by stigma and fear, <eob> and also held hostage <eob> were compassion, care, research, <eol> recovery and treatment. <eob>
But we changed all that. <eob> Because out of the pain of those deaths, <eob> we saw a social and political movement. <eob>
AIDS galvanized us into action; <eob> to stand up, to speak up and to act out. <eob>
And it also galvanized the LGBT movement. <eob>
We knew we were in a battle for our lives <eob> because silence equaled death, <eob> but we changed, and we made things happen. <eob>
And right now, we have the potential <eob> to see the end of HIV / AIDS in our lifetime. <eob>
These changes came in no small part <eob> by the courageous, yet simple decision <eob> for people to come out <eob> to their neighbors, to their friends, <eol> to their families <eob> and to their coworkers. <eob>
Years ago, I was a volunteer <eol> for the Names Project. <eob>
This was an effort started <eol> by Cleve Jones in San Francisco <eob> to show that people who died <eol> of AIDS <eob> had names <eob> and faces and families <eob> and people who loved them. <eob>
I still recall unfolding the AIDS <eol> memorial quilt <eob> on the National Mall <eol> on a brilliant day in October, 1988. <eob>
So fast forward to 2015. <eob>
The Supreme Court's decision to strike <eol> down the ban on same-sex marriage. <eob>
My husband, Dave, and I walk <eol> over to the steps of the Supreme Court <eob> to celebrate that decision <eol> with so many other people, <eob> and I couldn't help but think <eol> how far we came around LGBT rights <eob> and yet how far we needed <eol> to go around issues of addiction. <eob>
When I was nominated by President Obama <eob> to be his Director of Drug Policy, <eob> I was very open about my recovery <eol> and about the fact that I was a gay man. <eob>
And at no point during <eol> my confirmation process -- <eob> at least that I know of -- <eob> did the fact that I was a gay man <eol> come to bear on my candidacy <eob> or my fitness to do this job. <eob>
But my addiction did. <eob>
At one point, a congressional staffer said that <eol> there was no way <eob> that I was going to be confirmed by the United States Senate <eob> because of my past, <eob> despite the fact that I had been in recovery <eol> for over 20 years, <eob> and despite the fact <eob> that this job takes a little bit <eol> of knowledge around addiction. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, you know, this is the stigma <eob> that people with substance use disorders <eob> face every single day, <eob> and you know, I have to tell you <eob> it's still why I'm more comfortable <eol> coming out as a gay man <eob> than I am as a person <eol> with a history of addiction. <eob>
Nearly every family in America <eol> is affected by addiction. <eob>
Yet, unfortunately, too often, <eol> it's not talked about openly and honestly. <eob>
It's whispered about. <eob>
It's met with derision and scorn. <eob>
We hear these stories, time and time again, <eol> on TV, online, <eob> we hear it from public officials, <eol> and we hear it from family and friends. <eob>
And those of us with an addiction, <eol> we hear those voices, <eob> and somehow we believe <eol> that we are less deserving of care and treatment. <eob>
Today in the United States, <eol> only one in nine people <eob> get care and treatment for their disorder. <eob> One in nine. <eob> Think about that. <eob>
Generally, people with other diseases <eol> get care and treatment. <eob>
If you have cancer, you get treatment, <eob> if you have diabetes, you get treatment. <eob>
If you have a heart attack, <eob> you get emergency services, <eol> and you get referred to care. <eob>
But somehow people with addiction <eol> have to wait for treatment <eob> or often can't get when they need it. <eob>
And left untreated, addiction has significant, dire consequences. <eob>
And for many people <eol> that means death or incarceration. <eob>
We've been down that road before. <eob>
For too long our country felt <eob> like we could arrest <eol> our way out of this problem. <eob>
But we know that we can't. <eob>
Decades of scientific research <eol> has shown <eob> that this is a medical issue -- <eob> that this is a chronic medical condition <eob> that people inherit and that <eol> people develop. <eob>
So the Obama administration <eol> has taken a different tack on drug policy. <eob>
We've developed and implemented <eol> a comprehensive plan <eob> to expand prevention services, treatment services, <eob> early intervention and recovery support. <eob>
We've pushed criminal justice reform. <eob> We've knocked down barriers <eol> to give people second chances. <eob>
We see public health and public <eol> safety officials working hand in hand <eob> at the community level. <eob>
We see police chiefs across the country <eol> guiding people to treatment <eob> instead of jail and incarceration. <eob>
We see law enforcement <eol> and other first responders <eob> reversing overdoses with naloxone <eol> to give people a second chance for care. <eob>
The Affordable Care Act <eol> is the biggest expansion <eob> of substance use disorder treatment <eol> in a generation, <eob> and it also calls for the integration <eol> of treatment services within primary care. <eob>
But fundamentally, <eol> all of this work is not enough. <eob>
Unless we change the way <eol> that we view people with addiction <eob> in the United States. <eob>
Years ago when I finally understood <eol> that I had a problem <eob> and I knew that I needed help, <eob> I was too afraid to ask for it. <eob>
I felt that people would think I was stupid, <eol> that I was weak-willed, <eob> that I was morally flawed. <eob>
But I talk about my recovery <eol> because I want to make change. <eob>
I want us to see that we need <eol> to be open and candid about who we are <eob> and what we can do. <eob>
I am public about my own recovery <eob> not to be self-congratulatory. <eob>
I am open about my own recovery <eol> to change public opinion, <eob> to change public policy <eob> and to change the course <eol> of this epidemic and empower the millions of Americans <eob> who struggle with this journey <eob> to be open and candid about who they are. <eob>
People are more than their disease. <eob>
And all of us have the opportunity <eol> to change public opinion <eob> and <eob> to change public policy. <eob>
All of us know someone <eol> who has an addiction, <eob> and all of us can do our part <eob> to change how we view people with addiction <eob> in the United States. <eob>
So when you see someone with an addiction, <eob> don't think of a drunk or a junkie <eol> or an addict or an abuser -- <eob> see a person; <eob> offer them help; <eob> give them kindness and compassion. <eob>
And together, we can be part <eob> of a growing movement <eob> in the United States <eob> to change how we view people with addiction. <eob>
Together we can change public policy. <eob>
We can ensure <eol> that people get care when they need it, <eob> just like any other disease. <eob>
We can be part of a growing, <eol> unstoppable movement <eob> to have millions of Americans <eol> enter recovery, <eob> and put an end to this epidemic. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today, I want to tell you <eol> about a pressing social issue. <eob>
Now, it's not nuclear arms, <eob> it's not immigration, <eob> and it's not malaria. <eob>
I'm here to talk about movies. <eob>
Now, in all seriousness, <eol> movies are actually really important. <eob>
In film, we can be wildly entertained, <eob> and we can also be transported <eol> through storytelling. <eob>
Storytelling is so important. <eob>
Stories tell us what societies value, <eob> they offer us lessons, <eob> and they share and preserve our history. <eob> Stories are amazing. <eob>
But stories don't give everyone <eob> the same opportunity <eol> to appear within them, <eob> particularly not stories <eob> compartmentalized <eol> in the form of American movies. <eob>
In film, interestingly enough, <eob> females are still erased and marginalized <eob> in a lot of our stories. <eob>
And I learned this for the first time <eol> about 10 years ago <eob> when I did my first study <eol> on gender role in G-rated films. <eob>
Since then, we've conducted <eol> more than 30 investigations. <eob>
My team is tired. <eob>
And I've committed my life <eob> as researcher and activist <eob> to fighting the inclusion crisis <eob> in Hollywood. <eob>
So today, what I'd like to do <eol> is tell you about that crisis. <eob> I want to talk about <eol> gender inequality in film. <eob> I want to tell you how it is perpetuated, <eob> and then I'm going to tell you <eol> how we're going to fix it. <eob>
However, one caveat before I begin: <eob> my data are really depressing. <eob>
So I want to apologize in advance, <eob> because I'm going to put you all <eol> in a really bad mood. <eob>
But I'm going to bring it up at the end, <eob> and I'm going to present a silver lining <eob> to fix this mess that we've been in <eob> for a very, very long time. <eob>
So, let's start with the gravity <eol> of the situation. <eob>
Each year, my research team <eol> examines the top 100 grossing films <eob> in the United States. <eob>
What we do is we look at every speaking <eol> or named character on-screen. <eob>
Now, to count in one of my investigations, <eob> all a character has to do is say one word. <eob>
This is a very low bar. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies, <eob> from 2007 to 2015, <eob> cataloguing every speaking character <eol> on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity, <eob> LGBT and characters with a disability. <eob>
Let's take a look <eol> at really some problematic trends. <eob>
First, females are still <eol> noticeably absent on-screen in film. <eob>
Across 800 movies <eol> and 35,205 speaking characters, <eob> less than a third of all roles <eol> go to girls and women. <eob>
Less than a third! <eob>
There's been no change <eob> from 2007 to 2015, <eob> and if you compare our results <eob> to a small sample of films from 1946 to 1955, <eob> there's been no change in over a half of a century. <eob>
Over half of a century! <eob>
But we're half of the population. <eob>
Now, if we look at this data <eol> intersectionally, <eob> which has been a focus of today, <eob> the picture becomes even more problematic. <eob>
Across the top 100 films <eol> of just last year, <eob> 48 films didn't feature one black <eol> or African-American speaking character, <eob> not one. <eob>
70 films were devoid of Asian <eol> or Asian-American speaking characters <eob> that were girls or women. <eob> None. <eob> Eighty-four films didn't feature one <eol> female character that had a disability. <eob>
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual <eol> or transgender female speaking characters. <eob>
This is not underrepresentation. <eob> This is erasure, <eob> and I call this <eol> the epidemic of invisibility. <eob>
Now, when we move <eol> from prevalence to protagonist, <eob> the story is still problematic. <eob>
Out of a hundred films last year, <eob> only 32 featured a female lead <eol> or colead driving the action. <eob>
Only three out of a hundred films <eob> featured an underrepresented <eol> female driving the story, <eob> and only one diverse woman <eob> that was 45 years of age or older <eol> at the time of theatrical release. <eob>
Now let's look at portrayal. <eob> In addition to the numbers you just saw, <eob> females are far more likely <eol> to be sexualized in film <eob> than their male counterparts. <eob>
Matter of fact, they're about <eol> three times as likely <eob> to be shown in sexually <eol> revealing clothing, <eob> partially naked, <eob> and they're far more likely to be thin. <eob>
Now, sometimes, in animation, <eol> females are so thin <eob> that their waist size approximates <eol> the circumference of their upper arm. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We like to say that these gals <eol> have no room for a womb <eob> or any other internal organ. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, all joking aside, <eob> theories suggest, research confirms, <eob> exposure to thin ideals <eol> and objectifying content <eob> can lead to body dissatisfaction, <eol> internalization of the thin ideal <eob> and self-objectification <eol> among some female viewers. <eob>
Obviously, what we see on-screen <eob> and what we see in the world, <eob> they do not match. <eob> They do not match! <eob> Matter of fact, <eol> if we lived in the screen world, <eob> we would have a population <eol> crisis on our hands. <eob>
So, as soon as I recognized <eol> these patterns, <eob> I wanted to find out why, <eob> and it turns out that there are <eol> two drivers to inequality on-screen: <eob> content creator gender <eol> and misperceptions of the audience. <eob> Let's unpack them really quick. <eob>
If you want to change <eol> any of the patterns I just talked about, <eob> all you have to do <eol> is hire female directors. <eob>
Turns out, the female directors <eob> are associated with, in terms <eol> of short films and indie films, <eob> more girls and women on-screen, <eob> more stories with women in the center, <eob> more stories with women 40 years of age or older on-screen, <eob> which I think is good news for this crowd. <eob> More underrepresented — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sorry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sorry but not sorry. <eob> More underrepresented characters <eol> in terms of race and ethnicity, <eob> and most importantly, <eob> more women working behind the camera <eob> in key production roles. <eob>
Easy answer to the problems <eol> that we just talked about. <eob> Or is it? <eob> It's actually not. <eob> 800 films, 2007-2015, <eob> 886 directors. <eob> Only 4.1 percent are women. <eob>
Only three are African-American or black, <eob> and only one woman was Asian. <eob>
So why is it so difficult <eob> to have female directors <eob> if they're part of the solution? <eob>
Well, to answer this question, <eob> we conducted a study. <eob>
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders <eob> and asked them about directors. <eob>
Turns out, both male <eol> and female executives, <eob> when they think director, <eob> they think male. <eob>
They perceive the traits of leadership <eob> to be masculine in nature. <eob>
So when they're going to hire a director <eob> to command a crew, lead a ship, <eob> be a visionary or be General Patton, <eob> all the things that we've heard -- <eob> their thoughts and ideations pull male. <eob>
The perception of director or a leader <eob> is inconsistent <eol> with the perception of a woman. <eob>
The roles are incongruous, <eob> which is consistent with a lot of research <eol> in the psychological arena. <eob>
Second factor contributing <eol> to inequality on-screen <eob> is misperceptions of the audience. <eob>
I don't need to tell this crowd: <eob> 50 percent of the people <eol> that go to the box office and buy tickets <eob> are girls and women in this country. <eob> Right? <eob> But we're not perceived to be a viable <eol> or financially lucrative target audience. <eob>
Further, there's some misperceptions <eob> about whether females can open a film. <eob>
Open a film means that if you <eol> place a female at the center, <eob> it doesn't have the return on investment <eob> that if you place a male <eol> at the center of a story does. <eob>
This misperception is actually costly. <eob> Right? <eob> Especially in the wake <eol> of franchise successes <eob> like "The Hunger Games," <eob> "Pitch Perfect" <eob> or that small little indie film, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." <eob> Our own economic analyses show <eol> that gender of the lead character <eob> doesn't play a role <eol> in economic success <eob> in the United States. <eob> But what does? <eob> Production costs alone <eob> or in conjunction <eol> with how widely a film is distributed in this country. <eob>
It's not the gender of the lead character. <eob>
So at this point, we should <eol> all be sufficiently depressed. <eob>
No change in 50 years, <eob> few female directors <eol> working behind the camera <eob> and the entertainment industry <eol> does not trust us as an audience. <eob>
Well, I told you <eol> there would be a silver lining, <eob> and there is. <eob>
There are actually <eol> simple and tangible solutions <eob> to fixing this problem <eob> that involve content creators, <eob> executives and consumers <eob> like the individuals in this room. <eob>
Let's talk about a few of them. <eob>
The first is what I call "just add five." <eob> Did you know if we looked <eol> at the top 100 films next year <eob> and simply added five female <eol> speaking characters on-screen <eob> to each of those films, <eob> it would create a new norm. <eob>
If we were to do this <eol> for three contiguous years, <eob> we would be at gender parity <eob> for the first time <eol> in over a half of a century. <eob>
Now, this approach is advantageous <eol> for a variety of reasons. <eob> One? It doesn't take away jobs <eol> for male actors. <eob> Heaven forbid. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Two, it's actually cost-effective. <eol> It doesn't cost that much. <eob>
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent. <eob>
And four, it humanizes <eol> the production process. <eob> Why? Because it makes sure <eol> that there's women on set. <eob>
Second solution is for A-list talent. <eob>
A-listers, as we all know, <eol> can make demands in their contracts, <eob> particularly the ones that work <eol> on the biggest Hollywood films. <eob>
What if those A-listers <eob> simply added an equity clause <eol> or an inclusion rider <eob> into their contract? <eob>
Now, what does that mean? <eob>
Well, you probably don't know <eob> but the typical feature film <eob> has about 40 to 45 <eol> speaking characters in it. <eob>
I would argue that only 8 to 10 <eol> of those characters <eob> are actually relevant to the story. <eob>
Except maybe "Avengers." <eob> Right? <eob>
A few more in "Avengers." <eob> The remaining 30 or so roles, <eob> there's no reason why those minor roles <eob> can't match or reflect the demography <eob> of where the story is taking place. <eob>
An equity rider by an A-lister <eol> in their contract <eob> can stipulate that those roles <eob> reflect the world <eol> in which we actually live. <eob>
Now, there's no reason why a network, <eob> a studio or a production company <eob> cannot adopt the same contractual language <eob> in their negotiation processes. <eob>
Third solution: <eob> this would be for <eol> the entertainment industry, <eob> Hollywood in particular, <eob> to adopt the Rooney Rule <eob> when it comes to hiring practices <eol> around directors. <eob>
Now, in the NFL, <eol> the Rooney Rule stipulates <eob> that if a team wants to hire a coach <eol> from outside the organization, <eob> what they have to do is interview <eol> an underrepresented candidate. <eob>
The exact same principle <eol> can apply to Hollywood films. <eob> How? <eob> Well, on these top films, <eob> executives and agents can make sure <eob> that women and people of color <eol> are not only on the consideration list, <eob> but they're actually <eol> interviewed for the job. <eob>
Now, one might say, <eob> why is this important? <eob>
Because it exposes or introduces <eol> executives to female directors <eob> who otherwise fall prey <eol> to exclusionary hiring practices. <eob>
The fourth solution <eob> is for consumers like me and you. <eob>
If we want to see more films <eol> by, for and about women, <eob> we have to support them. <eob>
It may mean going <eol> to the independent theater chain <eob> instead of the multiplex. <eob>
Or it might mean scrolling down <eol> a little further online <eob> to find a film by a female director. <eob>
Or it may be writing a check <eol> and funding a film, <eob> particularly by a female director <eol> from an underrepresented background. <eob> Right? <eob> We need to write, call and email companies <eob> that are making <eol> and distributing films, <eob> and we need to post on our social media accounts <eob> when we want to see inclusive representation, <eob> women on-screen, <eob> and most importantly, <eob> women behind the camera. <eob>
We need to make our voices heard <eol> and our dollars count. <eob>
Now, we actually have the ability <eol> to change the world on this one. <eob>
The US and its content, <eob> films in particular, <eob> have captured the imaginations <eol> of audiences worldwide. <eob> Worldwide. <eob> So that means that the film industry <eol> has unprecedented access <eob> to be able to distribute <eol> stories about equality <eob> all around the world. <eob>
Imagine what would happen <eob> if the film industry aligned its values <eob> with what it shows on-screen. <eob>
It could foster inclusion <eob> and acceptance for girls and women, <eob> people of color, <eob> the LGBT community, <eob> individuals with disabilities, <eob> and so many more around the world. <eob>
The only thing that the film industry <eol> has to do is unleash its secret weapon, <eob> and that's storytelling. <eob>
Now, at the beginning of this talk, <eob> I said that films -- <eob> that they can actually transport us, <eob> but I would like to argue <eol> that films, they can transform us. <eob>
None of us in this room <eob> have grown up or experienced <eol> a storytelling landscape <eob> with fully realized female characters, <eob> none of us, <eob> because the numbers haven't changed. <eob>
What would happen <eol> if the next generation of audiences <eob> grew up with a whole <eol> different screen reality? <eob> What would happen? <eob> Well I'm here to tell you today <eob> that it's not only possible <eol> to change what we see on-screen <eob> but I am impatient for it to get here. <eob>
So let's agree to take action today <eob> to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility. <eob>
And let's agree to take action today <eob> to agree that US audiences <eol> and global viewers <eob> demand and deserve more. <eob>
And let's agree today <eob> that the next generation <eol> of viewers and audiences, <eob> that they deserve to see the stories <eob> we were never able to see. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: Hello. <eol> Welcome to this TED Dialogues. <eob> It's the first of a series <eol> that's going to be done <eob> in response to the current <eol> political upheaval. <eob>
I don't know about you; <eob> I've become quite concerned <eol> about the growing divisiveness in this country <eob> and in the world. <eob>
No one's listening to each other. Right? <eob> They aren't. <eob> I mean, it feels like we need <eol> a different kind of conversation, <eob> one that's based on -- I don't know, <eol> on reason, listening, on understanding, <eob> on a broader context. <eob>
That's at least what we're going to try <eol> in these TED Dialogues, <eob> starting today. <eob>
And we couldn't have anyone with us <eob> who I'd be more excited to kick this off. <eob>
This is a mind right here that thinks <eol> pretty much like no one else <eob> on the planet, I would hasten to say. <eob> I'm serious. <eob>
I'm serious. <eob> (Yuval Noah Harari laughs) <eob>
He synthesizes history <eol> with underlying ideas <eob> in a way that kind of takes <eol> your breath away. <eob>
So, some of you will know <eol> this book, "Sapiens." <eob> Has anyone here read "Sapiens"? <eob>
(Applause) <eob> I mean, I could not put it down. <eob>
The way that he tells the story of mankind <eob> through big ideas that really make you <eol> think differently -- <eob> it's kind of amazing. <eob>
And here's the follow-up, <eob> which I think is being published <eol> in the US next week. <eob>
YNH: Yeah, next week. <eob>
CA: "Homo Deus." <eob> Now, this is the history <eol> of the next hundred years. <eob>
I've had a chance to read it. <eob>
It's extremely dramatic, <eob> and I daresay, for some people, <eol> quite alarming. <eob> It's a must-read. <eob> And honestly, we couldn't have <eol> someone better to help <eob> make sense of what on Earth <eol> is happening in the world right now. <eob>
So a warm welcome, please, <eol> to Yuval Noah Harari. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's great to be joined by our friends <eol> on Facebook and around the Web. <eob> Hello, Facebook. <eob> And all of you, as I start <eol> asking questions of Yuval, <eob> come up with your own questions, <eob> and not necessarily about <eol> the political scandal du jour, <eob> but about the broader understanding <eol> of: Where are we heading? <eob> You ready? OK, we're going to go. <eob>
So here we are, Yuval: <eob> New York City, 2017, <eol> there's a new president in power, <eob> and shock waves rippling around the world. <eob>
What on Earth is happening? <eob>
YNH: I think the basic thing that happened <eob> is that we have lost our story. <eob>
Humans think in stories, <eob> and we try to make sense of the world <eol> by telling stories. <eob>
And for the last few decades, <eob> we had a very simple <eol> and very attractive story <eob> about what's happening in the world. <eob>
And the story said that, <eol> oh, what's happening is <eob> that the economy is being globalized, <eob> politics is being liberalized, <eob> and the combination of the two <eol> will create paradise on Earth, <eob> and we just need to keep on <eol> globalizing the economy <eob> and liberalizing the political system, <eob> and everything will be wonderful. <eob>
And 2016 is the moment <eob> when a very large segment, <eol> even of the Western world, <eob> stopped believing in this story. <eob> For good or bad reasons -- <eol> it doesn't matter. <eob>
People stopped believing in the story, <eob> and when you don't have a story, <eol> you don't understand what's happening. <eob>
CA: Part of you believes that that story <eol> was actually a very effective story. <eob> It worked. <eob>
YNH: To some extent, yes. <eob>
According to some measurements, <eob> we are now in the best time ever <eob> for humankind. <eob>
Today, for the first time in history, <eob> more people die from eating too much <eol> than from eating too little, <eob> which is an amazing achievement. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Also for the first time in history, <eob> more people die from old age <eol> than from infectious diseases, <eob> and violence is also down. <eob>
For the first time in history, <eob> more people commit suicide <eol> than are killed by crime and terrorism <eob> and war put together. <eob>
Statistically, you are <eol> your own worst enemy. <eob>
At least, of all the people in the world, <eob> you are most likely to be killed by yourself — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
which is, again, <eol> very good news, compared -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
compared to the level of violence <eol> that we saw in previous eras. <eob>
CA: But this process <eol> of connecting the world <eob> ended up with a large group of people <eol> kind of feeling left out, <eob> and they've reacted. <eob>
And so we have this bombshell <eob> that's sort of ripping <eol> through the whole system. <eob>
I mean, what do you make <eol> of what's happened? <eob>
It feels like the old way <eol> that people thought of politics, <eob> the left-right divide, <eol> has been blown up and replaced. <eob>
How should we think of this? <eob>
YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-century <eol> political model of left versus right <eob> is now largely irrelevant, <eob> and the real divide today is between <eol> global and national, <eob> global or local. <eob>
And you see it again all over the world <eob> that this is now the main struggle. <eob>
We probably need completely <eol> new political models <eob> and completely new ways <eol> of thinking about politics. <eob>
In essence, what you can say <eol> is that we now have global ecology, <eob> we have a global economy <eol> but we have national politics, <eob> and this doesn't work together. <eob>
This makes the political <eol> system ineffective, <eob> because it has no control <eol> over the forces that shape our life. <eob>
And you have basically two solutions <eol> to this imbalance: <eob> either de-globalize the economy <eol> and turn it back into a national economy, <eob> or globalize the political system. <eob>
CA: So some, I guess <eol> many liberals out there <eob> view Trump and his government <eol> as kind of irredeemably bad, <eob> just awful in every way. <eob>
Do you see any underlying narrative <eol> or political philosophy in there <eob> that is at least worth understanding? <eob>
How would you articulate that philosophy? <eob>
Is it just the philosophy of nationalism? <eob>
YNH: I think the underlying feeling or idea <eob> is that the political system — something is broken there. <eob>
It doesn't empower <eol> the ordinary person anymore. <eob>
It doesn't care so much <eol> about the ordinary person anymore, <eob> and I think this diagnosis <eol> of the political disease is correct. <eob>
With regard to the answers, <eol> I am far less certain. <eob>
I think what we are seeing <eol> is the immediate human reaction: <eob> if something doesn't work, let's go back. <eob>
And you see it all over the world, <eob> that people, almost nobody <eol> in the political system today, <eob> has any future-oriented vision <eol> of where humankind is going. <eob>
Almost everywhere, you see <eol> retrograde vision: <eob> "Let's make America great again," <eob> like it was great — I don't know — in the '50s, in the' 80s, sometime, <eob> let's go back there. <eob>
And you go to Russia <eol> a hundred years after Lenin, <eob> Putin's vision for the future <eob> is basically, ah, let's go back <eol> to the Tsarist empire. <eob> And in Israel, where I come from, <eob> the hottest political vision <eol> of the present is: <eob> "Let's build the temple again." <eob> So let's go back 2,000 years backwards. <eob>
So people are thinking <eol> sometime in the past we've lost it, <eob> and sometimes in the past, it's like <eol> you've lost your way in the city, <eob> and you say OK, let's go back <eol> to the point where I felt secure <eob> and start again. <eob>
I don't think this can work, <eob> but a lot of people, <eol> this is their gut instinct. <eob>
CA: But why couldn't it work? <eob> "America First" is a very <eol> appealing slogan in many ways. <eob>
Patriotism is, in many ways, <eol> a very noble thing. <eob>
It's played a role <eol> in promoting cooperation <eob> among large numbers of people. <eob>
Why couldn't you have a world <eol> organized in countries, <eob> all of which put themselves first? <eob>
YNH: For many centuries, <eol> even thousands of years, <eob> patriotism worked quite well. <eob>
Of course, it led to wars an so forth, <eob> but we shouldn't focus <eol> too much on the bad. <eob>
There are also many, <eol> many positive things about patriotism, <eob> and the ability to have <eol> a large number of people <eob> care about each other, <eob> sympathize with one another, <eob> and come together for collective action. <eob>
If you go back to the first nations, <eob> so, thousands of years ago, <eob> the people who lived along <eol> the Yellow River in China -- <eob> it was many, many different tribes <eob> and they all depended on the river <eol> for survival and for prosperity, <eob> but all of them also suffered <eol> from periodical floods <eob> and periodical droughts. <eob>
And no tribe could really do <eol> anything about it, <eob> because each of them controlled <eol> just a tiny section of the river. <eob>
And then in a long <eol> and complicated process, <eob> the tribes coalesced together <eol> to form the Chinese nation, <eob> which controlled the entire Yellow River <eob> and had the ability to bring <eol> hundreds of thousands of people together <eob> to build dams and canals <eol> and regulate the river <eob> and prevent the worst floods and droughts <eob> and raise the level <eol> of prosperity for everybody. <eob>
And this worked in many places <eol> around the world. <eob> But in the 21st century, <eob> technology is changing all that <eol> in a fundamental way. <eob>
We are now living -- all people <eol> in the world -- <eob> are living alongside the same cyber river, <eob> and no single nation can regulate <eol> this river by itself. <eob>
We are all living together <eol> on a single planet, <eob> which is threatened by our own actions. <eob>
And if you don't have some kind <eol> of global cooperation, <eob> nationalism is just not on the right level <eol> to tackle the problems, <eob> whether it's climate change <eol> or whether it's technological disruption. <eob>
CA: So it was a beautiful idea <eob> in a world where most of the action, <eol> most of the issues, <eob> took place on national scale, <eob> but your argument is that the issues <eol> that matter most today <eob> no longer take place on a national scale <eol> but on a global scale. <eob>
YNH: Exactly. All the major problems <eol> of the world today <eob> are global in essence, <eob> and they cannot be solved <eob> unless through some kind <eol> of global cooperation. <eob>
It's not just climate change, <eob> which is, like, the most obvious <eol> example people give. <eob>
I think more in terms <eol> of technological disruption. <eob>
If you think about, for example, <eol> artificial intelligence, <eob> over the next 20, 30 years <eob> pushing hundreds of millions of people <eol> out of the job market -- <eob> this is a problem on a global level. <eob>
It will disrupt the economy <eol> of all the countries. <eob>
And similarly, if you think <eol> about, say, bioengineering <eob> and people being afraid of conducting, <eob> I don't know, genetic engineering <eol> research in humans, <eob> it won't help if just <eol> a single country, let's say the US, <eob> outlaws all genetic experiments in humans, <eob> but China or North Korea <eol> continues to do it. <eob>
So the US cannot solve it by itself, <eob> and very quickly, the pressure on the US <eol> to do the same will be immense <eob> because we are talking about <eol> high-risk, high-gain technologies. <eob>
If somebody else is doing it, <eol> I can't allow myself to remain behind. <eob>
The only way to have regulations, <eol> effective regulations, <eob> on things like genetic engineering, <eob> is to have global regulations. <eob>
If you just have national regulations, <eol> nobody would like to stay behind. <eob>
CA: So this is really interesting. <eob>
It seems to me that this may be one key <eob> to provoking at least <eol> a constructive conversation <eob> between the different sides here, <eob> because I think everyone can agree <eol> that the start point <eob> of a lot of the anger <eol> that's propelled us to where we are <eob> is because of the legitimate <eol> concerns about job loss. <eob>
Work is gone, a traditional <eol> way of life has gone, <eob> and it's no wonder <eol> that people are furious about that. <eob>
And in general, they have blamed <eol> globalism, global elites, <eob> for doing this to them <eol> without asking their permission, <eob> and that seems like <eol> a legitimate complaint. <eob>
But what I hear you saying <eol> is that -- so a key question is: <eob> What is the real cause of job loss, <eol> both now and going forward? <eob>
To the extent that it's about globalism, <eob> then the right response, <eol> yes, is to shut down borders <eob> and keep people out <eol> and change trade agreements and so forth. <eob> But you're saying, I think, <eob> that actually the bigger cause of job loss <eol> is not going to be that at all. <eob>
It's going to originate <eol> in technological questions, <eob> and we have no chance of solving that <eob> unless we operate as a connected world. <eob>
YNH: Yeah, I think that, <eob> I don't know about the present, <eol> but looking to the future, <eob> it's not the Mexicans or Chinese <eol> who will take the jobs <eob> from the people in Pennsylvania, <eob> it's the robots and algorithms. <eob>
So unless you plan to build a big wall <eol> on the border of California -- <eob>
the wall on the border with Mexico <eol> is going to be very ineffective. <eob>
And I was struck when I watched <eol> the debates before the election, <eob> I was struck that certainly Trump <eol> did not even attempt to frighten people <eob> by saying the robots will take your jobs. <eob> Now even if it's not true, <eol> it doesn't matter. <eob>
It could have been an extremely <eol> effective way of frightening people -- <eob>
and galvanizing people: <eob> "The robots will take your jobs!" <eob> And nobody used that line. <eob>
And it made me afraid, <eob> because it meant that no matter what happens <eob> in universities and laboratories, <eob> and there, there is already <eol> an intense debate about it, <eob> but in the mainstream political <eol> system and among the general public, <eob> people are just unaware <eob> that there could be an immense technological disruption — <eob> not in 200 years, <eol> but in 10, 20, 30 years — <eob> and we have to do something about it now, <eob> partly because most of what we teach children <eol> today in school or in college <eob> is going to be completely irrelevant to the job market of 2040, 2050. <eob>
So it's not something we'll need <eol> to think about in 2040. <eob>
We need to think today <eol> what to teach the young people. <eob>
CA: Yeah, no, absolutely. <eob>
You've often written about <eol> moments in history <eob> where humankind has ... <eol> entered a new era, unintentionally. <eob>
Decisions have been made, <eol> technologies have been developed, <eob> and suddenly the world has changed, <eob> possibly in a way <eol> that's worse for everyone. <eob>
So one of the examples <eol> you give in "Sapiens" <eob> is just the whole agricultural revolution, <eob> which, for an actual person <eol> tilling the fields, <eob> they just picked up a 12-hour <eol> backbreaking workday <eob> instead of six hours in the jungle <eol> and a much more interesting lifestyle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So are we at another possible <eol> phase change here, <eob> where we kind of sleepwalk into a future <eol> that none of us actually wants? <eob>
YNH: Yes, very much so. <eob>
During the agricultural revolution, <eob> what happened is that immense <eol> technological and economic revolution <eob> empowered the human collective, <eob> but when you look at actual <eol> individual lives, <eob> the life of a tiny elite <eol> became much better, <eob> and the lives of the majority of people <eol> became considerably worse. <eob>
And this can happen again <eol> in the 21st century. <eob>
No doubt the new technologies <eol> will empower the human collective. <eob>
But we may end up again <eob> with a tiny elite reaping <eol> all the benefits, taking all the fruits, <eob> and the masses of the population <eol> finding themselves worse <eob> than they were before, <eob> certainly much worse than this tiny elite. <eob>
CA: And those elites <eol> might not even be human elites. <eob>
They might be cyborgs or -- <eob>
YNH: Yeah, they could be <eol> enhanced super humans. <eob> They could be cyborgs. <eob>
They could even be <eol> non-conscious algorithms. <eob> What we see now in the world <eol> is authority shifting away <eob> from humans to algorithms. <eob>
More and more decisions -- <eol> about personal lives, <eob> about economic matters, <eol> about political matters -- <eob> are actually being taken by algorithms. <eob>
If you ask the bank for a loan, <eob> chances are your fate is decided <eol> by an algorithm, not by a human being. <eob>
And the general impression <eol> is that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it. <eob>
The world is so complicated, <eol> there is so much data, <eob> things are changing so fast, <eob> that this thing that evolved <eol> on the African savanna <eob> tens of thousands of years ago -- <eob> to cope with a particular environment, <eob> a particular volume <eol> of information and data -- <eob> it just can't handle the realities <eol> of the 21st century, <eob> and the only thing <eol> that may be able to handle it <eob> is big-data algorithms. <eob>
So no wonder more and more authority <eol> is shifting from us to the algorithms. <eob>
CA: So we're in New York City <eol> for the first of a series of TED Dialogues <eob> with Yuval Harari, <eob> and there's a Facebook Live <eol> audience out there. <eob>
We're excited to have you with us. <eob>
We'll start coming <eol> to some of your questions <eob> and questions of people in the room <eob> in just a few minutes, <eob> so have those coming. <eob>
Yuval, if you're going <eol> to make the argument <eob> that we need to get past nationalism <eol> because of the coming technological ... <eob> danger, in a way, <eob> presented by so much of what's happening <eob> we've got to have <eol> a global conversation about this. <eob>
Trouble is, it's hard to get <eol> people really believing that, I don't know, <eob> AI really is an imminent threat, and so forth. <eob>
The things that people, <eol> some people at least, <eob> care about much more immediately, perhaps, <eob> is climate change, <eob> perhaps other issues like refugees, <eol> nuclear weapons, and so forth. <eob> Would you argue that where <eol> we are right now <eob> that somehow those issues <eol> need to be dialed up? <eob>
You've talked about climate change, <eob> but Trump has said <eol> he doesn't believe in that. <eob>
So in a way, your most powerful argument, <eob> you can't actually use to make this case. <eob>
YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change, <eob> at first sight, it's quite surprising <eob> that there is a very close correlation <eob> between nationalism and climate change. <eob>
I mean, almost always, the people <eol> who deny climate change are nationalists. <eob>
And at first sight, you think: Why? <eob>
What's the connection? <eob>
Why don't you have socialists <eol> denying climate change? <eob>
But then, when you think <eol> about it, it's obvious -- <eob> because nationalism has no solution <eol> to climate change. <eob>
If you want to be a nationalist <eol> in the 21st century, <eob> you have to deny the problem. <eob>
If you accept the reality of the problem, <eol> then you must accept that, yes, <eob> there is still room in the world <eol> for patriotism, <eob> there is still room in the world <eol> for having special loyalties <eob> and obligations towards your own people, <eol> towards your own country. <eob>
I don't think anybody is really <eol> thinking of abolishing that. <eob>
But in order to confront climate change, <eob> we need additional loyalties <eol> and commitments <eob> to a level beyond the nation. <eob>
And that should not be impossible, <eob> because people can have <eol> several layers of loyalty. <eob>
You can be loyal to your family <eob> and to your community <eob> and to your nation, <eob> so why can't you also be loyal <eol> to humankind as a whole? <eob>
Of course, there are occasions <eol> when it becomes difficult, <eob> what to put first, <eob> but, you know, life is difficult. <eob> Handle it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: OK, so I would love to get <eol> some questions from the audience here. <eob>
We've got a microphone here. <eob>
Speak into it, and Facebook, <eol> get them coming, too. <eob>
Howard Morgan: One of the things that has <eol> clearly made a huge difference <eob> in this country and other countries <eob> is the income distribution inequality, <eob> the dramatic change <eol> in income distribution in the US <eob> from what it was 50 years ago, <eob> and around the world. <eob>
Is there anything we can do <eol> to affect that? <eob>
Because that gets at a lot <eol> of the underlying causes. <eob>
YNH: So far I haven't heard a very good idea <eol> about what to do about it, <eob> again, partly because most ideas <eol> remain on the national level, <eob> and the problem is global. <eob>
I mean, one idea that we hear <eol> quite a lot about now <eob> is universal basic income. <eob>
But this is a problem. <eob>
I mean, I think it's a good start, <eob> but it's a problematic idea because <eol> it's not clear what "universal" is <eob> and it's not clear what "basic" is. <eob>
Most people when they speak <eol> about universal basic income, <eob> they actually mean national basic income. <eob>
But the problem is global. <eob>
Let's say that you have AI and 3D printers <eol> taking away millions of jobs <eob> in Bangladesh, <eob> from all the people who make <eol> my shirts and my shoes. <eob> So what's going to happen? <eob> The US government will levy taxes <eol> on Google and Apple in California, <eob> and use that to pay basic income <eol> to unemployed Bangladeshis? <eob>
If you believe that, <eol> you can just as well believe <eob> that Santa Claus will come <eol> and solve the problem. <eob>
So unless we have really universal <eol> and not national basic income, <eob> the deep problems <eol> are not going to go away. <eob>
And also it's not clear what basic is, <eob> because what are basic human needs? <eob>
A thousand years ago, <eol> just food and shelter was enough. <eob>
But today, people will say education <eol> is a basic human need, <eob> it should be part of the package. <eob> But how much? Six years? <eol> Twelve years? PhD? <eob> Similarly, with health care, <eob> let's say that in 20, 30, 40 years, <eob> you'll have expensive treatments <eol> that can extend human life <eob> to 120, I don't know. <eob>
Will this be part of the basket <eol> of basic income or not? <eob>
It's a very difficult problem, <eob> because in a world where people <eol> lose their ability to be employed, <eob> the only thing they are going to get <eol> is this basic income. <eob>
So what's part of it is a very, <eol> very difficult ethical question. <eob>
CA: There's a bunch of questions <eol> on how the world affords it as well, <eob> who pays. <eob>
There's a question here <eol> from Facebook from Lisa Larson: <eob> "How does nationalism in the US now <eob> compare to that between <eol> World War I and World War II <eob> in the last century?" <eob>
YNH: Well the good news, with regard <eol> to the dangers of nationalism, <eob> we are in a much better position <eol> than a century ago. <eob>
A century ago, 1917, <eob> Europeans were killing <eol> each other by the millions. <eob>
In 2016, with Brexit, <eol> as far as I remember, <eob> a single person lost their life, <eol> an MP who was murdered by some extremist. <eob> Just a single person. <eob> I mean, if Brexit was about <eol> British independence, <eob> this is the most peaceful <eol> war of independence in human history. <eob>
And let's say that Scotland <eol> will now choose to leave the UK <eob> after Brexit. <eob>
So in the 18th century, <eob> if Scotland wanted — and the Scots wanted several times — <eob> to break out of the control of London, <eob> the reaction of the government <eol> in London was to send an army up north <eob> to burn down Edinburgh <eol> and massacre the highland tribes. <eob>
My guess is that if, in 2018, <eol> the Scots vote for independence, <eob> the London government <eol> will not send an army up north <eob> to burn down Edinburgh. <eob>
Very few people are now willing <eol> to kill or be killed <eob> for Scottish or for British independence. <eob>
So for all the talk <eol> of the rise of nationalism <eob> and going back to the 1930s, <eob> to the 19th century, in the West at least, <eob> the power of national sentiments <eol> today is far, far smaller <eob> than it was a century ago. <eob>
CA: Although some people now, <eol> you hear publicly worrying <eob> about whether that might be shifting, <eob> that there could actually be <eol> outbreaks of violence in the US <eob> depending on how things turn out. <eob>
Should we be worried about that, <eob> or do you really think <eol> things have shifted? <eob>
YNH: No, we should be worried. <eob> We should be aware of two things. <eob>
First of all, don't be hysterical. <eob>
We are not back <eol> in the First World War yet. <eob>
But on the other hand, <eol> don't be complacent. <eob>
We reached from 1917 to 2017, <eob> not by some divine miracle, <eob> but simply by human decisions, <eob> and if we now start making <eol> the wrong decisions, <eob> we could be back <eol> in an analogous situation to 1917 <eob> in a few years. <eob>
One of the things I know as a historian <eob> is that you should never <eol> underestimate human stupidity. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's one of the most powerful <eol> forces in history, <eob> human stupidity and human violence. <eob>
Humans do such crazy things <eol> for no obvious reason, <eob> but again, at the same time, <eob> another very powerful force <eol> in human history is human wisdom. <eob> We have both. <eob>
CA: We have with us here <eol> moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, <eob> who I think has a question. <eob>
Jonathan Haidt: Thanks, Yuval. <eob>
So you seem to be a fan <eol> of global governance, <eob> but when you look at the map of the world <eol> from Transparency International, <eob> which rates the level of corruption <eol> of political institutions, <eob> it's a vast sea of red with little bits <eol> of yellow here and there <eob> for those with good institutions. <eob>
So if we were to have <eol> some kind of global governance, <eob> what makes you think it would end up <eol> being more like Denmark <eob> rather than more like Russia or Honduras, <eob> and aren't there alternatives, <eob> such as we did with CFCs? <eob>
There are ways to solve global problems <eol> with national governments. <eob>
What would world government <eol> actually look like, <eob> and why do you think it would work? <eob>
YNH: Well, I don't know <eol> what it would look like. <eob>
Nobody still has a model for that. <eob>
The main reason we need it <eob> is because many of these issues <eol> are lose-lose situations. <eob>
When you have <eol> a win-win situation like trade, <eob> both sides can benefit <eol> from a trade agreement, <eob> then this is something you can work out. <eob>
Without some kind of global government, <eob> national governments each <eol> have an interest in doing it. <eob>
But when you have a lose-lose situation <eol> like with climate change, <eob> it's much more difficult <eob> without some overarching <eol> authority, real authority. <eob>
Now, how to get there <eol> and what would it look like, <eob> I don't know. <eob>
And certainly there is no obvious reason <eob> to think that it would look like Denmark, <eob> or that it would be a democracy. <eob>
Most likely it wouldn't. <eob>
We don't have workable democratic models <eob> for a global government. <eob>
So maybe it would look more <eol> like ancient China <eob> than like modern Denmark. <eob>
But still, given the dangers <eol> that we are facing, <eob> I think the imperative of having <eol> some kind of real ability <eob> to force through difficult decisions <eol> on the global level <eob> is more important <eol> than almost anything else. <eob>
CA: There's a question from Facebook here, <eob> and then we'll get the mic to Andrew. <eob>
So, Kat Hebron on Facebook, <eob> calling in from Vail: <eob> "How would developed nations manage <eol> the millions of climate migrants?" <eob>
YNH: <eob> I don't know. <eob>
CA: That's your answer, Kat. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
YNH: And I don't think <eol> that they know either. <eob>
They'll just deny the problem, maybe. <eob>
CA: But immigration, generally, <eol> is another example of a problem <eob> that's very hard to solve <eol> on a nation-by-nation basis. <eob>
One nation can shut its doors, <eob> but maybe that stores up <eol> problems for the future. <eob>
YNH: Yes, I mean — it's another very good case, <eob> especially because it's so much easier <eob> to migrate today <eob> than it was in the Middle Ages <eol> or in ancient times. <eob>
CA: Yuval, there's a belief <eol> among many technologists, certainly, <eob> that political concerns <eol> are kind of overblown, <eob> that actually, political leaders <eol> don't have that much influence <eob> in the world, <eob> that the real determination <eol> of humanity at this point is by science, <eob> by invention, by companies, <eob> by many things other than political leaders, <eob> and it's actually very hard for leaders to do much, <eob> so we're actually worrying about nothing here. <eob>
YNH: Well, first, it should be emphasized <eob> that it's true that political leaders' <eol> ability to do good is very limited, <eob> but their ability to do harm <eol> is unlimited. <eob>
There is a basic imbalance here. <eob>
You can still press the button <eol> and blow everybody up. <eob>
You have that kind of ability. <eob>
But if you want, for example, <eol> to reduce inequality, <eob> that's very, very difficult. <eob>
But to start a war, <eob> you can still do so very easily. <eob>
So there is a built-in imbalance <eol> in the political system today <eob> which is very frustrating, <eob> where you cannot do a lot of good <eol> but you can still do a lot of harm. <eob>
And this makes the political system <eol> still a very big concern. <eob>
CA: So as you look at <eol> what's happening today, <eob> and putting your historian's hat on, <eob> do you look back in history at moments <eol> when things were going just fine <eob> and an individual leader really took <eol> the world or their country backwards? <eob>
YNH: There are quite a few examples, <eob> but I should emphasize, <eol> it's never an individual leader. <eob>
I mean, somebody put him there, <eob> and somebody allowed him <eol> to continue to be there. <eob>
So it's never really just the fault <eol> of a single individual. <eob>
There are a lot of people <eol> behind every such individual. <eob>
CA: Can we have the microphone <eol> here, please, to Andrew? <eob>
Andrew Solomon: You've talked a lot <eol> about the global versus the national, <eob> but increasingly, it seems to me, <eob> the world situation <eol> is in the hands of identity groups. <eob>
We look at people within the United States <eob> who have been recruited by ISIS. <eob>
We look at these other groups <eol> which have formed <eob> which go outside of national bounds <eob> but still represent <eol> significant authorities. <eob>
How are they to be integrated <eol> into the system, <eob> and how is a diverse set of identities <eol> to be made coherent <eob> under either national <eol> or global leadership? <eob>
YNH: Well, the problem <eol> of such diverse identities <eob> is a problem from nationalism as well. <eob>
Nationalism believes <eol> in a single, monolithic identity, <eob> and exclusive or at least <eol> more extreme versions of nationalism <eob> believe in an exclusive loyalty <eol> to a single identity. <eob>
And therefore, nationalism has had <eol> a lot of problems <eob> with people wanting to divide <eol> their identities <eob> between various groups. <eob>
So it's not just a problem, say, <eol> for a global vision. <eob>
And I think, again, history shows <eob> that you shouldn't necessarily <eol> think in such exclusive terms. <eob>
If you think that there is just <eol> a single identity for a person, <eob> "I am just X, that's it, I can't be <eol> several things, I can be just that," <eob> that's the start of the problem. <eob>
You have religions, you have nations <eob> that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty, <eob> but it's not the only option. <eob>
There are many religions and many nations <eob> that enable you to have <eol> diverse identities at the same time. <eob>
CA: But is one explanation <eol> of what's happened in the last year <eob> that a group of people <eol> have got fed up with, if you like, <eob> the liberal elites, <eol> for want of a better term, <eob> obsessing over many, many different identities <eol> and them feeling, <eob> "But what about my identity? <eob>
I am being completely ignored here. <eob>
And by the way, I thought <eol> I was the majority"? <eob>
And that that's actually <eol> sparked a lot of the anger. <eob>
YNH: Yeah. Identity <eol> is always problematic, <eob> because identity <eol> is always based on fictional stories <eob> that sooner or later <eol> collide with reality. <eob>
Almost all identities, <eob> I mean, beyond the level <eol> of the basic community <eob> of a few dozen people, <eob> are based on a fictional story. <eob>
They are not the truth. <eob>
They are not the reality. <eob>
It's just a story that people invent <eol> and tell one another <eob> and start believing. <eob>
And therefore all identities <eol> are extremely unstable. <eob>
They are not a biological reality. <eob>
Sometimes nationalists, for example, <eob> think that the nation <eol> is a biological entity. <eob>
It's made of the combination <eol> of soil and blood, <eob> creates the nation. <eob>
But this is just a fictional story. <eob>
CA: Soil and blood <eol> kind of makes a gooey mess. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
YNH: It does, and also <eol> it messes with your mind <eob> when you think too much that I am <eol> a combination of soil and blood. <eob>
If you look from a biological perspective, <eob> obviously none of the nations <eol> that exist today <eob> existed 5,000 years ago. <eob>
Homo sapiens is a social animal, <eol> that's for sure. <eob>
But for millions of years, <eob> Homo sapiens and our hominid ancestors <eol> lived in small communities <eob> of a few dozen individuals. <eob>
Everybody knew everybody else. <eob>
Whereas modern nations <eol> are imagined communities, <eob> in the sense that I don't even know <eol> all these people. <eob>
I come from a relatively <eol> small nation, Israel, <eob> and of eight million Israelis, <eob> I never met most of them. <eob>
I will never meet most of them. <eob>
They basically exist here. <eob>
CA: But in terms of this identity, <eob> this group who feel left out <eol> and perhaps have work taken away, <eob> I mean, in "Homo Deus," <eob> you actually speak of this group <eol> in one sense expanding, <eob> that so many people <eol> may have their jobs taken away <eob> by technology in some way <eol> that we could end up with <eob> a really large -- I think you call it <eol> a "useless class" -- <eob> a class where traditionally, <eob> as viewed by the economy, <eol> these people have no use. <eob>
YNH: Yes. <eob>
CA: How likely a possibility is that? <eob>
Is that something <eol> we should be terrified about? <eob>
And can we address it in any way? <eob>
YNH: We should think <eol> about it very carefully. <eob>
I mean, nobody really knows <eol> what the job market will look like <eob> in 2040, 2050. <eob>
There is a chance <eol> many new jobs will appear, <eob> but it's not certain. <eob>
And even if new jobs do appear, <eob> it won't necessarily be easy <eob> for a 50-year old unemployed truck driver <eob> made unemployed by self-driving vehicles, <eob> it won't be easy <eol> for an unemployed truck driver <eob> to reinvent himself or herself <eol> as a designer of virtual worlds. <eob>
Previously, if you look at the trajectory <eol> of the industrial revolution, <eob> when machines replaced humans <eol> in one type of work, <eob> the solution usually came <eol> from low-skill work <eob> in new lines of business. <eob>
So you didn't need any more <eol> agricultural workers, <eob> so people moved to working <eol> in low-skill industrial jobs, <eob> and when this was taken away <eol> by more and more machines, <eob> people moved to low-skill service jobs. <eob>
Now, when people say there will <eol> be new jobs in the future, <eob> that humans can do better than AI, <eob> that humans can do better than robots, <eob> they usually think about high-skill jobs, <eob> like software engineers <eol> designing virtual worlds. <eob>
Now, I don't see how <eol> an unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart <eob> reinvents herself or himself at 50 <eol> as a designer of virtual worlds, <eob> and certainly I don't see <eob> how the millions of unemployed <eol> Bangladeshi textile workers <eob> will be able to do that. <eob>
I mean, if they are going to do it, <eob> we need to start teaching <eol> the Bangladeshis today <eob> how to be software designers, <eob> and we are not doing it. <eob>
So what will they do in 20 years? <eob>
CA: So it feels like you're really <eol> highlighting a question <eob> that's really been bugging me <eol> the last few months more and more. <eob>
It's almost a hard question <eol> to ask in public, <eob> but if any mind has some wisdom <eol> to offer in it, maybe it's yours, <eob> so I'm going to ask you: <eob> What are humans for? <eob>
YNH: As far as we know, for nothing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I mean, there is no great cosmic drama, <eol> some great cosmic plan, <eob> that we have a role to play in. <eob>
And we just need to discover <eol> what our role is <eob> and then play it to the best <eol> of our ability. <eob>
This has been the story of all religions <eol> and ideologies and so forth, <eob> but as a scientist, the best I can say <eol> is this is not true. <eob>
There is no universal drama <eol> with a role in it for Homo sapiens. <eob> So — <eob>
CA: I'm going to push back on you <eol> just for a minute, <eob> just from your own book, <eob> because in "Homo Deus," <eob> you give really one of the most coherent <eol> and understandable accounts <eob> about sentience, about consciousness, <eob> and that unique sort of human skill. <eob>
You point out that it's different <eol> from intelligence, <eob> the intelligence <eol> that we're building in machines, <eob> and that there's actually a lot <eol> of mystery around it. <eob>
How can you be sure there's no purpose <eob> when we don't even understand <eol> what this sentience thing is? <eob>
I mean, in your own thinking, <eol> isn't there a chance <eob> that what humans are for <eol> is to be the universe's sentient things, <eob> to be the centers of joy and love <eol> and happiness and hope? <eob>
And maybe we can build machines <eol> that actually help amplify that, <eob> even if they're not going to become <eol> sentient themselves? <eob> Is that crazy? <eob> I kind of found myself hoping that, <eol> reading your book. <eob>
YNH: Well, I certainly think <eol> that the most interesting question today in science <eob> is the question of consciousness <eol> and the mind. <eob>
We are getting better and better <eol> in understanding the brain <eob> and intelligence, <eob> but we are not getting much better <eob> in understanding the mind <eol> and consciousness. <eob>
People often confuse intelligence <eol> and consciousness, <eob> especially in places like Silicon Valley, <eob> which is understandable, <eol> because in humans, they go together. <eob>
I mean, intelligence basically <eol> is the ability to solve problems. <eob>
Consciousness is the ability <eol> to feel things, <eob> to feel joy and sadness <eol> and boredom and pain and so forth. <eob>
In Homo sapiens and all other mammals <eol> as well -- it's not unique to humans -- <eob> in all mammals and birds <eol> and some other animals, <eob> intelligence and consciousness <eol> go together. <eob>
We often solve problems by feeling things. <eob>
So we tend to confuse them. <eob>
But they are different things. <eob>
What's happening today <eol> in places like Silicon Valley <eob> is that we are creating <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> but not artificial consciousness. <eob>
There has been an amazing development <eol> in computer intelligence <eob> over the last 50 years, <eob> and exactly zero development <eol> in computer consciousness, <eob> and there is no indication that computers <eol> are going to become conscious <eob> anytime soon. <eob>
So first of all, if there is <eol> some cosmic role for consciousness, <eob> it's not unique to Homo sapiens. <eob>
Cows are conscious, pigs are conscious, <eob> chimpanzees are conscious, <eol> chickens are conscious, <eob> so if we go that way, first of all, <eol> we need to broaden our horizons <eob> and remember very clearly we are not <eol> the only sentient beings on Earth, <eob> and when it comes to sentience -- <eob> when it comes to intelligence, <eol> there is good reason to think <eob> we are the most intelligent <eol> of the whole bunch. <eob>
But when it comes to sentience, <eob> to say that humans are more <eol> sentient than whales, <eob> or more sentient than baboons <eol> or more sentient than cats, <eob> I see no evidence for that. <eob>
So first step is, you go <eol> in that direction, expand. <eob>
And then the second question <eol> of what is it for, <eob> I would reverse it <eob> and I would say that I don't think <eol> sentience is for anything. <eob>
I think we don't need <eol> to find our role in the universe. <eob>
The really important thing <eol> is to liberate ourselves from suffering. <eob>
What characterizes sentient beings <eob> in contrast to robots, to stones, <eob> to whatever, <eob> is that sentient beings <eol> suffer, can suffer, <eob> and what they should focus on <eob> is not finding their place <eol> in some mysterious cosmic drama. <eob>
They should focus on understanding <eol> what suffering is, <eob> what causes it and how <eol> to be liberated from it. <eob>
CA: I know this is a big issue for you, <eol> and that was very eloquent. <eob>
We're going to have a blizzard <eol> of questions from the audience here, <eob> and maybe from Facebook as well, <eob> and maybe some comments as well. <eob> So let's go quick. <eob> There's one right here. <eob>
Keep your hands held up <eol> at the back if you want the mic, <eob> and we'll get it back to you. <eob>
Question: In your work, you talk a lot <eol> about the fictional stories <eob> that we accept as truth, <eob> and we live our lives by it. <eob>
As an individual, knowing that, <eob> how does it impact the stories <eol> that you choose to live your life, <eob> and do you confuse them <eol> with the truth, like all of us? <eob>
YNH: I try not to. <eob>
I mean, for me, maybe <eol> the most important question, <eob> both as a scientist and as a person, <eob> is how to tell the difference <eol> between fiction and reality, <eob> because reality is there. <eob>
I'm not saying that everything is fiction. <eob>
It's just very difficult <eol> for human beings to tell the difference <eob> between fiction and reality, <eob> and it has become more and more difficult <eol> as history progressed, <eob> because the fictions that we have created — <eob> nations and gods <eol> and money and corporations — <eob> they now control the world. <eob>
So just to even think, <eob> "Oh, this is just all fictional entities <eol> that we've created," <eob> is very difficult. <eob>
But reality is there. <eob>
For me the best... <eob> There are several tests <eob> to tell the difference <eob> between fiction and reality. <eob>
The simplest one, the best one <eol> that I can say in short, <eob> is the test of suffering. <eob>
If it can suffer, it's real. <eob>
If it can't suffer, it's not real. <eob>
A nation cannot suffer. <eob>
That's very, very clear. <eob>
Even if a nation loses a war, <eob> we say, "Germany suffered a defeat <eol> in the First World War," <eob> it's a metaphor. <eob> Germany cannot suffer. <eol> Germany has no mind. <eob>
Germany has no consciousness. <eob>
Germans can suffer, yes, <eol> but Germany cannot. <eob>
Similarly, when a bank goes bust, <eob> the bank cannot suffer. <eob>
When the dollar loses its value, <eol> the dollar doesn't suffer. <eob> People can suffer. Animals can suffer. <eob> This is real. <eob> So I would start, if you <eol> really want to see reality, <eob> I would go through the door of suffering. <eob>
If you can really understand <eol> what suffering is, <eob> this will give you also the key <eob> to understand what reality is. <eob>
CA: There's a Facebook question <eol> here that connects to this, <eob> from someone around the world <eol> in a language that I cannot read. <eob>
YNH: Oh, it's Hebrew. CA: Hebrew. There you go. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Can you read the name? <eob>
YNH: Or Lauterbach Goren. <eob>
CA: Well, thank you for writing in. <eob>
The question is: "Is the post-truth era <eol> really a brand-new era, <eob> or just another climax or moment <eol> in a never-ending trend? <eob>
YNH: Personally, I don't connect with this idea <eol> of post-truth. <eob>
My basic reaction as a historian is: <eob> If this is the era of post-truth, <eol> when the hell was the era of truth? <eob>
CA: Right. <eob>
YNH: Was it the 1980s, <eol> the 1950s, the Middle Ages? <eob>
I mean, we have always lived <eol> in an era, in a way, of post-truth. <eob>
CA: But I'd push back on that, <eob> because I think what people <eol> are talking about <eob> is that there was a world <eol> where you had fewer journalistic outlets, <eob> where there were traditions, <eol> that things were fact-checked. <eob>
It was incorporated into the charter <eol> of those organizations <eob> that the truth mattered. <eob>
So if you believe in a reality, <eob> then what you write is information. <eob>
There was a belief that that information <eol> should connect to reality in a real way, <eob> and if you wrote a headline, <eol> it was a serious, earnest attempt <eob> to reflect something <eol> that had actually happened. <eob>
And people didn't always get it right. <eob>
But I think the concern now is you've got <eob> a technological system <eol> that's incredibly powerful <eob> that, for a while at least, <eol> massively amplified anything <eob> with no attention paid to whether <eol> it connected to reality, <eob> only to whether it connected <eol> to clicks and attention, <eob> and that that was arguably toxic. <eob>
That's a reasonable concern, isn't it? <eob>
YNH: Yeah, it is. <eob>
I mean, the technology changes, <eob> and it's now easier to disseminate both <eol> truth and fiction and falsehood. <eob>
It goes both ways. <eob>
It's also much easier, though, to spread <eol> the truth than it was ever before. <eob>
But I don't think there <eol> is anything essentially new <eob> about this disseminating <eol> fictions and errors. <eob>
There is nothing that — <eob> I don't know <eob> — Joseph Goebbels, didn't know <eob> about all this idea of fake news <eol> and post-truth. <eob>
He famously said that if you repeat <eol> a lie often enough, <eob> people will think it's the truth, <eob> and the bigger the lie, the better, <eob> because people won't even think <eol> that something so big can be a lie. <eob>
I think that fake news <eol> has been with us for thousands of years. <eob>
Just think of the Bible. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: But there is a concern <eob> that the fake news is associated <eol> with tyrannical regimes, <eob> and when you see an uprise in fake news <eob> that is a canary in the coal mine <eol> that there may be dark times coming. <eob>
YNH: Yeah. I mean, the intentional use <eol> of fake news is a disturbing sign. <eob>
But I'm not saying that it's not bad, <eol> I'm just saying that it's not new. <eob>
CA: There's a lot of interest <eol> on Facebook on this question <eob> about global governance <eol> versus nationalism. <eob>
Question here from Phil Dennis: <eob> "How do we get people, governments, <eol> to relinquish power? <eob>
Is that -- is that -- <eol> actually, the text is so big <eob> I can't read the full question. <eob>
But is that a necessity? <eob>
Is it going to take war to get there? <eob>
Sorry Phil -- I mangled your question, <eol> but I blame the text right here. <eob>
YNH: One option <eol> that some people talk about <eob> is that only a catastrophe <eol> can shake humankind <eob> and open the path to a real system <eol> of global governance, <eob> and they say that we can't do it <eol> before the catastrophe, <eob> but we need to start <eol> laying the foundations <eob> so that when the disaster strikes, <eob> we can react quickly. <eob>
But people will just not have <eol> the motivation to do such a thing <eob> before the disaster strikes. <eob>
Another thing that I would emphasize <eob> is that anybody who is really <eol> interested in global governance <eob> should always make it very, very clear <eob> that it doesn't replace or abolish <eol> local identities and communities, <eob> that it should come both as -- <eob> It should be part of a single package. <eob>
CA: I want to hear more on this, <eob> because the very words "global governance" <eob> are almost the epitome of evil <eol> in the mindset of a lot of people <eob> on the alt-right right now. <eob>
It just seems scary, remote, distant, <eol> and it has let them down, <eob> and so globalists, <eol> global governance -- no, go away! <eob>
And many view the election <eol> as the ultimate poke in the eye <eob> to anyone who believes in that. <eob>
So how do we change the narrative <eob> so that it doesn't seem <eol> so scary and remote? <eob>
Build more on this idea <eol> of it being compatible <eob> with local identity, local communities. <eob>
YNH: Well, I think again we should start <eob> really with the biological realities <eob> of Homo sapiens. <eob>
And biology tells us two things <eol> about Homo sapiens <eob> which are very relevant to this issue: <eob> first of all, that we are <eol> completely dependent <eob> on the ecological system around us, <eob> and that today we are talking <eol> about a global system. <eob>
You cannot escape that. <eob>
And at the same time, biology tells us <eol> about Homo sapiens <eob> that we are social animals, <eob> but that we are social <eol> on a very, very local level. <eob>
It's just a simple fact of humanity <eob> that we cannot have intimate familiarity <eob> with more than about 150 individuals. <eob>
The size of the natural group, <eob> the natural community of Homo sapiens, <eob> is not more than 150 individuals, <eob> and everything beyond that is really <eol> based on all kinds of imaginary stories <eob> and large-scale institutions, <eob> and I think that we can find a way, <eob> again, based on a biological <eol> understanding of our species, <eob> to weave the two together <eob> and to understand that today <eol> in the 21st century, <eob> we need both the global level <eol> and the local community. <eob>
And I would go even further than that <eob> and say that it starts <eol> with the body itself. <eob>
The feelings that people today <eol> have of alienation and loneliness <eob> and not finding their place <eob> in the world, <eob> I would think that the chief problem <eol> is not global capitalism. <eob>
The chief problem is that over <eol> the last hundred years, <eob> people have been becoming disembodied, <eob> have been distancing themselves <eol> from their body. <eob>
As a hunter-gatherer or even as a peasant, <eob> to survive, you need to be <eol> constantly in touch <eob> with your body and with your senses, <eob> every moment. <eob>
If you go to the forest <eol> to look for mushrooms <eob> and you don't pay attention <eol> to what you hear, <eob> to what you smell, to what you taste, <eob> you're dead. <eob>
So you must be very connected. <eob>
In the last hundred years, <eol> people are losing their ability <eob> to be in touch with their body <eol> and their senses, <eob> to hear, to smell, to feel. <eob>
More and more attention goes to screens, <eob> to what is happening elsewhere, <eob> some other time. <eob>
This, I think, is the deep reason <eob> for the feelings of alienation <eol> and loneliness and so forth, <eob> and therefore part of the solution <eob> is not to bring back <eol> some mass nationalism, <eob> but also reconnect with our own bodies, <eob> and if you are back <eol> in touch with your body, <eob> you will feel much more at home <eol> in the world also. <eob>
CA: Well, depending on how things go, <eol> we may all be back in the forest soon. <eob>
We're going to have <eol> one more question in the room <eob> and one more on Facebook. <eob>
Ama Adi-Dako: Hello. I'm from Ghana, <eol> West Africa, and my question is: <eob> I'm wondering how do you present <eol> and justify the idea of global governance <eob> to countries that have been <eol> historically disenfranchised <eob> by the effects of globalization, <eob> and also, if we're talking about <eol> global governance, <eob> it sounds to me like it will definitely <eol> come from a very Westernized idea <eob> of what the "global" <eol> is supposed to look like. <eob>
So how do we present and justify <eol> that idea of global <eob> versus wholly nationalist <eob> to people in countries like Ghana <eol> and Nigeria and Togo <eob> and other countries like that? <eob>
YNH: I would start by saying <eol> that history is extremely unfair, <eob> and that we should realize that. <eob>
Many of the countries that suffered most <eob> from the last 200 years of globalization <eob> and imperialism and industrialization <eob> are exactly the countries <eol> which are also most likely to suffer most <eob> from the next wave. <eob>
And we should be very, <eol> very clear about that. <eob>
If we don't have a global governance, <eob> and if we suffer from climate change, <eob> from technological disruptions, <eob> the worst suffering will not be in the US. <eob>
The worst suffering <eol> will be in Ghana, will be in Sudan, will be in Syria, <eob> will be <eob> in Bangladesh, <eob> will be in those places. <eob>
So I think those countries <eol> have an even greater incentive <eob> to do something about <eol> the next wave of disruption, <eob> whether it's ecological <eol> or whether it's technological. <eob>
Again, if you think about <eol> technological disruption, <eob> so if AI and 3D printers and robots <eol> will take the jobs <eob> from billions of people, <eob> I worry far less about the Swedes <eob> than about the people in Ghana <eol> or in Bangladesh. <eob>
And therefore, <eol> because history is so unfair <eob> and the results of a calamity <eob> will not be shared equally <eol> between everybody, <eob> as usual, the rich <eol> will be able to get away <eob> from the worst consequences <eol> of climate change <eob> in a way that the poor <eol> will not be able to. <eob>
CA: And here's a great question <eol> from Cameron Taylor on Facebook: <eob> "At the end of 'Sapiens,'" <eob> you said we should be asking the question, <eob> 'What do we want to want?' <eob> Well, what do you think <eol> we should want to want?" <eob>
YNH: I think we should want <eol> to want to know the truth, <eob> to understand reality. <eob>
Mostly what we want is to change reality, <eob> to fit it to our own desires, <eol> to our own wishes, <eob> and I think we should first <eol> want to understand it. <eob>
If you look at the long-term <eol> trajectory of history, <eob> what you see is that <eol> for thousands of years <eob> we humans have been gaining <eol> control of the world outside us <eob> and trying to shape it <eol> to fit our own desires. <eob>
And we've gained control <eol> of the other animals, <eob> of the rivers, of the forests, <eob> and reshaped them completely, <eob> causing an ecological destruction <eob> without making ourselves satisfied. <eob>
So the next step <eol> is we turn our gaze inwards, <eob> and we say OK, getting control <eol> of the world outside us <eob> did not really make us satisfied. <eob>
Let's now try to gain control <eol> of the world inside us. <eob>
This is the really big project <eob> of science and technology <eol> and industry in the 21st century -- <eob> to try and gain control <eol> of the world inside us, <eob> to learn how to engineer and produce <eol> bodies and brains and minds. <eob>
These are likely to be the main <eol> products of the 21st century economy. <eob>
When people think about the future, <eol> very often they think in terms, <eob> "Oh, I want to gain control <eol> of my body and of my brain." <eob> And I think that's very dangerous. <eob>
If we've learned anything <eol> from our previous history, <eob> it's that yes, we gain <eol> the power to manipulate, <eob> but because we didn't really <eol> understand the complexity <eob> of the ecological system, <eob> we are now facing an ecological meltdown. <eob>
And if we now try to reengineer <eol> the world inside us <eob> without really understanding it, <eob> especially without understanding <eol> the complexity of our mental system, <eob> we might cause a kind of internal <eol> ecological disaster, <eob> and we'll face a kind of mental <eol> meltdown inside us. <eob>
CA: Putting all the pieces <eol> together here -- <eob> the current politics, <eol> the coming technology, <eob> concerns like the one <eol> you've just outlined -- <eob> I mean, it seems like you yourself <eol> are in quite a bleak place <eob> when you think about the future. <eob>
You're pretty worried about it. <eob> Is that right? <eob> And if there was one cause for hope, <eol> how would you state that? <eob>
YNH: I focus on the most <eol> dangerous possibilities <eob> partly because this is like my job <eol> or responsibility <eob> as a historian or social critic. <eob>
I mean, the industry focuses mainly <eol> on the positive sides, <eob> so it's the job of historians <eol> and philosophers and sociologists <eob> to highlight the more dangerous potential <eol> of all these new technologies. <eob>
I don't think any of that is inevitable. <eob>
Technology is never deterministic. <eob>
You can use the same technology <eob> to create very different <eol> kinds of societies. <eob>
If you look at the 20th century, <eob> so, the technologies <eol> of the Industrial Revolution, <eob> the trains and electricity and all that <eob> could be used to create <eol> a communist dictatorship <eob> or a fascist regime <eol> or a liberal democracy. <eob>
The trains did not tell you <eol> what to do with them. <eob>
Similarly, now, artificial intelligence <eol> and bioengineering and all of that -- <eob> they don't predetermine a single outcome. <eob>
Humanity can rise up to the challenge, <eob> and the best example we have <eob> of humanity rising up <eol> to the challenge of a new technology <eob> is nuclear weapons. <eob>
In the late 1940s, '50s, <eob> many people were convinced <eob> that sooner or later the Cold War <eol> will end in a nuclear catastrophe, <eob> destroying human civilization. <eob>
And this did not happen. <eob>
In fact, nuclear weapons prompted <eol> humans all over the world <eob> to change the way that they manage <eol> international politics <eob> to reduce violence. <eob>
And many countries basically took out war <eob> from their political toolkit. <eob>
They no longer tried to pursue <eol> their interests with warfare. <eob>
Not all countries have done so, <eol> but many countries have. <eob>
And this is maybe <eol> the most important reason <eob> why international violence <eol> declined dramatically since 1945, <eob> and today, as I said, <eol> more people commit suicide <eob> than are killed in war. <eob>
So this, I think, gives us a good example <eob> that even the most frightening technology, <eob> humans can rise up to the challenge <eob> and actually some good can come out of it. <eob>
The problem is, we have very little <eol> margin for error. <eob>
If we don't get it right, <eob> we might not have <eol> a second option to try again. <eob>
CA: That's a very powerful note, <eob> on which I think we should draw <eol> this to a conclusion. <eob>
Before I wrap up, I just want to say <eol> one thing to people here <eob> and to the global TED community <eol> watching online, anyone watching online: <eob> help us with these dialogues. <eob>
If you believe, like we do, <eob> that we need to find <eol> a different kind of conversation, <eob> now more than ever, help us do it. <eob>
Reach out to other people, <eob> try and have conversations <eol> with people you disagree with, <eob> understand them, <eob> pull the pieces together, <eob> and help us figure out how to take <eol> these conversations forward <eob> so we can make a real contribution <eob> to what's happening <eol> in the world right now. <eob>
I think everyone feels more alive, <eob> more concerned, more engaged <eob> with the politics of the moment. <eob>
The stakes do seem quite high, <eob> so help us respond to it <eol> in a wise, wise way. <eob>
Yuval Harari, thank you. <eob>
This story starts with these two -- <eob> my kids. <eob>
We were hiking in the Oakland woods <eob> when my daughter noticed <eol> a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek. <eob>
She looked at me and said, <eob> "Daddy? <eob>
That doesn't go there." <eob>
When she said that, <eol> it reminded me of summer camp. <eob>
On the morning of visiting day, <eob> right before they'd let our anxious <eol> parents come barreling through the gates, <eob> our camp director would say, <eob> "Quick! <eob>
Everyone pick up five pieces of litter. <eob> "You get a couple hundred kids <eol> each picking up five pieces, <eob> and pretty soon, you've got a much cleaner camp. <eob>
So I thought, <eob> why not apply that crowdsourced <eol> cleanup model to the entire planet? <eob>
And that was the inspiration <eol> for Litterati. <eob>
The vision is to create <eol> a litter-free world. <eob>
Let me show you how it started. <eob> I took a picture of a cigarette <eol> using Instagram. <eob> Then I took another photo ... <eob> and another photo ... <eob> and another photo. <eob>
And I noticed two things: <eob> one, litter became artistic <eol> and approachable; <eob> and two, <eob> at the end of a few days, <eol> I had 50 photos on my phone <eob> and I had picked up each piece, <eob> and I realized that I was keeping a record <eob> of the positive impact <eol> I was having on the planet. <eob>
That's 50 less things that you might see, <eob> or you might step on, <eob> or some bird might eat. <eob>
So I started telling people <eol> what I was doing, <eob> and they started participating. <eob>
One day, <eob> this photo showed up from China. <eob>
And that's when I realized <eob> that Litterati was more <eol> than just pretty pictures; <eob> we were becoming a community <eol> that was collecting data. <eob>
Each photo tells a story. <eob>
It tells us who picked up what, <eob> a geotag tells us where <eob> and a time stamp tells us when. <eob>
So I built a Google map, <eob> and started plotting the points <eol> where pieces were being picked up. <eob>
And through that process, <eol> the community grew <eob> and the data grew. <eob>
My two kids go to school <eol> right in that bullseye. <eob>
Litter: <eob> it's blending into <eol> the background of our lives. <eob>
But what if we brought it <eol> to the forefront? <eob>
What if we understood exactly <eol> what was on our streets, <eob> our sidewalks <eob> and our school yards? <eob>
How might we use that data <eol> to make a difference? <eob>
Well, let me show you. <eob> The first is with cities. <eob>
San Francisco wanted to understand <eol> what percentage of litter was cigarettes. <eob> Why? <eob> To create a tax. <eob>
So they put a couple of people <eol> in the streets <eob> with pencils and clipboards, <eob> who walked around collecting information <eob> which led to a 20-cent tax <eol> on all cigarette sales. <eob>
And then they got sued <eob> by big tobacco, <eob> who claimed that collecting information <eob> with pencils and clipboards <eob> is neither precise nor provable. <eob>
The city called me and asked <eol> if our technology could help. <eob>
I'm not sure they realized <eob> that our technology <eol> was my Instagram account -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I said, "Yes, we can." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"And we can tell you <eol> if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall. <eob>
Plus, every photograph <eol> is geotagged and time-stamped, <eob> providing you with proof." <eob> Four days and 5,000 pieces later, <eob> our data was used in court <eol> to not only defend but double the tax, <eob> generating an annual recurring revenue <eol> of four million dollars <eob> for San Francisco to clean itself up. <eob>
Now, during that process <eol> I learned two things: <eob> one, Instagram is not the right tool -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
so we built an app. <eob>
And two, if you think about it, <eob> every city in the world <eol> has a unique litter fingerprint, <eob> and that fingerprint provides <eol> both the source of the problem <eob> and the path to the solution. <eob>
If you could generate a revenue stream <eob> just by understanding <eol> the percentage of cigarettes, <eob> well, what about coffee cups <eob> or soda cans <eob> or plastic bottles? <eob>
If you could fingerprint San Francisco, <eol> well, how about Oakland <eob> or Amsterdam <eob> or somewhere much closer to home? <eob>
And what about brands? <eob>
How might they use this data <eob> to align their environmental <eol> and economic interests? <eob>
There's a block in downtown Oakland <eol> that's covered in blight. <eob>
The Litterati community got together <eol> and picked up 1,500 pieces. <eob>
And here's what we learned: <eob> most of that litter came <eol> from a very well-known taco brand. <eob>
Most of that brand's litter <eol> were their own hot sauce packets, <eob> and most of those hot sauce packets <eol> hadn't even been opened. <eob>
The problem <eob> and the path to the solution <eob> — <eob> well, maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request <eob> or installs bulk dispensers <eob> or comes up with more sustainable packaging. <eob>
How does a brand take <eol> an environmental hazard, <eob> turn it into an economic engine <eob> and become an industry hero? <eob>
If you really want to create change, <eob> there's no better place to start <eol> than with our kids. <eob>
A group of fifth graders picked up <eol> 1,247 pieces of litter <eob> just on their school yard. <eob>
And they learned that the most <eol> common type of litter <eob> were the plastic straw wrappers <eol> from their own cafeteria. <eob>
So these kids went <eol> to their principal and asked, <eob> "Why are we still buying straws?" <eob> And they stopped. <eob>
And they learned that individually <eol> they could each make a difference, <eob> but together they created an impact. <eob>
It doesn't matter <eol> if you're a student or a scientist, <eob> whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi, <eob> this is a community for everyone. <eob>
It started because of two little kids <eol> in the Northern California woods, <eob> and today it's spread across the world. <eob>
And you know how we're getting there? <eob>
One piece at a time. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Joseph Keller used to jog <eol> around the Stanford campus, <eob> and he was struck by all the women <eol> jogging there as well. <eob>
Why did their ponytails swing <eol> from side to side like that? <eob>
Being a mathematician, <eol> he set out to understand why. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Professor Keller was curious <eol> about many things: <eob> why teapots dribble <eob> or how earthworms wriggle. <eob>
Until a few months ago, <eol> I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. <eob>
I read about him in the New York Times, <eob> in the obituaries. <eob>
The Times had half a page <eol> of editorial dedicated to him, <eob> which you can imagine is premium space <eol> for a newspaper of their stature. <eob>
I read the obituaries almost every day. <eob>
My wife understandably thinks <eol> I'm rather morbid <eob> to begin my day with scrambled eggs <eol> and a "Let's see who died today." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But if you think about it, <eob> the front page of the newspaper <eol> is usually bad news, <eob> and cues man's failures. <eob>
An instance where bad news cues accomplishment <eob> is at the end of the paper, <eob> in the obituaries. <eob>
In my day job, <eob> I run a company that focuses <eol> on future insights <eob> that marketers can derive <eol> from past data -- <eob> a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. <eob>
And we began to think: <eob> What if we held a rearview mirror <eol> to obituaries from the New York Times? <eob>
Were there lessons on how you could get <eol> your obituary featured -- <eob> even if you aren't around to enjoy it? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Would this go better with scrambled eggs? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so, we looked at the data. <eob>
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries <eob> over a 20-month period <eol> between 2015 and 2016. <eob>
What did these 2,000 deaths -- <eol> rather, lives -- teach us? <eob>
Well, first we looked at words. <eob>
This here is an obituary headline. <eob>
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew. <eob>
If you remove the beginning and the end, <eob> you're left with a beautifully <eol> worded descriptor <eob> that tries to, in just a few words, <eol> capture an achievement or a lifetime. <eob>
Just looking at these is fascinating. <eob>
Here are a few famous ones, <eol> people who died in the last two years. <eob>
Try and guess who they are. <eob>
[An Artist who Defied Genre] <eob> That's Prince. <eob>
[Groundbreaking Architect] <eob> Zaha Hadid. <eob>
So we took these descriptors <eob> and did what's called <eol> natural language processing, <eob> where you feed these into a program, <eob> it throws out the superfluous words -- <eob> "the," "and," -- the kind of words <eol> you can mime easily in "Charades," -- <eob> and leaves you with the most <eol> significant words. <eob>
And we did it not just for these four, <eob> but for all 2,000 descriptors. <eob>
And this is what it looks like. <eob>
Film, theatre, music, dance <eol> and of course, art, are huge. <eob> Over 40 percent. <eob> You have to wonder <eol> why in so many societies <eob> we insist that our kids pursue <eol> engineering or medicine or business or law <eob> to be construed as successful. <eob>
And while we're talking profession, <eob> let's look at age -- <eob> the average age at which <eol> they achieved things. <eob>
That number is 37. <eob>
What that means is, <eol> you've got to wait 37 years ... <eob> before your first significant achievement <eol> that you're remembered for -- <eob> on average -- <eob> 44 years later, when you <eol> die at the age of 81 -- <eob> on average. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Talk about having to be patient. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course, it varies by profession. <eob> If you're a sports star, <eob> you'll probably hit <eol> your stride in your 20s. <eob>
And if you're in your 40s like me, <eob> you can join the fun world of politics. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Politicians do their first and sometimes <eol> only commendable act in their mid-40s. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If you're wondering what "others" are, <eob> here are some examples. <eob>
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do <eob> and the things they're remembered for? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Our curiosity was in overdrive, <eob> and we desired to analyze <eol> more than just a descriptor. <eob>
So, we ingested the entire <eol> first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, <eob> but we did this separately <eol> for two groups of people: <eob> people that are famous <eol> and people that are not famous. <eob>
Famous people — Prince, Ali, <eob> Zaha Hadid <eob> — <eob> people who are not famous <eol> are people like Jocelyn Cooper, <eob> Reverend Curry <eob> or Lorna Kelly. <eob>
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard <eol> of most of their names. <eob>
Amazing people, fantastic achievements, <eol> but they're not famous. <eob>
So what if we analyze <eol> these two groups separately -- <eob> the famous and the non-famous? <eob> What might that tell us? <eob>
Take a look. <eob> Two things leap out at me. <eob>
First: <eob> "John." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Anyone here named John <eol> should thank your parents -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and remind your kids to cut out <eol> your obituary when you're gone. <eob>
And second: <eob> "help." <eob>
We uncovered, many lessons <eol> from lives well-led, <eob> and what those people immortalized <eol> in print could teach us. <eob>
The exercise was a fascinating testament <eol> to the kaleidoscope that is life, <eob> and even more fascinating <eob> was the fact that the overwhelming <eol> majority of obituaries <eob> featured people famous and non-famous, <eob> who did seemingly extraordinary things. <eob>
They made a positive dent <eol> in the fabric of life. <eob> They helped. <eob>
So ask yourselves as you go <eol> back to your daily lives: <eob> How am I using my talents to help society? <eob>
Because the most powerful lesson here is, <eob> if more people lived their lives <eol> trying to be famous in death, <eob> the world would be a much better place. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to introduce you to some <eol> very wise kids that I've known, <eob> but first I want <eol> to introduce you to a camel. <eob>
This is Cassie, a therapy camel <eol> visiting one of our young patients <eob> in her room, <eob> which is pretty magical. <eob>
A friend of mine raises camels <eol> at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains. <eob>
He has about eight of them, <eob> and he started 30 years ago <eob> because he thought <eol> horses were too mundane. <eob>
John is an out-of-the-box thinker, <eob> which explains why the two of us <eol> have been such good friends <eob> all of our lives. <eob>
Over the years, I've convinced him <eol> to shuttle those sweet furry beasts <eob> up to hang out with our sick kids <eol> from time to time. <eob>
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn <eob> that camels have an average <eol> life expectancy of 40 to 50 years. <eob>
The life expectancy of many <eol> of the children with whom I work <eob> is less than a year. <eob>
This is a picture <eol> of the George Mark Children's House, <eob> the first pediatric <eol> palliative respite care center <eob> to open in the United States. <eob>
I founded it in 2004, <eob> after years of working <eol> as a psychologist <eob> on pediatric intensive care units, <eob> frustrated with the undignified deaths <eol> that so many children experienced <eob> and their families had to endure. <eob>
As I sat with families whose children <eol> were at the end of their lives, <eob> I was acutely aware of our surroundings. <eob>
While the elevated train <eol> rumbled overhead on its track, <eob> quite literally the room reverberated <eol> with each passing train car. <eob>
The lights on the ward <eol> were fluorescent and too bright. <eob>
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator, <eob> noisily announcing its arrival. <eob>
These families were experiencing <eob> some of the most excruciating <eol> moments of their lives, <eob> and I so wanted them <eol> to have a more peaceful place <eob> in which to say a last goodbye <eol> to their young daughters and sons. <eob>
Surely, I thought, <eob> there must be a better spot <eol> than a hospital intensive care unit <eob> for children at the end of their lives. <eob>
Our children's house <eob> is calm and nurturing. <eob>
It's a place where families <eol> can stay together <eob> to enjoy quality time with their children, <eob> many of whom are there for respite stays, <eob> some with repeated visits <eol> over a span of many years. <eob>
We call those kids our frequent flyers. <eob>
Rather than the bright, <eol> noisy quarters of the hospital, <eob> their rooms are calm and comfortable, <eob> with actual living spaces <eol> for the families, <eob> a sanctuary of gardens <eob> and a wonderful outdoor playground <eob> with special structures <eol> for children with physical limitations. <eob>
This sweet baby Lars <eob> came to us directly <eol> from a hospital intensive care unit. <eob>
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news <eob> that none of us would ever want to hear. <eob>
His parents had been told <eol> that Lars had a brain anomaly <eob> that would keep him from ever swallowing, <eob> walking, talking <eob> or developing mentally. <eob>
Recognizing what little chance <eol> he had for survival, <eob> his parents chose <eol> to focus on the quality of time <eob> that they could spend together. <eob>
They moved into <eol> one of our family apartments <eob> and treasured each day that they had, <eob> which were far too few. <eob>
Lars's life was brief, to be sure, <eob> mere weeks, <eob> but it was calm and comfortable. <eob>
He went on hikes with his parents. <eob>
The time that he spent in the pool <eol> with our aquatic therapist <eob> lessened the seizures he was experiencing <eob> and helped him to sleep at night. <eob>
His family had a peaceful place <eob> in which to both celebrate his life <eob> and mourn his death. <eob>
It has been five years <eol> since Lars was with us, <eob> and in that time, <eob> his family has welcomed <eob> a daughter and another son. <eob>
They are such a powerful testament <eob> to the positive outcome that specialized <eol> children's hospice care can create. <eob>
Their baby's physical discomfort <eol> was well managed, <eob> giving all of them the gift of time <eol> to be together in a beautiful place. <eob>
I'm going to talk to you now <eob> about the elephant <eob> rather than the camel in the room. <eob>
Very few people want to talk about death, <eob> and even fewer about children's death. <eob>
Loss of a child, <eob> especially for those of us <eol> who have our own children, <eob> is frightening, <eob> more than frightening, <eob> paralyzing, <eob> debilitating, <eob> impossible. <eob>
But what I've learned is this: <eob> children don't stop dying <eob> just because we the adults <eob> can't comprehend <eol> the injustice of losing them. <eob>
And what's more, <eob> if we can be brave enough <eob> to face the possibility of death, <eob> even among the most innocent, <eob> we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom. <eob>
Take Crystal, for example. <eob>
She was one of the first children <eol> to come for care <eob> after we opened our doors. <eob>
She was nine when she arrived, <eob> and her neurologist expected <eol> that she might live another two weeks. <eob>
She had an inoperable brain tumor, <eob> and her decline had really accelerated <eob> in the week before she came to us. <eob>
After settling into her room, <eob> dressed entirely in pink and lavender, <eob> surrounded by the Hello Kitty <eol> accessories that she loved, <eob> she spent the next several days <eob> winning over the hearts <eol> of every staff member. <eob>
Bit by bit, her condition stabilized, <eob> and then to our astonishment, <eob> she actually improved. <eob>
There were a variety of factors <eob> that contributed to Crystal's improvement <eob> which we later came to call <eol> the "George Mark bump," <eob> a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon <eob> where children outlive <eol> the prognoses of their illnesses <eob> if they're outside of the hospital. <eob>
The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings, <eob> tasty meals that were fixed <eol> often to accommodate her requests, <eob> the resident pets, <eob> the therapy dog and rabbit <eol> spent lots of cozy time with Crystal. <eob>
After she had been with us <eol> for about a week, <eob> she called her grandmother, <eob> and she said, <eob> "Gee, I'm staying in a great big house, <eob> and there's room for you to come, too. <eob> And guess what? <eob> You don't have to bring any quarters <eob> because the washer and dryer are free." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Crystal's grandmother <eol> soon arrived from out of town, <eob> and they spent the remaining <eol> four months of Crystal's life <eob> enjoying very special days together. <eob>
Some days were special because Crystal <eol> was outside in her wheelchair <eob> sitting by the fountain. <eob>
For a little girl who had spent most <eol> of the year earlier in a hospital bed, <eob> being outside counting hummingbirds <eob> made for an amazing time with her grandma, <eob> and lots of laughter. <eob>
Other days were special <eol> because of the activities <eob> that our child life specialist <eol> created for her. <eob>
Crystal strung beads and made jewelry <eol> for everybody in the house. <eob>
She painted a pumpkin <eol> to help decorate for Halloween. <eob>
She spent many excited days <eol> planning her tenth birthday, <eob> which of course none of us <eol> thought she would ever see. <eob>
All of us wore pink boas for the occasion, <eob> and Crystal, as you can see, <eob> queen for a day, <eob> wore a sparkly tiara. <eob>
One hot morning, I arrived at work <eob> and Crystal and her partner <eol> in crime, Charlie, greeted me. <eob>
With some help, they had set up <eol> a lemonade and cookie stand <eob> outside the front door, <eob> a very strategic location. <eob>
I asked Crystal the price of the cookie <eol> that I had selected, <eob> and she said, <eob> "Three dollars." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I said that seemed a bit high <eol> for one cookie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was small. <eob> "I know," she acknowledged with a grin, <eob> "but I'm worth it." <eob>
And therein lie the words of wisdom <eob> of a young girl whose brief life <eol> forever impacted mine. <eob>
Crystal was worth it, <eob> and shouldn't every child whose life <eol> is shortened by a horrific illness <eob> be worth it? <eob>
Together, all of us today <eob> can offer that same specialized care <eol> that Crystal received <eob> by recognizing that children's <eol> respite and hospice care <eob> is a critical component missing <eol> from our healthcare landscape. <eob>
It's also interesting to note <eob> that we are able to provide this care <eob> at about one third of the cost <eol> of a hospital intensive care unit, <eob> and our families don't see a bill. <eob>
We are ever grateful to the supporters <eob> who believe in this important work <eol> that we're doing. <eob>
The truth is that my colleagues and I <eob> and the parents and other family members <eob> who get to experience this special wisdom <eob> are in a unique position. <eob>
There are only two freestanding <eol> pediatric hospices in the United States, <eob> although I'm happy to report <eol> that based on our model, <eob> there are 18 others <eol> under various stages of development. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Still, most of the children <eol> who die in the United States every year <eob> die in hospital rooms, <eob> surrounded by beeping machines <eob> and anxious, exhausted adults <eob> who have no other option <eob> but to say goodbye <eol> under those harsh, institutional lights <eob> and among virtual strangers. <eob>
For comparison's sake, <eob> the United Kingdom, <eob> which is a country with about one fifth <eol> the population of the United States, <eob> and about half the size <eol> of the state of California, <eob> has 54 hospice and respite centers. <eob> Why is that? <eob> I've asked myself that question <eol> obviously many times. <eob>
My best guess is that Americans, <eol> with our positive can-do attitude <eob> hold the expectation <eol> that our medical care system will fix it, <eob> even though it may be a childhood illness <eol> for which there is no cure. <eob>
We go to extraordinary measures <eol> to keep children alive <eob> when in fact the greatest kindness <eol> that we might give them <eob> would be a peaceful, pain-free <eob> end of life. <eob>
The transition from cure to care <eob> remains a challenging one for many hospital physicians <eob> whose training has really been about saving lives, <eob> not about gently guiding the patient to the <eob> end of life. <eob>
The dad of a sweet baby <eol> for whom we cared at the end of her life <eob> certainly captured this dichotomy <eob> when he reflected <eob> that there are a lot of people <eol> to help you bring an infant into the world <eob> but very few to help you usher a baby out. <eob>
So what is the magic ingredient <eol> at George Mark? <eob>
The complex medical diagnoses <eol> that bring our young patients to us <eob> mean that their lives <eol> have often been restricted, <eob> some to a hospital bed <eol> for long periods of time, <eob> others to wheelchairs, <eob> still others to intensive courses <eol> of chemotherapy or rehab. <eob>
We make a practice <eol> of ignoring those limitations. <eob>
Our default answer is "yes" <eob> and our default question is, "Why not?" <eob> That's why we took a young boy <eob> who wasn't going to live <eol> for another baseball season <eob> to Game 5 of the World Series. <eob>
That's why we have a talent show <eol> put on by the staff and kids <eob> for family and friends. <eob>
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy <eol> playing a piano piece with his feet, <eob> because his arms are atrophied? <eob>
That's why we have a prom every year. <eob>
It's pretty magical. <eob>
We started the prom <eob> after hearing a dad lament <eob> that he would never pin <eol> a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel. <eob>
The weeks before the dance, <eob> the house is in a flurry, <eob> and I don't know who's more excited, <eol> the staff or the kids. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The night of the event <eob> involves rides in vintage cars, <eob> a walk on a red carpet <eob> into the great room, <eob> a terrific DJ <eob> and a photographer at the ready <eob> to capture pictures of these attendees <eob> and their families. <eob>
At the end of the evening this year, <eob> one of our young, <eol> delightful teenaged girls, <eob> Caitlin, said to her mom, <eob> "That was the best night <eol> of my whole life." <eob> And that's just the point, <eob> to capture the best days and nights, <eob> to abolish limitations, <eob> to have your default answer be "yes" <eob> and your default question be, "Why not?" <eob>
Ultimately life is too short, <eob> whether we live <eol> to be 85 years or just eight. <eob> Trust me. <eob> Better yet, trust Sam. <eob>
It's not by pretending <eol> that death doesn't exist <eob> that we keep the people, <eob> especially the little people that we love, <eob> safe. <eob>
In the end, <eob> we can't control how long any of us lives. <eob>
What we can control <eob> is how we spend our days, <eob> the spaces we create, <eob> the meaning and joy that we make. <eob>
We cannot change the outcome, <eob> but we can change the journey. <eob>
Isn't it time <eob> to recognize that children deserve <eob> nothing less than our <eol> most uncompromising bravery <eob> and our wildest imagination. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if our plants <eob> could sense the toxicity <eol> levels in the soil <eob> and express that toxicity <eol> through the color of its leaves? <eob>
What if those plants could also <eol> remove those toxins from the soil? <eob>
Instead, what if those plants <eob> grew their own packaging, <eob> or were designed to only be harvested <eob> by their owners' own patented machines? <eob>
What happens when biological design <eob> is driven by the motivations <eol> of mass-produced commodities? <eob>
What kind of world would that be? <eob>
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer <eol> and researcher at MIT Media Lab, <eob> where I'm part of a relatively new <eol> and unique group called Design Fiction, <eob> where we're wedged somewhere <eol> between science fiction and science fact. <eob>
And at MIT, I am lucky enough <eol> to rub shoulders with scientists <eob> studying all kinds of cutting edge fields <eob> like synthetic neurobiology, <eob> artificial intelligence, artificial life <eob> and everything in between. <eob>
And across campus, <eol> there's truly brilliant scientists <eob> asking questions like, <eol> "How can I make the world a better place?" <eob> And part of what my group <eol> likes to ask is, "What is better?" <eob> What is better for you, for me, <eob> for a white woman, a gay man, <eob> a veteran, a child with a prosthetic? <eob>
Technology is never neutral. <eob>
It frames a reality <eob> and reflects a context. <eob>
Can you imagine what it would say <eol> about the work-life balance at your office <eob> if these were standard issue <eol> on the first day? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I believe it's the role <eol> of artists and designers <eob> to raise critical questions. <eob>
Art is how you can see <eol> and feel the future, <eob> and today is an exciting <eol> time to be a designer, <eob> for all the new tools becoming accessible. <eob>
For instance, synthetic biology <eob> seeks to write biology <eol> as a design problem. <eob>
And through these developments, <eob> my lab asks, what are the roles <eol> and responsibilities <eob> of an artist, designer, <eol> scientist or businessman? <eob>
What are the implications <eob> of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, <eob> and how are they shaping our notions <eol> of what it means to be a human? <eob>
What are the implications <eob> of this on society, on evolution <eob> and what are the stakes in this game? <eob>
My own speculative design research <eol> at the current moment <eob> plays with synthetic biology, <eob> but for more emotionally driven output. <eob>
I'm obsessed with olfaction <eol> as a design space, <eob> and this project started with this idea <eob> of what if you could take <eol> a smell selfie, a smelfie? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What if you could take <eol> your own natural body odor <eob> and send it to a lover? <eob>
Funny enough, I found that this <eol> was a 19th century Austrian tradition, <eob> where couples in courtship <eol> would keep a slice of apple <eob> crammed under their armpit during dances, <eob> and at the end of the evening, <eob> the girl would give the guy <eol> she most fancied her used fruit, <eob> and if the feeling was mutual, <eob> he would wolf down that stinky apple. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Famously, Napoleon wrote many love <eol> letters to Josephine, <eob> but perhaps amongst the most memorable <eol> is this brief and urgent note: <eob> "Home in three days. <eob>
Don't bathe. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Both Napoleon and Josephine <eol> adored violets. <eob>
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume, <eob> carried violets on their wedding day, <eob> and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets <eob> every year on their anniversary. <eob>
When Josephine passed away, <eob> he planted violets at her grave, <eob> and just before his exile, <eob> he went back to that tomb site, <eob> picked some of those flowers, <eol> entombed them in a locket <eob> and wore them until the day he died. <eob>
And I found this so moving, <eob> I thought, could I engineer that violet <eol> to smell just like Josephine? <eob>
What if, for the rest of eternity, <eob> when you went to visit her site, <eob> you could smell Josephine <eol> just as Napoleon loved her? <eob>
Could we engineer new ways of mourning, <eob> new rituals for remembering? <eob>
After all, we've engineered <eol> transgenic crops <eob> to be maximized for profit, <eob> crops that stand up to transport, <eob> crops that have a long shelf life, <eob> crops that taste sugary sweet <eol> but resist pests, <eob> sometimes at the expense <eol> of nutritional value. <eob>
Can we harness these same technologies <eol> for an emotionally sensitive output? <eob>
So currently in my lab, <eob> I'm researching questions like, <eol> what makes a human smell like a human? <eob>
And it turns out it's fairly complicated. <eob>
Factors such as your diet, <eol> your medications, your lifestyle <eob> all factor into the way you smell. <eob>
And I found that our sweat <eol> is mostly odorless, <eob> but it's our bacteria and microbiome <eob> that's responsible for your smells, <eol> your mood, your identity <eob> and so much beyond. <eob>
And there's all kinds <eol> of molecules that you emit <eob> but which we only perceive subconsciously. <eob>
So I've been cataloging and collecting <eob> bacteria from different sites of my body. <eob>
After talking to a scientist, we thought, <eob> maybe the perfect concoction of Ani <eob> is like 10 percent collarbone, <eol> 30 percent underarm, <eob> 40 percent bikini line and so forth, <eob> and occasionally <eol> I let researchers from other labs <eob> take a sniff of my samples. <eob>
And it's been interesting to hear <eol> how smell of the body <eob> is perceived outside <eol> of the context of the body. <eob>
I've gotten feedback such as, <eob> smells like flowers, like chicken, <eob> like cornflakes, <eob> like beef carnitas. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At the same time, I cultivate <eol> a set of carnivorous plants <eob> for their ability to emit <eol> fleshlike odors to attract prey, <eob> in an attempt to kind of create <eol> this symbiotic relationship <eob> between my bacteria and this organism. <eob>
And as it so happens, <eol> I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar, <eob> and I was talking to a scientist <eob> who happens to be a chemist <eol> and a plant scientist, <eob> and I was telling him about my project, <eob> and he was like, "Well, this sounds <eol> like botany for lonely women." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Unperturbed, I said, "OK." <eob> I challenged him. <eob> "Can we engineer a plant <eol> that can love me back?" <eob> And for some reason, <eol> he was like, "Sure, why not?" <eob>
So we started with, <eol> can we get a plant to grow towards me <eob> like I was the sun? <eob>
And so we're looking at mechanisms <eol> in plants such as phototropism, <eob> which causes the plant <eol> to grow towards the sun <eob> by producing hormones like auxin, <eob> which causes cell elongation <eol> on the shady side. <eob>
And right now I'm creating <eol> a set of lipsticks <eob> that are infused with these chemicals <eob> that allow me to interact with a plant <eol> on its own chemical signatures -- <eob> lipsticks that cause plants <eol> to grow where I kiss it, <eob> plants that blossom <eol> where I kiss the bloom. <eob>
And through these projects, <eob> I'm asking questions like, <eob> how do we define nature? <eob>
How do we define nature <eol> when we can reengineer its properties, <eob> and when should we do it? <eob>
Should we do it for profit, for utility? <eob>
Can we do it for emotional ends? <eob>
Can biotechnology be used <eol> to create work as moving as music? <eob>
What are the thresholds between science <eob> and its ability to shape <eol> our emotional landscape? <eob>
It's a famous design mantra <eol> that form follows function. <eob>
Well, now, wedged somewhere <eol> between science, design and art <eob> I get to ask, <eob> what if fiction informs fact? <eob>
What kind of R & amp; <eol> D lab would that look like <eob> and what kind of questions <eol> would we ask together? <eob>
We often look to technology as the answer, <eob> but as an artist and designer, <eob> I like to ask, but what is the question? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Eight years ago, I was haunted <eol> by an evil spirit. <eob>
I was 25 at the time, <eob> and I was living in a tiny house <eol> behind someone else's house <eob> in Los Angeles. <eob>
It was this guest house, <eol> it had kind of been dilapidated, <eob> not taken care of for a long time. <eob>
And one night, I was sitting there <eob> and I got this really spooky feeling, <eob> kind of the feeling <eol> like you're being watched. <eob>
But no one was there except my two dogs, <eob> and they were just chewing their feet. <eob>
And I looked around. <eob>
No one was there. <eob>
And I thought, OK, <eol> it's just my imagination. <eob>
But the feeling just kept getting worse, <eob> and I started to feel <eol> this pressure in my chest, <eob> sort of like the feeling <eol> when you get bad news. <eob>
But it started to sink lower and lower <eob> and almost hurt. <eob>
And over the course of that week, <eol> this feeling got worse and worse, <eob> and I started to become convinced <eol> that something was there <eob> in my little guest house, haunting me. <eob>
And I started to hear these sounds, <eob> this "whoosh," kind of whisper, <eol> like something passing through me. <eob>
I called my best friend, Claire, and said, <eob> "I know this is going to sound crazy, <eob> but, um... <eob> I think there's a ghost in my house, <eol> and I need to get rid of it." <eob> And she said — she's very open-minded — and she said, <eob> "I don't think you're crazy. <eob>
I think you just need <eol> to do a cleansing ritual." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"So get some sage and burn it, <eob> and tell it to go away." <eob>
So I said, "OK," <eol> and I went and I bought sage. <eob>
I had never done this before, <eol> so I set the sage on fire, <eob> waved it about, and said, "Go away! <eob>
This is my house! I live here. <eob> You don't live here! <eob> "But the feeling stayed. Nothing got better. <eob> And then I started to think, <eob> OK, well now this thing <eol> is probably just laughing at me, <eob> because it hasn't left, <eob> and I probably just look like this impotent, powerless thing <eob> that couldn't get it to go away. <eob>
So every day I'd come home <eob> and you guys, this feeling got so bad <eol> that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now -- <eob> but I would sit there in bed <eol> and cry every night. <eob>
And the feeling on my chest <eol> got worse and worse. <eob> It was physically painful. <eob>
And I even went to a psychiatrist <eob> and tried to get her <eol> to prescribe me medicine, <eob> and she wouldn't just because <eol> I don't have schizophrenia, OK. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So finally I got on the internet, <eol> and I Googled "hauntings." <eob> And I came upon this forum <eol> of ghost hunters. <eob>
But these were a special <eol> kind of ghost hunters -- <eob> they were skeptics. <eob>
They believed that every case of ghosts <eol> that they had investigated so far <eob> had been explained away by science. <eob>
And I was like, "OK, smart guys, <eol> this is what's happening to me, <eob> and if you have an explanation for me, <eol> I would love to hear it." <eob>
And one of them said, "OK. <eob> Um, have you heard <eol> of carbon monoxide poisoning?" <eob>
And I said, "Yeah. <eob> Like, gas poisoning?" <eob>
Carbon monoxide poisoning <eol> is when you have a gas leak <eob> leaking into your home. <eob>
I looked it up, and the symptoms <eol> of carbon monoxide poisoning <eob> include a pressure on your chest, <eob> auditory hallucinations -- whoosh -- <eob> and an unexplained feeling of dread. <eob>
So that night, I called the gas company. <eob> I said, "I have an emergency. <eol> I need you to come out. <eob>
I don't want to get into the story now, <eol> but I need you to come out." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They came out. I said, <eol> "I suspect a gas leak." <eob> They brought their carbon <eol> monoxide detector, <eob> and the man said, <eob> "It's a really good thing <eol> that you called us tonight, <eob> because you could have been <eol> dead very soon." <eob>
Thirty-seven percent of Americans <eol> believe in haunted houses, <eob> and I wonder how many of them <eol> have been in one <eob> and how many of them have been in danger. <eob>
So that haunting story <eol> has led me to my job. <eob>
I'm an investigator, and I'm <eol> an investigator in two senses: <eob> I'm an investigative journalist, <eob> and I'm also an investigator <eol> of the claims of the paranormal <eob> and claims of the spiritual. <eob>
And that means a few things. <eob>
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending <eol> to need an exorcism <eob> so I can get -- yes, that's right! -- <eol> so I can go to an exorcist <eob> and see if he's using gimmicks <eol> or psychological tricks <eob> to try to convince someone <eol> that they're possessed. <eob>
Sometimes that means <eol> I'm going undercover in a fringe group <eob> which I report on <eol> for a podcast that I co-host. <eob>
And I've done over 70 investigations <eol> like this with my co-host, Ross. <eob>
I would love to tell you <eol> that nine times out of 10, science wins, <eob> saves the day, it's all explained. <eob>
That's not true. <eob>
The truth is, 10 times out of 10, <eol> science wins, it saves the day. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And that doesn't mean <eol> there's no such thing as a mystery. <eob>
Of course there are mysteries, <eol> but a mystery is a mystery. <eob>
It is not a ghost. <eob>
Now, I believe there are <eol> two kinds of truth, <eob> and it's taken me a while to get <eol> to this place, but I think this is right, <eob> so hear me out. <eob>
I think there is outer truth <eol> and there's inner truth. <eob>
So if you say to me, <eob> "There was a man named Jesus <eol> and he once existed," <eob> that's outer truth, right? <eob>
And we can go and look <eol> at the historical record. <eob>
We can determine <eol> whether that seems to be true. <eob>
And I would argue, <eol> it does seem to be true. <eob>
If you say, "Jesus rose <eol> from the dead," -- ooh, trickier. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I would say that's an outer-truth claim, <eob> because he physically rose or he didn't. <eob>
I'm not going to get into whether <eol> he rose or he didn't, <eob> but <eob> I would say that's an outer-truth claim. <eob>
It happened or it didn't happen. <eob>
But if you say, "I don't care <eol> whether he rose from the dead. <eob>
It's symbolically important to me, <eob> and that metaphor is so meaningful, <eol> so purposeful to me, <eob> and I'm not going to try <eol> to persuade you of it," <eob> now you've moved it <eol> from outer truth to inner truth, <eob> from science to art. <eob>
And I think we have a tendency <eol> to not be clear about this, <eob> to try to move our inner truths <eol> to outer truths, <eob> or to not be fair about it to each other, <eob> and when people are telling us <eol> their inner truths, <eob> to try to make them defend them <eol> by outer-truth standards. <eob>
So I'm talking here about outer truth, <eol> about objective things. <eob>
And there was an objective reality <eol> in my haunted house, right? <eob>
Now that I've told you about the gas leak, <eob> I doubt a single person here <eol> would be like, <eob> "I still think there was a ghost, too" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
because as soon as we have <eol> these scientific explanations, <eob> we know to give up the ghost. <eob>
We use these things as stopgaps <eol> for things that we can't explain. <eob>
We don't believe them because of evidence; <eob> we believe them because <eol> of a lack of evidence. <eob>
So there is a group <eob> in Los Angeles <eob> called the Independent Investigations Group, <eol> or the IIG, <eob> and they do great work. <eob>
They'll give a $10,000 prize <eob> to anyone who can show, <eol> under scientific conditions, <eob> that they have a paranormal ability. <eob>
No one's done it yet, <eob> but they've had a couple people <eol> who claim that they were clairaudients, <eob> which means that they can hear voices <eol> either from the great beyond <eob> or they can read minds. <eob>
And they had one person <eol> who was very sincere, <eob> who believed that he could read minds. <eob>
So they set up a test with him, <eol> and this is the way it always works. <eob>
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol, <eob> we have a way to scientifically test this. <eob>
Do you agree with it? <eob> "The person says yes. <eob>
Then they test it. <eob>
It's very important that both sides agree. <eob>
They did that, they tested him. <eob>
They said, "OK, you know what? <eob>
You weren't able to predict <eol> what Lisa was thinking. <eob>
It matched up about the same as chance. <eob>
Looks like you don't have the power." <eob>
And that gave them the opportunity <eob> to compassionately sit down with him <eol> and have a very difficult discussion, <eob> which basically amounted to, <eob> "Hey, we know you're sincere, <eol> and what that means is, <eob> you do hear something in your head." <eob>
And that guy got to make <eol> the very difficult decision, <eob> but really the life-changing decision <eol> about whether to go get help. <eob>
We're actually helping people <eol> to make these connections <eob> that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations, <eob> help draw us into reality <eol> and maybe change our lives for the better. <eob>
Now, on the other hand, <eol> maybe one time it'll turn out to be true. <eob>
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts, <eob> and holy shit, it will be the best thing! <eob>
And every time I do <eol> one of these investigations, <eob> I still get so excited, <eob> and I'm like 75 into them, <eob> and still I swear on number 76, <eol> I'm going to be like, "This is the one!" <eob>
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic, <eol> but I hope I never lose this hope, <eob> and I invite you to take <eol> this same attitude <eob> when people share <eol> their outer beliefs with you. <eob>
When talking about testable claims, <eob> respect them enough to ask <eol> these good questions. <eob>
Challenge and see <eol> how you can examine them together, <eob> because there's this idea <eol> that you can't respect a belief <eob> and still challenge it, <eol> but that's not true. <eob>
When we jiggle the lock, <eol> when we test the claim, <eob> we're saying, OK, I respect you, <eol> I'm listening to what you're saying, <eob> I'm going to test it out with you. <eob>
We've all had that experience <eol> where you're telling someone something, <eob> and they're like, "Oh, <eol> that's really interesting, yeah," <eob> you know you're being had. <eob>
But when someone says, "Really? Huh. <eob> Sounds a little sketchy to me, <eol> but I'm listening," <eob> you at least know <eol> you're being engaged and respected. <eob>
And that's the kind of attitude <eol> we should have with these claims. <eob>
That's showing someone <eol> that you care what they're saying. <eob> That's respect. <eob>
Now, yes, most of these searches <eol> will come up empty, <eob> but that's how all of science works. <eob>
Every cure for cancer so far <eol> has not panned out, <eob> but we don't stop looking, <eob> for two reasons. <eob>
Because number one, the answer matters. <eob>
Whether it's looking at the afterlife <eol> or the paranormal or the cure for cancer, <eob> it all amounts to the same question: <eob> How long will we be here? <eob>
And two, because looking for the truth, <eob> being open-minded, <eob> and being willing to be wrong <eol> and to change your whole worldview <eob> is awe-inspiring. <eob>
I still get excited at ghost stories <eol> every single time. <eob>
I still consider that every group <eol> I join might be right, <eob> and I hope I never lose that hope. <eob>
Let's all never lose that hope, <eob> because searching for what's out there <eob> helps us understand what's in here. <eob>
And also, please have <eol> a carbon monoxide detector in your home. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was a blue-eyed, <eol> chubby-cheeked five-year-old <eob> when I joined my family <eol> on the picket line for the first time. <eob>
My mom made me leave <eol> my dolls in the minivan. <eob>
I'd stand on a street corner <eol> in the heavy Kansas humidity, <eob> surrounded by a few dozen relatives, <eob> with my tiny fists clutching <eol> a sign that I couldn't read yet: <eob> "Gays are worthy of death." <eob> This was the beginning. <eob>
Our protests soon became <eol> a daily occurrence <eob> and an international phenomenon, <eob> and as a member <eol> of Westboro Baptist Church, <eob> I became a fixture <eol> on picket lines across the country. <eob>
The end of my antigay picketing career <eob> and life as I knew it, <eob> came 20 years later, <eob> triggered in part by strangers on Twitter <eob> who showed me the power <eol> of engaging the other. <eob>
In my home, <eob> life was framed as an epic <eol> spiritual battle between good and evil. <eob>
The good was my church and its members, <eob> and the evil was everyone else. <eob>
My church's antics were such <eob> that we were constantly <eol> at odds with the world, <eob> and that reinforced <eol> our otherness on a daily basis. <eob> "Make a difference <eol> between the unclean and the clean," <eob> the verse says, <eob> and so we did. <eob>
From baseball games to military funerals, <eob> we trekked across the country <eol> with neon protest signs in hand <eob> to tell others exactly <eol> how "unclean" they were <eob> and exactly why <eol> they were headed for damnation. <eob>
This was the focus of our whole lives. <eob>
This was the only way for me to do good <eol> in a world that sits in Satan's lap. <eob>
And like the rest of my 10 siblings, <eob> I believed what I was taught <eol> with all my heart, <eob> and I pursued Westboro's agenda <eol> with a special sort of zeal. <eob>
In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter. <eob>
Initially, the people <eol> I encountered on the platform <eob> were just as hostile as I expected. <eob>
They were the digital version <eol> of the screaming hordes <eob> I'd been seeing at protests <eol> since I was a kid. <eob>
But in the midst of that digital brawl, <eob> a strange pattern developed. <eob>
Someone would arrive at my profile <eol> with the usual rage and scorn, <eob> I would respond with a custom mix <eol> of Bible verses, pop culture references <eob> and smiley faces. <eob>
They would be understandably <eol> confused and caught off guard, <eob> but then a conversation would ensue. <eob>
And it was civil — <eob> full of genuine curiosity on both sides. <eob>
How had the other come to such <eol> outrageous conclusions about the world? <eob>
Sometimes the conversation <eol> even bled into real life. <eob>
People I'd sparred with on Twitter <eob> would come out <eol> to the picket line to see me <eob> when I protested in their city. <eob>
A man named David was one such person. <eob>
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious," <eob> and after several months <eol> of heated but friendly arguments online, <eob> he came out to see me <eol> at a picket in New Orleans. <eob>
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert <eol> from Jerusalem, where he lives, <eob> and I brought him kosher chocolate <eob> and held a "God hates Jews" sign. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There was no confusion <eol> about our positions, <eob> but the line between friend and foe <eol> was becoming blurred. <eob>
We'd started to see each other <eol> as human beings, <eob> and it changed the way <eol> we spoke to one another. <eob>
It took time, <eob> but eventually these conversations <eol> planted seeds of doubt in me. <eob>
My friends on Twitter took the time <eol> to understand Westboro's doctrines, <eob> and in doing so, <eob> they were able to find inconsistencies <eol> I'd missed my entire life. <eob>
Why did we advocate <eol> the death penalty for gays <eob> when Jesus said, "Let he who is <eol> without sin cast the first stone?" <eob> How could we claim to love our neighbor <eob> while at the same time <eol> praying for God to destroy them? <eob>
The truth is that the care shown to me <eol> by these strangers on the internet <eob> was itself a contradiction. <eob>
It was growing evidence <eob> that people on the other side were not <eol> the demons I'd been led to believe. <eob>
These realizations were life-altering. <eob> Once I saw that we were not <eol> the ultimate arbiters of divine truth <eob> but flawed human beings, <eob> I couldn't pretend otherwise. <eob>
I couldn't justify our actions -- <eob> especially our cruel practice <eol> of protesting funerals <eob> and celebrating human tragedy. <eob>
These shifts in my perspective <eob> contributed to a larger erosion <eol> of trust in my church, <eob> and eventually it made it <eol> impossible for me to stay. <eob>
In spite of overwhelming grief and terror, <eol> I left Westboro in 2012. <eob>
In those days just after I left, <eob> the instinct to hide <eol> was almost paralyzing. <eob>
I wanted to hide <eol> from the judgement of my family, <eob> who I knew would never <eol> speak to me again -- <eob> people whose thoughts and opinions <eol> had meant everything to me. <eob>
And I wanted to hide from the world <eol> I'd rejected for so long -- <eob> people who had no reason at all <eol> to give me a second chance <eob> after a lifetime of antagonism. <eob>
And yet, unbelievably, <eob> they did. <eob>
The world had access to my past <eol> because it was all over the internet -- <eob> thousands of tweets <eol> and hundreds of interviews, <eob> everything from local TV news <eol> to "The Howard Stern Show" -- <eob> but so many embraced me <eol> with open arms anyway. <eob>
I wrote an apology <eol> for the harm I'd caused, <eob> but I also knew that an apology <eol> could never undo any of it. <eob>
All I could do was try to build a new life <eob> and find a way somehow <eol> to repair some of the damage. <eob>
People had every reason <eol> to doubt my sincerity, <eob> but most of them didn't. <eob>
And — <eob> given my history, <eob> it was more than I could've hoped for — <eob> forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt. <eob>
It still amazes me. <eob>
I spent my first year away from home <eob> adrift with my younger sister, <eob> who had chosen to leave with me. <eob>
We walked into an abyss, <eob> but we were shocked to find <eol> the light and a way forward <eob> in the same communities <eol> we'd targeted for so long. <eob>
David, <eob> my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter, <eob> invited us to spend time among <eol> a Jewish community in Los Angeles. <eob>
We slept on couches in the home <eol> of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife <eob> and their four kids -- <eob> the same rabbi that I'd protested <eol> three years earlier <eob> with a sign that said, <eol> "Your rabbi is a whore." <eob> We spent long hours talking <eol> about theology and Judaism and life <eob> while we washed dishes <eol> in their kosher kitchen <eob> and chopped vegetables for dinner. <eob>
They treated us like family. <eob>
They held nothing against us, <eob> and again I was astonished. <eob>
That period was full of turmoil, <eob> but one part I've returned to often <eob> is a surprising realization <eol> I had during that time -- <eob> that it was a relief and a privilege <eol> to let go of the harsh judgments <eob> that instinctively ran through my mind <eol> about nearly every person I saw. <eob>
I realized that now I needed to learn. <eob> I needed to listen. <eob>
This has been at the front <eol> of my mind lately, <eob> because I can't help but see <eol> in our public discourse <eob> so many of the same destructive impulses <eol> that ruled my former church. <eob>
We celebrate tolerance and diversity <eol> more than at any other time in memory, <eob> and still we grow more and more divided. <eob>
We want good things -- <eob> justice, equality, <eol> freedom, dignity, prosperity -- <eob> but the path we've chosen <eob> looks so much like the one <eol> I walked away from four years ago. <eob>
We've broken the world into us and them, <eob> only emerging from our bunkers long enough <eob> to lob rhetorical grenades <eol> at the other camp. <eob>
We write off half the country <eol> as out-of-touch liberal elites <eob> or racist misogynist bullies. <eob>
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity. <eob>
Even when someone does call for empathy <eol> and understanding for the other side, <eob> the conversation nearly always devolves <eob> into a debate about <eol> who deserves more empathy. <eob>
And just as I learned to do, <eob> we routinely refuse to acknowledge <eol> the flaws in our positions <eob> or the merits in our opponent's. <eob> Compromise is anathema. <eob> We even target people on our own side <eol> when they dare to question the party line. <eob>
This path has brought us cruel, <eol> sniping, deepening polarization, <eob> and even outbreaks of violence. <eob>
I remember this path. <eob>
It will not take us where we want to go. <eob>
What gives me hope is that <eol> we can do something about this. <eob>
The good news is that it's simple, <eob> and the bad news is that it's hard. <eob>
We have to talk and listen <eol> to people we disagree with. <eob>
It's hard because we often can't fathom <eob> how the other side <eol> came to their positions. <eob>
It's hard because righteous indignation, <eob> that sense of certainty <eol> that ours is the right side, <eob> is so seductive. <eob>
It's hard because it means <eol> extending empathy and compassion <eob> to people who show us <eol> hostility and contempt. <eob>
The impulse to respond in kind <eol> is so tempting, <eob> but that isn't who we want to be. <eob> We can resist. <eob> And I will always be inspired to do so <eol> by those people I encountered on Twitter, <eob> apparent enemies <eol> who became my beloved friends. <eob>
And in the case of one particularly <eol> understanding and generous guy, <eob> my husband. <eob>
There was nothing special <eol> about the way I responded to him. <eob>
What was special was their approach. <eob>
I thought about it a lot <eol> over the past few years <eob> and I found four things <eol> they did differently <eob> that made real conversation possible. <eob>
These four steps were small but powerful, <eob> and I do everything I can to employ them <eol> in difficult conversations today. <eob>
The first is don't assume bad intent. <eob>
My friends on Twitter realized <eob> that even when my words <eol> were aggressive and offensive, <eob> I sincerely believed <eol> I was doing the right thing. <eob>
Assuming ill motives <eol> almost instantly cuts us off <eob> from truly understanding <eol> why someone does and believes as they do. <eob>
We forget that they're a human being <eob> with a lifetime of experience <eol> that shaped their mind, <eob> and we get stuck <eol> on that first wave of anger, <eob> and the conversation has a very hard time <eol> ever moving beyond it. <eob>
But when we assume good or neutral intent, <eob> we give our minds a much stronger <eol> framework for dialogue. <eob>
The second is ask questions. <eob>
When we engage people <eol> across ideological divides, <eob> asking questions <eol> helps us map the disconnect <eob> between our differing points of view. <eob>
That's important because <eol> we can't present effective arguments <eob> if we don't understand where <eol> the other side is actually coming from <eob> and because it gives them an opportunity <eol> to point out flaws in our positions. <eob>
But asking questions <eol> serves another purpose; <eob> it signals to someone <eol> that they're being heard. <eob>
When my friends on Twitter <eol> stopped accusing <eob> and started asking questions, <eob> I almost automatically mirrored them. <eob>
Their questions gave me room to speak, <eob> but they also gave me permission <eol> to ask them questions <eob> and to truly hear their responses. <eob>
It fundamentally changed <eol> the dynamic of our conversation. <eob>
The third is stay calm. <eob>
This takes practice and patience, <eob> but it's powerful. <eob>
At Westboro, I learned not to care <eol> how my manner of speaking affected others. <eob>
I thought my rightness <eol> justified my rudeness -- <eob> harsh tones, raised voices, <eol> insults, interruptions -- <eob> but that strategy <eol> is ultimately counterproductive. <eob>
Dialing up the volume and the snark <eol> is natural in stressful situations, <eob> but it tends to bring the conversation <eol> to an unsatisfactory, explosive end. <eob>
When my husband was still <eol> just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance, <eob> our discussions frequently <eol> became hard and pointed, <eob> but we always refused to escalate. <eob>
Instead, he would change the subject. <eob>
He would tell a joke or recommend a book <eob> or gently excuse himself <eol> from the conversation. <eob>
We knew the discussion wasn't over, <eob> just paused for a time <eol> to bring us back to an even keel. <eob>
People often lament that digital <eol> communication makes us less civil, <eob> but this is one advantage that online <eol> conversations have over in-person ones. <eob>
We have a buffer of time and space <eob> between us and the people <eol> whose ideas we find so frustrating. <eob>
We can use that buffer. <eob>
Instead of lashing out, <eol> we can pause, breathe, <eob> change the subject or walk away, <eob> and then come back to it when we're ready. <eob>
And finally... <eob> make the argument. <eob>
This might seem obvious, <eob> but one side effect <eol> of having strong beliefs <eob> is that we sometimes assume <eob> that the value of our position <eol> is or should be obvious and self-evident, <eob> that we shouldn't <eol> have to defend our positions <eob> because they're so clearly right and good <eob> that if someone doesn't get it, <eol> it's their problem -- <eob> that it's not my job to educate them. <eob>
But if it were that simple, <eob> we would all see things the same way. <eob>
As kind as my friends on Twitter were, <eob> if they hadn't actually <eol> made their arguments, <eob> it would've been so much harder for me <eol> to see the world in a different way. <eob>
We are all a product of our upbringing, <eob> and our beliefs reflect our experiences. <eob>
We can't expect others <eol> to spontaneously change their own minds. <eob>
If we want change, <eob> we have to make the case for it. <eob>
My friends on Twitter didn't abandon <eol> their beliefs or their principles -- <eob> only their scorn. <eob>
They channeled their <eol> infinitely justifiable offense <eob> and came to me with pointed questions <eol> tempered with kindness and humor. <eob>
They approached me as a human being, <eob> and that was more transformative <eob> than two full decades <eol> of outrage, disdain and violence. <eob>
I know that some might not have <eol> the time or the energy or the patience <eob> for extensive engagement, <eob> but as difficult as it can be, <eob> reaching out to someone we disagree with <eob> is an option that is <eol> available to all of us. <eob>
And I sincerely believe <eol> that we can do hard things, <eob> not just for them <eol> but for us and our future. <eob>
Escalating disgust <eol> and intractable conflict <eob> are not what we want for ourselves, <eob> or our country <eob> or our next generation. <eob>
My mom said something to me <eol> a few weeks before I left Westboro, <eob> when I was desperately hoping <eob> there was a way <eol> I could stay with my family. <eob>
People I have loved <eol> with every pulse of my heart <eob> since even before I was <eol> that chubby-cheeked five-year-old, <eob> standing on a picket line <eol> holding a sign I couldn't read. <eob>
She said, "You're just a human being, <eob> my dear, sweet child." <eob> She was asking me to be humble -- <eob> not to question <eol> but to trust God and my elders. <eob>
But to me, she was missing <eol> the bigger picture -- <eob> that we're all just human beings. <eob>
That we should be guided <eol> by that most basic fact, <eob> and approach one another <eol> with generosity and compassion. <eob>
Each one of us <eol> contributes to the communities <eob> and the cultures and the societies <eol> that we make up. <eob>
The end of this spiral of rage and blame <eol> begins with one person <eob> who refuses to indulge <eol> these destructive, seductive impulses. <eob>
We just have to decide <eol> that it's going to start with us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I was a kid, I was obsessed <eol> with the Guinness Book of World Records, <eob> and I really wanted <eol> to set a world record myself. <eob>
But there was just one small problem: <eob> I had absolutely no talent. <eob>
So I decided to set <eol> a world record in something <eob> that demanded absolutely no skill at all. <eob>
I decided to set a world record <eob> in crawling. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the record at the time <eol> was 12 and a half miles, <eob> and for some reason, <eol> this seemed totally manageable. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I recruited my friend Anne, <eob> and together we decided, <eol> we didn't even need to train. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And on the day of our record attempt, <eob> we put furniture pads <eol> on the outside of our good luck jeans <eob> and we set off, <eob> and right away, we were in trouble, <eob> because the denim was against our skin <eob> and it began to chafe, <eob> and soon our knees were being chewed up. <eob>
Hours in, <eob> it began to rain. <eob>
Then, Anne dropped out. <eob>
Then, it got dark. <eob>
Now, by now, my knees <eol> were bleeding through my jeans, <eob> and I was hallucinating from the cold <eob> and the pain and the monotony. <eob>
And to give you an idea <eol> of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing, <eob> the first lap around <eol> the high school track took 10 minutes. <eob>
The last lap took almost 30. <eob>
After 12 hours of crawling, <eob> I stopped, <eob> and I had gone eight and a half miles. <eob>
So I was short of <eol> the 12-and-a-half-mile record. <eob>
Now, for many years, I thought <eol> this was a story of abject failure, <eob> but today I see it differently, <eob> because when I was <eol> attempting the world record, <eob> I was doing three things. <eob> I was getting outside my comfort zone, <eob> I was calling upon my resilience, <eob> and I was finding confidence in myself <eob> and my own decisions. <eob>
I didn't know it then, <eob> but those are not <eol> the attributes of failure. <eob>
Those are the attributes of bravery. <eob>
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26, <eob> I became a San Francisco firefighter, <eob> and I was the 15th woman <eol> in a department of 1,500 men. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And as you can imagine, when I arrived <eob> there were many doubts <eol> about whether we could do the job. <eob>
So even though I was a 5 '10 ", 150-pound collegiate rower, <eob> and someone who could endure 12 hours <eol> of searing knee pain — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I knew I still had to prove <eol> my strength and fitness. <eob>
So one day a call came in for a fire, <eob> and sure enough, <eol> when my engine group pulled up, <eob> there was black smoke billowing <eol> from a building off an alleyway. <eob>
And I was with a big guy named Skip, <eob> and he was on the nozzle, <eol> and I was right behind, <eob> and it was a typical sort of fire. <eob>
It was smoky, it was hot, <eob> and all of a sudden, <eob> there was an explosion, <eob> and Skip and I were blown backwards, <eob> my mask was knocked sideways, <eob> and there was this moment of confusion. <eob>
And then I picked myself up, <eob> I groped for the nozzle, <eob> and I did what a firefighter <eol> was supposed to do: <eob> I lunged forward, <eob> opened up the water <eob> and I tackled the fire myself. <eob>
The explosion had been caused <eol> by a water heater, <eob> so nobody was hurt, <eol> and ultimately it was not a big deal, <eob> but later Skip came up to me and said, <eob> "Nice job, Caroline," <eob> in this surprised sort of voice. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I was confused, because <eol> the fire hadn't been difficult physically, <eob> so why was he looking at me <eol> with something like astonishment? <eob>
And then it became clear: <eob> Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy <eob> and an excellent firefighter, <eob> not only thought <eol> that women could not be strong, <eob> he thought that they <eol> could not be brave either. <eob>
And he wasn't the only one. <eob>
Friends, acquaintances and strangers, <eob> men and women throughout my career <eob> ask me over and over, <eob> "Caroline, all that fire, all that danger, <eob> aren't you scared?" <eob> Honestly, I never heard <eol> a male firefighter asked this. <eob>
And I became curious. <eob>
Why wasn't bravery expected of women? <eob>
Now, the answer began to come <eob> when a friend of mine lamented to me <eob> that her young daughter <eol> was a big scaredy-cat, <eob> and so I began to notice, <eob> and yes, the daughter was anxious, <eob> but more than that, <eol> the parents were anxious. <eob>
Most of what they said to her <eol> when she was outside began with, <eob> "Be careful," "Watch out," or "No." <eob> Now, my friends were not bad parents. <eob>
They were just doing what most parents do, <eob> which is cautioning their daughters <eol> much more than they caution their sons. <eob>
There was a study involving <eol> a playground fire pole, ironically, <eob> in which researchers saw that little girls <eol> were very likely to be warned <eob> by both their moms and dads <eol> about the fire pole's risk, <eob> and if the little girls <eol> still wanted to play on the fire pole, <eob> a parent was very likely to assist her. <eob>
But the little boys? <eob>
They were encouraged <eol> to play on the fire pole <eob> despite any trepidations <eol> that they might have, <eob> and often the parents offered <eol> guidance on how to use it on their own. <eob>
So what message does this send <eol> to both boys and girls? <eob>
Well, that girls are fragile <eol> and more in need of help, <eob> and that boys can and should master difficult tasks <eol> by themselves. <eob> It says that girls should be fearful <eob> and boys should be gutsy. <eob>
Now, the irony is that at this young age, <eob> girls and boys are actually <eol> very alike physically. <eob>
In fact, girls are often <eol> stronger until puberty, <eob> and more mature. <eob>
And yet we adults act <eob> as if girls are more fragile <eob> and more in need of help, <eob> and they can't handle as much. <eob>
This is the message <eol> that we absorb as kids, <eob> and this is the message <eol> that fully permeates as we grow up. <eob>
We women believe it, men believe it, <eob> and guess what? <eob>
As we become parents, <eol> we pass it on to our children, <eob> and so it goes. <eob>
Well, so now I had my answer. <eob>
This is why women, even firewomen, <eob> were expected to be scared. <eob>
This is why women often are scared. <eob>
Now, I know some of you <eol> won't believe me when I tell you this, <eob> but I am not against fear. <eob>
I know it's an important emotion, <eol> and it's there to keep us safe. <eob>
But the problem is <eol> when fear is the primary reaction <eob> that we teach and encourage in girls <eob> whenever they face something <eol> outside their comfort zone. <eob>
So I was a paraglider pilot <eol> for many years -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing, <eob> and it does fly very well, <eob> but to many people I realize <eol> it looks just like a bedsheet <eob> with strings attached. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops <eob> inflating this bedsheet, <eob> running off and flying. <eob>
And I know what you're thinking. <eob>
You're like, Caroline, <eol> a little fear would make sense here. <eob> And you're right, it does. <eob> I assure you, I did feel fear. <eob>
But on that mountaintop, <eob> waiting for the wind <eol> to come in just right, <eob> I felt so many other things, too: <eob> exhilaration, confidence. <eob>
I knew I was a good pilot. <eob> I knew the conditions were good, <eol> or I wouldn't be there. <eob> I knew how great it was going to be <eol> a thousand feet in the air. <eob>
So yes, fear was there, <eob> but I would take a good hard look at it, <eob> assess just how relevant it was <eob> and then put it where it belonged, <eob> which was more often than not <eob> behind my exhilaration, my anticipation <eob> and my confidence. <eob>
So I'm not against fear. <eob>
I'm just pro-bravery. <eob>
Now, I'm not saying <eol> your girls must be firefighters <eob> or that they should be paragliders, <eob> but I am saying that we are raising <eol> our girls to be timid, even helpless, <eob> and it begins when we caution them <eol> against physical risk. <eob>
The fear we learn <eol> and the experiences we don't <eob> stay with us as we become women <eob> and morphs into all those things <eol> that we face and try to shed: <eob> our hesitation in speaking out, <eob> our deference so that we can be liked <eob> and our lack of confidence <eol> in our own decisions. <eob>
So how do we become brave? <eob> Well, here's the good news. <eob> Bravery is learned, <eob> and like anything learned, <eob> it just needs to be practiced. <eob>
So first, <eob> we have to take a deep breath <eob> and encourage our girls <eob> to skateboard, climb trees <eob> and clamber around <eol> on that playground fire pole. <eob>
This is what my own mother did. <eob>
She didn't know it then, <eob> but researchers have a name for this. <eob> They call it risky play, <eob> and studies show that risky play <eol> is really important for kids, all kids, <eob> because it teaches hazard assessment, <eob> it teaches delayed gratification, <eob> it teaches resilience, <eob> it teaches confidence. <eob>
In other words, <eob> when kids get outside <eol> and practice bravery, <eob> they learn valuable life lessons. <eob>
Second, we have to stop <eol> cautioning our girls willy-nilly. <eob>
So notice next time you say, <eob> "Watch out, you're going to get hurt," <eob> or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous." <eob> And remember that often <eol> what you're really telling her <eob> is that she shouldn't be pushing herself, <eob> that she's really not good enough, <eob> that she should be afraid. <eob>
Third, <eob> we women have to start <eol> practicing bravery, too. <eob>
We cannot teach our girls <eol> until we teach ourselves. <eob>
So here's another thing: <eob> fear and exhilaration <eob> feel very similar -- <eob> the shaky hands, <eol> the heightened heart rate, <eob> the nervous tension, <eob> and I'm betting that for many of you <eob> the last time you thought <eol> you were scared out of your wits, <eob> you may have been feeling <eol> mostly exhilaration, <eob> and now you've missed an opportunity. <eob> So practice. <eob> And while girls should be getting <eol> outside to learn to be gutsy, <eob> I get that adults don't want <eol> to get on hoverboards or climb trees, <eob> so we all should be practicing <eob> at home, in the office <eob> and even right here getting up the guts <eob> to talk to someone that you really admire. <eob>
Finally, when your girl is, let's say, <eob> on her bike on the top of the steep hill <eob> that she insists <eol> she's too scared to go down, <eob> guide her to access her bravery. <eob>
Ultimately, maybe that hill <eol> really is too steep, <eob> but she'll come to that conclusion <eol> through courage, not fear. <eob>
Because this is not <eol> about the steep hill in front of her. <eob>
This is about the life ahead of her <eob> and that she has the tools <eob> to handle and assess <eob> all the dangers <eol> that we cannot protect her from, <eob> all the challenges that we won't <eol> be there to guide her through, <eob> everything that our girls here <eob> and around the world <eob> face in their future. <eob>
So by the way, <eob> the world record for crawling today -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
is 35.18 miles, <eob> and I would really love <eol> to see a girl go break that. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code, <eob> on a mission to stop <eol> an unseen force that's rising, <eob> a force that I called "the coded gaze," <eob> my term for algorithmic bias. <eob>
Algorithmic bias, like human bias, <eol> results in unfairness. <eob>
However, algorithms, like viruses, <eol> can spread bias on a massive scale <eob> at a rapid pace. <eob>
Algorithmic bias can also lead <eol> to exclusionary experiences <eob> and discriminatory practices. <eob>
Let me show you what I mean. <eob> (Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera. <eob>
I've got a face. <eob>
Can you see my face? <eob> No-glasses face? <eob> You can see her face. <eob> What about my face? <eob> I've got a mask. <eob>
Can you see my mask? <eob>
Joy Buolamwini: So how did this happen? <eob>
Why am I sitting in front of a computer <eob> in a white mask, <eob> trying to be detected by a cheap webcam? <eob>
Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze <eob> as a poet of code, <eob> I'm a graduate student <eol> at the MIT Media Lab, <eob> and there I have the opportunity to work <eol> on all sorts of whimsical projects, <eob> including the Aspire Mirror, <eob> a project I did so I could project <eol> digital masks onto my reflection. <eob>
So in the morning, if I wanted <eol> to feel powerful, <eob> I could put on a lion. <eob>
If I wanted to be uplifted, <eol> I might have a quote. <eob>
So I used generic <eol> facial recognition software <eob> to build the system, <eob> but found it was really hard to test it <eol> unless I wore a white mask. <eob>
Unfortunately, I've run <eol> into this issue before. <eob>
When I was an undergraduate <eol> at Georgia Tech studying computer science, <eob> I used to work on social robots, <eob> and one of my tasks was to get a robot <eol> to play peek-a-boo, <eob> a simple turn-taking game <eob> where partners cover their face <eol> and then uncover it saying, "Peek-a-boo!" <eob> The problem is, peek-a-boo <eol> doesn't really work if I can't see you, <eob> and my robot couldn't see me. <eob>
But I borrowed my roommate's face <eol> to get the project done, <eob> submitted the assignment, <eob> and figured, you know what, <eol> somebody else will solve this problem. <eob>
Not too long after, <eob> I was in Hong Kong <eol> for an entrepreneurship competition. <eob>
The organizers decided <eol> to take participants <eob> on a tour of local start-ups. <eob>
One of the start-ups had a social robot, <eob> and they decided to do a demo. <eob>
The demo worked on everybody <eol> until it got to me, <eob> and you can probably guess it. <eob>
It couldn't detect my face. <eob>
I asked the developers what was going on, <eob> and it turned out we had used the same <eol> generic facial recognition software. <eob>
Halfway around the world, <eob> I learned that algorithmic bias <eol> can travel as quickly <eob> as it takes to download <eol> some files off of the internet. <eob>
So what's going on? <eob>
Why isn't my face being detected? <eob>
Well, we have to look at <eol> how we give machines sight. <eob>
Computer vision uses <eol> machine learning techniques <eob> to do facial recognition. <eob>
So how this works is, you create <eol> a training set with examples of faces. <eob>
This is a face. This is a face. <eob>
This is not a face. <eob> And over time, you can teach a computer <eol> how to recognize other faces. <eob>
However, if the training sets <eol> aren't really that diverse, <eob> any face that deviates too much <eol> from the established norm <eob> will be harder to detect, <eob> which is what was happening to me. <eob>
But don't worry -- there's some good news. <eob>
Training sets don't just <eol> materialize out of nowhere. <eob>
We actually can create them. <eob>
So there's an opportunity to create <eol> full-spectrum training sets <eob> that reflect a richer <eol> portrait of humanity. <eob>
Now you've seen in my examples <eob> how social robots <eob> was how I found out about exclusion <eol> with algorithmic bias. <eob>
But algorithmic bias can also lead <eol> to discriminatory practices. <eob>
Across the US, <eob> police departments are starting to use <eol> facial recognition software <eob> in their crime-fighting arsenal. <eob>
Georgetown Law published a report <eob> showing that one in two adults <eol> in the US -- that's 117 million people -- <eob> have their faces <eol> in facial recognition networks. <eob>
Police departments can currently look <eol> at these networks unregulated, <eob> using algorithms that have not <eol> been audited for accuracy. <eob>
Yet we know facial recognition <eol> is not fail proof, <eob> and labeling faces consistently <eol> remains a challenge. <eob>
You might have seen this on Facebook. <eob>
My friends and I laugh all the time <eol> when we see other people <eob> mislabeled in our photos. <eob>
But misidentifying a suspected criminal <eol> is no laughing matter, <eob> nor is breaching civil liberties. <eob>
Machine learning is being used <eol> for facial recognition, <eob> but it's also extending beyond the realm <eol> of computer vision. <eob>
In her book, "Weapons <eol> of Math Destruction," <eob> data scientist Cathy O'Neil <eol> talks about the rising new WMDs -- <eob> widespread, mysterious <eol> and destructive algorithms <eob> that are increasingly being used <eol> to make decisions <eob> that impact more aspects of our lives. <eob>
So who gets hired or fired? <eob> Do you get that loan? <eol> Do you get insurance? <eob> Are you admitted into the college <eol> you wanted to get into? <eob>
Do you and I pay the same price <eol> for the same product <eob> purchased on the same platform? <eob>
Law enforcement is also starting <eol> to use machine learning <eob> for predictive policing. <eob>
Some judges use machine-generated <eol> risk scores to determine <eob> how long an individual <eol> is going to spend in prison. <eob>
So we really have to think <eol> about these decisions. <eob> Are they fair? <eob> And we've seen that algorithmic bias <eob> doesn't necessarily always <eol> lead to fair outcomes. <eob> So what can we do about it? <eob> Well, we can start thinking about <eol> how we create more inclusive code <eob> and employ inclusive coding practices. <eob>
It really starts with people. <eob>
So who codes matters. <eob>
Are we creating full-spectrum teams <eol> with diverse individuals <eob> who can check each other's blind spots? <eob>
On the technical side, <eol> how we code matters. <eob>
Are we factoring in fairness <eol> as we're developing systems? <eob>
And finally, why we code matters. <eob>
We've used tools of computational creation <eol> to unlock immense wealth. <eob>
We now have the opportunity <eol> to unlock even greater equality <eob> if we make social change a priority <eob> and not an afterthought. <eob>
And so these are the three tenets <eol> that will make up the "incoding" movement. <eob>
Who codes matters, <eob> how we code matters <eob> and why we code matters. <eob>
So to go towards incoding, <eol> we can start thinking about <eob> building platforms that can identify bias <eob> by collecting people's experiences <eol> like the ones I shared, <eob> but also auditing existing software. <eob>
We can also start to create <eol> more inclusive training sets. <eob>
Imagine a "Selfies for Inclusion" campaign <eob> where you and I can help <eol> developers test and create <eob> more inclusive training sets. <eob>
And we can also start thinking <eol> more conscientiously <eob> about the social impact <eol> of the technology that we're developing. <eob>
To get the incoding movement started, <eob> I've launched the Algorithmic <eol> Justice League, <eob> where anyone who cares about fairness <eol> can help fight the coded gaze. <eob>
On codedgaze.com, you can report bias, <eob> request audits, become a tester <eob> and join the ongoing conversation, <eob> # codedgaze. <eob>
So I invite you to join me <eob> in creating a world where technology <eol> works for all of us, <eob> not just some of us, <eob> a world where we value inclusion <eol> and center social change. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob> But I have one question: <eob> Will you join me in the fight? <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
Why do we think <eob> that stories by men are deemed <eol> to be of universal importance, <eob> and stories by women are thought <eol> to be merely about women? <eob>
My grandmother left school <eol> when she was 12. <eob>
She had 14 children. <eob>
My mother left school when she was 15. <eob> She was a secretary. <eob> I graduated from university <eol> to become a theater director, <eob> and that progress is entirely to do <eol> with the fact that people I'll never meet <eob> fought for women to have rights, <eob> get the vote, get education, <eol> have progress. <eob>
And I'm determined to do the same, <eol> and obviously you are, too. <eob> Why not? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I started a festival called WOW, <eol> Women of the World, seven years ago, <eob> and it's now in 20 countries <eol> across five continents. <eob>
And one of those countries <eol> is Somaliland in Africa. <eob>
So I traveled there last year, <eob> and part of the joy I had in going there <eol> was going to these caves. <eob>
The Laas Geel caves. <eob>
Now, these caves contain some of the oldest <eol> cave paintings in the world. <eob>
These paintings are thought to be <eol> round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old. <eob>
Art: <eob> what humanity has done <eol> ever since it evolved. <eob>
It's how we speak about ourselves, <eob> how we understand our identity, <eob> how we look at our surroundings, <eob> who we find out about each other <eob> because of the meaning of our lives. <eob>
That's what art is for. <eob>
So look at this little picture. <eob> I think it's a little girl. <eob>
I thought it was a bit like me <eol> when I was a little girl. <eob>
And I thought, well, who painted <eol> this joyful, youthful figure? <eob>
And I asked the curator of the caves. <eob>
I said, "Tell me about the men <eol> and women who painted these." <eob> And he looked at me absolutely askance, and he said, <eob> "Women didn't paint these pictures." <eob> And I said, "Well, it was 11,000 years ago." <eob> I said, "How do you know?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he said, "Women don't do these things. <eob>
Men made these marks. Women don't." <eob>
Now, I wasn't really surprised, <eob> because that's an attitude <eol> that I've seen continuously <eob> all my life as a theater maker. <eob>
We are told that divine knowledge <eol> comes down through the masculine, <eob> whether it be to the imam, <eol> the priest, the rabbi, the holy man. <eob>
Similarly, we're told that creative genius <eol> resides in the masculine, <eob> that it is the masculine <eob> that will be able to tell us <eol> about who we really are, <eob> that the masculine will tell <eol> the universal story <eob> on behalf of all of us, <eob> whereas women artists will really <eol> just talk about women's experiences, <eob> women's issues <eol> only really relevant to women <eob> and of passing interest to men -- <eob> and really only some men. <eob>
And it's that conviction, <eob> that that we are taught, <eob> that I think colors so much <eol> of whether we're prepared to believe <eob> that women's stories really matter. <eob>
And unless we're prepared to believe <eob> that women's stories really matter, <eob> then women's rights don't really matter, <eob> and then change can't really come. <eob>
I want to tell you <eol> about two examples of stories <eob> that are thought to be <eol> of universal importance: <eob> "E.T." and "Hamlet." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I took my two children <eol> when they were little -- <eob> Caroline was eight and Robby was five -- <eob> to see "E.T." <eob> And it's a fantastic story <eol> of this little alien <eob> who ends up in an American family <eob> with a mum, two brothers and a sister, <eob> but he wants to go home. <eob>
Not only that, but some <eol> really bad scientists <eob> want to do some experiments on him, <eob> and they're looking for him. <eob>
So the children have a plot. <eob>
They decide they're going to take him <eol> back to his spaceship <eob> as soon as they can, <eob> and they plop him in a bicycle basket, <eob> and off they ride. <eob>
But unfortunately, the baddies <eol> have found out, and they're catching up <eob> and they've got sirens <eol> and they've got their guns, <eob> they've got the loud-hailers, <eol> it's terribly frightening, <eob> and they're closing up on the children, <eob> and the children are never <eol> going to make it. <eob>
And then all of a sudden, magically, <eol> the bikes fly up in the air, <eob> over the clouds, <eob> over the moon, <eob> and they're going to save "E.T." <eob>
So I turn to see my children's faces, <eob> and Robby is enraptured, <eol> he's there with them, he's saving E.T., <eob> he's a happy boy. <eob>
And I turn to Caroline, <eol> and she's crying her eyes out. <eob>
And I said, "What's the matter?" <eob> And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.? <eob>
Why can't I come? <eob> "And then all of a sudden I realized: <eob> they weren't children; <eob> they were boys — <eob> all boys. <eob>
And Caroline, who had invested <eol> so much in E.T., <eob> well, she wasn't invited to save him, <eob> and she felt humiliated and spurned. <eob>
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
and I said, "I don't know <eol> if you understand <eob> the psychological importance <eol> of what's happened, <eob> and are you prepared to pay <eol> for the therapy bills?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Twenty years later, I haven't <eol> had a word back from him, <eob> but I'm still hopeful. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I thought it was interesting, <eob> because if you read reviews <eol> of what he intended with E.T., <eob> he says very specifically, <eob> "I wanted the world to understand <eob> that we should love <eol> and embrace difference." <eob> But somehow he didn't include <eol> the idea of girls' difference <eob> in this thinking. <eob>
He thought he was writing a story <eol> about all humanity. <eob>
Caroline thought he was marginalizing <eob> half of humanity. <eob>
He thought he was writing a story <eol> about human goodness; <eob> she thought he was writing <eol> a lad's heroic adventure. <eob>
And this is common. <eob> Men feel they have been given the mantle <eol> for universal communication, <eob> but of course, how could they be? <eob>
They are writing from male experience <eol> through male's eyes. <eob>
We have to have a look at this ourselves. <eob>
We have to be prepared to go back <eol> through all our books and our films, <eob> all our favorite things, <eob> and say, "Actually, this is written <eol> by a male artist -- <eob> not an artist. <eob> We have to see <eol> that so many of these stories <eob> are written through a male perspective. <eob>
Which is fine, <eob> but then females need to have <eol> 50 percent of the rights <eob> for the stage, the film, the novel, <eob> the place of creativity. <eob>
Let me talk about "Hamlet." <eob> To be or not to be. <eob>
That is the question. <eob>
But it's not my question. <eob>
My question is: Why was I taught <eol> as a young woman <eob> that this was the quintessential <eol> example of human dilemma <eob> and human experience? <eob>
It's a marvelous story, <eob> but actually, it's about a young man <eol> fearful that he won't be able to make it <eob> as a powerful figure in a male world <eob> unless he takes revenge <eol> for his father's murder. <eob>
He talks a great deal to us <eol> about suicide being an option, <eob> but the reality is that the person <eol> who actually commits suicide, Ophelia, <eob> after she's been humiliated <eol> and abused by him, <eob> never gets a chance to talk <eol> to the audience about her feelings. <eob>
And then when he's finished with Ophelia, <eol> he turns on his mum, <eob> because basically she has the audacity <eol> to fall in love with his uncle <eob> and enjoy sex. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It is a great story, <eob> but it is a story about male conflict, <eol> male dilemma, male struggle. <eob>
But I was told this was the story <eol> of human beings, <eob> despite the fact that it only <eol> had two women in it. <eob>
And unless I reeducate myself, <eob> I am always going to think <eob> that women's stories <eol> matter less than men's. <eob>
A woman could have written "Hamlet," <eob> but she would have written it differently, <eob> and it wouldn't have had <eol> global recognition. <eob>
As the writer Margaret Atwood says, <eob> "When a man writes about doing the dishes, <eob> it's realism. <eob>
When a woman writes about doing it, <eob> it's an unfortunate genetic disposition." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, this is not just something <eol> that belongs to then. <eob>
I mean, when I was a young girl, <eob> wanting desperately <eol> to be a theater director, <eob> this is what my male lecturer said to me: <eob> "Well, there are three women <eol> directors in Britain," he said, "Jude." <eob> "There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian, <eol> there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired, <eob> and there's Buzz Goodbody, <eol> who's just killed herself. <eob>
So, which of those three <eol> would you like to be?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, leaving aside <eol> the disgusting slur on gay women, <eob> the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me. <eob>
He thought it was silly <eol> that I wanted to be a director. <eob>
And I told my friend Marin Alsop, <eol> the conductor, and she said, <eob> "Oh yes, well, my music teacher <eol> said exactly the same. <eob>
He said, 'Women don't conduct.'" <eob> But all these years later, <eol> we've made our mark. <eob>
You think, "Well, it'll be different now." <eob> I'm afraid it's not different now. <eob>
The current head <eol> of the Paris Conservatoire <eob> said recently, "It takes <eol> great physical strength <eob> to conduct a symphony, <eob> and women are too weak." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The artist George Baselitz said, <eob> "Well, the fact is women can't paint. <eob>
Well -- they can't paint very well." <eob>
The writer V.S. Naipaul <eol> said two years ago, <eob> "I can read two paragraphs and know <eol> immediately if it's written by a woman, <eob> and I just stop reading, <eol> because it's not worthy of me." <eob>
Audience: Whoa! <eob>
And it goes on. <eob>
We have to find a way <eob> of stopping young girls and women <eob> feeling not only that <eol> their story doesn't matter, <eob> but they're not allowed <eol> to be the storyteller. <eob>
Because once you feel <eol> that you can't stand in the central space <eob> and speak on behalf of the world, <eob> you will feel that you can offer <eol> your goods up to a small, select group. <eob>
You will tend to do smaller work <eol> on smaller stages, <eob> your economic power will be less, <eob> your reach of audiences will be less, <eob> and your credit will be less as an artist. <eob>
And we do finally give artists <eol> these incredible, prominent spaces <eob> in the world, <eob> because they are our storytellers. <eob>
Now, why should it matter to you if you're <eob> not an artist? <eob>
Supposing you're an accountant <eol> or an entrepreneur or a medic <eob> or a scientist: <eob> Should you care about women artists? <eob>
Absolutely, you must, <eob> because as you can see <eol> from the cave paintings, <eob> all civilizations, <eob> all of humanity <eob> have relied upon artists <eol> to tell the human story, <eob> and if the human story <eol> is finally told by men, <eob> take my word for it, <eob> it will be about men. <eob>
So let's make a change. <eob> Let's make a change <eol> to all our institutions, <eob> and not just in the West. <eob>
Don't forget -- this message <eol> of incapability of women <eob> to hold creative genius <eob> is being told to girls and women <eol> in Nigeria, in China, in Russia, <eob> in Indonesia. <eob>
All over the world, girls <eol> and women are being told <eob> that they can't finally hold the idea <eol> of creative inspiration. <eob>
And I want to ask you: <eob> Do you believe that? <eob>
Do you believe that <eob> women can be a creative genius? <eob>
(Applause and cheers) <eob>
Well then, please go forward, <eob> support women artists, <eob> buy their work, <eob> insist that their voices are heard, <eob> find platforms on which <eol> their voices will be made. <eob>
And remember this: <eob> that in a sense, if we're going <eol> to get past this moment <eob> of a world where we know <eol> that we are unequal, <eob> it's artists who have to imagine <eol> a different world. <eob> And I'm calling on all artists, <eol> women and men, <eob> to imagine a gender-equal world. <eob>
Let's film it. <eob> And if we could imagine it, <eob> then we would have the energy <eol> and the stamina <eob> to work towards it. <eob>
When I see this little girl, <eob> 11,000 years ago, <eob> I want to know that the little girl now <eob> can stand there and think <eol> she's entitled to her dreams, <eob> she's entitled to her destiny <eob> and she's entitled to speak <eol> on behalf of the whole world, <eob> be recognized for it <eob> and applauded. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I die, <eob> I would like for my body <eol> to be laid out to be eaten by animals. <eob>
Having your body laid out to be eaten <eol> by animals is not for everyone. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
Maybe you have already had <eol> the end-of-life talk with your family <eob> and decided on, <eol> I don't know, cremation. <eob>
And in the interest of full disclosure, <eob> what I am proposing for my dead body <eol> is not strictly legal at the moment, <eob> but it's not without precedent. <eob>
We've been laying out our dead <eol> for all of human history; <eob> it's call exposure burial. <eob>
In fact, it's likely happening <eol> right now as we speak. <eob>
In the mountainous regions of Tibet, <eob> they practice "sky burial," <eob> a ritual where the body is left <eol> to be consumed by vultures. <eob>
In Mumbai, in India, <eol> those who follow the Parsi religion <eob> put their dead in structures <eol> called "Towers of Silence." <eob> These are interesting cultural tidbits, <eob> but they just haven't really been <eol> that popular in the Western world -- <eob> they're not what you'd expect. <eob>
In America, our death traditions <eol> have come to be chemical embalming, <eob> followed by burial at your local cemetery, <eob> or, more recently, cremation. <eob>
I myself, am a recent vegetarian, <eob> which means I spent the first <eol> 30 years or so of my life <eob> frantically inhaling animals -- <eob> as many as I could get my hands on. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Why, when I die, should they not <eol> have their turn with me? <eob>
Am I not an animal? <eob>
Biologically speaking, <eol> are we not all, in this room, animals? <eob>
Accepting the fact that we are animals <eob> has some potentially <eol> terrifying consequences. <eob>
It means accepting <eol> that we are doomed to decay and die, <eob> just like any other creature on earth. <eob>
For the last nine years, <eol> I've worked in the funeral industry, <eob> first as a crematory operator, <eob> then as a mortician <eob> and most recently, as the owner <eol> of my own funeral home. <eob>
And I have some good news: <eob> if you're looking to avoid the whole <eol> "doomed to decay and die" thing: <eob> you will have all the help <eol> in the world in that avoidance <eob> from the funeral industry. <eob>
It's a multi-billion-dollar industry, <eob> and its economic model <eol> is based on the principle <eob> of protection, sanitation <eol> and beautification of the corpse. <eob>
Whether they mean to or not, <eob> the funeral industry promotes <eol> this idea of human exceptionalism. <eob>
It doesn't matter what it takes, <eob> how much it costs, <eob> how bad it is for the environment, <eob> we're going to do it <eol> because humans are worth it! <eob>
It ignores the fact <eob> that death can be an emotionally messy <eol> and complex affair, <eob> and that there is beauty in decay -- <eob> beauty in the natural return <eol> to the earth from whence we came. <eob>
Now, I don't want you to get me wrong -- <eob> I absolutely understand <eol> the importance of ritual, <eob> especially when it comes <eol> to the people that we love. <eob>
But we have to be able <eol> to create and practice this ritual <eob> without harming the environment, <eob> which is why we need new options. <eob>
So let's return to the idea of protection, <eol> sanitation and beautification. <eob>
We'll start with a dead body. <eob>
The funeral industry <eol> will protect your dead body <eob> by offering to sell your family a casket <eol> made of hardwood or metal <eob> with a rubber sealant. <eob>
At the cemetery, on the day of burial, <eol> that casket will be lowered <eob> into a large concrete or metal vault. <eob>
We're wasting all of these resources -- <eol> concretes, metal, hardwoods -- <eob> hiding them in vast <eol> underground fortresses. <eob>
When you choose burial at the cemetery, <eob> your dead body is not coming anywhere <eol> near the dirt that surrounds it. <eob>
Food for worms <eob> you are not. <eob>
Next, the industry will sanitize <eol> your body through embalming: <eob> the chemical preservation of the dead. <eob>
This procedure drains your blood <eob> and replaces it with a toxic, <eol> cancer-causing formaldehyde. <eob>
They say they do this <eol> for the public health <eob> because the dead body can be dangerous, <eob> but the doctors in this room will tell you <eob> that that claim would only apply <eob> if the person had died of some wildly <eol> infectious disease, like Ebola. <eob>
Even human decomposition, <eol> which, let's be honest, <eob> is a little stinky and unpleasant, <eob> is perfectly safe. <eob>
The bacteria that causes disease <eol> is not the same bacteria <eob> that causes decomposition. <eob>
Finally, the industry <eol> will beautify the corpse. <eob>
They'll tell you that the natural <eol> dead body of your mother or father <eob> is not good enough as it is. <eob>
They'll put it in makeup. <eob> They'll put it in a suit. <eob> They'll inject dyes so the person <eol> looks a little more alive -- <eob> just resting. <eob>
Embalming is a cheat code, <eob> providing the illusion that death <eol> and then decay are not the natural end <eob> for all organic life on this planet. <eob>
Now, if this system of beautification, sanitation, protection <eob> doesn't appeal to you, <eob> you are not <eob> alone. <eob>
There is a whole wave of people -- <eob> funeral directors, designers, <eol> environmentalists -- <eob> trying to come up with a more <eol> eco-friendly way of death. <eob>
For these people, death is not necessarily <eob> a pristine, makeup, <eol> powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair. <eob>
There's no question <eob> that our current methods of death <eol> are not particularly sustainable, <eob> what with the waste of resources <eol> and our reliance on chemicals. <eob>
Even cremation, <eob> which is usually considered <eol> the environmentally friendly option, <eob> uses, per cremation, <eob> the natural gas equivalent <eol> of a 500-mile car trip. <eob>
So where do we go from here? <eob>
Last summer, I was in the mountains <eol> of North Carolina, <eob> hauling buckets of wood chips <eol> in the summer sun. <eob>
I was at Western Carolina University <eol> at their "Body Farm," <eob> more accurately called <eol> a "human decomposition facility." <eob> Bodies donated to science <eol> are brought here, <eob> and their decay is studied <eol> to benefit the future of forensics. <eob>
On this particular day, <eob> there were 12 bodies laid out <eol> in various stages of decomposition. <eob>
Some were skeletonized, <eob> one was wearing purple pajamas, <eob> one still had blonde facial hair visible. <eob>
The forensic aspect is really fascinating, <eob> but not actually why I was there. <eob>
I was there because a colleague of mine <eol> named Katrina Spade <eob> is attempting to create a system, <eol> not of cremating the dead, <eob> but composting the dead. <eob>
She calls the system "Recomposition," <eob> and we've been doing it with cattle <eol> and other livestock for years. <eob>
She imagines a facility <eob> where the family could come <eol> and lay their dead loved one <eob> in a nutrient-rich mixture that would, <eol> in four-to-six weeks, <eob> reduce the body -- bones <eol> and all -- to soil. <eob>
In those four-to-six weeks, <eob> your molecules become other molecules; <eob> you literally transform. <eob>
How would this fit in <eol> with the very recent desire <eob> a lot of people seem to have <eob> to be buried under a tree, <eob> or to become a tree when they die? <eob>
In a traditional cremation, <eol> the ashes that are left over -- <eob> inorganic bone fragments -- <eob> form a thick, chalky layer <eob> that, unless distributed <eol> in the soil just right, <eob> can actually hurt or kill the tree. <eob>
But if you're recomposed, <eol> if you actually become the soil, <eob> you can nourish the tree, <eob> and become the post-mortem contributor <eol> you've always wanted to be -- <eob> that you deserve to be. <eob>
So that's one option <eol> for the future of cremation. <eob>
But what about the future of cemeteries? <eob>
There are a lot of people who think <eol> we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore <eob> because we're running out of land. <eob>
But what if we reframed it, <eob> and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy, <eob> but its potential savior? <eob>
I'm talking about conservation burial, <eob> where large swaths of land <eol> are purchased by a land trust. <eob>
The beauty of this is that once you plant <eol> a few dead bodies in that land, <eob> it can't be touched, <eol> it can't be developed on -- <eob> hence the term, "conservation burial." <eob> It's the equivalent of chaining yourself <eol> to a tree post-mortem -- <eob> "Hell no, I won't go! <eob>
No, really — I can't. <eob>
I'm decomposing under here. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Any money that the family <eol> gives to the cemetery <eob> would go back into protecting <eol> and managing the land. <eob>
There are no headstones <eol> and no graves in the typical sense. <eob>
The graves are scattered <eol> about the property <eob> under elegant mounds, <eob> marked only by a rock <eol> or a small metal disk, <eob> or sometimes only locatable by GPS. <eob> There's no embalming, <eob> no heavy, metal caskets. <eob>
My funeral home sells a few caskets <eob> made out of things like <eol> woven willow and bamboo, <eob> but honestly, most of our families <eol> just choose a simple shroud. <eob>
There are none of the big vaults <eol> that most cemeteries require <eob> just because it makes it easier <eol> for them to landscape. <eob>
Families can come here; <eol> they can luxuriate in nature; <eob> they can even plant a tree or a shrub, <eob> though only native plants <eol> to the area are allowed. <eob>
The dead then blend seamlessly <eol> in with the landscape. <eob>
There's hope in conservation cemeteries. <eob>
They offer dedicated green space <eol> in both urban and rural areas. <eob>
They offer a chance to reintroduce <eol> native plants and animals to a region. <eob>
They offer public trails, <eob> places for spiritual practice, <eob> places for classes and events -- <eob> places where nature and mourning meet. <eob> Most importantly, <eol> they offer us, once again, <eob> a chance to just decompose <eol> in a hole in the ground. <eob>
The soil, <eob> let me tell you, <eob> has missed us. <eob>
I think for a lot of people, <eob> they're starting to get the sense <eob> that our current funeral industry <eol> isn't really working for them. <eob>
For many of us, <eob> being sanitized and beautified <eol> just doesn't reflect us. <eob>
It doesn't reflect <eol> what we stood for during our lives. <eob>
Will changing the way we bury our dead <eol> solve climate change? <eob> No. <eob> But it will make bold moves <eob> in how we see ourselves <eol> as citizens of this planet. <eob>
If we can die in a way <eol> that is more humble and self-aware, <eob> I believe that we stand a chance. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
For several years now, <eob> we've been engaged in a national debate <eol> about sexual assault on campus. <eob>
No question -- <eob> it's crucial that young people <eol> understand the ground rules for consent, <eob> but that's where the conversation <eol> about sex is ending. <eob>
And in that vacuum of information <eob> the media and the Internet -- <eob> that new digital street corner -- <eob> are educating our kids for us. <eob>
If we truly want young people <eol> to engage safely, ethically, <eob> and yes, enjoyably, <eob> it's time to have open honest discussion <eol> about what happens after "yes," <eob> and that includes breaking <eol> the biggest taboo of all <eob> and talking to young people <eob> about women's capacity for <eol> and entitlement to sexual pleasure. <eob> Yeah. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Come on, ladies. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I spent three years <eol> talking to girls ages 15 to 20 <eob> about their attitudes <eol> and experience of sex. <eob>
And what I found was <eob> that while young women may feel <eol> entitled to engage in sexual behavior, <eob> they don't necessarily <eol> feel entitled to enjoy it. <eob>
Take this sophomore <eol> at the Ivy League college <eob> who told me, <eob> "I come from a long line <eol> of smart, strong women. <eob>
My grandmother was a firecracker, <eob> my mom is a professional, <eob> my sister and I are loud, <eol> and that's our form of feminine power. <eob> "She then proceeded to describe her sex life to me: <eob> a series of one-off hookups, <eob> starting when she was 13, <eob> that were... <eob> not especially responsible, <eob> not especially reciprocal <eob> and not especially enjoyable. <eob>
She shrugged. <eob> "I guess we girls are just socialized <eol> to be these docile creatures <eob> who don't express our wants or needs." <eob> "Wait a minute," I replied. <eob> "Didn't you just tell me <eol> what a smart, strong woman you are?" <eob> She hemmed and hawed. <eob> "I guess," she finally said, <eob> "no one told me that that smart, <eol> strong image applies to sex." <eob>
I should probably say right up top <eol> that despite the hype, <eob> teenagers are not engaging in intercourse <eol> more often or at a younger age <eob> than they were 25 years ago. <eob>
They are, however, <eol> engaging in other behavior. <eob>
And when we ignore that, <eob> when we label that as "not sex," <eob> that opens the door <eol> to risky behavior and disrespect. <eob>
That's particularly true of oral sex, <eob> which teenagers consider <eol> to be less intimate than intercourse. <eob>
Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal," <eob> like they'd all read <eol> the same instruction manual -- <eob> at least if boys <eol> were on the receiving end. <eob>
Young women have lots <eol> of reasons for participating. <eob>
It made them feel desired; <eob> it was a way to boost social status. <eob>
Sometimes, it was a way <eol> to get out of an uncomfortable situation. <eob>
As a freshman at a West Coast <eol> college said to me, <eob> "A girl will give a guy a blow job <eol> at the end of the night <eob> because she doesn't <eol> want to have sex with him, <eob> and he expects to be satisfied. <eob>
So, if I want him to leave <eob> and I don't want anything to happen ... " <eob> I heard so many stories <eol> of girls performing one-sided oral sex <eob> that I started asking, <eob> "What if every time <eol> you were alone with a guy, <eob> he told you to get him <eol> a glass of water from the kitchen, <eob> and he never got you a glass of water -- <eob> or if he did, it was like ... <eob> 'you want me to uh ...?'" <eob> You know, totally begrudging. <eob>
You wouldn't stand for it. <eob>
But it wasn't always <eol> that boys didn't want to. <eob>
It was that girls didn't want them to. <eob>
Girls expressed a sense of shame <eol> around their genitals. <eob>
A sense that they were <eol> simultaneously icky and sacred. <eob>
Women's feelings about their genitals <eob> have been directly linked <eol> to their enjoyment of sex. <eob>
Yet, Debby Herbenick, <eol> a researcher at Indiana University, <eob> believes that girls' genital <eol> self-image is under siege, <eob> with more pressure than ever <eob> to see them as unacceptable <eol> in their natural state. <eob>
According to research, <eob> about three-quarters of college women <eol> remove their pubic hair -- all of it -- <eob> at least on occasion, <eob> and more than half do so regularly. <eob>
Girls would tell me that hair removal <eol> made them feel cleaner, <eob> that it was a personal choice. <eob>
Though, I kind of wondered <eol> if left alone on a desert island, <eob> if this was how they would <eol> choose to spend their time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And when I pushed further, <eob> a darker motivation emerged: <eob> avoiding humiliation. <eob> "Guys act like they <eol> would be disgusted by it," <eob> one young woman told me. <eob> "No one wants to be <eol> talked about like that." <eob> The rising pubic hair removal <eol> reminded me of the 1920s, <eob> when women first started regularly <eol> shaving their armpits and their legs. <eob>
That's when flapper dresses <eol> came into style, <eob> and women's limbs were suddenly visible, <eob> open to public scrutiny. <eob>
There's a way that I think <eol> that this too is a sign. <eob> That a girl's most intimate part <eol> is <eob> open to public scrutiny, <eob> open to critique, <eob> to becoming more about how it <eol> looks to someone else <eob> than how it feels to her. <eob>
The shaving trend has sparked <eol> another rise in labiaplasty. <eob>
Labiaplasty, which is the trimming <eol> of the inner and outer labia, <eob> is the fastest-growing cosmetic <eol> surgery among teenage girls. <eob>
It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015, <eob> and whereas girls under 18 comprise <eol> two percent of all cosmetic surgeries, <eob> they are five percent of labiaplasty. <eob>
The most sought-after look, incidentally, <eob> in which the outer labia appear <eol> fused like a clam shell, <eob> is called... wait for it... <eob> "The Barbie." <eob>
(Groan) <eob>
I trust I don't have to tell you <eob> that Barbie is a) made of plastic <eob> and b) has no genitalia. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The labiaplasty trend <eol> has become so worrisome <eob> that the American College <eol> of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <eob> has issued a statement on the procedure, <eob> which is rarely medically indicated, <eob> has not been proven safe <eob> and whose side effects <eol> include scarring, numbness, pain <eob> and diminished sexual sensation. <eob>
Now, admittedly, <eob> and blessedly, <eob> the number of girls involved <eol> is still quite small, <eob> but you could see them <eol> as canaries in a coal mine, <eob> telling us something important <eol> about the way girls see their bodies. <eob>
Sara McClellan, <eob> a psychologist <eol> at the University of Michigan, <eob> coined what is my favorite phrase ever <eol> in talking about all of this: <eob> "Intimate justice." <eob> That's the idea that sex has political, <eol> as well as personal implications, <eob> just like, who does <eol> the dishes in your house, <eob> or who vacuums the rug. <eob>
And it raises similar <eol> issues about inequality, <eob> about economic disparity, <eob> violence, <eob> physical and mental health. <eob>
Intimate justice asks us to consider <eob> who is entitled <eol> to engage in an experience. <eob>
Who is entitled to enjoy it? <eob>
Who is the primary beneficiary? <eob>
And how does each partner <eol> define "good enough"? <eob>
Honestly, I think those questions <eol> are tricky and sometimes traumatic <eob> for adult women to confront, <eob> but when we're talking about girls, <eob> I just kept coming back to the idea <eol> that their early sexual experience <eob> shouldn't have to be <eol> something that they get over. <eob>
In her work, <eob> McClelland found that young women <eol> were more likely than young men <eob> to use their partner's pleasure <eol> as a measure of their satisfaction. <eob>
So they'd say things like, <eob> "If he's sexually satisfied, <eob> then I'm sexually satisfied." <eob> Young men were more likely to measure <eol> their satisfaction by their own orgasm. <eob>
Young women also defined <eol> bad sex differently. <eob>
In the largest ever survey <eob> ever conducted <eol> on American sexual behavior, <eob> they reported pain <eol> in their sexual encounters <eob> 30 percent of the time. <eob>
They also used words like "depressing," <eob> "humiliating," <eob> "degrading." <eob> The young men never used that language. <eob>
So when young women <eol> report sexual satisfaction levels <eob> that are equal to <eol> or greater than young men's -- <eob> and they do in research -- <eob> that can be deceptive. <eob>
If a girl goes into an encounter <eol> hoping that it won't hurt, <eob> wanting to feel close to her partner <eob> and expecting him to have an orgasm, <eob> she'll be satisfied <eol> if those criteria are met. <eob>
And there's nothing wrong with wanting <eol> to feel close to your partner, <eob> or wanting him to be happy, <eob> and orgasm isn't the only <eol> measure of an experience ... <eob> but absence of pain -- <eob> that's a very low bar <eol> for your own sexual fulfillment. <eob>
Listening to all of this <eol> and thinking about it, <eob> I began to realize that we performed <eol> a kind of psychological clitoridectomy <eob> on American girls. <eob>
Starting in infancy, <eob> parents of baby boys are more likely <eol> to name all their body parts, <eob> at least they'll say, <eol> "here's your pee-pee." <eob> Parents of baby girls <eol> go right from navel to knees, <eob> and they leave this whole <eol> situation in here unnamed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There's no better way <eol> to make something unspeakable <eob> than not to name it. <eob>
Then kids go into <eol> their puberty education classes <eob> and they learn that boys <eol> have erections and ejaculations, <eob> and girls have ... <eob> periods and unwanted pregnancy. <eob>
And they see that internal diagram <eol> of a woman's reproductive system -- <eob> you know, the one that looks <eol> kind of like a steer head -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it always grays out between the legs. <eob>
So we never say vulva, <eob> we certainly never say clitoris. <eob>
No surprise, <eob> fewer than half <eol> of teenage girls age 14 to 17 <eob> have ever masturbated. <eob>
And then they go <eol> into their partnered experience <eob> and we expect that somehow <eol> they'll think sex is about them, <eob> that they'll be able to articulate <eol> their needs, their desires, their limits. <eob> It's unrealistic. <eob>
Here's something, though. <eob> Girls' investment <eol> in their partner's pleasure remains <eob> regardless of the gender of the partner. <eob>
So in same-sex encounters, <eob> the orgasm gap disappears. <eob>
And young women climax <eol> at the same rate as men. <eob>
Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me <eob> that they felt liberated <eol> to get off the script -- <eob> free to create an encounter <eol> that worked for them. <eob>
Gay girls also challenged <eol> the idea of first intercourse <eob> as the definition of virginity. <eob>
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal, <eob> but it's worth questioning <eol> why we consider this one act, <eob> which most girls associate <eol> with discomfort or pain, <eob> to be the line in the sand <eol> of sexual adulthood -- <eob> so much more meaningful, <eob> so much more transformative <eol> than anything else. <eob>
And it's worth considering <eol> how this is serving girls; <eob> whether it's keeping them safer <eol> from disease, <eob> coercion, betrayal, assault. <eob>
Whether it's encouraging <eol> mutuality and caring; <eob> what it means about the way <eol> they see other sex acts; <eob> whether it's giving them more control over <eob> and joy in their experience, <eob> and what it means about gay teens, <eob> who can have multiple sex partners <eol> without heterosexual intercourse. <eob>
So I asked a gay girl that I met, <eob> "How'd you know <eol> you weren't a virgin anymore?" <eob> She said she had to Google it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And Google wasn't sure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She finally decided <eol> that she wasn't a virgin anymore <eob> after she'd had <eol> her first orgasm with a partner. <eob>
And I thought -- <eob> whoa. <eob>
What if just for a second <eob> we imagined that was the definition? <eob>
Again, not because <eol> intercourse isn't a big deal -- <eob> of course it is -- <eob> but it isn't the only big deal, <eob> and rather than thinking about sex <eol> as a race to a goal, <eob> this helps us reconceptualize it <eol> as a pool of experiences <eob> that include warmth, affection, arousal, <eob> desire, touch, intimacy. <eob>
And it's worth asking young people: <eob> who's really the more sexually <eol> experienced person? <eob>
The one who makes out <eol> with a partner for three hours <eob> and experiments with sensual <eol> tension and communication, <eob> or the one who gets wasted at a party <eol> and hooks up with a random <eob> in order to dump their "virginity" <eol> before they get to college? <eob>
The only way that shift <eol> in thinking can happen though <eob> is if we talk to young people <eol> more about sex -- <eob> if we normalize those discussions, <eob> integrating them into everyday life, <eob> talking about those intimate acts <eol> in a different way -- <eob> the way we mostly have changed <eob> in the way that we talk <eol> about women in the public realm. <eob>
Consider a survey <eol> of 300 randomly chosen girls <eob> from a Dutch and an American university, <eob> two similar universities, <eob> talking about their early <eol> experience of sex. <eob>
The Dutch girls embodied everything <eol> we say we want from our girls. <eob>
They had fewer negative consequences, <eob> like disease, pregnancy, regret — <eob> more positive outcomes <eob> like being able to communicate <eol> with their partner, <eob> who they said they knew very well; <eob> preparing for the experience <eol> responsibly; <eob> enjoying themselves. <eob>
What was their secret? <eob>
The Dutch girls said <eol> that their doctors, teachers and parents <eob> talked to them candidly, <eob> from an early age, <eob> about sex, pleasure <eol> and the importance of mutual trust. <eob>
What's more, <eob> while American parents weren't necessarily <eol> less comfortable talking about sex, <eob> we tend to frame those conversations <eob> entirely in terms or risk and danger, <eob> whereas Dutch parents talk <eol> about balancing responsibility and joy. <eob>
I have to tell you, <eob> as a parent myself, <eob> that hit me hard, <eob> because I know, <eob> had I not delved into that research, <eob> I would have talked to my own child <eol> about contraception, <eob> about disease protection, <eob> about consent because I'm a modern parent, <eob> and I would have thought ... <eob> job well done. <eob>
Now I know that's not enough. <eob>
I also know what I hope for for our girls. <eob>
I want them to see sexuality <eol> as a source of self-knowledge, <eob> creativity and communication, <eob> despite its potential risks. <eob>
I want them to be able <eol> to revel in their bodies' sensuality <eob> without being reduced to it. <eob>
I want them to be able <eol> to ask for what they want in bed, <eob> and to get it. <eob>
I want them to be safe <eol> from unwanted pregnancy, <eob> disease, <eob> cruelty, <eob> dehumanization, <eob> violence. <eob>
If they are assaulted, <eob> I want them to have recourse <eol> from their schools, <eob> their employers, <eob> the courts. <eob>
It's a lot to ask, <eob> but it's not too much. <eob>
As parents, teachers, <eol> advocates and activists, <eob> we have raised a generation <eol> of girls to have a voice, <eob> to expect egalitarian <eol> treatment in the home, <eob> in the classroom, <eob> in the workplace. <eob>
Now it's time to demand <eol> that intimate justice <eob> in their personal lives as well. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today I want to talk <eol> about the meaning of words, <eob> how we define them <eob> and how they, almost as revenge, <eob> define us. <eob>
The English language <eol> is a magnificent sponge. <eob>
I love the English language. <eob>
I'm glad that I speak it. <eob>
But for all that, it has a lot of holes. <eob>
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism" <eob> which is the hunger for disaster. <eob>
You know, when you see <eol> a thunderstorm on the horizon <eob> and you just find yourself <eol> rooting for the storm. <eob>
In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" -- <eob> I'm not pronouncing that correctly -- <eob> which means the longing <eol> to feel intensely again <eob> the way you did when you were a kid. <eob>
In Polish, they have a word "jouska" <eob> which is the kind of <eol> hypothetical conversation <eob> that you compulsively <eol> play out in your head. <eob>
And finally, in German, <eol> of course in German, <eob> they have a word called "zielschmerz" <eob> which is the dread <eol> of getting what you want. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream. <eob>
I'm German myself, <eol> so I know exactly what that feels like. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure <eol> if I would use any of these words <eob> as I go about my day, <eob> but I'm really glad they exist. <eob>
But the only reason they exist <eol> is because I made them up. <eob>
I am the author of "The Dictionary <eol> of Obscure Sorrows," <eob> which I've been writing <eol> for the last seven years. <eob>
And the whole mission of the project <eob> is to find holes <eol> in the language of emotion <eob> and try to fill them <eob> so that we have a way of talking <eol> about all those human peccadilloes <eob> and quirks of the human condition <eob> that we all feel <eol> but may not think to talk about <eob> because we don't have the words to do it. <eob>
And about halfway through this project, <eob> I defined "sonder," <eob> the idea that we all think of ourselves <eol> as the main character <eob> and everyone else is just extras. <eob>
But in reality, <eol> we're all the main character, <eob> and you yourself are an extra <eol> in someone else's story. <eob>
And so as soon as I published that, <eob> I got a lot of response from people <eob> saying, "Thank you for giving voice <eol> to something I had felt all my life <eob> but there was no word for that." <eob> So it made them feel less alone. <eob>
That's the power of words, <eob> to make us feel less alone. <eob>
And it was not long after that <eob> that I started to notice sonder <eob> being used earnestly <eol> in conversations online, <eob> and not long after I actually noticed it, <eob> I caught it next to me <eol> in an actual conversation in person. <eob>
There is no stranger feeling <eol> than making up a word <eob> and then seeing it <eol> take on a mind of its own. <eob>
I don't have a word <eol> for that yet, but I will. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm working on it. <eob>
I started to think <eol> about what makes words real, <eob> because a lot of people ask me, <eob> the most common thing <eol> I got from people is, <eob> "Well, are these words made up? <eob>
I don't really understand. <eob> "And I didn't really know what to tell them <eob> because once sonder started to take off, <eob> who am I to say what words <eol> are real and what aren't. <eob>
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs, <eol> who described his epiphany <eob> as when he realized that most of us, <eol> as we go through the day, <eob> we just try to avoid <eol> bouncing against the walls too much <eob> and just sort of get on with things. <eob>
But once you realize that people -- <eob> that this world was built <eol> by people no smarter than you, <eob> then you can reach out <eol> and touch those walls <eob> and even put your hand through them <eob> and realize that you have <eol> the power to change it. <eob>
And when people ask me, <eol> "Are these words real?" <eob> I had a variety of answers <eol> that I tried out. <eob>
Some of them made sense. <eol> Some of them didn't. <eob>
But one of them I tried out was, <eob> "Well, a word is real <eol> if you want it to be real." <eob> The way that this path is real <eol> because people wanted it to be there. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It happens on college <eol> campuses all the time. <eob> It's called a "desire path." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But then I decided, <eol> what people are really asking <eob> when they're asking if a word is real, <eol> they're really asking, <eob> "Well, how many brains <eol> will this give me access to?" <eob> Because I think that's <eol> a lot of how we look at language. <eob>
A word is essentially a key <eob> that gets us into certain people's heads. <eob>
And if it gets us into one brain, <eob> it's not really worth it, <eob> not really worth knowing. <eob> Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is. <eob> A million brains, OK, now we're talking. <eob>
And so a real word is one that gets you <eol> access to as many brains as you can. <eob>
That's what makes it worth knowing. <eob>
Incidentally, the realest word of all <eol> by this measure is this. <eob>
[O.K.] <eob>
That's it. <eob> The realest word we have. <eob>
That is the closest thing we have <eol> to a master key. <eob>
That's the most commonly <eol> understood word in the world, <eob> no matter where you are. <eob>
The problem with that is, <eob> no one seems to know <eol> what those two letters stand for. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which is kind of weird, right? <eob>
I mean, it could be a misspelling <eol> of "all correct," I guess, <eob> or "old kinderhook." <eob> No one really seems to know, <eol> but the fact that it doesn't matter <eob> says something about <eol> how we add meaning to words. <eob>
The meaning is not <eol> in the words themselves. <eob>
We're the ones <eol> that pour ourselves into it. <eob>
And I think, when we're all searching <eol> for meaning in our lives, <eob> and searching for the meaning of life, <eob> I think words have <eol> something to do with that. <eob>
And I think if you're looking <eol> for the meaning of something, <eob> the dictionary is a decent place to start. <eob>
It brings a sense of order <eob> to a very chaotic universe. <eob>
Our view of things is so limited <eob> that we have to come up <eol> with patterns and shorthands <eob> and try to figure out <eol> a way to interpret it <eob> and be able to get on with our day. <eob>
We need words to contain us, <eol> to define ourselves. <eob>
I think a lot of us feel boxed in <eob> by how we use these words. <eob>
We forget that words are made up. <eob>
It's not just my words. <eol> All words are made up, <eob> but not all of them mean something. <eob>
We're all just sort of <eol> trapped in our own lexicons <eob> that don't necessarily correlate <eol> with people who aren't already like us, <eob> and so I think I feel us drifting apart <eol> a little more every year, <eob> the more seriously we take words. <eob>
Because remember, words are not real. <eob>
They don't have meaning. We do. <eob>
And I'd like to leave you with a reading <eob> from one of my favorite philosophers, <eob> Bill Watterson, who created <eol> "Calvin and Hobbes." <eob> He said, <eob> "Creating a life that reflects <eol> your values and satisfies your soul <eob> is a rare achievement. <eob>
To invent your own life's meaning <eob> is not easy, <eob> but it is still allowed, <eob> and I think you'll be <eol> happier for the trouble." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We all have milestones in life <eol> that we remember so vividly. <eob>
The first one for me <eol> was when I was entering kindergarten. <eob>
My big brother was in school, <eol> and by golly, it was my time. <eob>
And I went trottin' down that hallway. <eob>
I was so excited, I almost wet myself. <eob>
And I go to the door, <eob> and there was the teacher <eol> with a warm welcome, <eob> and she took me into the classroom, <eob> showed me my little cubbyhole -- <eob> we all remember <eol> those little cubbyholes, don't we -- <eob> and we put our stuff in there. <eob> And then she said, "Go over to the circle <eob> and play with the kids until class starts." <eob> So I went over there and plopped <eol> down like I owned the place, <eob> and I'm playing, <eob> and all of a sudden, the boy next to me, <eob> he was wearing a white shirt with blue shorts. <eob> I remember it like it was yesterday. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And in a louder voice, he said, <eob> "Hey, why are you so short?" <eob> So I looked up and I said, <eob> "What are you talking about? <eol> Let's just play. We're happy. <eob> I've been waiting for this." <eob>
And so we played, <eol> and about a minute later, <eob> the girl next to him, <eol> in a white shirt and a pink skirt, <eob> stood up, put her hands on her hips, <eob> and said, "Yeah, why do you <eol> look so different?" <eob> And I went, "What are you talking about? <eob>
I don't look different. <eob>
I'm not short. Again, let's just play. " <eob>
About this time, I looked <eol> all around the circle I was in, <eob> and all the kids had stopped playing <eol> and they were all looking at me. <eob>
And I'm thinking -- <eob> in today's language, it would be <eol> "OMG" or "WTF." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What just happened? <eob>
So all the confidence <eol> that I went in with that morning <eob> was withering away as the morning went on <eob> and the questions kept coming. <eob>
And at the end of the morning, <eol> before I went home, <eob> the teacher had us in a circle, <eob> and I actually found myself outside of the circle. <eob>
I couldn't look at anybody. <eob>
I could not understand what just happened. <eob>
And over the next few years, <eob> I hated to go out in public. <eob>
I felt every stare, every giggle, <eob> every pointed finger, <eob> not the finger, <eob> but every pointed finger, <eob> and I hated it. <eob>
I would hide behind my parents' legs <eol> like nobody could see me. <eob>
And as a child, <eob> you can't understand <eol> another child's curiosity, <eob> nor an adult's ignorance. <eob>
It became very apparent to me <eol> that the real world was not built <eob> for someone of my size, <eol> both literally or figuratively. <eob>
And so I have no anonymity, <eol> as you can probably tell, <eob> and while you can see my size, <eob> we all go through many challenges <eol> through our lifetime. <eob>
And some you can see, like mine. <eob>
Most you can't. <eob>
You can't tell if someone's <eol> dealing with a mental illness, <eob> or they're struggling with their gender identity, <eob> they're caring for an aging parent, <eob> they're having financial difficulty. <eob>
You can't see that kind of stuff. <eob>
So while you can see <eob> one of my challenges is my size, <eob> seeing does not mean you understand <eob> what it's truly to be me <eol> on a daily basis, or what I go through. <eob>
And so I'm here to debunk a myth. <eob>
I do not believe you can walk <eol> in someone else's shoes, <eob> and because of that, we must adopt <eol> a new way of giving of ourselves. <eob>
Simply stated, I will never know <eol> what it's like to be you <eob> and you will never know <eol> what it's like to be me. <eob>
I cannot face your fears <eol> or chase your dreams, <eob> and you can't do that for me, <eob> but we can be supportive of each other. <eob>
Instead of trying to walk <eol> in each other's shoes, <eob> we must adopt a new way <eol> of giving of ourselves. <eob>
I learned at an early age <eob> that I did have to do some things <eol> different than most people, <eob> but I also learned there were things <eol> I was on equal footing with, <eob> and one of those was the classroom. <eob>
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal. <eob> As a matter of fact, <eol> I excelled in the classroom. <eob>
This was vitally important, <eol> I discovered as I grew older <eob> and realized I wasn't going to be able <eol> to do a physical job. <eob>
I needed an education. <eob>
So I went on and got a university degree, <eob> but I felt to be one step ahead of everyone <eol> for employment, <eob> I needed to have an advanced university degree, <eob> so I went ahead and got that. <eob>
Now I'm ready for my interview. <eob>
Remember your first interview? <eol> What am I going to wear? <eob> What questions? <eob> And don't forget that firm handshake. <eob>
I was right there with you. <eob>
So 24 hours before my interview, <eob> a friend of mine who I've known all my life <eob> called and said, "Michele, the building <eol> you're going in has steps." <eob> And she knew I couldn't climb steps. <eob>
So suddenly, my focus changed. <eob>
In my shoes, I was worried about <eol> how am I going to get there? <eob>
So I went early and found a loading dock <eol> and got in and had a great interview. <eob>
They had no idea what I went through <eol> for the day and that's OK. <eob>
You're probably thinking my greatest <eol> challenge that day was the interview, <eob> or getting in the building. <eob>
In reality, my biggest challenge that day <eob> was getting through the loading dock <eol> without getting run over. <eob>
I am very vulnerable <eol> in certain situations: <eob> airports, hallways, parking lots, <eob> loading docks. <eob>
And so I have to be very careful. <eob> I have to anticipate and be flexible <eob> and move as quickly as I can sometimes. <eob>
So I got the job, <eob> and in my current role <eol> I travel quite a bit. <eob>
And travel is a challenge <eol> for all of us these days. <eob>
And so you probably get to the airport, <eol> run through security, get to the gate. <eob>
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat? <eol> Did I get my upgrade? <eob> Me, first of all, <eol> I don't run through anything. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I especially don't run through the TSA <eob> because I get to experience <eol> the personal patdown. <eob>
I won't comment on that. <eob>
And then I make my way to the gate, <eob> and with my gift of gab <eol> that my parents said I was born with, <eob> I talk to the gate agent, and then I say, <eol> "By the way, my scooter weighs this much, <eob> I have a dry cell battery, <eob> and I can drive it down to the door of the plane." <eob> Also, the day before, <eol> I had called the city where I'm traveling to <eob> to find out where I could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken on the way. <eob>
So in my shoes, <eol> it's a little bit different. <eob>
When I get onto the plane, <eob> I use my gift of gab <eob> to ask the lady to put my bag up, <eol> and they graciously do. <eob>
I try not to eat <eol> or drink on a plane <eob> because I don't want to have <eol> to get up and walk on the plane, <eob> but nature has its own schedule, <eob> and not long ago, it knocked and I answered. <eob>
So I walked up to the front of the plane <eob> and gabbed with the flight attendant, <eob> and said, "Can you watch the door? <eob>
I can't reach the lock. <eob> "So I'm in there doing my business, <eol> and the door flies open. <eob>
And there's a gentleman there <eob> with a look of horror on his face. <eob>
I'm sure I had the same look. <eob>
As I came out, I noticed <eol> that he was sitting right across from me, <eob> and he's in total, complete embarrassment. <eob>
So I walk up to him <eol> and I quietly go, <eob> "Are you going to remember <eol> this as much as I am?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he goes, "I think so." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, while he's probably not talking <eol> about it publicly, I am. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we talked for the rest of the flight, <eob> and we got to know each other, <eol> our families, sports, work, <eob> and when we landed, he said, <eob> "Michele, I noticed someone <eol> put your bag up. <eob>
Can I get that for you?" <eob> And I said, "Of course, thank you." <eob> And we wished each other well, <eob> and the most important thing that day <eob> was that he was not going to leave <eol> with that embarrassment, <eob> that experience of embarrassment. <eob>
He won't forget it, and neither will I, <eob> but I think he will remember more <eob> our chat and our different perspectives. <eob>
When you travel internationally, <eob> it can be even more challenging <eol> in certain ways. <eob>
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar, <eob> and I come wheeling in, <eob> and think about that. <eob> Short, white, blond woman in a chair. <eob>
That doesn't probably happen every day. <eob>
So I go up, and with my gift of gab, <eol> I start to talk to the agent. <eob>
So friendly, and I ask <eol> about their culture and so forth, <eob> and I notice there wasn't <eol> a jet bridge. <eob>
So I had to kind of say, <eob> "Not only do you have to lift my chair, <eob> I could use some help getting up the steps." <eob> So we got to spend about an hour <eol> together while we waited for the flight, <eob> and it was the most magnificent hour. <eob>
Our perspective changed <eol> for both of us that day. <eob>
And once I got on the flight, <eob> he patted me on the back <eol> and wished me well, <eob> and I thanked him so much. <eob>
And again, I think he's going <eol> to remember that experience more <eob> than when I first came in, <eol> and there was a bit of hesitation. <eob>
And as you notice, I get a lot of help. <eob>
I would not be where I am today <eob> if it was not for my family, <eol> my friends, my colleagues <eob> and the many strangers <eob> that help me every single day of my life. <eob>
And it's important that we all <eol> have a support system. <eob>
Asking for help is a strength, <eob> not a weakness. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We all need help <eol> throughout our lifetime, <eob> but it is just as important <eob> that we are part of other <eol> people's support systems. <eob>
We must adopt that way of giving back. <eob>
We all obviously have a role <eol> to play in our own successes, <eob> but think about the role we have to play <eol> in other people's successes, <eob> just like people do for me <eol> every single day. <eob>
It's vitally important <eol> that we help each other, <eob> because society is increasingly <eol> placing people in silos <eob> based on biases and ideologies. <eob>
And we must look past the surface <eob> and be confronted with the truth <eob> that none of us are what you can see. <eob>
There's more to us than that, <eob> and we're all dealing with things <eol> that you cannot see. <eob>
So living a life free of judgment <eob> allows all of us <eol> to share those experiences together <eob> and have a totally different perspective, <eob> just like the couple of people <eol> I mentioned earlier in my stories. <eob>
So remember, the only shoes <eob> you truly can walk in are your own. <eob>
I cannot walk in yours. <eob>
I know you can't walk in my size 1s -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but you can try. <eob> But we can do something better than that. <eob>
With compassion, courage and understanding, <eob> we can walk side by side <eob> and support one another, <eob> and think about how society can change <eob> if we all do that <eob> instead of judging on only what you can see. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
In the last couple of years, <eob> I have produced what I call <eol> "The Dead Mall Series," <eob> 32 short films and counting <eol> about dead malls. <eob>
Now, for those of you who are <eol> not familiar with what a dead mall is, <eob> it's basically a shopping mall <eob> that has fallen into hard times. <eob>
So it either has few shops <eol> and fewer shoppers, <eob> or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin. <eob>
No sale at Penny's. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I started producing this series <eob> in early 2015 <eob> after going through <eol> kind of a dark period in my life <eob> where I just didn't want <eol> to create films anymore. <eob>
I put my camera away <eob> and I just stopped. <eob>
So in 2015, I decided to make <eol> a short film about the Owings Mills Mall. <eob>
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986. <eob>
I should know because <eol> I was there on opening day. <eob>
I was there with my family, <eob> along with every other <eol> family in Baltimore, <eob> and you had to drive around <eob> for 45 minutes <eob> just to find a parking spot. <eob>
So if you can imagine, <eob> that's not happening at the malls today. <eob>
My first mall job that I had as a teenager <eob> was at a sporting goods store <eol> called Herman's World of Sports. <eob> Maybe you remember. <eob>
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports. <eob>
You guys remember that? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store. <eob>
I worked in a leather goods store, <eob> and I also worked in a video store, <eob> and not being one who was <eol> very fond of the retail arts -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I got fired from every single job. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In between these low-paying retail jobs, <eob> I did what any normal teenager did <eob> in the 1990s. <eob> I shoplifted. <eob> I'm just kidding. <eob>
I hung out with my friends at the mall. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Everyone's like, "Oh my God, <eol> what kind of talk is this?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Hanging out at the mall could be fun, <eol> but it could be really lame, too, <eob> like sharing a cigarette <eol> with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat <eob> who has put on <eol> black lipstick for the night <eob> while you're on your break <eol> from your crappy minimum wage job. <eob>
As I stand here today, <eob> Owings Mills has been gutted <eob> and it's ready for the wrecking ball. <eob>
The last time I was there, <eol> it was in the evening, <eob> and it was about three days <eol> before they closed the mall for good. <eob>
And you kind of felt -- <eob> they never announced the mall was closing, <eob> but you had this sort of feeling, <eol> this ominous feeling, <eob> that something big was going to happen, <eob> like it was the end of the road. <eob> It was a very creepy walk <eol> through the mall. <eob>
Let me show you. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
So when I started producing <eol> "The Dead Mall Series," <eob> I put the videos up onto YouTube, <eob> and while I thought they were interesting, <eob> frankly I didn't think others <eol> would share the enthusiasm <eob> for such a drab and depressing topic. <eob>
But apparently I was wrong, <eob> because a lot of people <eol> started to comment. <eob>
And at first the comments were like -- <eob> basically like, "Oh my God, <eol> that's the mall from my childhood. <eob>
What happened? <eob> "And then I would get comments from people <eol> who were like," <eob> There's a dead mall in my town. <eob>
You should come and film it. <eob> "So I started to travel <eol> around the mid-Atlantic region <eob> filming these dead malls. <eob> Some were open. <eob> Some were abandoned. <eob> It was kind of always hard <eol> to get into the ones that were abandoned, <eob> but I somehow always found a way in. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The malls that are still open, <eob> they always do this weird thing -- <eol> like the dead malls. <eob>
They'll have three stores left, <eob> but they try to spruce it up <eob> to make it appear <eol> like things are on the up-and-up. <eob>
For example, <eob> you'll have an empty store <eob> and they bring the gate down. <eob>
So at Owings Mills, for example, <eol> they put this tarp over the gate. <eob> Right? <eob> And it's got a stock photo <eob> of a woman who is so happy <eob> and she's holding a blouse, <eob> and she's like -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then there's a guy <eol> standing next to her, with, like, <eob> an espresso cup, and he's like -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it says, "What brings you today?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I wanted to be scared and depressed. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
So the comments just kept pouring in <eob> on the videos, <eob> from all over the country, <eol> and then all over the world. <eob>
And I started to think, <eol> this could really be something, <eob> but I had to get creative, <eol> because I'm like, <eob> how long are people going to sit and watch <eol> me waddling through an empty mall? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the original episodes <eol> I filmed with an iPhone. <eob>
So I'd walk through the mall <eol> with an iPhone, and, you know. <eob> Like that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And security -- because malls, <eol> they don't like photography -- <eob> so the security would come up and be like, <eol> "Put that away," and I'm like, "OK." <eob> So I had to get creative and sneaky, <eob> so I started using a hidden camera <eol> and different techniques <eob> to get the footage that I needed, <eob> and basically what I wanted to do <eob> was make the video <eob> like it was a first-person experience, <eob> like you are sitting -- <eob> put your headphones on <eol> watching the screen -- <eob> it's like, you're there in the video, <eob> like a video game, basically. <eob>
I also started to use music, <eob> collaborating with artists <eol> who create music called vaporwave. <eob> And vaporwave is a music genre <eob> that emerged in the early 2010s <eol> among internet communities. <eob> Here's an example. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
That's by an artist named Disconscious <eob> from an album he did <eol> called "Hologram Plaza." <eob> So if you look that up, <eol> you can hear more of those tunes. <eob>
Vaporwave is more than an art form. <eol> It's like a movement. <eob>
It's nihilistic, it's angsty, <eob> but it's somehow comforting. <eob>
The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing <eol> with things you can't do anything about, <eob> like no jobs, or sitting in your parents' <eol> basement eating ramen noodles. <eob>
Vaporwave came out of this generation's <eol> desire to express their hopelessness, <eob> the same way that <eol> the pre-internet generation did <eob> sitting around in the food court. <eob>
One of my favorite malls <eob> I've been to <eob> is in Corpus Christi, <eol> and it's called the Sunrise Mall. <eob>
When I was a kid, <eob> my favorite thing to do was watch movies, <eob> and I used to watch movies <eol> over and over and over again. <eob>
And one of my favorite films <eol> was "The Legend of Billie Jean." <eob> Now, for those of you who have seen <eol> "The Legend of Billie Jean," <eob> you'll know that it's a great film. <eob> I love it. <eob> And Helen Slater and Christian Slater -- <eob> and if you didn't know, <eol> they are not related. <eob>
Many people thought that they <eol> were brother and sister. They're not. <eob> But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used <eol> in the film as a filming location. <eob>
The mall is exactly the same <eol> as it was in 1984. <eob>
We're talking 32 years later. <eob> Let me show you. <eob>
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean <eol> running across the fountain, <eob> being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends. <eob>
And she jumps over here. <eob>
And you can see the shot right here <eol> is what it looks like today. <eob> It's pretty incredible. <eob>
I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same. <eob>
And there they are <eol> falling in the fountain, <eob> and she runs up the stairs. <eob>
This is a nice shot <eol> of the whole thing here. <eob>
Dan Bell: I love that so much. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I always think in my head, <eol> if I owned a dead mall -- <eob> why don't they embrace their vintage look? <eob>
Put in a bar, <eob> like, put vegan food <eol> in the food court <eob> and invite millennials and hipsters <eob> to come and drink and eat, <eob> and I guarantee you within three weeks <eob> H & amp; M and Levi's will be banging <eol> on the door trying to get space. <eob>
I don't know why they don't do this, <eob> but apparently, <eob> it's only in my mind, it goes all day. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Anyway, in closing -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When they first asked me to do this talk, <eob> I said, <eob> "Do you have the right person?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
These talks are supposed <eol> to be kind of inspiring and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I remembered something, though. <eob>
I put my camera down <eol> three or four years ago, <eob> and it took going to these malls <eob> for me to be inspired again. <eob>
And to see my audience <eob> and people from all over the world <eol> writing me and saying, <eob> "God, I love your videos," <eob> is incredible. <eob>
I don't know how to even explain it, <eob> as an artist, <eob> how fulfilling that is. <eob>
If you would have told me a year ago <eob> that I would be standing on this stage <eob> talking to all of you wonderful people, <eob> I would have never believed it. <eob>
I am humbled <eob> and so appreciative. <eob>
Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Well, as many of you know, <eob> the results of the recent <eol> election were as follows: <eob> Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate <eob> won a landslide victory <eob> with 52 percent of the overall vote. <eob>
Jill Stein, the Green candidate, <eob> came a distant second, with 19 percent. <eob>
Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate, <eob> was hot on her heels <eol> with 14 percent, <eob> and the remainder of the vote <eol> were shared between abstainers <eob> and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, what parallel universe <eol> do you suppose I live in? <eob>
Well, I don't live in a parallel universe. <eob>
I live in the world, and that <eol> is how the world voted. <eob>
So let me take you back <eol> and explain what I mean by that. <eob>
In June this year, <eob> I launched something called <eol> the Global Vote. <eob>
And the Global Vote does exactly <eol> what it says on the tin. <eob>
For the first time in history, <eob> it lets anybody, <eol> anywhere in the world, <eob> vote in the elections <eol> of other people's countries. <eob> Now, why would you do that? <eob> What's the point? <eob>
Well, let me show you what it looks like. <eob>
You go to a website, <eob> rather a beautiful website, <eob> and then you select an election. <eob>
Here's a bunch that we've already covered. <eob>
We do about one a month, or thereabouts. <eob>
So you can see Bulgaria, the United States of America, <eob> Secretary-General of the United Nations, <eob> the Brexit referendum at the end there. <eob>
You select the election <eol> that you're interested in, <eob> and you pick the candidates. <eob>
These are the candidates <eol> from the recent presidential election <eob> in the tiny island nation of São Tomé <eol> and Príncipe, <eob> 199,000 inhabitants, <eob> off the coast of West Africa. <eob>
And then you can look at the brief summary <eol> of each of those candidates <eob> which I dearly hope is very neutral, <eob> very informative and very succinct. <eob>
And when you've found the one <eol> you like, you vote. <eob>
These were the candidates <eob> in the recent Icelandic presidential election, <eob> and that's the way it goes. <eob>
So why on earth would you want to vote <eol> in another country's election? <eob>
Well, the reason that you wouldn't <eol> want to do it, <eob> let me reassure you, <eob> is in order to interfere in the democratic <eol> processes of another country. <eob>
That's not the purpose at all. <eob>
In fact, you can't, <eob> because usually what I do <eol> is I release the results <eob> after the electorate in each individual country <eol> has already voted, <eob> so there's no way that we could <eol> interfere in that process. <eob>
But more importantly, <eob> I'm not particularly interested <eob> in the domestic issues <eol> of individual countries. <eob>
That's not what we're voting on. <eob>
So what Donald J. Trump <eol> or Hillary Clinton proposed to do for the Americans <eob> is frankly none of our business. <eob>
That's something that only <eol> the Americans can vote on. <eob>
No, in the global vote, <eol> you're only considering one aspect of it, <eob> which is what are those leaders <eol> going to do for the rest of us? <eob>
And that's so very important because we live, <eob> as no doubt you're sick <eol> of hearing people tell you, <eob> in a globalized, hyperconnected, <eol> massively interdependent world <eob> where the political decisions <eol> of people in other countries <eob> can and will have an impact on our lives <eob> no matter who we are, no matter where we live. <eob>
Like the wings of the butterfly <eob> beating on one side of the Pacific <eob> that can apparently create <eol> a hurricane on the other side, <eob> so it is with the world <eol> that we live in today <eob> and the world of politics. <eob>
There is no longer a dividing line between domestic <eol> and international affairs. <eob>
Any country, no matter how small, <eob> even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe, <eob> could produce the next Nelson Mandela <eob> or the next Stalin. <eob>
They could pollute the atmosphere <eol> and the oceans, which belong to all of us, <eob> or they could be responsible <eol> and they could help all of us. <eob>
And yet, the system is so strange <eob> because the system hasn't caught up <eol> with this globalized reality. <eob>
Only a small number of people are allowed <eol> to vote for those leaders, <eob> even though their impact is gigantic <eob> and almost universal. <eob>
What number was it? <eob>
140 million Americans voted <eob> for the next president <eol> of the United States, <eob> and yet, as all of us knows, <eol> in a few weeks time, <eob> somebody is going to hand over <eol> the nuclear launch codes <eob> to Donald J. Trump. <eob>
Now, if that isn't having <eol> a potential impact on all of us, <eob> I don't know what is. <eob>
Similarly, the election for the referendum <eol> on the Brexit vote, <eob> a small number of millions <eol> of British people voted on that, <eob> but the outcome of the vote, <eol> whichever way it went, <eob> would have had a significant impact <eob> on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions <eol> of people around the world. <eob>
And yet, only a tiny number could vote. <eob>
What kind of democracy is that? <eob>
Huge decisions that affect all of us <eob> being decided by relatively very <eol> small numbers of people. <eob>
And I don't know about you, <eob> but I don't think that sounds <eol> very democratic. <eob>
So I'm trying to clear it up. <eob>
But as I say, <eob> we don't ask about domestic questions. <eob>
In fact, I only ever ask two questions <eol> of all of the candidates. <eob>
I send them the same two questions <eol> every single time. <eob>
I say, one, <eob> if you get elected, what are you going <eol> to do for the rest of us, <eob> for the remainder <eol> of the seven billion who live on this planet? <eob> Second question: <eob> What is your vision <eol> for your country's future in the world? <eob>
What role do you see it playing? <eob> Every candidate, I send them <eol> those questions. <eob>
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong. <eob>
I reckon if you're standing <eob> to become the next president <eol> of the United States, <eob> you're probably pretty tied up most of the time, <eob> so I'm not altogether surprised <eol> that they don't all answer, but many do. <eob> More every time. <eob> And some of them do much more than answer. <eob>
Some of them answer <eol> in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way <eob> you could imagine. <eob>
I just want to say a word here <eol> for Saviour Chishimba, <eob> who was one of the candidates <eob> in the recent Zambian presidential election. <eob>
His answers to those two questions <eol> were basically an 18-page dissertation <eob> on his view of Zambia's potential role in the world <eob> and in the international community. <eob>
I posted it on the website <eol> so anybody could read it. <eob>
Now, Saviour won the global vote, <eob> but he didn't win the Zambian election. <eob>
So I found myself wondering, <eob> what am I going to do <eol> with this extraordinary group of people? <eob>
I've got some wonderful people <eol> here who won the global vote. <eob>
We always get it wrong, by the way. <eob>
The one that we elect <eob> is never the person <eol> who's elected by the domestic electorate. <eob>
That may be partly because we always <eol> seem to go for the woman. <eob>
But I think it may also be a sign <eob> that the domestic electorate <eol> is still thinking very nationally. <eob>
They're still thinking very inwardly. <eob>
They're still asking themselves: <eol> What's in it for me? ... <eob> instead of what they should be asking today, <eob> which is, what's in it for we? <eob>
But there you go. <eob> So suggestions, please, not right now, <eob> but send me an email <eol> if you've got an idea <eob> about what we can do with this amazing team <eol> of glorious losers. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> We've got Saviour Chishimba, who I mentioned before. <eob>
We've got Halla Tómasdóttir, <eob> who was the runner up in the Icelandic presidential election. <eob>
Many of you may have seen her <eol> amazing talk at TEDWomen <eob> just a few weeks ago <eob> where she spoke about the need <eol> for more women to get into politics. <eob>
We've got Maria das Neves <eol> from São Tomé and Príncipe. <eob>
We've got Hillary Clinton. <eob>
I don't know if she's available. <eob>
We've got Jill Stein. <eob>
And we covered also the election <eob> for the next <eob> Secretary-General of the United Nations. <eob>
We've got the ex-prime minister <eol> of New Zealand, <eob> who would be a wonderful member of the team. <eob>
So I think maybe those people, <eob> the glorious loser's club, <eol> could travel around the world <eob> wherever there's an election <eob> and remind people of the necessity <eol> in our modern age <eob> of thinking a little bit outwards <eob> and thinking of the international consequences. <eob>
So what comes next for the global vote? <eob>
Well, obviously, <eob> the Donald and Hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow, <eob> but there are some other really important elections <eol> coming up. <eob>
In fact, they seem to be multiplying. <eob>
There's something going on, <eol> I'm sure you've noticed, in the world. <eob>
And the next row of elections <eol> are all critically important. <eob>
In just a few day's time <eob> we've got the rerun <eol> of the Austrian presidential election, <eob> with the prospect of Norbert Hofer <eob> becoming what is commonly described <eob> as the first far-right head <eol> of state in Europe since the Second World War. <eob>
Next year we've got Germany, <eob> we've got France, <eob> we've got presidential elections in Iran <eob> and a dozen others. <eob>
It doesn't get less important. <eob>
It gets more and more important. <eob>
Clearly, the global vote <eol> is not a stand-alone project. <eob>
It's not just there on its own. <eob>
It has some background. <eob>
It's part of a project <eol> which I launched back in 2014, <eob> which I call the Good Country. <eob>
The idea of the Good Country <eol> is basically very simple. <eob>
It's my simple diagnosis of <eol> what's wrong with the world <eob> and how we can fix it. <eob>
What's wrong with the world <eol> I've already hinted at. <eob>
Basically, we face an enormous and growing number <eob> of gigantic, existential global challenges: <eob> climate change, human rights abuses, <eob> mass migration, terrorism, economic chaos, <eol> weapons proliferation. <eob>
All of these problems <eol> which threaten to wipe us out <eob> are by their very nature <eol> globalized problems. <eob>
No individual country has the capability <eol> of tackling them on its own. <eob>
And so very obviously <eob> we have to cooperate <eol> and we have to collaborate as nations <eob> if we're going to solve these problems. <eob>
It's so obvious, and yet we don't. <eob>
We don't do it nearly often enough. <eob>
Most of the time, countries <eol> still persist in behaving <eob> as if they were warring, <eol> selfish tribes battling against each other, <eob> much as they have done since <eol> the nation-state was invented <eob> hundreds of years ago. <eob> And this has got to change. <eob>
This is not a change in political systems <eol> or a change in ideology. <eob> This is a change in culture. <eob>
We, all of us, have to understand <eob> that thinking inwards <eol> is not the solution to the world's problems. <eob>
We have to learn <eol> how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more <eob> and compete just a tiny bit less. <eob>
Otherwise things are going <eol> to carry on getting bad <eob> and they're going to get much worse, <eol> much sooner than we anticipate. <eob>
This change will only happen <eob> if we ordinary people <eob> tell our politicians that things have changed. <eob>
We have to tell them <eol> that the culture has changed. <eob>
We have to tell them <eol> that they've got a new mandate. <eob>
The old mandate was very simple <eol> and very single: <eob> if you're in a position <eol> of power or authority, <eob> you're responsible for your own people <eol> and your own tiny slice of territory, <eob> and that's it. <eob>
And if in order to do the best thing <eol> for your own people, <eob> you screw over everybody else on the planet, <eol> that's even better. <eob>
That's considered to be a bit macho. <eob>
Today, I think everybody in a position <eol> of power and responsibility <eob> has got a dual mandate, <eob> which says if you're in a position <eol> of power and responsibility, <eob> you're responsible for your own people <eob> and for every single man, woman, <eol> child and animal on the planet. <eob>
You're responsible for your own <eol> slice of territory <eob> and for every single square mile <eol> of the earth's surface <eob> and the atmosphere above it. <eob>
And if you don't like that responsibility, <eol> you should not be in power. <eob>
That for me is the rule <eol> of the modern age, <eob> and that's the message <eol> that we've got to get across to our politicians, <eob> and show them that that's the way things <eol> are done these days. <eob>
Otherwise, we're all screwed. <eob>
I don't have a problem, actually, <eob> with Donald Trump's credo of "America first." <eob> It seems to me that that's a pretty banal statement <eob> of what politicians have always done <eol> and probably should always do. <eob>
Of course they're elected <eol> to represent the interests of their own people. <eob>
But what I find so boring and so old-fashioned <eob> and so unimaginative <eol> about his take on that <eob> is that America first means everyone else last, <eob> that making America great again means making everybody else small again, <eob> and it's just not true. <eob>
In my job as a policy advisor <eol> over the last 20 years or so, <eob> I've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies <eob> that harmonize the international <eol> and the domestic needs, <eob> and they make better policy. <eob>
I'm not asking nations <eol> to be altruistic or self-sacrificing. <eob> That would be ridiculous. <eob>
No nation would ever do that. <eob>
I'm asking them to wake up <eol> and understand that we need a new form of governance, <eob> which is possible <eob> and which harmonizes those two needs, <eob> those good for our own people <eol> and those good for everybody else. <eob>
Since the US election and since Brexit <eob> it's become more and more obvious to me <eob> that those old distinctions <eol> of left wing and right wing <eob> no longer make sense. <eob>
They really don't fit the pattern. <eob>
What does seem to matter today <eob> is very simple, <eob> whether your view of the world is <eob> that you take comfort <eol> from looking inwards and backwards, <eob> or whether, like me, <eol> you find hope in looking forwards and outwards. <eob>
That's the new politics. <eob>
That's the new division that is splitting <eol> the world right down the middle. <eob>
Now, that may sound judgmental, <eol> but it's not meant to be. <eob>
I don't at all misunderstand <eob> why so many people find their comfort <eol> in looking inwards and backwards. <eob>
When times are difficult, <eol> when you're short of money, <eob> when you're feeling insecure <eol> and vulnerable, <eob> it's almost a natural human tendency <eol> to turn inwards, <eob> to think of your own needs <eob> and to discard everybody else's, <eob> and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better <eob> than the present or the future could ever be. <eob>
But I happen to believe <eol> that that's a dead end. <eob>
History shows us that it's a dead end. <eob>
When people turn inwards <eol> and turn backwards, <eob> human progress becomes reversed <eob> and things get worse for everybody <eol> very quickly indeed. <eob>
If you're like me <eob> and you believe in forwards <eol> and outwards, <eob> and you believe that the best thing <eol> about humanity is its diversity, <eob> and the best thing <eol> about globalization <eob> is the way that it stirs up <eol> that diversity, that cultural mixture <eob> to make something more creative, more exciting, more productive <eob> than there's ever been <eol> before in human history, <eob> then, my friends, we've got a job on our hands, <eob> because the inwards and backwards brigade <eob> are uniting as never before, <eob> and that creed of inwards and backwards, <eob> that fear, that anxiety, <eob> playing on the simplest instincts, <eob> is sweeping across the world. <eob>
Those of us who believe, <eob> as I believe, in forwards <eol> and outwards, <eob> we have to get ourselves organized, <eob> because time is running out very, <eol> very quickly. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: Welcome <eol> to this next edition of TED Dialogues. <eob>
We're trying to do <eol> some bridging here today. <eob>
You know, the American dream <eol> has inspired millions of people <eob> around the world for many years. <eob>
Today, I think, you can say <eol> that America is divided, <eob> perhaps more than ever, <eob> and the divisions seem <eol> to be getting worse. <eob>
It's actually really hard <eol> for people on different sides <eob> to even have a conversation. <eob>
People almost feel... <eob> disgusted with each other. <eob>
Some families can't even speak <eol> to each other right now. <eob>
Our purpose in this dialogue today <eol> is to try to do something about that, <eob> to try to have a different kind <eol> of conversation, <eob> to do some listening, some thinking, <eol> some understanding. <eob>
And I have two people with us <eol> to help us do that. <eob>
They're not going to come at this <eol> hammer and tong against each other. <eob> This is not like cable news. <eob>
This is two people who have both spent <eol> a lot of their working life <eob> in the political center <eol> or right of the center. <eob>
They've immersed themselves <eol> in conservative worldviews, if you like. <eob>
They know that space very well. <eob>
And we're going to explore together <eob> how to think about <eol> what is happening right now, <eob> and whether we can find new ways to bridge <eob> and just to have wiser, <eol> more connected conversations. <eob>
With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson, <eob> who has spent a decade working <eol> at Fox News, <eob> hosting "Fox and Friends" <eol> and then "The Real Story," <eob> before taking a courageous stance in filing <eol> sexual harassment claims <eob> against Roger Ailes, <eob> which eventually led to his departure from Fox News. <eob>
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath <eob> of many of [The New York Times's] <eol> left-leaning readers <eob> because of his conservative views, <eob> and more recently, perhaps, <eol> some of the right-leaning readers <eob> because of his criticism <eol> of some aspects of Trump. <eob>
Yet, his columns are usually <eob> the top one, two or three <eol> most-read content of the day <eob> because they're brilliant, <eob> because they bring psychology <eol> and social science <eob> to providing understanding <eol> for what's going on. <eob>
So without further ado, a huge welcome <eol> to Gretchen and David. <eob> Come and join me. <eob>
So, Gretchen. <eob> Sixty-three million Americans <eol> voted for Donald Trump. <eob>
Why did they do this? <eob>
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot <eol> of reasons, in my mind, why it happened. <eob>
I mean, I think it was a movement <eol> of sorts, but it started long ago. <eob>
It didn't just happen overnight. <eob> "Anger" would be the first word <eol> that I would think of -- <eob> anger with nothing <eol> being done in Washington, <eob> anger about not being heard. <eob>
I think there was a huge swath <eol> of the population <eob> that feels like Washington <eol> never listens to them, <eob> you know, a good part of the middle <eol> of America, not just the coasts, <eob> and he was somebody they felt <eol> was listening to their concerns. <eob>
So I think those two issues <eol> would be the main reason. <eob>
I have to throw in there also celebrity. <eob>
I think that had a huge impact <eol> on Donald Trump becoming president. <eob>
CA: Was the anger justified? <eob>
David Brooks: Yeah, I think so. <eob>
In 2015 and early 2016, <eol> I wrote about 30 columns <eob> with the following theme: <eob> don't worry, Donald Trump will never <eol> be the Republican nominee. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And having done that <eol> and gotten that so wrong, <eob> I decided to spend the ensuing year <eol> just out in Trumpworld, <eob> and I found a lot of economic dislocation. <eob>
I ran into a woman in West Virginia <eol> who was going to a funeral for her mom. <eob> She said, "The nice thing about <eol> being Catholic is we don't have to speak, <eob> and that's good, <eol> because we're not word people." <eob> That phrase rung in my head: word people. <eob>
A lot of us in the TED community <eol> are word people, <eob> but if you're not, the economy <eol> has not been angled toward you, <eob> and so 11 million men, for example, <eol> are out of the labor force <eob> because those jobs are done away. <eob>
A lot of social injury. <eob>
You used to be able to say, <eol> "I'm not the richest person in the world, <eob> I'm not the most famous, <eob> but my neighbors can count on me <eol> and I get some dignity out of that." <eob> And because of celebritification <eol> or whatever, if you're not rich or famous, <eob> you feel invisible. <eob>
And a lot of moral injury, <eol> sense of feeling betrayed, <eob> and frankly, in this country, <eol> we almost have one success story, <eob> which is you go to college, get <eol> a white-collar job, and you're a success, <eob> and if you don't fit in that formula, <eob> you feel like you're not respected. <eob>
And so that accumulation of things -- <eob> and when I talked to Trump <eol> voters and still do, <eob> I found most of them completely <eol> realistic about his failings, <eob> but they said, this is my shot. <eob>
GC: And yet I predicted <eol> that he would be the nominee, <eob> because I've known him for 27 years. <eob>
He's a master marketer, <eob> and one of the things <eol> he did extremely well <eob> that President Obama also did <eol> extremely well, <eob> was simplifying the message, <eob> simplifying down to phrases <eob> and to a populist message. <eob>
Even if he can't achieve it, <eol> it sounded good. <eob>
And many people latched on <eol> to that simplicity again. <eob>
It's something they could grasp onto: <eob> "I get that. I want that. <eol> That sounds fantastic." <eob> And I remember when he used to come <eol> on my show originally, <eob> before "The Apprentice" <eol> was even "The Apprentice," <eob> and he'd say it was the number <eol> one show on TV. <eob>
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not." <eob> And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen." <eob> And I would say, "No it's not." <eob> But people at home would see that, <eol> and they'd be like, <eob> "Wow, I should be watching <eol> the number one show on TV." <eob> And -- lo and behold -- it became <eol> the number one show on TV. <eob>
So he had this, I've seen <eol> this ability in him <eob> to be the master marketer. <eob>
CA: It's puzzling <eol> to a lot of people on the left <eob> that so many women voted for him, <eob> despite some of his comments. <eob>
GC: I wrote a column <eol> about this for Time Motto, <eob> saying that I really believe <eol> that lot of people put on blinders, <eob> and maybe for the first time, <eob> some people decided <eol> that policies they believed in <eob> and being heard <eol> and not being invisible anymore <eob> was more important to them <eob> than the way in which he had acted <eol> or acts as a human. <eob>
And so human dignity -- <eob> whether it would be the dust-up <eol> about the disabled reporter, <eob> or what happened <eol> in that audiotape with Billy Bush <eob> and the way in which he spoke <eol> about women -- <eob> they put that aside <eob> and pretended as if <eol> they hadn't seen that or heard that, <eob> because to them, <eol> policies were more important. <eob>
CA: Right, so just because <eol> someone voted for Trump, <eob> it's not blind adherence to everything <eol> that he's said or stood for. <eob>
GC: No. I heard a lot of people <eol> that would say to me, <eob> "Wow, I just wish he would shut up <eol> before the election. <eob>
If he would just stay quiet, <eol> he'd get elected." <eob>
CA: And so, maybe for people on the left <eol> there's a trap there, <eob> to sort of despise <eol> or just be baffled by the support, <eob> assuming that it's for some <eol> of the unattractive features. <eob>
Actually, maybe they're supporting <eol> him despite those, <eob> because they see something exciting. <eob> They see a man of action. <eob>
They see the choking hold of government <eol> being thrown off in some way <eob> and they're excited by that. <eob>
GC: But don't forget we saw that <eol> on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders. <eob>
So this is one of the commonalities <eol> that I think we can talk about today, <eob> "The Year of the Outsider," <eol> David -- right? <eob>
And even though Bernie Sanders <eol> has been in Congress for a long time, <eob> he was deemed an outsider this time. <eob> And so there was anger <eol> on the left as well, <eob> and so many people were in favor <eol> of Bernie Sanders. <eob>
So I see it as a commonality. <eob>
People who like Trump, <eol> people who like Bernie Sanders, <eob> they were liking different policies, <eol> but the underpinning was anger. <eob>
CA: David, there's often <eol> this narrative, then, <eob> that the sole explanation <eol> for Trump's victory and his rise <eob> is his tapping into anger <eol> in a very visceral way. <eob>
But you've written a bit about <eol> that it's actually more than that, <eob> that there's a worldview <eol> that's being worked on here. <eob>
Could you talk about that? <eob>
DB: I would say he understood what, <eol> frankly, I didn't, <eob> which is what debate we were having. <eob>
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan, <eob> and it was the big government <eol> versus small government debate. <eob>
It was Barry Goldwater <eol> versus George McGovern, <eob> and that was the debate <eol> we had been having for a generation. <eob> It was: Democrats wanted to use <eol> government to enhance equality, <eob> Republicans wanted to limit government <eol> to enhance freedom. <eob>
That was the debate. <eob>
He understood what I think <eol> the two major parties did not, <eob> which was that's not the debate anymore. <eob>
The debate is now open versus closed. <eob>
On one side are those who have <eol> the tailwinds of globalization <eob> and the meritocracy blowing at their back, <eob> and they tend to favor open trade, <eob> open borders, open social mores, <eob> because there are so many opportunities. <eob>
On the other side are those <eol> who feel the headwinds of globalization <eob> and the meritocracy <eol> just blasting in their faces, <eob> and they favor closed trade, <eol> closed borders, closed social mores, <eob> because they just want some security. <eob>
And so he was right <eol> on that fundamental issue, <eob> and people were willing <eol> to overlook a lot to get there. <eob>
And so he felt that sense of security. <eob>
We're speaking the morning after <eol> Trump's joint session speech. <eob>
There are three traditional <eol> groups in the Republican Party. <eob>
There are the foreign policies hawks <eob> who believe in America <eol> as global policeman. <eob>
Trump totally repudiated that view. <eob>
Second, there was the social conservatives <eob> who believed in religious liberty, <eob> pro-life, <eob> prayer in schools. <eob>
He totally ignored that. <eob>
There was not a single mention <eol> of a single social conservative issue. <eob>
And then there were the fiscal hawks, <eob> the people who wanted to cut down <eol> on the national debt, Tea Party, <eob> cut the size of government. <eob>
He's expanding the size of government! <eob>
Here's a man who has single-handedly <eol> revolutionized a major American party <eob> because he understood <eol> where the debate was headed <eob> before other people. <eob>
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in <eob> and give him substance to his impulses. <eob>
CA: And so take that a bit further, <eob> and maybe expand a bit more <eol> on your insights <eob> into Steve Bannon's worldview. <eob>
Because he's sometimes tarred <eol> in very simple terms <eob> as this dangerous, racist, <eol> xenophobic, anger-sparking person. <eob>
There's more to the story; <eol> that is perhaps an unfair simplification. <eob>
DB: I think that part is true, <eob> but there's another part <eol> that's probably true, too. <eob>
He's part of a global movement. <eob>
It's like being around Marxists in 1917. <eob>
There's him here, there's the UKIP party, <eol> there's the National Front in France, <eob> there's Putin, there's a Turkish version, <eol> a Philippine version. <eob>
So we have to recognize that this <eol> is a global intellectual movement. <eob> And it believes <eob> that wisdom and virtue is not held <eol> in individual conversation and civility <eob> the way a lot of us <eol> in the enlightenment side of the world do. <eob>
It's held in -- the German word <eol> is the "volk" -- in the people, <eob> in the common, instinctive wisdom <eol> of the plain people. <eob>
And the essential virtue of that people <eol> is always being threatened by outsiders. <eob>
And he's got a strategy <eol> for how to get there. <eob>
He's got a series of policies <eol> to bring the people up <eob> and repudiate the outsiders, <eob> whether those outsiders <eol> are Islam, Mexicans, the media, <eob> the coastal elites... <eob> And there's a whole worldview there; <eol> it's a very coherent worldview. <eob>
I sort of have more respect for him. <eob>
I loathe what he stands for <eol> and I think he's wrong on the substance, <eob> but it's interesting to see someone <eol> with a set of ideas <eob> find a vehicle, Donald Trump, <eob> and then try to take control <eol> of the White House <eob> in order to advance his viewpoint. <eob>
CA: So it's almost become, like, <eol> that the core question of our time now is: <eob> Can you be patriotic <eol> but also have a global mindset? <eob>
Are these two things <eol> implacably opposed to each other? <eob>
I mean, a lot of conservatives <eob> and, to the extent <eol> that it's a different category, <eob> a lot of Trump supporters, <eob> are infuriated by <eob> the coastal elites <eob> and the globalists <eob> because they see them as, sort of, <eol> not cheering for America, <eob> not embracing fully American values. <eob>
I mean, have you seen that <eol> in your conversations with people, <eob> in your understanding of their mindset? <eob>
GC: I do think that there's <eol> a huge difference between -- <eob> I hate to put people in categories, but, <eob> Middle America versus <eol> people who live on the coasts. <eob>
It's an entirely different existence. <eob>
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have <eol> an understanding of Middle America, <eob> and I've never forgotten it. <eob>
And maybe that's why I have <eol> an understanding of what happened here, <eob> because those people often feel <eol> like nobody's listening to them, <eob> and that we're only concentrating <eol> on California and New York. <eob>
And so I think that was a huge reason <eol> why Trump was elected. <eob>
I mean, these people felt like <eol> they were being heard. <eob>
Whether or not patriotism falls into that, <eob> I'm not sure about that. <eob>
I do know one thing: <eob> a lot of things Trump talked about <eol> last night are not conservative things. <eob>
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up <eol> and given that speech, <eob> not one Republican would have <eol> stood up to applaud. <eob>
I mean, he's talking about spending <eol> a trillion dollars on infrastructure. <eob>
That is not a conservative viewpoint. <eob>
He talked about government-mandated <eol> maternity leave. <eob>
A lot of women may love that; <eol> it's not a conservative viewpoint. <eob> So it's fascinating <eob> that people who loved what his message <eol> was during the campaign, <eob> I'm not sure -- how do you <eol> think they'll react to that? <eob>
DB: I should say I grew up <eol> in Lower Manhattan, <eob> in the triangle between ABC Carpets, <eol> the Strand Bookstore <eob> and The Odeon restaurant. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: You are a card-carrying member <eol> of the coastal elite, my man. <eob>
But what did you make <eol> of the speech last night? <eob>
It seemed to be a move <eol> to a more moderate position, <eob> on the face of it. <eob>
DB: Yeah, I thought it <eol> was his best speech, <eob> and it took away the freakishness of him. <eob>
I do think he's a moral freak, <eob> and I think he'll be undone by that fact, <eob> the fact that he just doesn't know <eol> anything about anything <eob> and is uncurious about it. <eob>
But if you take away these minor flaws, <eob> I think we got to see him at his best, <eob> and it was revealing for me <eol> to see him at his best, <eob> because to me, it exposed a central <eol> contradiction that he's got to confront, <eob> that a lot of what he's doing <eol> is offering security. <eob> So, "I'm ordering closed borders, <eob> I'm going to secure the world <eol> for you, for my people." <eob> But then if you actually look <eol> at a lot of his economic policies, <eob> like health care reform, which is about <eol> private health care accounts, <eob> that's not security, that's risk. <eob>
Educational vouchers: that's risk. <eol> Deregulation: that's risk. <eob>
There's really a contradiction <eol> between the security of the mindset <eob> and a lot of the policies, <eol> which are very risk-oriented. <eob>
And what I would say, especially <eol> having spent this year, <eob> the people in rural Minnesota, <eol> in New Mexico -- <eob> they've got enough risk in their lives. <eob>
And so they're going to say, <eol> "No thank you." <eob> And I think his health care repeal <eol> will fail for that reason. <eob>
CA: But despite the criticisms <eol> you just made of him, <eob> it does at least seem that he's listening <eob> to a surprisingly wide range of voices; <eob> it's not like everyone <eol> is coming from the same place. <eob>
And maybe that leads to a certain <eol> amount of chaos and confusion, but -- <eob>
GC: I actually don't think he's listening <eol> to a wide range of voices. <eob>
I think he's listening to very few people. <eob>
That's just my impression of it. <eob>
I believe that some of the things <eol> he said last night <eob> had Ivanka all over them. <eob>
So I believe he was listening <eol> to her before that speech. <eob>
And he was Teleprompter Trump <eol> last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump. <eob>
And that's why, before we came out here, <eob> I said, "We better check Twitter <eol> to see if anything's changed." <eob> And also I think you have to keep in mind <eob> that because he's such a unique character, <eob> what was the bar that we <eol> were expecting last night? <eob>
Was it here or here or here? <eob>
And so he comes out <eol> and gives a looking political speech, <eob> and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it." <eob> It just depends <eol> on which direction he goes. <eob>
DB: Yeah, and we're trying <eol> to build bridges here, <eob> and especially for an audience <eol> that may have contempt for Trump, <eob> it's important to say, <eol> no, this is a real thing. <eob>
But as I try my best to go an hour <eol> showing respect for him, <eob> my thyroid is surging, <eob> because I think the oddities <eol> of his character <eob> really are condemnatory <eol> and are going to doom him. <eob>
CA: Your reputation is as a conservative. <eob>
People would you describe you <eol> as right of center, <eob> and yet here you are <eol> with this visceral reaction against him <eob> and some of what he stands for. <eob>
I mean, I'm -- how do you have <eol> a conversation? <eob>
The people who support him, <eol> on evidence so far, <eob> are probably pretty excited. <eob>
He's certainly shown real engagement <eob> in a lot of what he promised to do, <eob> and there is a strong desire <eol> to change the system radically. <eob>
People hate what government has become <eol> and how it's left them out. <eob>
GC: I totally agree with that, <eob> but I think that when he was proposing <eol> a huge government program last night <eob> that we used to call the bad s-word, <eol> "stimulus," I find it completely ironic. <eob>
To spend a trillion dollars <eol> on something -- <eob> that is not a conservative viewpoint. <eob>
Then again, I don't really believe <eol> he's a Republican. <eob>
DB: And I would say, as someone <eol> who identifies as conservative: <eob> first of all, <eob> to be conservative is to believe <eol> in the limitations of politics. <eob>
Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the things <eol> that human hearts endure, <eob> how few are those that kings <eol> can cause and cure." <eob> Politics is a limited realm; <eob> what matters most <eol> is the moral nature of the society. <eob>
And so I have to think <eol> character comes first, <eob> and a man who doesn't pass <eol> the character threshold <eob> cannot be a good president. <eob>
Second, I'm the kind <eol> of conservative who -- <eob> I harken back to Alexander Hamilton, <eob> who was a Latino hip-hop star <eol> from the heights -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but his definition of America <eol> was very future-oriented. <eob>
He was a poor boy from the islands <eob> who had this rapid and amazing <eol> rise to success, <eob> and he wanted government to give <eol> poor boys and girls like him <eob> a chance to succeed, <eob> using limited but energetic government <eol> to create social mobility. <eob>
For him and for Lincoln <eol> and for Teddy Roosevelt, <eob> the idea of America <eol> was the idea of the future. <eob>
We may have division and racism <eol> and slavery in our past, <eob> but we have a common future. <eob>
The definition of America that Steve <eol> Bannon stands for is backwards-looking. <eob> It's nostalgic; it's for the past. <eob>
And that is not traditionally <eol> the American identity. <eob>
That's traditionally, frankly, <eol> the Russian identity. <eob> That's how they define virtue. <eob>
And so I think it is a fundamental <eol> and foundational betrayal <eob> of what conservatism used to stand for. <eob>
CA: Well, I'd like actually <eol> like to hear from you, <eob> and if we see some comments coming in <eol> from some of you, we'll -- <eob> oh, well here's one right now. <eob>
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried <eol> to convince progressive friends <eob> that they need to understand <eol> what motivates Trump supporters, <eob> yet many of them have given up <eol> trying to understand <eob> in the face of what they perceive <eol> as lies, selfishness and hatred. <eob> How would you reach out to such people, <eol> the Tea Party of the left, <eob> to try to bridge this divide? <eob>
GC: I actually think <eol> there are commonalities in anger, <eob> as I expressed earlier. <eob>
So I think you can come to the table, <eol> both being passionate about something. <eob>
So at least you care. <eob>
And I would like to believe -- <eol> the c-word has also become <eob> a horrible word -- "compromise," right? <eob>
So you have the far left <eol> and the far right, <eob> and compromise -- forget it. <eob>
Those groups don't want <eol> to even think about it. <eob>
But you have a huge swath <eol> of voters, myself included, <eob> who are registered independents, <eob> like 40 percent of us, right? <eob>
So there is a huge faction of America <eol> that wants to see change <eob> and wants to see people come together. <eob> It's just that we have to figure out <eob> how to do that. <eob>
CA: So let's talk about that for a minute, <eob> because we're having these TED Dialogues, <eol> we're trying to bridge. <eob>
There's a lot of people out there, <eol> right now, perhaps especially on the left, <eob> who think this is a terrible idea, <eob> that actually, the only moral response <eol> to the great tyranny <eob> that may be about to emerge in America <eob> is to resist it at every stage, <eol> is to fight it tooth and nail, <eob> it's a mistake to try and do this. <eob> Just fight! <eob> Is there a case for that? <eob>
DB: It depends what "fight" means. <eob>
If it means literal fighting, then no. <eob>
If it means marching, well maybe <eol> marching to raise consciousness, <eob> that seems fine. <eob>
But if you want change in this country, <eol> we do it through parties and politics. <eob>
We organize parties, and those parties <eol> are big, diverse, messy coalitions, <eob> and we engage in politics, <eob> and politics is always <eol> morally unsatisfying <eob> because it's always <eol> a bunch of compromises. <eob> But politics is essentially <eol> a competition between partial truths. <eob> The Trump people have a piece <eol> of the truth in America. <eob>
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer <eol> to the right question, <eob> but they have some truth, <eob> and it's truth found in the epidemic <eol> of opiates around the country, <eob> it's truth found in <eol> the spread of loneliness, <eob> it's the truth found in people <eol> whose lives are inverted. <eob>
They peaked professionally at age 30, <eob> and it's all been downhill since. <eob>
And so, understanding that <eol> doesn't take fighting, <eob> it takes conversation and then asking, <eob> "What are we going to replace Trump with?" <eob>
GC: But you saw fighting last night, <eol> even at the speech, <eob> because you saw the Democratic women <eol> who came and wore white <eob> to honor the suffragette movement. <eob>
I remember back during the campaign <eob> where some Trump supporters wanted <eol> to actually get rid of the amendment <eob> that allowed us to vote as women. <eob>
It was like, what? <eob>
So I don't know if <eol> that's the right way to fight. <eob>
It was interesting, <eol> because I was looking in the audience, <eob> trying to see Democratic women <eol> who didn't wear white. <eob>
So there's a lot going on there, <eob> and there's a lot of ways to fight <eol> that are not necessarily doing that. <eob>
CA: I mean, one of the key <eol> questions, to me, is: <eob> The people who voted for Trump <eol> but, if you like, are more in the center, <eob> like they're possibly <eol> amenable to persuasion -- <eob> are they more likely to be persuaded <eol> by seeing a passionate uprising <eob> of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!" <eob> or will that actually piss them off <eol> and push them away? <eob>
DB: How are any of us persuaded? <eob>
Am I going to persuade you by saying, <eol> "Well, you're kind of a bigot, <eob> you're supporting bigotry, <eol> you're supporting sexism. <eob>
You're a primitive, fascistic rise <eol> from some authoritarian past"? <eob>
That's probably not going to be <eol> too persuasive to you. <eob>
And so the way any of us <eol> are persuaded is by: <eob> a) some basic show of respect <eol> for the point of view, and saying, <eob> "I think this guy is not going <eol> to get you where you need to go." <eob> And there are two phrases <eol> you've heard over and over again, <eob> wherever you go in the country. <eob>
One, the phrase "flyover country." <eob> And that's been heard for years, <eob> but I would say this year, <eol> I heard it almost on an hourly basis, <eob> a sense of feeling invisible. <eob>
And then the sense a sense of the phrase <eol> "political correctness." <eob> Just that rebellion: "They're not even <eol> letting us say what we think." <eob> And I teach at Yale. <eob>
The narrowing of debate is real. <eob>
CA: So you would say this is a trap <eol> that liberals have fallen into <eob> by celebrating causes <eol> they really believe in, <eob> often expressed through the language <eol> of "political correctness." <eob> They have done damage. <eob>
They have pushed people away. <eob>
DB: I would say <eol> a lot of the argument, though, <eob> with "descent to fascism," <eol> "authoritarianism" -- <eob> that just feels over-the-top to people. <eob>
And listen, I've written <eol> eight million anti-Trump columns, <eob> but it is a problem, especially <eol> for the coastal media, <eob> that every time he does something <eol> slightly wrong, we go to 11, <eob> and we're at 11 every day. <eob> And it just strains <eol> credibility at some point. <eob>
CA: Crying wolf a little too loud <eol> and a little too early. <eob>
But there may be a time <eol> when we really do have to cry wolf. <eob>
GC: But see -- one of the most <eol> important things to me <eob> is how the conservative media <eol> handles Trump. <eob>
Will they call him out <eol> when things are not true, <eob> or will they just go along with it? <eob>
To me, that is what is essential <eol> in this entire discussion, <eob> because when you have <eol> followers of somebody <eob> who don't really care <eol> if he tells the truth or not, <eob> that can be very dangerous. <eob>
So to me, it's: How is the conservative <eol> media going to respond to it? <eob>
I mean, you've been calling them out. <eob>
But how will other forms <eol> of conservative media deal with that <eob> as we move forward? <eob>
DB: It's all shifted, though. <eob>
The conservative media used to be Fox <eol> or Charles Krauthammer or George Will. <eob>
They're no longer the conservative media. <eob>
Now there's another whole set <eol> of institutions further right, <eob> which is Breitbart and Infowars, <eol> Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham, <eob> and so they're the ones who are now <eol> his base, not even so much Fox. <eob>
CA: My last question for the time being <eol> is just on this question of the truth. <eob> I mean, it's one of the scariest <eol> things to people right now, <eob> that there is no agreement, <eol> nationally, on what is true. <eob>
I've never seen anything like it, <eob> where facts are so massively disputed. <eob>
Your whole newspaper, sir, <eol> is delivering fake news every day. <eob>
DB: And failing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: And failing. My commiserations. <eob> But is there any path <eob> whereby we can start to get <eol> some kind of consensus, <eob> to believe the same things? <eob>
Can online communities play a role here? <eob> How do we fix this? <eob>
GC: See, I understand how that happened. <eob>
That's another groundswell kind of emotion <eob> that was going on in the middle of America <eob> and not being heard, <eob> in thinking that the mainstream <eol> media was biased. <eob>
There's a difference, though, <eol> between being biased and being fake. <eob>
To me, that is a very important <eol> distinction in this conversation. <eob>
So let's just say that there was some bias <eol> in the mainstream media. <eob> OK. So there are ways <eol> to try and mend that. <eob>
But what Trump's doing <eol> is nuclearizing that and saying, <eob> "Look, we're just going to call <eol> all of that fake." <eob> That's where it gets dangerous. <eob>
CA: Do you think enough of his supporters <eob> have a greater loyalty <eol> to the truth than to any ... <eob> Like, the principle <eol> of not supporting something <eob> that is demonstrably not true <eob> actually matters, so there will be <eol> a correction at some point? <eob>
DB: I think the truth <eol> eventually comes out. <eob>
So for example, Donald Trump <eol> has based a lot of his economic policy <eob> on this supposition that Americans <eol> have lost manufacturing jobs <eob> because they've been stolen <eol> by the Chinese. <eob>
That is maybe 13 percent <eol> of the jobs that left. <eob>
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs <eol> were replaced by technology. <eob>
That is just the truth. <eob>
And so as a result, when he says, <eob> "I'm going to close TPP <eol> and all the jobs will come roaring back," <eob> they will not come roaring back. <eob>
So that is an actual fact, in my belief. <eob> And — <eob>
GC: But I'm saying what <eol> his supporters think is the truth, <eob> no matter how many times <eol> you might say that, <eob> they still believe him. <eob>
DB: But eventually either jobs <eol> will come back or they will not come back, <eob> and at that point, either something <eol> will work or it doesn't work, <eob> and it doesn't work or not work <eol> because of great marketing, <eob> it works because it actually <eol> addresses a real problem <eob> and so I happen to think <eol> the truth will out. <eob>
CA: If you've got a question, <eol> please raise your hand here. <eob>
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box. <eob>
My name's Yael Eisenstat. <eob>
I hear a lot of this talk <eob> about how we all need to start <eol> talking to each other more <eob> and understanding each other more, <eob> and I've even written about this, <eol> published on this subject as well, <eob> but now today I keep hearing liberals -- <eol> yes, I live in New York, <eob> I can be considered a liberal -- <eob> we sit here and self-analyze: <eob> What did we do to not understand <eol> the Rust Belt? <eob>
Or: What can we do to understand <eol> Middle America better? <eob>
And what I'd like to know: <eob> Have you seen any attempts <eol> or conversations from Middle America <eob> of what can I do to understand <eol> the so-called coastal elites better? <eob>
Because I'm just offended <eol> as being put in a box as a coastal elite <eob> as someone in Middle America is <eol> as being considered a flyover state <eob> and not listened to. <eob>
CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook <eol> cheering as you -- <eob>
DB: I would say -- and this is someone <eol> who has been conservative <eob> all my adult life -- <eob> when you grow up conservative, <eob> you learn to speak both languages. <eob>
Because if I'm going to listen to music, <eob> I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent. <eob>
So a lot of my favorite rock bands <eol> are all on the left. <eob>
If I'm going to go to a school, <eob> I'm going probably to school <eol> where the culture is liberal. <eob>
If I'm going to watch a sitcom <eob> or a late-night comedy show, <eol> it's going to be liberal. <eob>
If I'm going to read a good newspaper, <eol> it'll be the New York Times. <eob>
As a result, <eob> you learn to speak both languages. <eob>
And that actually, at least <eol> for a number of years, <eob> when I started at National Review <eol> with William F. Buckley, <eob> it made us sharper, <eob> because we were used to arguing <eol> against people every day. <eob>
The problem now that's happened <eol> is you have ghettoization on the right <eob> and you can live entirely in rightworld, <eob> so as a result, the quality of argument <eol> on the right has diminished, <eob> because you're not in the other side <eob> all the time. <eob>
But I do think if you're living <eol> in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona, <eob> the coastal elites <eob> make themselves aware to you, <eob> so you know that language as well, <eob> but it's not the reverse. <eob>
CA: But what does Middle America <eol> not get about coastal elites? <eob>
So the critique is, <eob> you are not dealing <eol> with the real problems. <eob>
There's a feeling of a snobbishness, <eol> an elitism that is very off-putting. <eob>
What are they missing? <eob>
If you could plant one piece of truth <eob> from the mindset of someone <eol> in this room, for example, <eob> what would you say to them? <eob>
DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are. <eob>
No, I reject the category. <eob>
The problem with populism <eol> is the same problem with elitism. <eob>
It's just a prejudice on the basis <eob> of probably an over-generalized <eol> social class distinction <eob> which is too simplistic <eol> to apply in reality. <eob>
Those of us in New York know <eol> there are some people in New York <eob> who are completely awesome, <eol> and some people who are pathetic, <eob> and if you live in Iowa, some people <eol> are awesome and some people are pathetic. <eob>
It's not a question <eol> of what degree you have <eob> or where you happen to live <eol> in the country. <eob>
The distinction is just a crude <eol> simplification to arouse political power. <eob>
GC: But I would encourage people <eol> to watch a television news show <eob> or read a column <eol> that they normally wouldn't. <eob>
So if you are a Trump supporter, <eol> watch the other side for a day, <eob> because you need to come out of the bubble <eob> if you're ever going <eol> to have a conversation. <eob>
And both sides -- so if you're a liberal, <eob> then watch something <eol> that's very conservative. <eob>
Read a column that is not something <eol> you would normally read, <eob> because then you gain perspective <eol> of what the other side is thinking, <eob> and to me, that's a start <eol> of coming together. <eob>
I worry about the same thing <eol> you worry about, these bubbles. <eob>
I think if you only watch <eol> certain entities, <eob> you have no idea what the rest <eol> of the world is talking about. <eob>
DB: I think not only watching, <eob> being part of an organization <eol> that meets at least once a month <eob> that puts you in direct contact <eol> with people completely unlike yourself <eob> is something we all have <eol> a responsibility for. <eob>
I may get this a little wrong, <eob> but I think of the top-selling <eol> automotive models in this country, <eob> I think the top three or four <eol> are all pickup trucks. <eob>
So ask yourself: How many people <eol> do I know who own a pickup truck? <eob>
And it could be very few or zero <eol> for a lot of people. <eob>
And that's sort of a warning sign <eol> kind of a problem. <eob>
Where can I join a club <eob> where I'll have a lot in common <eol> with a person who drives a pickup truck <eob> because we have a common <eol> interest in whatever? <eob>
CA: And so the internet is definitely <eol> contributing to this. <eob>
A question here from Chris Ajemian: <eob> "How do you feel structure <eol> of communications, <eob> especially the prevalence of social <eol> media and individualized content, <eob> can be used to bring together <eol> a political divide, <eob> instead of just filing communities <eol> into echo chambers?" <eob> I mean, it looks like Facebook <eol> and Google, since the election, <eob> are working hard on this question. <eob> They're trying to change the algorithms <eob> so that they don't amplify fake news <eob> to the extent that it happened <eol> last time round. <eob>
Do you see any other <eol> promising signs of ...? <eob>
GC: ... or amplify one side <eol> of the equation. <eob>
CA: Exactly. <eob>
GC: I think that was the constant <eol> argument from the right, <eob> that social media <eol> and the internet in general <eob> was putting articles towards the top <eol> that were not their worldview. <eob>
I think, again, that fed into the anger. <eob> It fed into the anger of: <eob> "You're pushing something <eol> that's not what I believe." <eob> But social media has obviously <eol> changed everything, <eob> and I think Trump is the example <eol> of Twitter changing absolutely everything. <eob>
And from his point of view, <eob> he's reaching the American people <eol> without a filter, <eob> which he believes the media is. <eob>
CA: Question from the audience. <eob>
Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny. <eob> I have a question regarding political <eol> correctness, and I'm curious: <eob> When did political correctness <eol> become synonymous with silencing, <eob> versus a way that we speak <eol> about other people <eob> to show them respect <eol> and preserve their dignity? <eob>
GC: Well, I think the conservative media <eol> really pounded this issue <eob> for the last 10 years. <eob>
I think that they really, really <eol> spent a lot of time <eob> talking about political correctness, <eob> and how people should have <eol> the ability to say what they think. <eob>
Another reason why Trump <eol> became so popular: <eob> because he says what he thinks. <eob>
It also makes me think about the fact <eob> that I do believe there are a lot <eol> of people in America <eob> who agree with Steve Bannon, <eob> but they would never say it publicly, <eob> and so voting for Trump <eol> gave them the opportunity <eob> to agree with it silently. <eob>
DB: On the issue of immigration, <eol> it's a legitimate point of view <eob> that we have too many immigrants <eol> in the country, <eob> that it's economically costly. <eob>
CA: That we have too many -- <eob>
DB: Immigrants in the country, <eol> especially from Britain. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK? <eob>
CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'll go now. <eob>
DB: But it became <eol> sort of impermissible to say that, <eob> because it was a sign that somehow <eol> you must be a bigot of some sort. <eob>
So the political correctness <eol> was not only cracking down on speech <eob> that we would all find <eol> completely offensive, <eob> it was cracking down on some speech <eol> that was legitimate, <eob> and then it was turning speech <eol> and thought into action <eob> and treating it as a crime, <eob> and people getting fired <eol> and people thrown out of schools, <eob> and there were speech codes written. <eob>
Now there are these diversity teams, <eob> where if you say something <eol> that somebody finds offensive, <eob> like, "Smoking is really dangerous," <eol> you can say "You're insulting my group," <eob> and the team from the administration <eol> will come down into your dorm room <eob> and put thought police upon you. <eob>
And so there has been a genuine narrowing <eol> of what is permissible to say. <eob>
And some of it is legitimate. <eob>
There are certain words that there <eol> should be some social sanction against, <eob> but some of it was used <eol> to enforce a political agenda. <eob>
CA: So is that a project <eob> you would urge on liberals, <eol> if you like -- progressives -- <eob> to rethink the ground rules <eol> around political correctness <eob> and accept a little more <eol> uncomfortable language <eob> in certain circumstances? <eob>
Can you see that being solved <eob> to an extent that others <eol> won't be so offended? <eob>
DB: I mean, most American universities, <eol> especially elite universities, <eob> are overwhelmingly on the left, <eob> and there's just an ease of temptation <eob> to use your overwhelming cultural power <eol> to try to enforce some sort of thought <eob> that you think is right <eol> and correct thought. <eob>
So, be a little more self-suspicious <eol> of, are we doing that? <eob>
And second, my university, <eol> the University of Chicago, <eob> sent out this letter saying, <eol> we will have no safe spaces. <eob>
There will be no critique <eol> of micro-aggression. <eob>
If you get your feelings hurt, <eol> well, welcome to the world of education. <eob>
I do think that policy -- <eob> which is being embraced by a lot <eol> of people on the left, by the way -- <eob> is just a corrective to what's happened. <eob>
CA: So here's a question <eol> from Karen Holloway: <eob> How do we foster an American culture <eob> that's forward-looking, like Hamilton, <eob> that expects and deals with change, <eob> rather than wanting to have everything <eol> go back to some fictional past? <eob>
That's an easy question, right? <eob>
GC: Well, I'm still a believer <eol> in the American dream, <eob> and I think what we can teach <eol> our children is the basics, <eob> which is that hard work <eob> and believing in yourself <eob> in America, you can achieve <eol> whatever you want. <eob>
I was told that every single day. <eob>
When I got in the real world, I was like, <eol> wow, that's maybe not always so true. <eob>
But I still believe in that. <eob>
Maybe I'm being too optimistic. <eob>
So I still look towards the future <eol> for that to continue. <eob>
DB: I think you're being too optimistic. <eob>
GC: You do? <eob>
DB: The odds of an American young person <eol> exceeding their parents' salary -- <eob> a generation ago, like 86 percent did it. <eob>
Now 51 percent do it. <eob>
There's just been a problem <eol> in social mobility in the country. <eob>
CA: You've written that this entire <eol> century has basically been a disaster, <eob> that the age of sunny growth is over <eol> and we're in deep trouble. <eob>
DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged, <eol> in real terms, population-adjusted, <eob> two or three percent growth for 50 years, <eob> and now we've had less <eol> than one percent growth. <eob>
And so there's something seeping out. <eob>
And so if I'm going to tell people <eol> that they should take risks, <eob> one of the things we're seeing <eol> is a rapid decline in mobility, <eob> the number of people who are moving <eol> across state lines, <eob> and that's especially true <eol> among millennials. <eob>
It's young people that are moving less. <eob>
So how do we give people the security <eol> from which they can take risk? <eob>
And I'm a big believer in attachment <eol> theory of raising children, <eob> and attachment theory <eol> is based on the motto <eob> that all of life is a series <eol> of daring adventures from a secure base. <eob>
Have you parents given you a secure base? <eob>
And as a society, <eol> we do not have a secure base, <eob> and we won't get to that "Hamilton," <eol> risk-taking, energetic ethos <eob> until we can supply a secure base. <eob>
CA: So I wonder whether <eol> there's ground here <eob> to create almost like a shared agenda, <eol> a bridging conversation, <eob> on the one hand recognizing <eol> that there is this really deep problem <eob> that the system, <eol> the economic system that we built, <eob> seems to be misfiring right now. <eob>
Second, that maybe, if you're right <eol> that it's not all about immigrants, <eob> it's probably more about technology, <eob> if you could win that argument, <eob> that de-emphasizes what seems to me <eol> the single most divisive territory <eob> between Trump supporters and others, <eol> which is around the role of the other. <eob>
It's very offensive to people on the left <eol> to have the other demonized <eob> to the extent that the other <eol> seems to be demonized. <eob>
That feels deeply immoral, <eob> and maybe people on the left <eol> could agree, as you said, <eob> that immigration <eol> may have happened too fast, <eob> and there is a limit beyond which <eol> human societies struggle, <eob> but nonetheless this whole problem <eol> becomes de-emphasized <eob> if automation is the key issue, <eob> and then we try to work together <eol> on recognizing that it's real, <eob> recognizing that the problem <eol> probably wasn't properly addressed <eob> or seen or heard, <eob> and try to figure out <eol> how to rebuild communities <eob> using, well, using what? <eob>
That seems to me to become <eol> the fertile conversation of the future: <eob> How do we rebuild communities <eol> in this modern age, <eob> with technology doing what it's doing, <eob> and reimagine this bright future? <eob>
GC: That's why I go back to optimism. <eob>
I'm not being ... it's not like <eol> I'm not looking at the facts, <eob> where we've come or where we've come from. <eob>
But for gosh sakes, if we don't look <eol> at it from an optimistic point of view -- <eob> I'm refusing to do that just yet. <eob>
I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old <eol> to say, "Look, the world is dim." <eob>
CA; We're going to have <eol> one more question from the room here. <eob>
Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry. <eob> You both mentioned <eol> the infrastructure plan and Russia <eob> and some other things that wouldn't be <eol> traditional Republican priorities. <eob>
What do you think, or when, <eol> will Republicans be motivated <eob> to take a stand against Trumpism? <eob>
GC: After last night, not for a while. <eob>
He changed a lot last night, I believe. <eob>
DB: His popularity among Republicans -- <eol> he's got 85 percent approval, <eob> which is higher than Reagan <eol> had at this time, <eob> and that's because society <eol> has just gotten more polarized. <eob>
So people follow the party <eol> much more than they used to. <eob>
So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan <eol> and the Republicans in Congress <eob> to flake away, <eob> it's going to take a little while. <eob>
GC: But also because they're all <eol> concerned about reelection, <eob> and Trump has so much power <eol> with getting people either for you <eob> or against you, <eob> and so, they're vacillating <eol> every day, probably: <eob> "Well, should I go against <eol> or should I not?" <eob> But last night, where he finally <eol> sounded presidential, <eob> I think most Republicans are breathing <eol> a sigh of relief today. <eob>
DB: The half-life of that is short. <eob>
GC: Right -- I was just going to say, <eol> until Twitter happens again. <eob>
CA: OK, I want to give <eol> each of you the chance <eob> to imagine you're speaking <eol> to -- I don't know -- <eob> the people online who are watching this, <eob> who may be Trump supporters, <eob> who may be on the left, <eol> somewhere in the middle. <eob>
How would you advise them to bridge <eol> or to relate to other people? <eob>
Can you share any final wisdom on this? <eob>
Or if you think that they shouldn't, <eol> tell them that as well. <eob>
GC: I would just start by saying <eob> that I really think any change <eol> and coming together starts from the top, <eob> just like any other organization. <eob>
And I would love if, somehow, <eob> Trump supporters or people on the left <eol> could encourage their leaders <eob> to show that compassion from the top, <eob> because imagine the change <eol> that we could have <eob> if Donald Trump tweeted out today, <eob> to all of his supporters, <eob> "Let's not be vile anymore to each other. <eob> Let's have more understanding. <eob> As a leader, I'm going <eol> to be more inclusive <eob> to all of the people of America." <eob> To me, it starts at the top. <eob>
Is he going to do that? <eob>
I have no idea. <eob>
But I think that everything <eol> starts from the top, <eob> and the power that he has <eob> in encouraging his supporters <eob> to have an understanding of where <eol> people are coming from on the other side. <eob>
CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say <eob> I don't think we can teach <eol> each other to be civil, <eob> and give us sermons on civility. <eob> That's not going to do it. <eob>
It's substance and how we act, <eob> and the nice thing about Donald Trump <eol> is he smashed our categories. <eob>
All the categories that we thought <eol> we were thinking in, they're obsolete. <eob>
They were great for the 20th century. <eol> They're not good for today. <eob>
He's got an agenda which is about <eol> closing borders and closing trade. <eob>
I just don't think it's going to work. <eob>
I think if we want to rebuild <eol> communities, recreate jobs, <eob> we need a different set of agenda <eob> that smashes through all our current <eol> divisions and our current categories. <eob>
For me, that agenda is Reaganism <eol> on macroeconomic policy, <eob> Sweden on welfare policy <eob> and cuts across right and left. <eob>
I think we have to have a dynamic <eol> economy that creates growth. <eob>
That's the Reagan on economic policy. <eob>
But people have to have that secure base. <eob>
There have to be <eol> nurse-family partnerships; <eob> there has to be universal preschool; <eob> there have to be charter schools; <eob> there have to be college programs <eol> with wraparound programs <eob> for parents and communities. <eob>
We need to help heal the crisis <eol> of social solidarity in this country <eob> and help heal families, <eob> and government just has to get <eol> a lot more involved <eob> in the way liberals like <eol> to rebuild communities. <eob>
At the other hand, we have to have <eol> an economy that's free and open <eob> the way conservatives used to like. <eob>
And so getting the substance right <eol> is how you smash through <eob> the partisan identities, <eob> because the substance is what <eol> ultimately shapes our polarization. <eob>
CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much <eob> for an absolutely fascinating conversation. <eob> Thank you. That was really, really interesting. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hey, let's keep the conversation going. <eob> We're continuing to try and figure out <eob> whether we can add something here, <eob> so keep the conversation <eol> going on Facebook. <eob>
Give us your thoughts from whatever part <eol> of the political spectrum you're on, <eob> and actually, wherever <eol> in the world you are. <eob> This is not just about America. <eol> It's about the world, too. <eob>
But we're not going <eol> to end today without music, <eob> because if we put music <eol> in every political conversation, <eob> the world would be <eol> completely different, frankly. <eob> It just would. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman, <eob> Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here -- <eob> let's get a shot of her. <eob>
She created this program <eol> that brings teens together, <eob> teaches them the joy <eol> and the impact of gospel music, <eob> and hundreds of teens have gone <eol> through this program. <eob>
It's transformative for them. <eob>
The music they made, as you already heard, <eob> is extraordinary, <eob> and I can't think of a better way <eol> of ending this TED Dialogue <eob> than welcoming Vy Higginsen's <eol> Gospel Choir from Harlem. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Singing) Choir: O beautiful <eol> for spacious skies <eob> For amber waves of grain <eob> For purple mountain majesties <eob> Above the fruited plain <eob> America! <eob> America! <eob> America! <eob> America! <eob> God shed his grace on thee <eob> And crown thy good with brotherhood <eob> From sea to shining sea <eob> From sea to shining sea <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to be talking <eol> about statistics today. <eob>
If that makes you immediately feel <eol> a little bit wary, that's OK, <eob> that doesn't make you some <eol> kind of crazy conspiracy theorist, <eob> it makes you skeptical. <eob>
And when it comes to numbers, <eol> especially now, you should be skeptical. <eob>
But you should also be able to tell <eol> which numbers are reliable <eob> and which ones aren't. <eob>
So today I want to try to give you <eol> some tools to be able to do that. <eob>
But before I do, <eob> I just want to clarify which numbers <eol> I'm talking about here. <eob>
I'm not talking about claims like, <eob> "9 out of 10 women recommend <eol> this anti-aging cream." <eob> I think a lot of us always <eol> roll our eyes at numbers like that. <eob>
What's different now is people <eol> are questioning statistics like, <eob> "The US unemployment <eol> rate is five percent." <eob> What makes this claim different is <eol> it doesn't come from a private company, <eob> it comes from the government. <eob>
About 4 out of 10 Americans <eol> distrust the economic data <eob> that gets reported by government. <eob>
Among supporters of President Trump <eol> it's even higher; <eob> it's about 7 out of 10. <eob>
I don't need to tell anyone here <eob> that there are a lot of dividing lines <eol> in our society right now, <eob> and a lot of them start to make sense, <eob> once you understand people's relationships <eol> with these government numbers. <eob>
On the one hand, there are those <eol> who say these statistics are crucial, <eob> that we need them to make sense <eol> of society as a whole <eob> in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes <eob> and measure progress in an [objective] way. <eob>
And then there are the others, <eob> who say that these statistics are elitist, <eob> maybe even rigged; <eob> they don't make sense <eol> and they don't really reflect <eob> what's happening <eol> in people's everyday lives. <eob>
It kind of feels like that second group <eol> is winning the argument right now. <eob>
We're living in a world <eol> of alternative facts, <eob> where people don't find statistics <eol> this kind of common ground, <eob> this starting point for debate. <eob>
This is a problem. <eob>
There are actually <eol> moves in the US right now <eob> to get rid of some government <eol> statistics altogether. <eob>
Right now there's a bill in congress <eol> about measuring racial inequality. <eob>
The draft law says that government <eol> money should not be used <eob> to collect data on racial segregation. <eob>
This is a total disaster. <eob>
If we don't have this data, <eob> how can we observe discrimination, <eob> let alone fix it? <eob>
In other words: <eob> How can a government create fair policies <eob> if they can't measure <eol> current levels of unfairness? <eob>
This isn't just about discrimination, <eob> it's everything — think about it. <eob>
How can we legislate on health care <eob> if we don't have good data <eol> on health or poverty? <eob>
How can we have public debate <eol> about immigration <eob> if we can't at least agree <eob> on how many people are entering <eol> and leaving the country? <eob>
Statistics come from the state; <eol> that's where they got their name. <eob>
The point was to better <eol> measure the population <eob> in order to better serve it. <eob>
So we need these government numbers, <eob> but we also have to move <eol> beyond either blindly accepting <eob> or blindly rejecting them. <eob>
We need to learn the skills <eol> to be able to spot bad statistics. <eob>
I started to learn some of these <eob> when I was working <eol> in a statistical department <eob> that's part of the United Nations. <eob>
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis <eol> had been forced from their homes <eob> as a result of the war, <eob> and what they needed. <eob>
It was really important work, <eol> but it was also incredibly difficult. <eob>
Every single day, we were making decisions <eob> that affected the accuracy <eol> of our numbers -- <eob> decisions like which parts <eol> of the country we should go to, <eob> who we should speak to, <eob> which questions we should ask. <eob>
And I started to feel <eol> really disillusioned with our work, <eob> because we thought we were doing <eol> a really good job, <eob> but the one group of people <eol> who could really tell us were the Iraqis, <eob> and they rarely got the chance to find <eol> our analysis, let alone question it. <eob>
So I started to feel really determined <eob> that the one way to make <eol> numbers more accurate <eob> is to have as many people as possible <eol> be able to question them. <eob>
So I became a data journalist. <eob> My job is finding these data sets <eol> and sharing them with the public. <eob>
Anyone can do this, <eol> you don't have to be a geek or a nerd. <eob>
You can ignore those words; <eol> they're used by people <eob> trying to say they're smart <eol> while pretending they're humble. <eob>
Absolutely anyone can do this. <eob>
I want to give you guys three questions <eob> that will help you be able to spot <eol> some bad statistics. <eob>
So, question number one <eol> is: Can you see uncertainty? <eob>
One of things that's really changed <eol> people's relationship with numbers, <eob> and even their trust in the media, <eob> has been the use of political polls. <eob>
I personally have a lot of issues <eol> with political polls <eob> because I think the role of journalists <eol> is actually to report the facts <eob> and not attempt to predict them, <eob> especially when those predictions <eol> can actually damage democracy <eob> by signaling to people: <eol> don't bother to vote for that guy, <eob> he doesn't have a chance. <eob>
Let's set that aside for now and talk <eol> about the accuracy of this endeavor. <eob>
Based on national elections <eol> in the UK, Italy, Israel <eob> and of course, the most recent <eol> US presidential election, <eob> using polls to predict electoral outcomes <eob> is about as accurate as using the moon <eol> to predict hospital admissions. <eob>
No, seriously, I used actual data <eol> from an academic study to draw this. <eob>
There are a lot of reasons why <eol> polling has become so inaccurate. <eob>
Our societies have become really diverse, <eob> which makes it difficult for pollsters <eol> to get a really nice representative sample <eob> of the population for their polls. <eob>
People are really reluctant to answer <eol> their phones to pollsters, <eob> and also, shockingly enough, <eol> people might lie. <eob>
But you wouldn't necessarily <eol> know that to look at the media. <eob>
For one thing, the probability <eol> of a Hillary Clinton win <eob> was communicated with decimal places. <eob>
We don't use decimal places <eol> to describe the temperature. <eob>
How on earth can predicting the behavior <eol> of 230 million voters in this country <eob> be that precise? <eob>
And then there were those sleek charts. <eob>
See, a lot of data visualizations <eol> will overstate certainty, and it works -- <eob> these charts can numb <eol> our brains to criticism. <eob>
When you hear a statistic, <eol> you might feel skeptical. <eob>
As soon as it's buried in a chart, <eob> it feels like some kind <eol> of objective science, <eob> and it's not. <eob>
So I was trying to find ways <eol> to better communicate this to people, <eob> to show people the uncertainty <eol> in our numbers. <eob>
What I did was I started taking <eol> real data sets, <eob> and turning them into <eol> hand-drawn visualizations, <eob> so that people can see <eol> how imprecise the data is; <eob> so people can see that a human did this, <eob> a human found the data and visualized it. <eob>
For example, instead <eol> of finding out the probability <eob> of getting the flu in any given month, <eob> you can see the rough <eol> distribution of flu season. <eob> This is -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a bad shot to show in February. <eob>
But it's also more responsible <eol> data visualization, <eob> because if you were to show <eol> the exact probabilities, <eob> maybe that would encourage <eol> people to get their flu jabs <eob> at the wrong time. <eob>
The point of these shaky lines <eob> is so that people remember <eol> these imprecisions, <eob> but also so they don't necessarily <eol> walk away with a specific number, <eob> but they can remember important facts. <eob>
Facts like injustice and inequality <eol> leave a huge mark on our lives. <eob>
Facts like Black Americans and Native <eol> Americans have shorter life expectancies <eob> than those of other races, <eob> and that isn't changing anytime soon. <eob>
Facts like prisoners in the US <eol> can be kept in solitary confinement cells <eob> that are smaller than the size <eol> of an average parking space. <eob>
The point of these visualizations <eol> is also to remind people <eob> of some really important <eol> statistical concepts, <eob> concepts like averages. <eob>
So let's say you hear a claim like, <eob> "The average swimming pool in the US <eol> contains 6.23 fecal accidents." <eob> That doesn't mean every single <eol> swimming pool in the country <eob> contains exactly 6.23 turds. <eob>
So in order to show that, <eob> I went back to the original data, <eol> which comes from the CDC, <eob> who surveyed 47 swimming facilities. <eob>
And I just spent one evening <eol> redistributing poop. <eob> So you can kind of see <eol> how misleading averages can be. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, so the second question <eol> that you guys should be asking yourselves <eob> to spot bad numbers is: <eob> Can I see myself in the data? <eob>
This question is also <eol> about averages in a way, <eob> because part of the reason <eol> why people are so frustrated <eob> with these national statistics, <eob> is they don't really tell the story <eol> of who's winning and who's losing <eob> from national policy. <eob>
It's easy to understand why people <eol> are frustrated with global averages <eob> when they don't match up <eol> with their personal experiences. <eob>
I wanted to show people the way <eol> data relates to their everyday lives. <eob>
I started this advice column <eol> called "Dear Mona," <eob> where people would write to me <eol> with questions and concerns <eob> and I'd try to answer them with data. <eob>
People asked me anything. <eob> questions like, "Is it normal to sleep <eol> in a separate bed to my wife?" <eob> "Do people regret their tattoos?" <eob> "What does it mean to die <eol> of natural causes?" <eob>
All of these questions are great, <eol> because they make you think <eob> about ways to find <eol> and communicate these numbers. <eob>
If someone asks you, <eol> "How much pee is a lot of pee?" <eob> which is a question that I got asked, <eob> you really want to make sure <eol> that the visualization makes sense <eob> to as many people as possible. <eob>
These numbers aren't unavailable. <eob>
Sometimes they're just buried <eol> in the appendix of an academic study. <eob>
And they're certainly not inscrutable; <eob> if you really wanted to test <eol> these numbers on urination volume, <eob> you could grab a bottle <eol> and try it for yourself. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The point of this isn't necessarily <eob> that every single data set <eol> has to relate specifically to you. <eob>
I'm interested in how many women <eol> were issued fines in France <eob> for wearing the face veil, or the niqab, <eob> even if I don't live in France <eol> or wear the face veil. <eob>
The point of asking where you fit in <eol> is to get as much context as possible. <eob>
So it's about zooming out <eol> from one data point, <eob> like the unemployment rate <eol> is five percent, <eob> and seeing how it changes over time, <eob> or seeing how it changes <eol> by educational status -- <eob> this is why your parents always <eol> wanted you to go to college -- <eob> or seeing how it varies by gender. <eob>
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher <eob> than the female unemployment rate. <eob>
Up until the early '80s, <eol> it was the other way around. <eob>
This is a story of one of the biggest changes <eob> that's happened in American society, <eob> and it's all there in that chart, <eol> once you look beyond the averages. <eob>
The axes are everything; <eob> once you change the scale, <eol> you can change the story. <eob>
OK, so the third and final question <eol> that I want you guys to think about <eob> when you're looking at statistics is: <eob> How was the data collected? <eob>
So far, I've only talked about the way <eol> data is communicated, <eob> but the way it's collected <eol> matters just as much. <eob>
I know this is tough, <eob> because methodologies can be opaque <eol> and actually kind of boring, <eob> but there are some simple steps <eol> you can take to check this. <eob>
I'll use one last example here. <eob>
One poll found that 41 percent <eol> of Muslims in this country support jihad, <eob> which is obviously pretty scary, <eob> and it was reported everywhere in 2015. <eob>
When I want to check a number like that, <eob> I'll start off by finding <eol> the original questionnaire. <eob>
It turns out that journalists <eol> who reported on that statistic <eob> ignored a question <eol> lower down on the survey <eob> that asked respondents <eol> how they defined "jihad." <eob> And most of them defined it as, <eob> "Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle <eol> to be more religious." <eob> Only 16 percent defined it as, <eol> "violent holy war against unbelievers." <eob> This is the really important point: <eob> based on those numbers, <eol> it's totally possible <eob> that no one in the survey <eol> who defined it as violent holy war <eob> also said they support it. <eob>
Those two groups might not overlap at all. <eob>
It's also worth asking <eol> how the survey was carried out. <eob>
This was something called an opt-in poll, <eob> which means anyone could have found it <eol> on the internet and completed it. <eob>
There's no way of knowing <eol> if those people even identified as Muslim. <eob>
And finally, there were 600 <eol> respondents in that poll. <eob>
There are roughly three million <eol> Muslims in this country, <eob> according to Pew Research Center. <eob>
That means the poll spoke to roughly <eol> one in every 5,000 Muslims <eob> in this country. <eob>
This is one of the reasons <eob> why government statistics are often <eol> better than private statistics. <eob>
A poll might speak to a couple <eol> hundred people, maybe a thousand, <eob> or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell <eol> skin care products in 2005, <eob> then you spoke to 48 women <eol> to claim that they work. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Private companies don't have a huge <eol> interest in getting the numbers right, <eob> they just need the right numbers. <eob>
Government statisticians aren't like that. <eob>
In theory, at least, <eol> they're totally impartial, <eob> not least because most of them do <eol> their jobs regardless of who's in power. <eob> They're civil servants. <eob> And to do their jobs properly, <eob> they don't just speak <eol> to a couple hundred people. <eob>
Those unemployment numbers <eol> I keep on referencing <eob> come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <eob> and to make their estimates, <eob> they speak to over 140,000 businesses <eob> in this country. <eob>
I get it, it's frustrating. <eob>
If you want to test a statistic <eol> that comes from a private company, <eob> you can buy the face cream for you <eol> and a bunch of friends, test it out, <eob> if it doesn't work, <eol> you can say the numbers were wrong. <eob>
But how do you question <eol> government statistics? <eob>
You just keep checking everything. <eob> Find out how they collected the numbers. <eob> Find out if you're seeing everything <eol> on the chart you need to see. <eob>
But don't give up on the numbers <eol> altogether, because if you do, <eob> we'll be making public policy <eol> decisions in the dark, <eob> using nothing but private <eol> interests to guide us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It was just an ordinary Saturday. <eob>
My dad was outside mowing the lawn, <eob> my mom was upstairs folding laundry, <eob> my sister was in her room doing homework <eob> and I was in the basement <eol> playing video games. <eob>
And as I came upstairs <eol> to get something to drink, <eob> I looked out the window <eob> and realized that there was something <eol> that I was supposed to be doing, <eob> and this is what I saw. <eob>
No, this wasn't <eol> my family's dinner on fire. <eob>
This was my science project. <eob> Flames were pouring out, <eob> smoke was in the air <eob> and it looked like our wooden deck <eol> was about to catch fire. <eob>
I immediately started yelling. <eob>
My mom was freaking out, <eob> my dad ran around to put out the fire <eob> and of course my sister <eol> started recording a Snapchat video. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> This was just the beginning <eol> of my team's science project. <eob>
My team is composed of me <eol> and three other students <eob> who are here in the audience today. <eob>
We competed in FIRST LEGO League <eob> which is an international <eol> LEGO robotics competition for kids, <eob> and in addition to a robotics game, <eob> we also worked <eol> on a separate science project, <eob> and this was the project <eol> that we were working on. <eob>
So the idea for this project all started <eob> when a few months earlier, <eob> a couple of my teammates <eol> took a trip to Central America <eob> and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam, <eob> or expanded polystyrene foam. <eob>
And when they came back <eol> and told us about it, <eob> we really started thinking about the ways <eol> in which we see Styrofoam every day. <eob>
Get a new flat-screen TV? <eob>
You end up with a block of Styrofoam <eol> bigger than the TV itself. <eob>
Drink a cup of coffee? <eob>
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups <eol> are sure going to add up. <eob>
And where do all these items go <eol> after their one-time use? <eob>
Since there aren't any good <eol> existing solutions for used Styrofoam, <eob> almost all of them <eol> end up right in the landfill, <eob> or the oceans and beaches, <eob> taking over 500 years to degrade. <eob>
And in fact, every year, the US alone <eob> produces over two billion <eol> pounds of Styrofoam, <eob> filling up a staggering <eol> 25 percent of landfills. <eob>
So why do we have these ghost <eol> accumulations of Styrofoam waste? <eob>
Why can't we just recycle them <eol> like many plastics? <eob>
Well, simply put, recycled <eol> polystyrene is too expensive <eob> and potentially contaminated, <eob> so there is very little market demand <eol> for Styrofoam that has to be recycled. <eob>
And as a result, Styrofoam <eol> is considered a nonrenewable material, <eob> because it is neither feasible <eol> nor viable to recycle polystyrene. <eob>
And in fact, many cities across the US <eob> have even passed ordinances <eob> that simply ban the production <eol> of many products containing polystyrene, <eob> which includes disposable utensils, <eob> packing peanuts, takeout containers <eob> and even plastic beach toys, <eob> all products that are very useful <eol> in today's society. <eob>
And now France <eol> has become the first country <eob> to completely ban all plastic utensils, <eob> cups and plates. <eob>
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam <eob> and keep benefiting <eol> from its cheap, lightweight, insulating <eob> and excellent packing ability, <eob> while not having to suffer <eol> from the repercussions <eob> of having to dispose of it? <eob>
What if we could turn it into <eol> something else that's actually useful? <eob>
What if we could make <eol> the impossible possible? <eob>
My team hypothesized that we could use <eol> the carbon that's already in Styrofoam <eob> to create activated carbon, <eob> which is used in almost <eol> every water filter today. <eob>
And activated carbon works <eol> by using very small micropores <eob> to filter out contaminants <eol> from water or even air. <eob>
So we started out <eol> by doing a variety of heating tests, <eob> and unfortunately, we had many failures. <eob> Literally, nothing worked. <eob> Besides my dad's grill catching on fire, <eob> most of our samples <eol> vaporized into nothing, <eob> or exploded inside expensive furnaces, <eob> leaving a horribly sticky mess. <eob>
In fact, we were so saddened <eol> by our failures that we almost gave up. <eob>
So why did we keep trying <eob> when all the adults <eol> said it was impossible? <eob>
Well, maybe it's because we're kids. <eol> We don't know any better. <eob>
But the truth is, we kept trying <eol> because we thought it was still possible. <eob>
We knew that if we were successful, <eob> we would be helping the environment <eol> and making the world a better place. <eob>
So we kept trying <eob> and failing <eob> and trying <eob> and failing. <eob>
We were so ready to give up. <eob>
But then it happened. <eob> With the right temperatures, <eol> times and chemicals, <eob> we finally got that successful test result <eob> showing us that we had created <eol> activated carbon from Styrofoam waste. <eob>
And at that moment, <eol> the thing that had been impossible <eob> all of a sudden wasn't. <eob>
It showed us that although we had <eol> many failures at the beginning, <eob> we were able to persevere through them <eol> to get the test results that we wanted. <eob>
And moreover, not only were we able <eob> to create activated carbon <eob> for purifying water, <eob> but we were also able to reduce Styrofoam waste, <eob> solving two global problems <eol> with just one solution. <eob>
So from then on, we were inspired <eol> to take our project further, <eob> performing more tests <eol> to make it more effective <eob> and testing it in real world situations. <eob>
We then proceeded to receive funding <eob> from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION <eol> STEM-in-Action program <eob> sponsored by the US Army, <eob> as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards <eob> sponsored by XPRIZE. <eob>
And we were also honored <eob> with the Scientific American <eol> Innovator Award <eob> from Google Science Fair. <eob>
And using these funds, we plan <eol> to file a full patent on our process <eob> and to continue to work on our project. <eob>
So yes, although we started <eol> with catching my dad's grill on fire <eob> and failing <eob> so many times that we almost quit, <eob> it was well worth it <eol> when we look back at it now. <eob>
We took a problem <eol> that many people said was impossible <eob> and we made it possible, <eob> and we persevered when it looked <eol> like nothing that we did would work. <eob>
We learned that you can't have success <eob> without a little, <eob> or a lot, of failure. <eob>
So in the future, don't be afraid <eol> if your grill goes up in flames, <eob> because you never know <eol> when your idea might just catch fire. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Have you ever heard the one <eol> about how breastfeeding is free? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, it's pretty funny, <eob> because it's only free if we don't value <eol> women's time and energy. <eob>
Any mother can tell you <eol> how much time and energy it takes <eob> to liquify her body -- <eob> to literally dissolve herself -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
as she feeds this precious <eol> little cannibal. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Milk is why mammals suck. <eob>
At Arizona State University, <eob> in the Comparative Lactation Lab, <eob> I decode mothers' milk composition <eob> to understand its complexity <eob> and how it influences infant development. <eob>
The most important thing that I've learned <eob> is that we do not do enough <eol> to support mothers and babies. <eob>
And when we fail mothers and babies, <eob> we fail everyone <eol> who loves mothers and babies: <eob> the fathers, the partners, <eol> the grandparents, the aunties, <eob> the friends and kin <eol> that make our human social networks. <eob>
It's time that we abandon <eol> simple solutions and simple slogans, <eob> and grapple with the nuance. <eob>
I was very fortunate <eob> to run smack-dab <eol> into that nuance very early, <eob> during my first interview <eol> with a journalist <eob> when she asked me, <eob> "How long should a mother <eol> breastfeed her baby?" <eob> And it was that word "should" <eol> that brought me up short, <eob> because I will never tell a woman <eol> what she should do with her body. <eob>
Babies survive and thrive <eob> because their mother's milk <eol> is food, medicine and signal. <eob>
For young infants, <eob> mother's milk is a complete diet <eob> that provides all the building <eol> blocks for their bodies, <eob> that shapes their brain <eob> and fuels all of their activity. <eob>
Mother's milk also feeds the microbes <eob> that are colonizing <eol> the infant's intestinal tract. <eob>
Mothers aren't just eating for two, <eob> they're eating for two to the trillions. <eob>
Milk provides immunofactors <eol> that help fight pathogens <eob> and mother's milk provides hormones <eol> that signal to the infant's body. <eob>
But in recent decades, <eob> we have come to take milk for granted. <eob>
We stopped seeing <eol> something in plain sight. <eob>
We began to think of milk as standardized, <eol> homogenized, pasteurized, <eob> packaged, powdered, <eol> flavored and formulated. <eob>
We abandoned the milk of human kindness <eob> and turned our priorities elsewhere. <eob>
At the National Institutes of Health <eob> in Washington DC <eob> is the National Library of Medicine, <eob> which contains 25 million articles -- <eob> the brain trust of life science <eol> and biomedical research. <eob>
We can use keywords <eol> to search that database, <eob> and when we do that, <eob> we discover nearly a million articles about pregnancy, <eob> but far fewer about breast milk and lactation. <eob>
When we zoom in on the number of articles <eol> just investigating breast milk, <eob> we see that we know much more <eol> about coffee, wine and tomatoes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We know over twice as much <eol> about erectile dysfunction. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm not saying we shouldn't <eol> know about those things -- <eob> I'm a scientist, I think <eol> we should know about everything. <eob>
But that we know so much less -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
about breast milk -- <eob> the first fluid a young mammal <eol> is adapted to consume -- <eob> should make us angry. <eob>
Globally, nine out of 10 women will <eol> have at least one child in her lifetime. <eob>
That means that nearly 130 million <eol> babies are born each year. <eob>
These mothers and babies <eol> deserve our best science. <eob>
Recent research has shown <eol> that milk doesn't just grow the body, <eob> it fuels behavior <eol> and shapes neurodevelopment. <eob>
In 2015, researchers discovered <eob> that the mixture of breast milk <eol> and baby saliva -- <eob> specifically, baby saliva -- <eob> causes a chemical reaction <eol> that produces hydrogen peroxide <eob> that can kill staph and salmonella. <eob>
And from humans and other mammal species, <eob> we're starting to understand <eol> that the biological recipe of milk <eob> can be different when produced <eol> for sons or daughters. <eob>
When we reach for donor milk <eol> in the neonatal intensive care unit, <eob> or formula on the store shelf, <eob> it's nearly one-size-fits-all. <eob>
We aren't thinking about how sons <eol> and daughters may grow at different rates, <eob> or different ways, <eob> and that milk may be a part of that. <eob>
Mothers have gotten the message <eob> and the vast majority of mothers <eol> intend to breastfeed, <eob> but many do not reach <eol> their breastfeeding goals. <eob>
That is not their failure; <eob> it's ours. <eob>
Increasingly common medical conditions <eol> like obesity, endocrine disorders, <eob> C-section and preterm births <eob> all can disrupt the underlying <eol> biology of lactation. <eob>
And many women do not have <eol> knowledgeable clinical support. <eob>
Twenty-five years ago, <eob> the World Health Organization <eol> and UNICEF established criteria <eob> for hospitals to be <eol> considered baby friendly -- <eob> that provide the optimal level <eol> of support for mother-infant bonding <eob> and infant feeding. <eob>
Today, only one in five babies <eol> in the United States <eob> is born in a baby-friendly hospital. <eob>
This is a problem, <eob> because mothers can grapple <eol> with many problems <eob> in the minutes, hours, days <eol> and weeks of lactation. <eob>
They can have struggles <eol> with establishing latch, <eob> with pain, <eob> with milk letdown <eob> and perceptions of milk supply. <eob>
These mothers deserve <eol> knowledgeable clinical staff <eob> that understand these processes. <eob>
Mothers will call me as they're <eol> grappling with these struggles, <eob> crying with wobbly voices. <eob> "It's not working. <eob>
This is what I'm supposed <eol> to naturally be able to do. <eob>
Why is it not working?" <eob> And just because something <eol> is evolutionarily ancient <eob> doesn't mean that it's easy <eol> or that we're instantly good at it. <eob>
You know what else <eol> is evolutionarily ancient? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sex. <eob> And nobody expects us <eol> to start out being good at it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Clinicians best deliver <eol> quality equitable care <eob> when they have continuing education <eob> about how to best support <eol> lactation and breastfeeding. <eob>
And in order to have <eol> that continuing education, <eob> we need to anchor it <eol> to cutting-edge research <eob> in both the life sciences <eol> and the social sciences, <eob> because we need to recognize <eob> that too often <eob> historical traumas and implicit biases <eob> sit in the space between <eol> a new mother and her clinician. <eob>
The body is political. <eob>
If our breastfeeding support <eol> is not intersectional, <eob> it's not good enough. <eob>
And for moms who have to return for work, <eob> because countries like the United States <eol> do not provide paid parental leave, <eob> they can have to go back in as short <eol> as just a few days after giving birth. <eob>
How do we optimize mother <eol> and infant health <eob> just by messaging about breast milk to moms <eob> without providing the institutional support <eob> that facilitates that mother-infant bonding <eob> to support breastfeeding? <eob>
The answer is: we can't. <eob>
I'm talking to you, legislators, <eob> and the voters who elect them. <eob>
I'm talking to you, job creators <eol> and collective bargaining units, <eob> and workers, and shareholders. <eob>
We all have a stake <eol> in the public health of our community, <eob> and we all have a role <eol> to play in achieving it. <eob>
Breast milk is a part <eol> of improving human health. <eob>
In the NICU, when infants are born <eol> early or sick or injured, <eob> milk or bioactive constituents in milk <eol> can be critically important. <eob>
Environments or ecologies, <eob> or communities where there's <eol> high risk of infectious disease, <eob> breast milk can be incredibly protective. <eob>
Where there are emergencies <eol> like storms and earthquakes, <eob> when the electricity goes out, <eob> when safe water is not available, <eob> breast milk can keep babies <eol> fed and hydrated. <eob>
And in the context of humanitarian crises, <eob> like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones, <eob> the smallest drops can buffer babies <eol> from the biggest global challenges. <eob>
But understanding breast milk <eol> is not just about messaging to mothers <eob> and policy makers. <eob>
It's also about understanding <eol> what is important in breast milk <eob> so that we can deliver better formulas <eob> to moms who cannot or do not <eol> breastfeed for whatever reason. <eob>
We can all do a better job <eob> of supporting the diversity <eol> of moms raising their babies <eob> in a diversity of ways. <eob>
As women around the world struggle <eob> to achieve political, <eol> social and economic equality, <eob> we must reimagine motherhood <eob> as not the central, <eol> core aspect of womanhood, <eob> but one of the many potential facets <eol> of what makes women awesome. <eob>
It's time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So it all came to life <eob> in a dark bar in Madrid. <eob>
I encountered my colleague from McGill, <eol> Michael Meaney. <eob>
And we were drinking a few beers, <eob> and like scientists do, <eob> he told me about his work. <eob>
And he told me that he is interested <eol> in how mother rats lick their pups <eob> after they were born. <eob>
And I was sitting there and saying, <eob> "This is where my tax dollars are wasted — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> on this kind of soft science." <eob> And he started telling me <eob> that the rats, like humans, <eob> lick their pups in very different ways. <eob>
Some mothers do a lot of that, <eob> some mothers do very little, <eob> and most are in between. <eob>
But what's interesting about it <eob> is when he follows these pups <eol> when they become adults -- <eob> like, years in human life, <eol> long after their mother died. <eob> They are completely different animals. <eob>
The animals that were licked and groomed heavily, <eob> the high-licking and grooming, <eob> are not stressed. <eob>
They have different sexual behavior. <eob>
They have a different way of living <eob> than those that were not treated <eol> as intensively by their mothers. <eob>
So then I was thinking to myself: <eob> Is this magic? <eob> How does this work? <eob> As geneticists would like you to think, <eob> perhaps the mother had the <eol> "bad mother" gene <eob> that caused her pups to be stressful, <eob> and then it was passed <eol> from generation to generation; <eob> it's all determined by genetics. <eob>
Or is it possible that something <eol> else is going on here? <eob>
In rats, we can ask this question <eol> and answer it. <eob>
So what we did is a cross-fostering experiment. <eob>
You essentially separate the litter, <eol> the babies of this rat, at birth, <eob> to two kinds of fostering mothers -- <eob> not the real mothers, but mothers <eol> that will take care of them: <eob> high-licking mothers and low-licking mothers. <eob>
And you can do the opposite <eol> with the low-licking pups. <eob>
And the remarkable answer was, <eob> it wasn't important what gene <eol> you got from your mother. <eob>
It was not the biological mother <eol> that defined this property of these rats. <eob> It is the mother that took care <eol> of the pups. <eob>
So how can this work? <eob>
I am an a epigeneticist. <eob>
I am interested in how genes <eol> are marked <eob> by a chemical mark <eob> during embryogenesis, during the time <eol> we're in the womb of our mothers, <eob> and decide which gene will be expressed <eob> in what tissue. <eob>
Different genes are expressed in the brain <eol> than in the liver and the eye. <eob>
And we thought: Is it possible <eob> that the mother is somehow reprogramming <eol> the gene of her offspring <eob> through her behavior? <eob>
And we spent 10 years, <eob> and we found that there is a cascade <eol> of biochemical events <eob> by which the licking and grooming <eol> of the mother, the care of the mother, <eob> is translated to biochemical signals <eob> that go into the nucleus and into the DNA <eob> and program it differently. <eob>
So now the animal <eol> can prepare itself for life: <eob> Is life going to be harsh? <eob>
Is there going to be a lot of food? <eob>
Are there going to be <eol> a lot of cats and snakes around, <eob> or will I live in an upper-class neighborhood <eob> where all I have to do <eol> is behave well and proper, <eob> and that will gain me social acceptance? <eob>
And now one can think about how important <eol> that process can be <eob> for our lives. <eob>
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors. <eob>
The DNA is old. <eob>
It evolved during evolution. <eob>
But it doesn't tell us if you are going <eol> to be born in Stockholm, <eob> where the days are long in the summer <eol> and short in the winter, <eob> or in Ecuador, <eob> where there's an equal number of hours <eol> for day and night all year round. <eob>
And that has such an enormous [effect] on our physiology. <eob>
So what we suggest is, perhaps <eol> what happens early in life, <eob> those signals <eol> that come through the mother, <eob> tell the child what kind of social world <eol> you're going to be living in. <eob>
It will be harsh, and you'd better be anxious <eol> and be stressful, <eob> or it's going to be an easy world, <eol> and you have to be different. <eob>
Is it going to be a world <eol> with a lot of light or little light? <eob>
Is it going to be a world <eol> with a lot of food or little food? <eob>
If there's no food around, <eob> you'd better develop your brain <eol> to binge whenever you see a meal, <eob> or store every piece of food <eol> that you have as fat. <eob>
So this is good. <eob> Evolution has selected this <eob> to allow our fixed, old DNA <eol> to function in a dynamic way <eob> in new environments. <eob>
But sometimes things can go wrong; <eob> for example, if you're born <eol> to a poor family <eob> and the signals <eol> are, "You better binge, <eob> you better eat every piece of food <eol> you're going to encounter." <eob> But now we humans <eol> and our brain have evolved, <eob> have changed evolution even faster. <eob>
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar. <eob>
And therefore, the preparation <eol> that we had by our mothers <eob> is turning out to be maladaptive. <eob>
The same preparation that was supposed <eol> to protect us from hunger and famine <eob> is going to cause obesity, <eob> cardiovascular problems <eol> and metabolic disease. <eob>
So this concept that genes could <eol> be marked by our experience, <eob> and especially the early life experience, <eob> can provide us a unifying explanation <eob> of both health and disease. <eob>
But is true only for rats? <eob>
The problem is, we cannot test <eol> this in humans, <eob> because ethically, we cannot administer <eol> child adversity in a random way. <eob>
So if a poor child develops <eol> a certain property, <eob> we don't know whether this <eol> is caused by poverty <eob> or whether poor people have bad genes. <eob>
So geneticists will try to tell you <eol> that poor people are poor <eob> because their genes make them poor. <eob>
Epigeneticists will tell you <eob> poor people are in a bad environment <eol> or an impoverished environment <eob> that creates that phenotype, that property. <eob>
So we moved to look into <eol> our cousins, the monkeys. <eob>
My colleague, Stephen Suomi, <eol> has been rearing monkeys <eob> in two different ways: <eob> randomly separated <eol> the monkey from the mother <eob> and reared her with a nurse <eob> and surrogate motherhood conditions. <eob>
So these monkeys didn't have a mother; <eol> they had a nurse. <eob>
And other monkeys were reared <eol> with their normal, natural mothers. <eob>
And when they were old, <eol> they were completely different animals. <eob>
The monkeys that had a mother <eol> did not care about alcohol, <eob> they were not sexually aggressive. <eob>
The monkeys that didn't have a mother <eol> were aggressive, were stressed <eob> and were alcoholics. <eob>
So we looked at their DNA <eol> early after birth, to see: <eob> Is it possible that the mother is marking? <eob>
Is there a signature of the mother <eol> in the DNA of the offspring? <eob>
These are Day-14 monkeys, <eob> and what you see here is the modern way <eol> by which we study epigenetics. <eob>
We can now map those chemical marks, <eol> which we call methylation marks, <eob> on DNA at a single <eol> nucleotide resolution. <eob>
We can map the entire genome. <eob>
We can now compare the monkey <eol> that had a mother or not. <eob>
And here's a visual presentation of this. <eob>
What you see is the genes <eol> that got more methylated are red. <eob>
The genes that got less met <eol>hylated are green. <eob>
You can see many genes are changing, <eob> because not having a mother <eol> is not just one thing -- <eob> it affects the whole way; <eob> it sends signals <eol> about the whole way your world is going to look <eob> when you become an adult. <eob>
And you can see the two groups of monkeys <eob> extremely well-separated from each other. <eob>
How early does this develop? <eob>
These monkeys already <eol> didn't see their mothers, <eob> so they had a social experience. <eob>
Do we sense our social status, <eol> even at the moment of birth? <eob>
So in this experiment, <eol> we took placentas of monkeys <eob> that had different social status. <eob>
What's interesting about social rank <eol> is that across all living beings, <eob> they will structure themselves <eol> by hierarchy. <eob>
Monkey number one is the boss; <eob> monkey number four is the peon. <eob>
You put four monkeys in a cage, <eob> there will always be a boss <eol> and always be a peon. <eob>
And what's interesting <eol> is that the monkey number one <eob> is much healthier than monkey <eol> number four. <eob>
And if you put them in a cage, <eob> monkey number one will not eat as much. <eob> Monkey number four will eat [a lot]. <eob>
And what you see here <eol> in this methylation mapping, <eob> a dramatic separation at birth <eob> of the animals that had a high social status <eob> versus the animals that did not have <eol> a high status. <eob>
So we are born already knowing <eol> the social information, <eob> and that social information <eol> is not bad or good, <eob> it just prepares us for life, <eob> because we have to program <eol> our biology differently <eob> if we are in the high <eol> or the low social status. <eob>
But how can you study this in humans? <eob>
We can't do experiments, <eol> we can't administer adversity to humans. <eob>
But God does experiments with humans, <eob> and it's called natural disasters. <eob>
One of the hardest natural disasters <eol> in Canadian history <eob> happened in my province of Quebec. <eob>
It's the ice storm of 1998. <eob>
We lost our entire electrical grid <eol> because of an ice storm <eob> when the temperatures were, <eol> in the dead of winter in Quebec, <eob> minus 20 to minus 30. <eob> And there were pregnant mothers <eol> during that time. <eob>
And my colleague Suzanne King <eol> followed the children of these mothers <eob> for 15 years. <eob>
And what happened was, <eol> that as the stress increased -- <eob> and here we had objective <eol> measures of stress: <eob> How long were you without power? <eol> Where did you spend your time? <eob> Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment <eol> or in some posh country home? <eob>
So all of these added up <eol> to a social stress scale, <eob> and you can ask the question: <eob> How did the children look? <eob>
And it appears that as stress increases, <eob> the children develop more autism, <eob> they develop more metabolic diseases <eob> and they develop more autoimmune diseases. <eob>
We would map the methylation state, <eob> and again, you see the green genes <eol> becoming red as stress increases, <eob> the red genes becoming green <eol> as stress increases, <eob> an entire rearrangement <eol> of the genome in response to stress. <eob>
So if we can program genes, <eob> if we are not just the slaves <eol> of the history of our genes, <eob> that they could be programmed, <eol> can we deprogram them? <eob>
Because epigenetic causes <eol> can cause diseases like cancer, <eob> metabolic disease <eob> and mental health diseases. <eob>
Let's talk about cocaine addiction. <eob>
Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation <eob> that can lead to death <eol> and to loss of human life. <eob>
We asked the question: <eob> Can we reprogram the addicted brain <eob> to make that animal not addicted anymore? <eob>
We used a cocaine addiction model <eob> that recapitulates what happens in humans. <eob>
In humans, you're in high school, <eob> some friends suggest you use some cocaine, <eob> you take cocaine, nothing happens. <eob>
Months pass by, something reminds <eol> you of what happened the first time, <eob> a pusher pushes cocaine, <eob> and you become addicted <eol> and your life has changed. <eob>
In rats, we do the same thing. <eob>
My colleague, Gal Yadid, <eob> he trains the animals <eol> to get used to cocaine, <eob> then for one month, no cocaine. <eob>
Then he reminds them of the party <eol> when they saw the cocaine the first time <eob> by cue, the colors of the cage <eol> when they saw cocaine. <eob> And they go crazy. <eob>
They will press the lever to get cocaine <eob> until they die. <eob>
We first determined <eol> that the difference between these animals <eob> is that during that time <eol> when nothing happens, <eob> there's no cocaine around, <eob> their epigenome is rearranged. <eob>
Their genes are re-marked in a different way, <eob> and when the cue comes, <eol> their genome is ready <eob> to develop this addictive phenotype. <eob>
So we treated these animals with drugs <eol> that either increase DNA methylation, <eob> which was the epigenetic marker to look at, <eob> or decrease epigenetic markings. <eob>
And we found that if we increased <eol> methylation, <eob> these animals go even crazier. <eob>
They become more craving for cocaine. <eob>
But if we reduce the DNA methylation, <eob> the animals are not addicted anymore. <eob>
We have reprogrammed them. <eob>
And a fundamental difference <eol> between an epigenetic drug <eob> and any other drug <eob> is that with epigenetic drugs, <eob> we essentially remove the signs of experience, <eob> and once they're gone, <eob> they will not come back unless <eol> you have the same experience. <eob>
The animal now is reprogrammed. <eob>
So when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later, <eob> which is in human terms many years of life, <eob> they were still not addicted -- <eol> by a single epigenetic treatment. <eob>
So what did we learn about DNA? <eob>
DNA is not just a sequence of letters; <eob> it's not just a script. <eob>
DNA is a dynamic movie. <eob>
Our experiences are being written <eol> into this movie, which is interactive. <eob>
You're, like, watching a movie <eol> of your life, with the DNA, <eob> with your remote control. <eob>
You can remove an actor and add an actor. <eob>
And so you have, in spite <eol> of the deterministic nature of genetics, <eob> you have control of the way <eol> your genes look, <eob> and this has a tremendous optimistic message <eob> for the ability to now encounter <eol> some of the deadly diseases <eob> like cancer, mental health, <eob> with a new approach, <eob> looking at them as maladaptation. <eob>
And if we can epigenetically intervene, <eob> [we can] reverse the movie <eol> by removing an actor <eob> and setting up a new narrative. <eob>
So what I told you today is, <eob> our DNA is really combined <eol> of two components, <eob> two layers of information. <eob>
One layer of information is old, <eob> evolved from millions <eol> of years of evolution. <eob> It is fixed and very hard to change. <eob>
The other layer of information <eol> is the epigenetic layer, <eob> which is open and dynamic <eob> and sets up a narrative <eol> that is interactive, <eob> that allows us to control, <eol> to a large extent, our destiny, <eob> to help the destiny <eol> of our children <eob> and to hopefully conquer disease <eob> and serious health challenges <eob> that have plagued humankind <eol> for a long time. <eob>
So even though we are determined <eob> by our genes, <eob> we have a degree of freedom <eob> that can set up our life <eol> to a life of responsibility. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I was 10 years old when I learned <eol> what the word "genocide" meant. <eob>
It was 2003, <eob> and my people were being brutally attacked <eol> because of their race -- <eob> hundreds of thousands murdered, <eob> millions displaced, <eob> a nation torn apart <eol> at the hands of its own government. <eob>
My mother and father immediately began <eol> speaking out against the crisis. <eob>
I didn't really understand it, <eob> except for the fact <eol> that it was destroying my parents. <eob>
One day, I walked in <eol> on my mother crying, <eob> and I asked her why we are burying so many people. <eob>
I don't remember the words <eol> that she chose <eob> to describe genocide <eol> to her 10-year-old daughter, <eob> but I remember the feeling. <eob>
We felt completely alone, <eob> as if no one could hear us, <eob> as if we were essentially invisible. <eob>
This is when I wrote my first <eol> poem about Darfur. <eob>
I wrote poetry to convince <eol> people to hear and see us, <eob> and that's how I learned <eol> the thing that changed me. <eob>
It's easy to be seen. <eob>
I mean, look at me -- I'm a young African woman <eol> with a scarf around my head, <eob> an American accent on my tongue <eob> and a story that makes even the most brutal <eol> of Monday mornings seem inviting. <eob>
But it's hard to convince people <eol> that they deserve to be seen. <eob>
I learned this in my high school classroom one day, <eob> when my teacher asked me <eol> to give a presentation about Darfur. <eob>
I was setting up the projector <eol> when a classmate of mine said, <eob> "Why do you have to talk about this? <eob>
Can't you think about us <eol> and how it will make us feel?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My 14-year-old self didn't know <eol> what to say to her, <eob> or how to explain the pain <eol> that I felt in that moment, <eob> and in every moment that we were forced <eol> not to talk about "this." <eob> Her words took me back to the days <eol> and nights on the ground in Darfur, <eob> where we were forced to remain silent; <eob> where we didn't speak over morning tea <eob> because the warplanes overhead <eol> would swallow any and all noise; <eob> back to the days when we were told <eob> not only that we don't deserve to be heard <eob> but that we do not have a right to exist. <eob>
And this is where the magic happened, <eob> in that classroom when all the students <eol> started taking their seats <eob> and I began to speak, <eob> despite this renewed feeling <eol> that I didn't deserve to be there, <eob> that I didn't belong there <eob> or have a right to break the silence. <eob>
As I talked, <eob> and my classmates listened, <eob> the fear ebbed away. <eob> My mind became calm, <eob> and I felt safe. <eob>
It was the sound of our grieving, <eob> the feel of their arms around me, <eob> the steady walls that held us together. <eob>
It felt nothing like a vacuum. <eob>
I choose poetry because it's so visceral. <eob>
When someone is standing in front <eol> of you, mind, body and soul, <eob> saying "Witness me," <eob> it's impossible not to become keenly aware <eol> of your own humanity. <eob>
This changed everything for me. <eob>
It gave me courage. <eob>
Every day I experience <eol> the power of witness, <eob> and because of that, I am whole. <eob>
And so now I ask: <eob> Will you witness me? <eob>
They hand me the microphone <eob> as my shoulders sink <eol> under the weight of this stress. <eob>
The woman says, <eob> "The one millionth refugee <eol> just left South Sudan. <eob> Can you comment?" <eob>
I feel my feet rock back and forth <eol> on the heels my mother bought, <eob>
begging the question: <eob>
Do we stay, or is it safer <eol> to choose flight? <eob>
My mind echoes the numbers: <eob>
one million gone, <eob>
two million displaced, <eob>
400,000 dead in Darfur. <eob>
And this lump takes over my throat, <eob>
as if each of those bodies <eol> just found a grave <eob>
right here in my esophagus. <eob>
Our once country, <eob>
all north and south and east and west, <eob>
so restless the Nile couldn't <eol> hold us together, <eob>
and you ask me to summarize. <eob>
They talk about the numbers <eol> as if this isn't still happening, <eob>
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria, <eob>
as if 3,000 aren't still <eol> making their final stand <eob>
at the bottom of the Mediterranean, <eob>
as if there aren't entire volumes full of fact <eol> sheets about our genocides, <eob>
and now they want me to write one. <eob>
Fact: <eob>
we never talked over breakfast, <eob>
because the warplanes <eol> would swallow our voices. <eob>
Fact: <eob>
my grandfather didn't want to leave home, <eob>
so he died in a war zone. <eob>
Fact: <eob>
a burning bush without God is just a fire. <eob>
I measure the distance between what I know <eob>
and what is safe to say on a microphone. <eob>
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement? <eob>
Do I mention the violence, <eob>
how it's never as simple <eol> as what you see on TV, <eob>
how there are weeks' worth <eol> of fear before the camera is on? <eob>
Do I tell her about our bodies, <eob>
how they are 60 percent water, <eob>
but we still burn like driftwood, <eob>
making fuel of our sacrifice? <eob>
Do I tell her the men died first, mothers <eol> forced to watch the slaughter? <eob>
That they came for our children, <eob>
scattering them across the continent <eol> until our homes sank? <eob>
That even castles sink <eol> at the bite of the bomb? <eob>
Do I talk about the elderly, <eob> our heroes, <eob>
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot, <eob>
how they would march them, <eob>
hands raised, rifles at their backs, <eob> into the fire? <eob>
How their walking sticks <eol> kept the flames alive? <eob>
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires <eol> and an audience to swallow. <eob>
Too relentless, <eob>
like the valley that filled with the putrid <eol> smoke of our deaths. <eob>
Is it better in verse? <eob>
Can a stanza become a burial shroud? <eob>
Will it sting less if I say it softly? <eob>
If you don't see me cry, <eol> will you listen better? <eob>
Will the pain leave <eol> when the microphone does? <eob>
Why does every word feel <eol> as if I'm saying my last? <eob>
Thirty seconds for the sound bite, <eob>
and now three minutes for the poem. <eob>
My tongue goes dry the same way we died, <eob>
becoming ash, having never been coal. <eob>
I feel my left leg go numb, <eob>
and I realize that I locked my knees, <eob> bracing for impact. <eob>
I never wear shoes I can't run in. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note, <eob> because that's the paradox <eol> that this life has been: <eob> in the places where I learned <eol> to cry the most, <eob> I also learned how to smile after. <eob> So, here goes. <eob>
"You Have a Big Imagination <eob> or <eob> 400,000 Ways to Cry." <eob> For Zeinab. <eob>
I am a sad girl, <eob>
but my face makes other plans, <eob>
focusing energy on this smile, <eol> so as not to waste it on pain. <eob>
The first thing they took was my sleep, <eob>
eyes heavy but wide open, <eob>
thinking maybe I missed something, <eob>
maybe the cavalry is still coming. <eob>
They didn't come, <eob>
so I bought bigger pillows. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My grandmother could cure anything <eob>
by talking the life out of it. <eob>
And she said that I could make <eol> a thief in a silo laugh <eob> in the middle of our raging war. <eob>
War makes a broken marriage <eol> bed out of sorrow. <eob>
You want nothing more than to disappear, <eob>
but your heart can't salvage <eol> enough remnants to leave. <eob>
But joy -- <eob>
joy is the armor we carried <eol> across the borders of our broken homeland. <eob>
A hasty mix of stories and faces <eob> that lasts long after the flavor is gone. <eob>
A muscle memory that overcomes <eol> even the most bitter of times, <eob>
my memory is spotted with days <eol> of laughing until I cried, <eob>
or <eob> crying <eol> until I laughed. <eob>
Laughter and tears are both involunt <eol>ary human reactions, <eob>
testaments to our capacity for expression. <eob>
So allow me to express <eob>
that if I make you laugh, <eob> it's usually on purpose. <eob>
And if I make you cry, <eob> I'll still think you are beautiful. <eob>
This is for my cousin Zeinab, <eob>
bedridden on a random afternoon. <eob>
I hadn't seen her since the last <eol> time we were in Sudan together, <eob>
and there I was at her hospital bedside <eob>
in a 400-year-old building in France. <eob>
Zeinab wanted to hear poems. <eob>
Suddenly, English, Arabic and French <eol> were not enough. <eob>
Every word I knew became empty noise, <eob>
and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I read her everything that I could, <eob> and we laughed, <eob> and we loved it, <eob>
and it was the most important stage <eol> that I've ever stood on, <eob>
surrounded by family, <eob>
by remnants of a people who were given <eol> as a dowry to a relentless war <eob>
but still managed to make <eol> pearls of this life; <eob>
by the ones <eol> who taught me to not only laugh, <eob>
but to live in the face of death; <eob>
who placed their hands across the sky, <eob>
measuring the distance to the sun <eol> and saying, "Smile; <eob> I'm gonna meet you there." <eob>
And for Zeinab — <eob>
Zeinab, who taught me love <eol> in a place like France, <eob>
Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar <eol> poems on her deathbed — <eob>
Dilated fibromyalgia. <eob>
Her heart muscles expanded <eob> until they couldn't function. <eob>
And she held me, and she made <eol> me feel like gold. <eob>
And I said, "Zeinab, <eob>
isn't it strange that your only problem <eob>
is that your heart was too big?" <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In the movie "Interstellar," <eob> we get an up-close look <eol> at a supermassive black hole. <eob>
Set against a backdrop of bright gas, <eob> the black hole's massive <eol> gravitational pull <eob> bends light into a ring. <eob>
However, this isn't a real photograph, <eob> but a computer graphic rendering -- <eob> an artistic interpretation <eol> of what a black hole might look like. <eob>
A hundred years ago, <eob> Albert Einstein first published <eol> his theory of general relativity. <eob>
In the years since then, <eob> scientists have provided <eol> a lot of evidence in support of it. <eob>
But one thing predicted <eol> from this theory, black holes, <eob> still have not been directly observed. <eob>
Although we have some idea <eol> as to what a black hole might look like, <eob> we've never actually taken <eol> a picture of one before. <eob>
However, you might be surprised to know <eol> that that may soon change. <eob>
We may be seeing our first picture <eol> of a black hole in the next couple years. <eob>
Getting this first picture will come down <eol> to an international team of scientists, <eob> an Earth-sized telescope <eob> and an algorithm that puts together <eol> the final picture. <eob>
Although I won't be able to show you <eol> a real picture of a black hole today, <eob> I'd like to give you a brief glimpse <eol> into the effort involved <eob> in getting that first picture. <eob>
My name is Katie Bouman, <eob> and I'm a PhD student at MIT. <eob>
I do research in a computer science lab <eob> that works on making computers <eol> see through images and video. <eob>
But although I'm not an astronomer, <eob> today I'd like to show you <eob> how I've been able to contribute <eol> to this exciting project. <eob>
If you go out past <eol> the bright city lights tonight, <eob> you may just be lucky enough <eol> to see a stunning view <eob> of the Milky Way Galaxy. <eob>
And if you could zoom past <eol> millions of stars, <eob> 26,000 light-years toward the heart <eol> of the spiraling Milky Way, <eob> we'd eventually reach <eol> a cluster of stars right at the center. <eob>
Peering past all the galactic dust <eol> with infrared telescopes, <eob> astronomers have watched these stars <eol> for over 16 years. <eob>
But it's what they don't see <eol> that is the most spectacular. <eob>
These stars seem to orbit <eol> an invisible object. <eob>
By tracking the paths of these stars, <eob> astronomers have concluded <eob> that the only thing small and heavy <eol> enough to cause this motion <eob> is a supermassive black hole -- <eob> an object so dense that it sucks up <eol> anything that ventures too close -- <eob> even light. <eob>
But what happens if we were <eol> to zoom in even further? <eob>
Is it possible to see something <eol> that, by definition, is impossible to see? <eob>
Well, it turns out that if we were <eol> to zoom in at radio wavelengths, <eob> we'd expect to see a ring of light <eob> caused by the gravitational <eol> lensing of hot plasma <eob> zipping around the black hole. <eob>
In other words, <eob> the black hole casts a shadow <eol> on this backdrop of bright material, <eob> carving out a sphere of darkness. <eob>
This bright ring reveals <eol> the black hole's event horizon, <eob> where the gravitational <eol> pull becomes so great <eob> that not <eob> even light <eob> can escape. <eob>
Einstein's equations predict <eol> the size and shape of this ring, <eob> so taking a picture of it <eol> wouldn't only be really cool, <eob> it would also help to verify <eol> that these equations hold <eob> in the extreme conditions <eol> around the black hole. <eob>
However, this black hole <eol> is so far away from us, <eob> that from Earth, this ring appears <eol> incredibly small -- <eob> the same size to us as an orange <eol> on the surface of the moon. <eob>
That makes taking a picture of it <eol> extremely difficult. <eob> Why is that? <eob> Well, it all comes down <eol> to a simple equation. <eob>
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction, <eob> there are fundamental limits <eob> to the smallest objects <eol> that we can possibly see. <eob>
This governing equation says <eol> that in order to see smaller and smaller, <eob> we need to make our telescope <eol> bigger and bigger. <eob>
But even with the most powerful <eol> optical telescopes here on Earth, <eob> we can't even get close <eol> to the resolution necessary <eob> to image on the surface of the moon. <eob>
In fact, here I show one of the highest <eol> resolution images ever taken <eob> of the moon from Earth. <eob>
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels, <eob> and yet each pixel would contain <eol> over 1.5 million oranges. <eob>
So how big of a telescope do we need <eob> in order to see an orange <eol> on the surface of the moon <eob> and, by extension, our black hole? <eob>
Well, it turns out <eol> that by crunching the numbers, <eob> you can easily calculate <eol> that we would need a telescope <eob> the size of the entire Earth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If we could build <eol> this Earth-sized telescope, <eob> we could just start to make out <eol> that distinctive ring of light <eob> indicative of the black <eol> hole's event horizon. <eob>
Although this picture wouldn't contain <eol> all the detail we see <eob> in computer graphic renderings, <eob> it would allow us to safely get <eol> our first glimpse <eob> of the immediate environment <eol> around a black hole. <eob>
However, as you can imagine, <eob> building a single-dish telescope <eol> the size of the Earth is impossible. <eob>
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger, <eob> "You can't always get what you want, <eob> but if you try sometimes, <eol> you just might find <eob> you get what you need." <eob> And by connecting telescopes <eol> from around the world, <eob> an international collaboration <eol> called the Event Horizon Telescope <eob> is creating a computational telescope <eol> the size of the Earth, <eob> capable of resolving structure <eob> on the scale of a black <eol> hole's event horizon. <eob>
This network of telescopes is scheduled <eol> to take its very first picture <eob> of a black hole next year. <eob>
Each telescope in the worldwide <eol> network works together. <eob>
Linked through the precise <eol> timing of atomic clocks, <eob> teams of researchers <eol> at each of the sites freeze light <eob> by collecting thousands of terabytes of data. <eob>
This data is then processed in a lab <eol> right here in Massachusetts. <eob>
So how does this even work? <eob> Remember if we want to see the black hole <eol> in the center of our galaxy, <eob> we need to build this impossibly large <eol> Earth-sized telescope? <eob>
For just a second, <eol> let's pretend we could build <eob> a telescope the size of the Earth. <eob>
This would be a little bit <eol> like turning the Earth <eob> into a giant spinning disco ball. <eob>
Each individual mirror would collect light <eob> that we could then combine <eol> together to make a picture. <eob>
However, now let's say <eol> we remove most of those mirrors <eob> so only a few remained. <eob>
We could still try to combine <eol> this information together, <eob> but now there are a lot of holes. <eob>
These remaining mirrors represent <eol> the locations where we have telescopes. <eob>
This is an incredibly small number <eol> of measurements to make a picture from. <eob>
But although we only collect light <eol> at a few telescope locations, <eob> as the Earth rotates, we get to see <eol> other new measurements. <eob>
In other words, <eob> as the disco ball spins, <eol> those mirrors change locations <eob> and we get to observe different parts of the image. <eob>
The imaging algorithms we develop <eol> fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball <eob> in order to reconstruct <eol> the underlying black hole image. <eob>
If we had telescopes located <eol> everywhere on the globe -- <eob> in other words, the entire disco ball -- <eob> this would be trivial. <eob>
However, we only see a few samples, <eol> and for that reason, <eob> there are an infinite number <eol> of possible images <eob> that are perfectly consistent <eol> with our telescope measurements. <eob>
However, not all images are created equal. <eob>
Some of those images look more like <eol> what we think of as images than others. <eob>
And so, my role in helping to take <eol> the first image of a black hole <eob> is to design algorithms that find <eol> the most reasonable image <eob> that also fits the telescope measurements. <eob>
Just as a forensic sketch artist <eol> uses limited descriptions <eob> to piece together a picture using <eol> their knowledge of face structure, <eob> the imaging algorithms I develop <eol> use our limited telescope data <eob> to guide us to a picture that also <eol> looks like stuff in our universe. <eob>
Using these algorithms, <eol> we're able to piece together pictures <eob> from this sparse, noisy data. <eob>
So here I show a sample reconstruction <eol> done using simulated data, <eob> when we pretend to point our telescopes <eob> to the black hole <eol> in the center of our galaxy. <eob>
Although this is just a simulation, <eol> reconstruction such as this give us hope <eob> that we'll soon be able to reliably take <eol> the first image of a black hole <eob> and from it, determine <eol> the size of its ring. <eob>
Although I'd love to go on <eol> about all the details of this algorithm, <eob> luckily for you, I don't have the time. <eob>
But I'd still like <eol> to give you a brief idea <eob> of how we define <eol> what our universe looks like, <eob> and how we use this to reconstruct <eol> and verify our results. <eob>
Since <eob> there are an infinite number of possible images <eob> that perfectly explain our telescope measurements, <eob> we have to choose between them in some way. <eob>
We do this by ranking the images <eob> based upon how likely they are <eol> to be the black hole image, <eob> and then choosing the one <eol> that's most likely. <eob>
So what do I mean by this exactly? <eob>
Let's say we were trying to make a model <eob> that told us how likely an image <eol> were to appear on Facebook. <eob>
We'd probably want the model to say <eob> it's pretty unlikely that someone <eol> would post this noise image on the left, <eob> and pretty likely that someone <eol> would post a selfie <eob> like this one on the right. <eob>
The image in the middle is blurry, <eob> so even though it's more likely <eol> we'd see it on Facebook <eob> compared to the noise image, <eob> it's probably less likely we'd see it <eol> compared to the selfie. <eob>
But when it comes to images <eol> from the black hole, <eob> we're posed with a real conundrum: <eol> we've never seen a black hole before. <eob>
In that case, what is a likely <eol> black hole image, <eob> and what should we assume <eol> about the structure of black holes? <eob>
We could try to use images <eol> from simulations we've done, <eob> like the image of the black hole <eol> from "Interstellar," <eob> but if we did this, <eol> it could cause some serious problems. <eob>
What would happen <eol> if Einstein's theories didn't hold? <eob>
We'd still want to reconstruct <eol> an accurate picture of what was going on. <eob>
If we bake Einstein's equations <eol> too much into our algorithms, <eob> we'll just end up seeing <eol> what we expect to see. <eob>
In other words, <eob> we want to leave the option open <eob> for there being a giant elephant <eol> at the center of our galaxy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Different types of images have <eol> very distinct features. <eob>
We can easily tell the difference <eol> between black hole simulation images <eob> and images we take <eol> every day here on Earth. <eob>
We need a way to tell our algorithms <eol> what images look like <eob> without imposing one type <eol> of image's features too much. <eob>
One way we can try to get around this <eob> is by imposing the features <eol> of different kinds of images <eob> and seeing how the type of image we assume <eol> affects our reconstructions. <eob>
If all images' types produce <eol> a very similar-looking image, <eob> then we can start to become more confident <eob> that the image assumptions we're making <eol> are not biasing this picture that much. <eob>
This is a little bit like <eol> giving the same description <eob> to three different sketch artists <eol> from all around the world. <eob>
If they all produce <eol> a very similar-looking face, <eob> then we can start to become confident <eob> that they're not imposing their own <eol> cultural biases on the drawings. <eob>
One way we can try to impose <eol> different image features <eob> is by using pieces of existing images. <eob>
So we take a large collection of images, <eob> and we break them down <eol> into their little image patches. <eob>
We then can treat each image patch <eol> a little bit like pieces of a puzzle. <eob>
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces <eol> to piece together an image <eob> that also fits our telescope measurements. <eob>
Different types of images have <eol> very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces. <eob>
So what happens when we take the same data <eob> but we use different sets of puzzle pieces <eol> to reconstruct the image? <eob>
Let's first start with black hole <eol> image simulation puzzle pieces. <eob> OK, this looks reasonable. <eob> This looks like what we expect <eol> a black hole to look like. <eob>
But did we just get it <eob> because we just fed it little pieces <eol> of black hole simulation images? <eob>
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces <eob> from astronomical, non-black hole objects. <eob>
OK, we get a similar-looking image. <eob>
And then how about pieces <eol> from everyday images, <eob> like the images you take <eol> with your own personal camera? <eob>
Great, we see the same image. <eob>
then we can start to become more confident <eob> When we get the same image <eol> from all different sets of puzzle pieces, <eob> that the image assumptions we're making <eob> aren't biasing the final <eol> image we get too much. <eob>
Another thing we can do is take <eol> the same set of puzzle pieces, <eob> such as the ones derived <eol> from everyday images, <eob> and use them to reconstruct <eol> many different kinds of source images. <eob>
So in our simulations, <eob> we pretend a black hole looks like <eol> astronomical non-black hole objects, <eob> as well as everyday images like <eol> the elephant in the center of our galaxy. <eob>
When the results of our algorithms <eol> on the bottom look very similar <eob> to the simulation's truth image on top, <eob> then we can start to become more confident <eob> in our algorithms. <eob>
And I really want to emphasize here <eob> that all of these pictures were created <eob> by piecing together little pieces <eol> of everyday photographs, <eob> like you'd take with your own <eol> personal camera. <eob>
So an image of a black hole <eol> we've never seen before <eob> may eventually be created by piecing <eol> together pictures we see all the time <eob> of people, buildings, <eol> trees, cats and dogs. <eob>
Imaging ideas like this <eol> will make it possible for us <eob> to take our very first pictures <eol> of a black hole, <eob> and hopefully, verify <eol> those famous theories <eob> on which scientists rely on a daily basis. <eob>
But of course, getting <eol> imaging ideas like this working <eob> would never have been possible <eol> without the amazing team of researchers <eob> that I have the privilege to work with. <eob>
It still amazes me <eob> that although I began this project <eol> with no background in astrophysics, <eob> what we have achieved <eol> through this unique collaboration <eob> could result in the very first <eol> images of a black hole. <eob>
But big projects like <eol> the Event Horizon Telescope <eob> are successful due to all <eol> the interdisciplinary expertise <eob> different people bring to the table. <eob>
We're a melting pot of astronomers, <eob> physicists, mathematicians and engineers. <eob>
This is what will make it soon possible <eob> to achieve something <eol> once thought impossible. <eob>
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out <eob> and help push the boundaries of science, <eob> even if it may at first seem <eol> as mysterious to you as a black hole. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
No one will ever pay you <eol> what you're worth. <eob>
No one will ever pay you <eol> what you're worth. <eob>
They'll only ever pay you <eob> what they think you're worth. <eob>
And you control their thinking, <eob> not like this, <eob> although that would be cool. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That would be really cool. <eob> Instead, like this: <eob> clearly defining and communicating <eol> your value are essential <eob> to being paid well for your excellence. <eob>
Anyone here want to be paid well? <eob>
OK, good, <eob> then this talk is for everyone. <eob>
It's got universal applicability. <eob>
It's true if you're a business owner, <eol> if you're an employee, <eob> if you're a job seeker. <eob> It's true if you're a man or a woman. <eob>
Now, I approach this today through <eol> the lens of the woman business owner, <eob> because in my work I've observed <eol> that women underprice more so than men. <eob>
The gender wage gap is <eol> a well-traveled narrative in this country. <eob>
According to the Bureau <eol> of Labor Statistics, <eob> a woman employee earns just 83 cents <eol> for every dollar a man earns. <eob>
What may surprise you <eob> is that this trend continues <eol> even into the entrepreneurial sphere. <eob>
A woman business owner earns just <eol> 80 cents for every dollar a man earns. <eob>
In my work, I've often heard women express <eob> that they're uncomfortable <eol> communicating their value, <eob> especially early on in business ownership. <eob>
They say things like, <eob> "I don't like to toot my own horn." <eob> "I'd rather let the work <eol> speak for itself." <eob> "I don't like to sing my own praises." <eob>
I hear very different narratives <eol> in working with male business owners, <eob> and I think this difference <eol> is costing women 20 cents on the dollar. <eob>
I'd like to tell you the story <eol> of a consulting firm <eob> that helps their clients <eol> dramatically improve their profitability. <eob>
That company is my company. <eob>
After my first year in business, <eol> I saw the profit increases <eob> that my clients were realizing <eol> in working with me, <eob> and I realized that I needed <eol> to reevaluate my pricing. <eob>
I was really underpriced <eol> relative to the value I was delivering. <eob>
It's hard for me to admit to you, <eol> because I'm a pricing consultant. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's what I do. <eob>
I help companies price for value. <eob>
But nonetheless, it's what I saw, <eob> and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing, <eol> evaluate my value, <eob> and I did that <eol> by asking key value questions. <eob>
What are my clients' needs <eol> and how do I meet them? <eob>
What is my unique skill set that makes me <eol> better qualified to serve my clients? <eob>
What do I do that no one else does? <eob>
What problems do I solve for clients? <eob>
What value do I add? <eob>
I answered these questions <eob> and defined the value that my clients <eol> get from working with me, <eob> calculated their return on investment, <eob> and what I saw was <eol> that I needed to double my price, <eob> double it. <eob>
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me. <eob>
I'm supposed to be the expert in this, <eol> but I'm not cured. <eob>
I knew the value was there. <eob>
I was convinced the value was there, <eob> and I was still scared out of my wits. <eob>
What if nobody would pay me that? <eob>
What if clients said, "That's ridiculous. <eob>
You're ridiculous." <eob>
Was I really worth that? <eob> Not my work, mind you, but me. <eob> Was I worth that? <eob> I'm the mother of two beautiful <eol> little girls who depend upon me. <eob>
I'm a single mom. <eob>
What if my business fails? <eob>
What if I fail? <eob>
But I know how to take my own medicine, <eob> the medicine that I <eol> prescribe to my clients. <eob>
I had done the homework. <eob>
I knew the value was there. <eob>
So when prospects came, <eob> I prepared the proposals <eol> with the new higher pricing <eob> and sent them out <eob> and communicated the value. <eob>
How's the story end? <eob>
Clients continued to hire me <eob> and refer me and recommend me, <eol> and I'm still here. <eob>
And I share this story <eob> because doubts and fears <eol> are natural and normal. <eob>
But they don't define our value, <eob> and they shouldn't limit <eol> our earning potential. <eob>
I'd like to share another story, <eob> about a woman who learned <eol> to communicate her value <eob> and found her own voice. <eob>
She runs a successful <eol> web development company <eob> and employs several people. <eob>
When she first started her firm <eol> and for several years thereafter, <eob> she would say, "I have <eol> a little web design company." <eob> She'd actually use <eol> those words with clients. <eob> "I have a little web design company." <eob> In this and in many other small ways, <eob> she was diminishing her company <eol> in the eyes of prospects and clients, <eob> and diminishing herself. <eob>
It was really impacting her ability <eol> to earn what she was worth. <eob>
I believe her language and her style <eob> communicated that she didn't believe <eob> she had much value to offer. <eob>
In her own words, she was practically <eol> giving her services away. <eob>
And so she began her journey <eob> to take responsibility <eol> for communicating value to clients <eob> and changing her message. <eob>
One thing I shared with her <eob> is that it's so important <eob> to find your own voice, <eob> a voice that's authentic and true to you. <eob>
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law <eol> just because she's a great salesperson <eob> or your neighbor who tells a great joke <eol> if that's not who you are. <eob>
Give up this notion <eol> that it's tooting your own horn. <eob>
Make it about the other party. <eob>
Focus on serving and adding value, <eol> and it won't feel like bragging. <eob>
What do you love about what you do? <eob>
What excites you <eol> about the work that you do? <eob>
If you connect with that, communicating <eol> your value will come naturally. <eob>
So she embraced her natural style, <eob> found her voice and changed her message. <eob>
For one thing, she stopped calling herself <eol> a little web design company. <eob>
She really found a lot of strength <eol> and power in communicating her message. <eob>
She's now charging three times <eol> as much for web design, <eob> and her business is growing. <eob>
She told me about a recent meeting <eob> with a gruff and sometimes <eol> difficult client <eob> who had called a meeting questioning <eol> progress on search engine optimization. <eob>
She said in the old days, <eob> that would have been <eol> a really intimidating meeting for her, <eob> but her mindset was different. <eob>
She said, she prepared the information, <eol> sat down with the client, <eob> said this isn't about me, <eol> it's not personal, <eob> it's about the client. <eob>
She took them through the data, <eol> through the numbers, <eob> laid out the trends and the progress <eol> in her own voice and in her own way, <eob> but very directly said, <eol> "Here's what we've done for you." <eob> The client sat up and took notice, <eol> and said, "OK, I got it." <eob> And she said in describing that meeting, <eob> "I didn't feel scared or panicky <eob> or small, <eob> which is how I used to feel. <eob>
Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this. <eob>
I know what I'm doing. <eob>
I'm confident. '" <eob>
Being properly valued is so important. <eob>
You can hear in this story <eob> that the implications <eol> range far beyond just finances <eob> into the realm of self-respect <eol> and self-confidence. <eob>
Today I've told two stories, <eol> one about defining our value <eob> and the other about <eol> communicating our value, <eob> and these are the two elements <eol> to realizing our full earning potential. <eob> That's the equation. <eob> And if you're sitting <eol> in the audience today <eob> and you're not being paid <eob> what you're worth, <eob> I'd like to welcome you into this equation. <eob>
Just imagine what life could be like, <eob> how much more we could do, <eob> how much more we could give back, <eob> how much more we could <eol> plan for the future, <eob> how validated and respected we would feel <eob> if we could earn our full potential, <eob> realize our full value. <eob>
No one will ever pay you <eol> what you're worth. <eob>
They'll only ever pay you <eob> what they think you're worth, <eob> and you control their thinking. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine <eob> told the story of Clyde Murphy, <eob> a black man who was a member <eol> of the Class of 1970. <eob> Clyde was a success story. <eob> After Yale and a law degree from Columbia, <eob> Clyde spent the next 30 years <eob> as one of America's <eol> top civil rights lawyers. <eob>
He was also a great husband and father. <eob>
But despite his success, <eob> personally and professionally, <eob> Clyde's story had a sad ending. <eob>
In 2010, <eob> at the age of 62, <eob> Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung. <eob>
Clyde's experience was not unique. <eob>
Many of his black classmates from Yale <eob> also died young. <eob>
In fact, the magazine article indicated <eob> that 41 years after graduation from Yale, <eob> the black members of the Class of 1970 <eob> had a death rate <eol> that was three times higher <eob> than that of the average class member. <eob> It's stunning. <eob>
America has recently awakened <eob> to a steady drumbeat <eob> of unarmed black men <eol> being shot by the police. <eob>
What is even a bigger story <eob> is that every seven minutes, <eob> a black person dies prematurely <eol> in the United States. <eob>
That is over 200 black people <eob> die every single day <eob> who would not die if the health <eol> of blacks and whites were equal. <eob>
For the last 25 years, <eob> I have been on a mission <eob> to understand why does race <eob> matter so profoundly for health. <eob>
When I started my career, <eob> many believed that it was simply <eol> about racial differences <eob> in income and education. <eob>
I discovered that while <eol> economic status matters for health, <eob> there is more to the story. <eob>
So for example, if we look <eol> at life expectancy at age 25, <eob> at age 25 there's a five-year gap <eol> between blacks and whites. <eob>
And the gap by education <eol> for both whites and blacks <eob> is even larger than the racial gap. <eob>
At the same time, <eol> at every level of education, <eob> whites live longer than blacks. <eob>
So whites who are high school dropouts <eob> live 3.4 years longer <eol> than their black counterparts, <eob> and the gap is even larger <eob> among college graduates. <eob>
Most surprising of all, <eob> whites who have graduated from high school <eob> live longer than blacks <eol> with a college degree <eob> or more education. <eob>
So why does race <eob> matter so profoundly for health? <eob>
What else is it <eol> beyond education and income <eob> that might matter? <eob>
In the early 1990s, <eob> I was asked to review a new book <eob> on the health of black America. <eob>
I was struck that almost every single one <eob> of its 25 chapters <eob> said that racism <eob> was a factor that was hurting <eol> the health of blacks. <eob>
All of these researchers <eob> were stating that racism <eol> was a factor adversely impacting blacks, <eob> but they provided no evidence. <eob>
For me, that was not good enough. <eob>
A few months later, <eob> I was speaking at a conference <eol> in Washington, DC, <eob> and I said that one of the priorities <eol> for research <eob> was to document the ways <eol> in which racism affected health. <eob>
A white gentleman stood in the audience <eob> and said that while he agreed with me <eol> that racism was important, <eob> we could never measure racism. <eob> "We measure self-esteem," I said. <eob> "There's no reason <eob> why we can't measure racism <eol> if we put our minds to it." <eob>
And so I put my mind to it <eob> and developed three scales. <eob>
The first one captured <eol> major experiences of discrimination, <eob> like being unfairly fired <eol> or being unfairly stopped by the police. <eob>
But discrimination also occurs <eol> in more minor and subtle experiences, <eob> and so my second scale, <eol> called the Everyday Discrimination Scale, <eob> captures nine items <eob> that captures experiences <eob> like you're treated <eol> with less courtesy than others, <eob> you receive poorer service <eol> than others in restaurants or stores, <eob> or people act as if they're afraid of you. <eob>
This scale captures <eob> ways in which the dignity and the respect <eob> of people who society does not value <eob> is chipped away on a daily basis. <eob>
Research has found <eob> that higher levels of discrimination <eob> are associated with an elevated risk <eol> of a broad range of diseases <eob> from blood pressure to abdominal obesity <eob> to breast cancer to heart disease <eob> and even premature mortality. <eob>
Strikingly, some of the effects <eol> are observed at a very young age. <eob>
For example, a study of black teens <eob> found that those who reported higher <eol> levels of discrimination as teenagers <eob> had higher levels of stress hormones, <eob> of blood pressure <eob> and of weight at age 20. <eob>
However, <eob> the stress of discrimination <eob> is only one aspect. <eob>
Discrimination and racism <eob> also matters in other profound <eol> ways for health. <eob>
For example, there's <eol> discrimination in medical care. <eob>
In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine <eob> asked me to serve on a committee <eob> that found, concluded <eol> based on the scientific evidence, <eob> that blacks and other minorities <eob> receive poorer quality care than whites. <eob>
This was true for all kinds <eol> of medical treatment, <eob> from the most simple <eob> to the most technologically sophisticated. <eob>
One explanation for this pattern <eob> was a phenomenon <eol> that's called "implicit bias" <eob> or "unconscious discrimination." <eob> Research for decades <eol> by social psychologists <eob> indicates that if you hold <eol> a negative stereotype <eob> about a group in your subconscious mind <eob> and you meet someone from that group, <eob> you will discriminate against that person. <eob>
You will treat them differently. <eob>
It's an unconscious process. <eob>
It's an automatic process. <eob>
It is a subtle process, but it's normal <eob> and it occurs even among <eol> the most well-intentioned individuals. <eob>
But the deeper that I delved <eob> into the health impact of racism, <eob> the more insidious the effects became. <eob>
There is institutional discrimination, <eob> which refers to discrimination <eob> that exists in the processes <eol> of social institutions. <eob>
Residential segregation by race, <eob> which has led to blacks and whites living <eol> in very different neighborhood contexts, <eob> is a classic example <eol> of institutional racism. <eob>
One of America's best-kept secrets <eob> is how residential segregation <eob> is the secret source <eob> that creates racial inequality <eol> in the United States. <eob>
In America, where you live <eob> determines your access to opportunities <eob> in education, in employment, <eob> in housing and even <eol> in access to medical care. <eob>
One study of the 171 largest <eol> cities in the United States <eob> concluded that there is not even one city <eob> where whites live <eol> under equal conditions to blacks, <eob> and that the worst urban contexts <eol> in which whites reside <eob> is considerably better than the average <eol> context of black communities. <eob>
Another study found <eob> that if you could eliminate statistically <eob> residential segregation, <eob> you would completely erase <eol> black-white differences in income, <eob> education and unemployment, <eob> and reduce black-white differences <eol> in single motherhood <eob> by two thirds, <eob> all of that driven by segregation. <eob>
I have also learned <eob> how the negative stereotypes <eob> and images of blacks in our culture <eob> literally create and sustain <eob> both institutional <eol> and individual discrimination. <eob>
A group of researchers <eol> have put together a database <eob> that contains the books, <eob> magazines and articles <eob> that an average college-educated <eol> American would read over their lifetime. <eob>
It allows us to look within this database <eob> and see how Americans <eol> have seen words paired together <eob> as they grow up in their society. <eob>
So when the word "black" <eol> appears in American culture, <eob> what co-occurs with it? <eob> "Poor," <eob> "violent," <eob> "religious," <eob> "lazy," <eob> "cheerful," <eob> "dangerous." <eob> When "white" occurs, <eob> the frequently co-occurring words <eob> are "wealthy," <eob> "progressive," <eob> "conventional," <eob> "stubborn," <eob> "successful," <eob> "educated." <eob> So when a police officer <eob> overreacts when he sees <eol> an unarmed black male <eob> and perceives him <eol> to be violent and dangerous, <eob> we are not necessarily dealing <eol> with an inherently bad cop. <eob>
We may be simply viewing <eob> a normal American <eob> who is reflecting <eol> what he has been exposed to <eob> as a result of being raised <eob> in this society. <eob>
From my own experience, <eob> I believe that your race <eob> does not have to be <eol> a determinant of your destiny. <eob>
I migrated to the United States <eob> from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia <eob> in the late 1970s <eob> in pursuit of higher education, <eob> and in the last 40 years, <eob> I have done well. <eob>
I have done well. <eob> I have had a supportive family, <eob> I have worked hard, <eob>
But it took more for me to be successful. <eob>
I received a minority fellowship <eol> from the University of Michigan. <eob> Yes. I am an affirmative action baby. <eob>
Without affirmative action, <eob> I would not be here. <eob>
But in the last 40 years, <eob> black America has been <eol> less successful than I have. <eob>
In 1978, black households <eol> in the United States <eob> earned 59 cents for every dollar <eol> of income whites earned. <eob>
In 2015, <eob> black families still earn 59 cents <eob> for every dollar of income <eol> that white families receive, <eob> and the racial gaps in wealth <eol> are even more stunning. <eob>
For every dollar of wealth <eol> that whites have, <eob> black families have six pennies <eol> and Latinos have seven pennies. <eob>
The fact is, <eob> racism <eob> is producing a truly rigged system <eob> that is systematically disadvantaging <eol> some racial groups in the United States. <eob>
To paraphrase Plato, <eob> there is nothing so unfair <eob> as the equal treatment of unequal people. <eob>
And that's why I am committed <eob> to working to dismantle racism. <eob>
I deeply appreciate the fact <eob> that I am standing on the shoulders <eob> of those who have sacrificed <eol> even their lives to open the doors <eob> that I have walked through. <eob>
I want to ensure <eol> that those doors remain open <eob> and that everyone <eol> can walk through those doors. <eob>
Robert Kennedy said, <eob> "Each time a man" -- <eol> or woman, I would add -- <eob> "stands up for an ideal <eob> or acts to improve the lot of others <eob> or strikes out against injustice, <eob> he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, <eob> and those ripples can build a current <eob> that can sweep down the mightiest walls <eol> of oppression and resistance." <eob>
I am optimistic today <eob> because all across America, <eob> I have seen ripples of hope. <eob>
The Boston Medical Center <eob> has added lawyers to the medical team <eob> so that physicians can improve <eol> the health of their patients <eob> because the lawyers are addressing <eol> the nonmedical needs their patients have. <eob>
Loma Linda University <eol> has built a gateway college <eob> in nearby San Bernardino <eob> so that in addition <eol> to delivering medical care, <eob> they can provide job skills <eob> and job training <eob> to a predominantly minority, <eol> low-income community members <eob> so that they will have the skills <eol> they need to get a decent job. <eob>
In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, <eob> the Abecedarian Project has figured out <eob> how to ensure that they have lowered <eol> the risks for heart disease <eob> for blacks in their mid-30s <eob> by providing high-quality day care <eob> from birth to age five. <eob>
In after-school centers <eol> across the United States, <eob> Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy <eob> is breaking the cycle of incarceration <eob> by providing high-quality <eol> academic enrichment and mentoring <eob> to the children of prisoners <eob> and children who have <eol> fallen behind in school. <eob>
In Huntsville, Alabama, <eob> Oakwood University, <eob> a historically black institution, <eob> is showing how we can improve <eol> the health of black adults <eob> by including a health evaluation <eob> as a part of freshman orientation <eob> and giving those students <eol> the tools they need <eob> to make healthy choices <eob> and providing them annually <eol> a health transcript <eob> so they can monitor their progress. <eob>
And in Atlanta, Georgia, <eob> Purpose Built Communities has dismantled <eol> the negative effects of segregation <eob> by transforming a crime-ridden, <eob> drug-infested public housing project <eob> into an oasis of mixed-income housing, <eob> of academic performance, <eob> of great community wellness <eob> and of full employment. <eob>
And finally, <eob> there is the Devine solution. <eob>
Professor Patricia Devine <eob> of the University of Wisconsin <eob> has shown us how we can attack <eob> our hidden biases head on <eob> and effectively reduce them. <eob>
Each one of us <eob> can be a ripple of hope. <eob>
This work will not always be easy, <eob> but former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall <eob> has told us, "We must dissent. <eob>
We must dissent from the indifference. <eob>
We must dissent from the apathy. <eob>
We must dissent from the hatred <eol> and from the mistrust. <eob>
We must dissent <eob> because America can do better, <eob> because America has no choice <eol> but to do better." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is what my last week looked like. <eob>
What I did, <eob> who I was with, <eob> the main sensations I had <eol> for every waking hour ... <eob> If the feeling came as I thought of my dad <eob> who recently passed away, <eob> or if I could have just definitely <eol> avoided the worries and anxieties. <eob>
And if you think I'm a little obsessive, <eob> you're probably right. <eob>
But clearly, from this visualization, <eob> you can learn much more about me <eol> than from this other one, <eob> which are images you're <eol> probably more familiar with <eob> and which you possibly even have <eol> on your phone right now. <eob>
Bar charts for the steps you walked, <eob> pie charts for the quality <eol> of your sleep -- <eob> the path of your morning runs. <eob>
In my day job, I work with data. <eob>
I run a data visualization design company, <eob> and we design and develop ways <eol> to make information accessible <eob> through visual representations. <eob>
What my job has taught me over the years <eob> is that to really understand data <eol> and their true potential, <eob> sometimes we actually <eol> have to forget about them <eob> and see through them instead. <eob>
Because data are always just a tool <eol> we use to represent reality. <eob>
They're always used <eol> as a placeholder for something else, <eob> but they are never the real thing. <eob>
But let me step back for a moment <eob> to when I first understood <eol> this personally. <eob>
In 1994, I was 13 years old. <eob>
I was a teenager in Italy. <eob>
I was too young <eol> to be interested in politics, <eob> but I knew that a businessman, <eol> Silvio Berlusconi, <eob> was running for president <eol> for the moderate right. <eob>
We lived in a very liberal town, <eob> and my father was a politician <eol> for the Democratic Party. <eob>
And I remember that no one thought <eol> that Berlusconi could get elected -- <eob> that was totally not an option. <eob> But it happened. <eob> And I remember the feeling very vividly. <eob>
It was a complete surprise, <eob> as my dad promised that in my town <eol> he knew nobody who voted for him. <eob>
This was the first time <eob> when the data I had gave me <eol> a completely distorted image of reality. <eob>
My data sample was actually <eol> pretty limited and skewed, <eob> so probably it was because of that, <eol> I thought, I lived in a bubble, <eob> and I didn't have enough chances <eol> to see outside of it. <eob>
Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016 <eob> in the United States. <eob>
The internet polls, <eob> statistical models, <eob> all the pundits agreeing on a possible <eol> outcome for the presidential election. <eob>
It looked like we had <eol> enough information this time, <eob> and many more chances to see outside <eol> the closed circle we lived in -- <eob> but we clearly didn't. <eob>
The feeling felt very familiar. <eob>
I had been there before. <eob>
I think it's fair to say <eol> the data failed us this time -- <eob> and pretty spectacularly. <eob>
We believed in data, <eob> but what happened, <eob> even with the most respected newspaper, <eob> is that the obsession to reduce everything <eol> to two simple percentage numbers <eob> to make a powerful headline <eob> made us focus on these two digits <eob> and them alone. <eob>
In an effort to simplify the message <eob> and draw a beautiful, <eol> inevitable red and blue map, <eob> we lost the point completely. <eob>
We somehow forgot <eol> that there were stories -- <eob> stories of human beings <eol> behind these numbers. <eob>
In a different context, <eob> but to a very similar point, <eob> a peculiar challenge was presented <eol> to my team by this woman. <eob>
She came to us with a lot of data, <eob> but ultimately she wanted to tell <eol> one of the most humane stories possible. <eob>
She's Samantha Cristoforetti. <eob>
She has been the first <eol> Italian woman astronaut, <eob> and she contacted us before being launched <eob> on a six-month-long expedition <eol> to the International Space Station. <eob>
She told us, "I'm going to space, <eob> and I want to do something meaningful <eol> with the data of my mission <eob> to reach out to people." <eob> A mission to the <eol> International Space Station <eob> comes with terabytes of data <eob> about anything you can possibly imagine -- <eob> the orbits around Earth, <eob> the speed and position of the ISS <eob> and all of the other thousands <eol> of live streams from its sensors. <eob>
We had all of the hard data <eol> we could think of -- <eob> just like the pundits <eol> before the election -- <eob> but what is the point <eol> of all these numbers? <eob>
People are not interested <eol> in data for the sake of it, <eob> because numbers are never the point. <eob>
They're always the means to an end. <eob>
The story we needed to tell <eob> is that there is a human being <eol> in a teeny box <eob> flying in space above your head, <eob> and that you can actually see her <eol> with your naked eye on a clear night. <eob>
So we decided to use data <eol> to create a connection <eob> between Samantha and all of the people <eol> looking at her from below. <eob>
We designed and developed <eol> what we called "Friends in Space," <eob> a web application that simply <eol> lets you say "hello" to Samantha <eob> from where you are, <eob> and "hello" to all the people <eol> who are online at the same time <eob> from all over the world. <eob>
And all of these "hellos" <eol> left visible marks on the map <eob> as Samantha was flying by <eob> and as she was actually <eol> waving back every day at us <eob> using Twitter from the ISS. <eob>
This made people see the mission's data <eol> from a very different perspective. <eob>
It all suddenly became much more <eol> about our human nature and our curiosity, <eob> rather than technology. <eob>
So data powered the experience, <eob> but stories of human beings <eol> were the drive. <eob>
The very positive response <eol> of its thousands of users <eob> taught me a very important lesson -- <eob> that working with data <eol> means designing ways <eob> to transform the abstract <eol> and the uncountable <eob> into something that can be seen, <eol> felt and directly reconnected <eob> to our lives and to our behaviors, <eob> something that is hard to achieve <eob> if we let the obsession for the numbers <eol> and the technology around them <eob> lead us in the process. <eob>
But we can do even more to connect data <eol> to the stories they represent. <eob>
We can remove technology completely. <eob>
A few years ago, I met this other woman, <eob> Stefanie Posavec -- <eob> a London-based designer who shares with me <eol> the passion and obsession about data. <eob>
We didn't know each other, <eob> but we decided to run <eol> a very radical experiment, <eob> starting a communication using only data, <eob> no other language, <eob> and we opted for using no technology <eol> whatsoever to share our data. <eob>
In fact, our only means of communication <eob> would be through <eol> the old-fashioned post office. <eob>
For "Dear Data," every week for one year, <eob> we used our personal data <eol> to get to know each other -- <eob> personal data around weekly <eol> shared mundane topics, <eob> from our feelings <eob> to the interactions with our partners, <eob> from the compliments we received <eol> to the sounds of our surroundings. <eob>
Personal information <eol> that we would then manually hand draw <eob> on a postcard-size sheet of paper <eob> that we would every week <eol> send from London to New York, <eob> where I live, <eob> and from New York to London, <eol> where she lives. <eob>
The front of the postcard <eol> is the data drawing, <eob> and the back of the card <eob> contains the address <eol> of the other person, of course, <eob> and the legend for how <eol> to interpret our drawing. <eob>
The very first week into the project, <eob> we actually chose <eol> a pretty cold and impersonal topic. <eob>
How many times do we <eol> check the time in a week? <eob>
So here is the front of my card, <eob> and you can see that every little symbol <eob> represents all of the times <eol> that I checked the time, <eob> positioned for days <eol> and different hours chronologically -- <eob> nothing really complicated here. <eob>
But then you see in the legend <eob> how I added anecdotal details <eol> about these moments. <eob>
In fact, the different types of symbols <eol> indicate why I was checking the time -- <eob> what was I doing? <eob> Was I bored? Was I hungry? <eob> Was I late? <eob> Did I check it on purpose <eol> or just casually glance at the clock? <eob>
And this is the key part -- <eob> representing the details <eol> of my days and my personality <eob> through my data collection. <eob>
Using data as a lens or a filter <eol> to discover and reveal, for example, <eob> my never-ending anxiety for being late, <eob> even though I'm absolutely always on time. <eob>
Stefanie and I spent one year <eol> collecting our data manually <eob> to force us to focus on the nuances <eol> that computers cannot gather -- <eob> or at least not yet -- <eob> using data also to explore our minds <eol> and the words we use, <eob> and not only our activities. <eob>
Like at week number three, <eob> where we tracked the "thank yous" <eol> we said and were received, <eob> and when I realized that I thank <eol> mostly people that I don't know. <eob>
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker <eol> to waitresses and waiters, <eob> but I definitely don't thank enough <eol> the people who are close to me. <eob>
Over one year, <eob> the process of actively noticing <eol> and counting these types of actions <eob> became a ritual. <eob>
It actually changed ourselves. <eob>
We became much more <eol> in tune with ourselves, <eob> much more aware of our behaviors <eol> and our surroundings. <eob>
Over one year, <eob> Stefanie and I connected <eol> at a very deep level <eob> through our shared data diary, <eob> but we could do this only <eol> because we put ourselves in these numbers, <eob> adding the contexts <eol> of our very personal stories to them. <eob>
It was the only way <eol> to make them truly meaningful <eob> and representative of ourselves. <eob>
I am not asking you <eol> to start drawing your personal data, <eob> or to find a pen pal across the ocean. <eob>
But I'm asking you to consider data -- <eob> all kind of data -- <eob> as the beginning of the conversation <eob> and not the end. <eob>
Because data alone <eol> will never give us a solution. <eob>
And this is why data failed us so badly -- <eob> because we failed to include <eol> the right amount of context <eob> to represent reality -- <eob> a nuanced, complicated <eol> and intricate reality. <eob>
We kept looking at these two numbers, <eob> obsessing with them <eob> and pretending that our world <eol> could be reduced <eob> to a couple digits and a horse race, <eob> while the real stories, <eob> the ones that really mattered, <eob> were somewhere else. <eob>
What we missed looking at these stories <eol> only through models and algorithms <eob> is what I call "data humanism." <eob> In the Renaissance humanism, <eob> European intellectuals <eob> placed the human nature instead of God <eol> at the center of their view of the world. <eob>
I believe something similar <eol> needs to happen <eob> with the universe of data. <eob>
Now data are apparently <eol> treated like a God -- <eob> keeper of infallible truth <eol> for our present and our future. <eob>
The experiences <eol> that I shared with you today <eob> taught me that to make data faithfully <eol> representative of our human nature <eob> and to make sure they will not <eol> mislead us anymore, <eob> we need to start designing ways <eol> to include empathy, imperfection <eob> and human qualities <eob> in how we collect, process, <eol> analyze and display them. <eob>
I do see a place where, ultimately, <eob> instead of using data <eol> only to become more efficient, <eob> we will all use data <eol> to become more humane. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> about three seconds ago. <eob> I've been futuring <eol> for about 20 years, <eob> and when I first started, <eol> I would sit down with people, <eob> and say, "Hey, let's talk <eol> 10, 20 years out." <eob> And they'd say, "Great." <eob> And I've been seeing that time horizon <eob> get shorter and shorter <eob> and shorter, <eob> so much so that I met <eol> with a CEO two months ago <eob> and I said — we started <eol> our initial conversation. <eob> He goes, "I love what you do. <eob>
I want to talk about the next six months. <eol> "(Laughter) <eob>
We have a lot of problems <eol> that we are facing. <eob>
These are civilizational-scale problems. <eob> The issue though is, <eob> we can't solve them <eob> using the mental models <eol> that we use right now <eob> to try and solve these problems. <eob>
Yes, a lot of great technical work <eol> is being done, <eob> but there is a problem that we need <eol> to solve for a priori, before, <eob> if we want to really move the needle <eol> on those big problems. <eob> "Short-termism." <eob> Right? <eob>
There's no marches. <eob>
There's no bracelets. <eob>
There's no petitions that you can sign <eol> to be against short-termism. <eob>
I tried to put one up, and no one signed. <eob> It was weird. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But it prevents us from doing so much. <eob>
Short-termism, for many reasons, <eob> has pervaded every <eol> nook and cranny of our reality. <eob>
I just want you to take a second <eob> and just think about an issue <eol> that you're thinking, working on. <eob>
It could be personal, it could be at work <eob> or it could be move-the-needle world stuff, <eob> and think about how far out <eol> you tend to think <eob> about the solution set for that. <eob>
Because short-termism prevents the CEO <eob> from buying really <eol> expensive safety equipment. <eob>
It'll hurt the bottom line. <eob>
So we get the Deepwater Horizon. <eob>
Short-termism prevents teachers <eob> from spending quality <eol> one-on-one time with their students. <eob>
So right now in America, <eob> a high school student <eol> drops out every 26 seconds. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Short-termism prevents Congress -- <eob> sorry if there's anyone <eol> in here from Congress -- <eob>
from putting money <eol> into a real infrastructure bill. <eob> So what we get <eol> is the I-35W bridge collapse <eob> over the Mississippi a few years ago, <eob> 13 killed. <eob>
It wasn't always like this. <eob>
We did the Panama Canal. <eob>
We pretty much <eol> have eradicated global polio. <eob>
We did the transcontinental railroad, <eol> the Marshall Plan. <eob>
And it's not just big, physical <eol> infrastructure problems and issues. <eob>
Women's suffrage, the right to vote. <eob>
But in our short-termist time, <eob> where everything seems to happen right now <eob> and we can only think out <eol> past the next tweet or timeline post, <eob> we get hyper-reactionary. <eob> So what do we do? <eob> We take people who are fleeing <eol> their war-torn country, <eob> and we go after them. <eob> We take low-level drug offenders, <eol> and we put them away for life. <eob>
And then we build McMansions <eol> without even thinking <eob> about how people are going <eol> to get between them and their job. <eob>
It's a quick buck. <eob>
Now, the reality is, <eol> for a lot of these problems, <eob> there are some technical fixes, <eob> a lot of them. <eob>
I call these technical fixes <eol> sandbag strategies. <eob>
So you know there's a storm coming, <eob> the levee is broken, no one's <eol> put any money into it, <eob> you surround your home <eol> with sandbags. <eob> And guess what? It works. <eob> Storm goes away, <eol> the water level goes down, <eob> you get rid of the sandbags, <eob> and you do this storm after storm after storm. <eob>
And here's the insidious thing. <eob> A sandbag strategy <eob> can get you reelected. <eob> A sandbag strategy <eob> can help you make your quarterly numbers. <eob>
Now, if we want to move forward <eob> into a different future <eol> than the one we have right now, <eob> because I don't think we've hit — <eob> 2016 is not peak civilization. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> There's some more we can do. <eob>
But my argument is that unless we shift <eol> our mental models and our mental maps <eob> on how we think about the short, <eob> it's not going to happen. <eob>
So what I've developed <eol> is something called "longpath," <eob> and it's a practice. <eob>
And longpath isn't <eol> a kind of one-and-done exercise. <eob>
I'm sure everyone here at some point <eol> has done an off-site <eob> with a lot of Post-It notes and whiteboards, <eob> and you do — <eob> no offense to the consultants <eol> in here who do that — <eob> and you do a long-term plan, <eob> and then two weeks later, everyone forgets about it. <eob> Right? Or a week later. <eob>
If you're lucky, three months. <eob>
It's a practice because <eol> it's not necessarily a thing that you do. <eob>
It's a process where you have <eol> to revisit different ways of thinking <eob> for every major decision <eol> that you're working on. <eob>
So I want to go through <eol> those three ways of thinking. <eob>
So the first: transgenerational thinking. <eob>
I love the philosophers: <eob> Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger. <eob>
I was raised on them. <eob>
But they all did one thing <eob> that didn't actually seem like a big deal <eob> until I really started <eol> kind of looking into this. <eob>
And they all took, <eob> as a unit of measure <eol> for their entire reality <eob> of what it meant to be virtuous and good, <eob> the single lifespan, <eob> from birth to death. <eob>
But here's a problem with these issues: <eob> they stack up on top of us, <eob> because the only way we know <eol> how to do something good in the world <eob> is if we do it between <eol> our birth and our death. <eob>
That's what we're programmed to do. <eob>
If you go to the self-help section <eol> in any bookstore, <eob> it's all about you. <eob>
Which is great, <eob> unless you're dealing <eol> with some of these major issues. <eob>
And so with transgenerational thinking, <eob> which is really kind of <eol> transgenerational ethics, <eob> you're able to expand <eol> how you think about these problems, <eob> what is your role <eol> in helping to solve them. <eob>
Now, this isn't something that just has to <eol> be done at the Security Council chamber. <eob>
It's something that you can do <eol> in a very kind of personal way. <eob>
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky, <eol> my wife and I like to go out to dinner, <eob> and we have three children <eol> under the age of seven. <eob>
So you can imagine it's a very <eol> peaceful, quiet meal. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So we sit down and literally all I want <eol> to do is just eat and chill, <eob> and my kids have a completely <eol> and totally different idea <eob> of what we're going to be doing. <eob>
And so my first idea <eob> is my sandbag strategy, right? <eob>
It's to go into my pocket <eol> and take out the iPhone <eob> and give them "Frozen" <eob> or some other bestselling game thing. <eob>
And then I stop <eob> and I have to kind of put on <eol> this transgenerational thinking cap. <eob>
I don't do this in the restaurant, <eol> because it would be bizarre, <eob> but I have to — <eob> I did it once, and that's how I learned it was bizarre. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And you have to kind of think, <eol> "OK, I can do this." <eob> But what is this teaching them? <eob>
So what does it mean <eol> if I actually bring some paper <eob> or engage with them in conversation? <eob> It's hard. It's not easy, <eol> and I'm making this very personal. <eob>
It's actually more traumatic <eob> than some of the big issues <eol> that I work on in the world -- <eob> entertaining my kids at dinner. <eob>
But what it does is it connects them <eol> here in the present with me, <eob> but it also -- <eob> and this is the crux <eol> of transgenerational thinking ethics -- <eob> it sets them up to how they're <eol> going to interact with their kids <eob> and their kids and their kids. <eob>
Second, futures thinking. <eob> When we think about the future, <eob> 10, 15 years out, <eob> give me a vision of what the future is. <eob>
You don't have to give it to me, <eol> but think in your head. <eob>
And what you're probably going to see <eob> is the dominant cultural lens <eob> that dominates our thinking <eol> about the future right now: <eob> technology. <eob>
So when we think about the problems, <eob> we always put it through <eol> a technological lens, <eob> a tech-centric, a techno-utopia, <eol> and there's nothing wrong with that, <eob> but it's something that we have to <eol> really think deeply about <eob> if we're going to move <eol> on these major issues, <eob> because it wasn't always like this. Right? <eob> The ancients had their way of thinking <eob> about what the future was. <eob>
The Church definitely had their idea <eol> of what the future could be, <eob> and you could actually pay your way <eol> into that future. Right? <eob> And luckily for humanity, <eob> we got the scientific revolution. <eob>
From there, we got the <eob> technology, <eob> but what has happened — <eob> And by the way, this is not a critique. <eob> I love technology. <eob> Everything in my house talks <eol> back to me, <eob> from my children to my speakers to everything. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we've abdicated the future <eol> from the high priests in Rome <eob> to the high priests of Silicon Valley. <eob>
So when we think, well, <eol> how are we going to deal with climate <eob> or with poverty or homelessness, <eob> our first reaction is to think about it <eol> through a technology lens. <eob>
And look, I'm not advocating <eol> that we go to this guy. <eob>
I love Joel, don't get me wrong, <eob> but I'm not saying we go to Joel. <eob>
What I'm saying is we have to rethink <eob> our base assumption about <eol> only looking at the future in one way, <eob> only looking at it <eol> through the dominant lens. <eob>
Because our problems <eol> are so big and so vast <eob> that we need to open ourselves up. <eob>
So that's why I do everything in my power <eol> not to talk about the future. <eob>
I talk about futures. <eob>
It opens the conversation again. <eob>
So when you're sitting and thinking <eob> about how do we move forward <eol> on this major issue -- <eob> it could be at home, <eob> it could be at work, <eob> it could be again on the global stage -- <eob> don't cut yourself off from thinking <eol> about something beyond technology as a fix <eob> because we're more concerned <eol> about technological evolution right now <eob> than we are about moral evolution. <eob>
And unless we fix for that, <eob> we're not going to be able <eol> to get out of short-termism <eob> and get to where we want to be. <eob>
The final, telos thinking. <eol> This comes from the Greek root. <eob>
Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose. <eob>
And it's really asking one question: <eob> to what end? <eob>
When was the last time <eol> you asked yourself: To what end? <eob>
And when you asked yourself that, <eol> how far out did you go? <eob>
Because long isn't long enough anymore. <eob>
Three, five years doesn't cut it. <eob>
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years. <eob>
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey," <eob> Odysseus had the answer to his "what end." <eob> It was Ithaca. <eob>
It was this bold vision <eol> of what he wanted -- <eob> to return to Penelope. <eob>
And I can tell you, <eol> because of the work that I'm doing, <eob> but also you know it intuitively -- <eol> we have lost our Ithaca. <eob>
We have lost our <eob> "to what end," <eob> so we stay on this hamster wheel. <eob>
And yes, we're trying <eol> to solve these problems, <eob> but what comes after we solve the problem? <eob>
And unless you define what comes after, <eol> people aren't going to move. <eob>
The businesses -- <eol> this isn't just about business -- <eob> but the businesses that do consistently, <eol> who break out of short-termism <eob> not surprisingly <eol> are family-run businesses. <eob> They're transgenerational. They're telos. <eol> They think about the futures. <eob>
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe. <eob>
They're 175 years old, <eob> and what's amazing is that <eol> they literally embody <eob> this kind of longpathian <eol> sense in their brand, <eob> because, by the way, you never <eol> actually own a Patek Philippe, <eob> and I definitely won't — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
unless somebody wants to just <eol> throw 25,000 dollars on the stage. <eob>
You merely look after it <eol> for the next generation. <eob>
So it's important that we remember, <eob> the future, we treat it like a noun. <eob> It's not. It's a verb. <eob> It requires action. <eob> It requires us to push into it. <eob>
It's not this thing that washes over us. <eob>
It's something that we <eol> actually have total control over. <eob>
But in a short-term society, <eol> we end up feeling like we don't. <eob> We feel like we're trapped. <eob>
We can push through that. <eob>
Now I'm getting more comfortable <eob> in the fact that at some point <eob> in the inevitable future, <eob> I will die. <eob>
But because of these new ways <eol> of thinking and doing, <eob> both in the outside world <eol> and also with my family at home, <eob> and what I'm leaving my kids, <eol> I get more comfortable in that fact. <eob>
And it's something that a lot of us <eol> are really uncomfortable with, <eob> but I'm telling you, <eob> think it through. <eob>
Apply this type of thinking <eol> and you can push yourself past <eob> what's inevitably <eol> very, very uncomfortable. <eob>
And it all begins really <eol> with yourself asking this question: <eob> What is your longpath? <eob>
But I ask you, when you ask yourself that <eob> now or tonight or behind a steering wheel <eob> or in the boardroom or the situation room: <eob> push past the longpath, <eob> quick, oh, what's my longpath <eol> the next three years or five years? <eob>
Try and push past your own life if you can <eob> because it makes you do things <eol> a little bit bigger <eob> than you thought were possible. <eob>
Yes, we have huge, <eol> huge problems out there. <eob>
With this process, with this thinking, <eob> I think we can make a difference. <eob>
I think you can make a difference, <eob> and I believe in you guys. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Last year, I got a chance to watch <eol> the new "Star Wars" movie, <eob> which was fantastic, <eob> but one thing kept bugging me. <eob>
I don't know if you noticed this or not. <eob>
In this entirely technically <eol> advanced world, <eob> I did not see a single AED anywhere, <eob> which was totally shocking -- <eob> almost as shocking <eol> as not knowing what an AED is, <eob> which you guys do know. <eob>
But for those at home, <eob> an AED is an automated <eol> external defibrillator. <eob>
It's the device you use <eol> when your heart goes into cardiac arrest <eob> to shock it back into a normal rhythm, <eob> or, as one of the guys I was teaching <eol> a class to referred to it as: <eob> "The shocky-hearty-box thing." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I really can't blame the Empire, <eob> since health and safety regulations <eob> aren't really their first <eol> order of business. <eob>
Though, even if we -- <eob> I think worse than not having an AED <eol> would be if there was one there, <eob> but just, no one knew where to find it. <eob>
These devices can drastically increase <eol> your chance of survival -- <eob> almost like a tauntaun on Hoth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I'm pretty sure <eol> that stormtrooper is going to be toast, <eob> regardless if we have an AED or not, <eob> since what happens is the chest plate <eol> is going to be quite hard to get off, <eob> and like that tauntaun, <eob> the AED has a very short window of time <eol> at which it's highly effective. <eob>
In this case -- basically, we've got <eol> to use it within the first 10 minutes. <eob>
The Jedi, on the other hand, <eol> have no problems with their outfits. <eob>
Those robes open straight up, <eob> you can place the pads <eol> right onto the chest -- <eob> so upper-right-hand side of the chest, <eob> lower left, <eob> wait for the unit to determine <eol> if it's a shockable rhythm <eob> and get ready to shock. <eob>
But, the Jedi do have a problem. <eob>
They have a head appendage issue. <eob>
And so I can be totally clear, <eol> thinking I'm ready to go, <eob> but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle <eob> and inadvertently shocking myself. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So before you hit that button, <eol> make sure you are clear <eob> and everyone else is clear. <eob>
Going back to that stormtrooper: <eob> If I did get that chest plate off in time, <eob> what would you do if you suddenly found <eol> there was a Wookiee under there, <eob> or possibly two Ewoks? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, lucky for us, <eob> in the kit there's actually a razor, <eob> and we can use that to shave the chest <eol> on the upper right-hand side <eob> and the <eob> lower left. <eob>
Wookiees also have another problem. <eob> They have an accessory issue. <eob>
What we want to do is remove these -- <eob> anything between the two pads <eol> we want to remove, <eob> since it can cause <eol> something called "arcing." <eob> For those who don't know what arcing is, <eob> do you remember the Emperor, <eob> when he shoots electricity <eol> out the ends of his fingers -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
that would be kind of like arcing. <eob> Another thing that -- <eob> Oh! By the way, he creates that <eol> by wearing wool socks under his robes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We can also get arcing if we have <eol> an extremely wet chest. <eob>
The electricity travels across the surface <eol> instead of through the heart. <eob>
We can correct this with the immortal <eol> words of Douglas Adams: <eob> "Don't panic," which most of us <eol> have done today -- <eob> and also always having a towel. <eob>
So, good words to go by. <eob>
The metal bikini -- unfortunately, <eol> this is where panic sets in -- <eob> like the modern bra, <eob> we have to make sure we remove, <eob> because this can cause <eol> severe arcing along with burns. <eob>
But unfortunately this opens up an issue <eob> that's almost as controversial <eol> as talking about the prequels. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The mere mention of the word "nipples," <eob> and people get into a little <eol> bit of a tizzy. <eob>
By the way, that is not a nipple, <eol> that's a cupcake. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Chances are, if you do have to use this, <eob> this is going to be on someone you know. <eob>
And remember, everyone has nipples, <eob> except for Jabba. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But he does love cupcakes. <eob>
Speaking about Jabba, <eob> if we do have to use an AED on him, <eob> remember pad placement is the same, <eob> even though he doesn't have nipples. <eob>
So it's going to be upper right-hand side, <eob> lower left. <eob>
If we were going through, we're shocking, <eol> getting ready to go -- <eob> after we've done the shock, <eob> one of the things we need to do <eol> is remember to do compression. <eob>
The preferred method <eol> is 30 compressions and two breaths <eob> in the center of the chest, <eol> between the nipples, <eob> pressing down at least two inches, <eob> no more than two and a half, <eob> at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute, <eob> no more than 120. <eob>
Unfortunately, due to the size <eol> of Jabba's mouth <eob> and also what he puts in said mouth, <eob> we may not want to actually <eol> do the mouth-to-mouth part. <eob>
So instead, we can do <eol> compression-only CPR. <eob>
The way of remembering <eol> the compression-only part <eob> is we can actually use the Imperial March. <eob>
I would sing it for you -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Unfortunately, that would be more <eol> something an interrogation droid would do. <eob>
Yoda. <eob> Small little guy, like a baby. <eob>
What we do is basically <eol> treat him like a baby, <eob> in the sense that we're going to place <eol> one pad in the center of the chest <eob> and one in the back. <eob>
If we place them both in the front, <eob> they can be too close <eol> and cause severe arcing, <eob> so we want to avoid that. <eob>
Hopefully, this helped to clarify <eob> and put some light <eol> on some of the darker issues <eob> of using an AED in the Star Wars universe, <eob> or any universe in total. <eob>
I'll leave you with one point. <eob> Remember, if you do find yourself <eol> dealing with a Wookiee, <eob> do not shave the entire Wookiee. <eob>
This takes way too much time, <eob> and it only pisses them off. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Twenty years ago, <eob> when I was a barrister <eol> and human rights lawyer <eob> in full-time legal practice in London, <eob> and the highest court in the land <eob> still convened, some would say <eol> by an accident of history, <eob> in this building here, <eob> I met a young man <eol> who had just quit his job <eob> in the British Foreign Office. <eob>
When I asked him, "Why did you leave," <eob> he told me this story. <eob>
He had gone to his boss <eol> one morning and said, <eob> "Let's do something <eol> about human rights abuses in China." <eob> And his boss had replied, <eob> "We can't do anything <eol> about human rights abuses in China <eob> because we have <eol> trade relations with China." <eob>
So my friend went away <eol> with his tail between his legs, <eob> and six months later, <eol> he returned again to his boss, <eob> and he said this time, <eob> "Let's do something <eol> about human rights in Burma," <eob> as it was then called. <eob>
His boss once again paused <eob> and said, "Oh, but we can't <eol> do anything about human rights in Burma <eob> because we don't have <eol> any trade relations with Burma." <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
It wasn't just the hypocrisy <eol> that got to him. <eob> It was the unwillingness of his government <eob> to engage in conflict with other governments, <eob> in tense discussions, <eob> all the while, innocent people <eol> were being harmed. <eob>
We are constantly told <eob> that conflict is bad <eob> that compromise is good; <eob> that conflict is bad <eob> but consensus is good; <eob> that conflict is bad <eob> and collaboration is good. <eob>
But in my view, <eob> that's far too simple <eol> a vision of the world. <eob>
We cannot know <eob> whether conflict is bad <eob> unless we know who is fighting, <eob> why they are fighting <eob> and how they are fighting. <eob>
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten <eob> if they harm people <eol> who are not at the table, <eob> people who are vulnerable, disempowered, <eob> people whom we have <eol> an obligation to protect. <eob>
Now, you might be <eol> somewhat skeptical of a lawyer <eob> arguing about the benefits of conflict <eob> and creating problems for compromise, <eob> but I did also qualify as a mediator, <eob> and these days, I spend my time <eol> giving talks about ethics for free. <eob>
So as my bank manager likes to remind me, <eol> I'm downwardly mobile. <eob>
But if you accept my argument, <eob> it should change not just the way <eol> we lead our personal lives, <eob> which I wish to put <eol> to one side for the moment, <eob> but it will change the way <eol> we think about major problems <eob> of public health and the environment. <eob> Let me explain. <eob> Every middle schooler <eol> in the United States, <eob> my 12-year-old daughter included, <eob> learns that there are <eol> three branches of government, <eob> the legislative, the executive <eol> and the judicial branch. <eob>
James Madison wrote, <eob> "If there is any principle <eol> more sacred in our Constitution, <eob> and indeed in any free constitution, <eob> than any other, <eob> it is that which separates <eob> the legislative, the executive <eol> and the judicial powers." <eob> Now, the framers were not just concerned <eob> about the concentration <eol> and exercise of power. <eob> They also understood <eol> the perils of influence. <eob>
Judges cannot determine <eol> the constitutionality of laws <eob> if they participate in making those laws, <eob> nor can they hold the other branches <eol> of government accountable <eob> if they collaborate with them <eob> or enter into close <eol> relationships with them. <eob>
The Constitution is, <eol> as one famous scholar put it, <eob> "an invitation to struggle." <eob> And we the people are served <eob> when those branches do, indeed, <eol> struggle with each other. <eob>
Now, we recognize the importance of struggle <eob> not just in the public sector <eob> between our branches of government. <eob>
We also know it too in the private sector, <eob> in relationships among corporations. <eob>
Let's imagine that two American airlines <eol> get together and agree <eob> that they will not drop the price <eob> of their economy class airfares <eol> below 250 dollars a ticket. <eob>
That is collaboration, <eol> some would say collusion, <eob> not competition, <eob> and we the people are harmed <eob> because we pay more for our tickets. <eob>
and we the people are harmed <eob> Imagine similarly <eol> two airlines were to say, <eob> "Look, Airline A, we'll take <eol> the route from LA to Chicago," <eob> and Airline B says, "We'll take <eol> the route from Chicago to DC, <eob> and we won't compete." <eob> Once again, that's collaboration <eol> or collusion instead of competition, <eob>
So we understand <eol> the importance of struggle <eob> when it comes to relationships <eol> between branches of government, <eob> the public sector. <eob>
We also understand <eol> the importance of conflict <eob> when it comes to relationships <eol> among corporations, <eob> the private sector. <eob>
But where we have forgotten it <eob> is in the relationships <eol> between the public and the private. <eob>
And governments all over the world <eol> are collaborating with industry <eob> to solve problems <eob> of public health and the environment, <eob> often collaborating <eol> with the very corporations <eob> that are creating or exacerbating <eol> the problems they are trying to solve. <eob>
We are told that these relationships <eob> are a win-win. <eob>
But what if someone is losing out? <eob>
Let me give you some examples. <eob>
A United Nations agency <eol> decided to address a serious problem: <eob> poor sanitation in schools in rural India. <eob>
They did so not just in collaboration <eol> with national and local governments <eob> but also with a television company <eob> and with a major <eol> multinational soda company. <eob>
In exchange for less <eol> than one million dollars, <eob> that corporation received the benefits <eol> of a months-long promotional campaign <eob> including a 12-hour telethon <eob> all using the company's logo <eol> and color scheme. <eob>
This was an arrangement <eob> which was totally understandable <eob> from the corporation's point of view. <eob>
It enhances the reputation of the company <eob> and it creates brand loyalty <eol> for its products. <eob>
But in my view, <eob> this is profoundly problematic <eol> for the intergovernmental agency, <eob> an agency that has a mission <eol> to promote sustainable living. <eob>
By increasing consumption <eol> of sugar-sweetened beverages <eob> made from scarce local water supplies <eol> and drunk out of plastic bottles <eob> in a country that is already <eol> grappling with obesity, <eob> this is neither sustainable <eol> from a public health <eob> nor an environmental point of view. <eob>
And in order to solve <eol> one public health problem, <eob> the agency is sowing the seeds <eob> of another. <eob>
This is just one example <eol> of dozens I discovered <eob> in researching a book on the relationships <eol> between government and industry. <eob>
I could also have told you <eol> about the initiatives in parks <eob> in London and throughout Britain, <eob> involving the same company, <eol> promoting exercise, <eob> or indeed of the British government <eol> creating voluntary pledges <eob> in partnership with industry <eob> instead of regulating industry. <eob>
These collaborations or partnerships <eol> have become the paradigm in public health, <eob> and once again, they make sense <eol> from the point of view of industry. <eob>
It allows them to frame <eol> public health problems and their solutions <eob> in ways that are least threatening to, <eob> most consonant with <eol> their commercial interests. <eob>
So obesity becomes a problem <eob> of individual decision-making, <eob> of personal behavior, <eob> personal responsibility <eol> and lack of physical activity. <eob>
It is not a problem, <eob> when framed this way, <eob> of a multinational food system <eol> involving major corporations. <eob>
And again, I don't blame industry. <eob>
Industry naturally engages <eol> in strategies of influence <eob> to promote its commercial interests. <eob>
But governments have a responsibility <eob> to develop counterstrategies <eob> to protect us <eob> and the common good. <eob>
The mistake that governments are making <eob> when they collaborate in this way <eob> with industry <eob> is that they conflate <eob> the common good <eob> with common ground. <eob>
When you collaborate <eob> with industry, <eob> you necessarily put off the table <eob> things that might promote <eob> the common good <eob> to which industry will not agree. <eob>
Industry will not agree <eol> to increased regulation <eob> unless it believes this will <eol> stave off even more regulation <eob> or perhaps knock some competitors <eol> out of the market. <eob>
Nor can companies agree <eol> to do certain things, <eob> for example raise the prices <eol> of their unhealthy products, <eob> because that would violate <eol> competition law, <eob> as we've established. <eob>
So our governments should not confound <eob> the common good <eob> and common ground, especially when common <eol> ground means reaching agreement <eob> with industry. <eob>
I want to give you another example, <eob> moving from high-profile collaboration <eob> to something that is below ground <eob> both literally and figuratively: <eob> the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas. <eob>
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land <eob> not knowing the mineral rights <eol> have been sold. <eob>
This is before the fracking boom. <eob>
You build your dream home on that plot, <eob> and shortly afterwards, <eob> you discover that a gas company <eol> is building a well pad on your land. <eob>
That was the plight <eol> of the Hallowich family. <eob>
Within a very short period of time, <eob> they began to complain of headaches, <eob> of sore throats, of itchy eyes, <eob> in addition to the interference <eol> of the noise, vibration <eob> and the bright lights <eol> from the flaring of natural gas. <eob>
They were very vocal in their criticisms, <eob> and then they fell silent. <eob>
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, <eol> where this image appeared, <eob> and one other newspaper, <eol> we discovered why they fell silent. <eob>
The newspapers went <eob> to the court and said, "What happened <eol> to the Hallowiches?" <eob> And it turned out the Hallowiches had made a secret settlement <eob> with the gas operators, and it was a take-it-or-leave-it settlement. <eob>
The gas company said, <eob> you can have a six-figure sum <eob> to move elsewhere <eol> and start your lives again, <eob> but in return <eob> you must promise not to speak <eol> of your experience with our company, <eob> not to speak of your <eol> experience with fracking, <eob> not to speak about the health consequences <eob> that might have been revealed <eol> by a medical examination. <eob> Now, I do not blame <eol> the Hallowiches for accepting <eob> a take-it-or-leave-it settlement <eob> and starting their lives elsewhere. <eob>
And one can understand <eob> why the company would wish <eol> to silence a squeaky wheel. <eob>
What I want to point the finger at <eol> is the legal and regulatory system, <eob> a system in which there are <eol> networks of agreements <eob> just like this one <eob> which serve to silence people <eol> and seal off data points <eob> from public health experts <eol> and epidemiologists, <eob> a system in which regulators <eob> will even refrain <eol> from issuing a violation notice <eob> in the event of pollution <eob> if the landowner and the gas company <eob> agree to settle. <eob>
This is a system which isn't just <eol> bad from a public health point of view; <eob> it exposes hazards to local families <eob> who remain in the dark. <eob>
Now, I have given you two examples <eol> not because they are isolated examples. <eob>
They are examples of a systemic problem. <eob>
I could share some counterexamples, <eob> the case for example <eol> of the public official <eob> who sues the pharmaceutical company <eob> for concealing the fact <eob> that its antidepressant increases <eol> suicidal thoughts in adolescents. <eob>
I can tell you about the regulator <eol> who went after the food company <eob> for exaggerating the purported <eol> health benefits of its yogurt. <eob>
And I can tell you about the legislator <eob> who despite heavy lobbying <eol> directed at both sides of the aisle <eob> pushes for environmental protections. <eob>
These are isolated examples, <eob> but they are beacons of light <eol> in the darkness, <eob> and they can show us the way. <eob>
I began by suggesting that sometimes <eol> we need to engage in conflict. <eob>
Governments should tussle with, <eob> struggle with, at times engage <eol> in direct conflict with corporations. <eob>
This is not because governments <eol> are inherently good <eob> and corporations are inherently evil. <eob> Each is capable of good or ill. <eob>
But corporations understandably act <eol> to promote their commercial interests, <eob> and they do so either sometimes <eol> undermining or promoting <eob> the common good. <eob>
But it is the responsibility <eol> of governments <eob> to protect and promote <eob> the common good. <eob>
And we should insist <eob> that they fight to do so. <eob>
This is because governments <eob> are the guardians <eob> of public health; <eob> governments are the guardians <eob> of the environment; <eob> and it is governments <eob> that are guardians <eob> of these essential parts <eol> of our common good. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
In the next six minutes <eol> that you will listen to me, <eob> the world will have lost three mothers <eob> while delivering their babies: <eob> one, because of a severe complication; <eob> second, because she will be a teenager <eob> and her body will not <eol> be prepared for birth; <eob> but the third, only because of lack <eol> of access to basic clean tools <eob> at the time of childbirth. <eob>
She will not be alone. <eob>
Over one million mothers and babies <eol> die every single year <eob> in the developing world, <eob> only because of lack of access <eol> to basic cleanliness <eob> while giving birth to their babies. <eob>
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon <eob> in India in 2008, <eob> when after a day of meeting women <eol> and listening to their needs, <eob> I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife. <eob>
As a mother, I was very curious <eol> on how she delivered babies in her house. <eob>
After a deep and engaging <eol> conversation with her <eob> on how she considered it a profound <eol> calling to do what she was doing, <eob> I asked her a parting question: <eob> Do you have the tools that you need <eol> to deliver the babies? <eob>
I got to see her tool. <eob> "This is what I use to separate <eol> the mother and the baby," she said. <eob>
Unsure of how to react, I held this <eol> agricultural tool in my hand in shock. <eob>
I took a picture of this, <eol> hugged her and walked away. <eob>
My mind was flooded with reflections <eol> of my own infection <eob> that I had to struggle with <eol> for a year past childbirth <eob> despite having access <eol> to the best medical care, <eob> and memories of my conversation <eol> with my father, <eob> who had lost his mom to childbirth, <eob> on how he thought his life <eol> would be so different <eob> if she would have been <eol> just next to him growing up. <eob>
As a product developer, <eol> I started my process of research. <eob>
I was very excited to find <eol> that there was a product out there <eob> called the Clean Birth Kit. <eob>
But I just couldn't buy one for months. <eob>
They were only assembled <eol> based on availability of funding. <eob>
Finally, when I got my hands on one, <eol> I was in shock again. <eob>
I would never use these tools <eol> to deliver my baby, I thought. <eob> But to confirm my instincts, <eol> I went back to the women, <eob> some of whom had the experience <eol> of using this product. <eob>
Lo and behold, they had <eol> the same reaction and more. <eob>
The women said they would rather <eol> deliver on a floor <eob> than on a plastic sheet <eol> that smeared blood all over. <eob>
They were absolutely right -- <eol> it would cause more infection. <eob>
The thread provided was a highway <eol> to bacterial infection <eob> through the baby's umbilical cord, <eob> and the blade used was the kind <eol> that men used for shaving, <eob> and they did not want it <eol> anywhere close to them. <eob>
There was no incentive for anybody <eol> to redesign this product, <eob> because it was based on charity. <eob>
The women were never <eol> consulted in this process. <eob>
And to my surprise, the need <eol> was not only in homes <eob> but also in institutional settings <eol> with high-volume births. <eob>
Situations in remote areas <eol> were even more daunting. <eob>
This had to change. <eob> I made this my area of focus. <eob>
I started the design process <eol> by collecting feedback, <eob> developing prototypes <eob> and engaging with various stakeholders <eol> researching global protocols. <eob>
With every single prototype, <eol> we went back to the women <eob> to ensure that we had a product for them. <eob>
What I learned through this process <eol> was that these women, <eob> despite their extreme poverty, <eob> placed great value <eol> on their health and well-being. <eob>
They were absolutely not poor in mind. <eob>
As with all of us, they would appreciate <eol> a well-designed product <eob> developed for their needs. <eob>
After many iterations <eol> working with experts, <eob> medical health professionals <eob> and the women themselves, <eob> I should say it was not <eol> an easy process at all, <eob> but we had a simple and beautiful design. <eob>
For a dollar more than what <eol> the existing product was offered for, <eob> at three dollars, we were able <eol> to deliver "janma," <eob> a clean birth kit in a purse. <eob>
Janma, meaning "birth," contained <eol> a blood-absorbing sheet <eob> for the woman to give birth on, <eob> a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp, <eol> a bar of soap, a pair of gloves <eob> and the first cloth <eol> to wipe the baby clean. <eob>
All this came packaged <eol> in a beautiful purse <eob> that was given to the mother <eol> as a gift after all her hard work, <eob> that she carried home with pride <eol> as a symbol of prosperity. <eob>
One woman reacted to this gift. <eob>
She said, "Is this really mine? <eob>
Can I keep it? <eob> "The other one said," Will <eol> you give me a different color <eob> when I have my next baby? <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Better yet, a woman expressed <eol> that this was the first purse <eob> that she had ever owned in her life. <eob>
The kit, aside from its symbolism <eol> and its simplicity, <eob> is designed to follow <eol> globally recommended medical protocol <eob> and serves as a behavior-change tool <eol> to follow steps one after the other. <eob>
It can not only be used in homes, <eol> but also in institutional settings. <eob>
To date, our kit has impacted <eol> over 600,000 mothers and babies <eob> around the world. <eob>
It's a humbling experience <eol> to watch these numbers grow, <eob> and I cannot wait until <eol> we reach a hundred million. <eob>
But women's health issues do not end here. <eob>
There are thousands of simple issues <eol> that require low-cost interventions. <eob>
We have facts to prove <eol> that if we invest in women and girls <eob> and provide them with better <eol> health and well-being, <eob> they will deliver healthier and wealthier <eol> and prosperous communities. <eob>
We have to start by bringing simplicity <eol> and dignity to women's health issues: <eob> from reducing maternal mortality, <eol> to breaking taboos, <eob> to empowering women <eol> to take control of their own lives. <eob>
This is my dream. <eob>
But it is not possible to achieve it <eol> without engaging men and women alike <eob> from <eob> around the world <eob> — <eob> yes, all of you. <eob>
I recently heard this lyric <eol> by Leonard Cohen: <eob> "Ring the bells that still can ring. <eob>
Forget your perfect offering. <eob> There is a crack in everything. <eob> That's how the light gets in." <eob> This is my bit of light. <eob>
But we need more light. <eob>
In fact, we need huge spotlights <eol> placed in the world of women's health <eob> if we need a better tomorrow. <eob>
We should never forget that women <eol> are at the center of a sustainable world, <eob> and we do not exist without them. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
So I would like to start by telling you <eol> about one of my greatest friends, <eob> Okoloma Maduewesi. <eob>
Okoloma lived on my street <eob> and looked after me like a big brother. <eob>
If I liked a boy, <eol> I would ask Okoloma's opinion. <eob>
Okoloma died in the notorious <eol> Sosoliso plane crash <eob> in Nigeria in December of 2005. <eob>
Almost exactly seven years ago. <eob>
Okoloma was a person I could argue with, <eol> laugh with and truly talk to. <eob>
He was also the first person <eol> to call me a feminist. <eob>
I was about fourteen, <eol> we were at his house, arguing. <eob>
Both of us bristling <eol> with half bit knowledge <eob> from books that we had read. <eob>
I don't remember what this <eol> particular argument was about, <eob> but I remember <eol> that as I argued and argued, <eob> Okoloma looked at me and said, <eol> "You know, you're a feminist." <eob> It was not a compliment. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I could tell from his tone, <eob> the same tone that you would use <eol> to say something like, <eob> "You're a supporter of terrorism." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I did not know exactly <eol> what this word "feminist" meant, <eob> and I did not want Okoloma <eol> to know that I did not know. <eob>
So I brushed it aside, <eol> and I continued to argue. <eob>
And the first thing <eol> I planned to do when I got home <eob> was to look up the word <eol> "feminist" in the dictionary. <eob>
Now fast forward to some years later, <eob> I wrote a novel about a man <eol> who among other things beats his wife <eob> and whose story doesn't end very well. <eob>
While I was promoting <eol> the novel in Nigeria, <eob> a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man, <eob> told me he wanted to advise me. <eob>
And for the Nigerians here, <eob> I'm sure we're all familiar <eob> with how quick our people are <eol> to give unsolicited advice. <eob>
He told me that people were saying <eol> that my novel was feminist <eob> and his advice to me -- <eob> and he was shaking his head <eol> sadly as he spoke -- <eob> was that I should never <eol> call myself a feminist <eob> because feminists <eol> are women who are unhappy <eob> because they cannot find husbands. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I decided to call myself <eol> "a happy feminist." <eob> Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me <eob> that feminism was not our culture <eob> and that feminism wasn't African, <eob> and that I was calling myself a feminist <eob> because I had been corrupted <eol> by "Western books." <eob> Which amused me, <eob> because a lot of my early readings <eol> were decidedly unfeminist. <eob>
I think I must have read every single <eol> Mills &amp; Boon romance published <eob> before I was sixteen. <eob>
And each time I tried to read those books <eob> called "the feminist classics," <eob> I'd get bored, and I really <eol> struggled to finish them. <eob>
But anyway, since feminism was un-African, <eob> I decided that I would now call myself <eol> "a happy African feminist." <eob> At some point I was a happy African <eol> feminist who does not hate men <eob> and who likes lip gloss <eob> and who wears high heels <eol> for herself but not for men. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course a lot of this <eol> was tongue-in-cheek, <eob> but that word feminist is so heavy <eol> with baggage, negative baggage. <eob>
You hate men, you hate bras, <eob> you hate African culture, <eol> that sort of thing. <eob>
Now here's a story from my childhood. <eob>
When I was in primary school, <eob> my teacher said at the beginning of term <eol> that she would give the class a test <eob> and whoever got the highest score <eol> would be the class monitor. <eob>
Now, class monitor was a big deal. <eob>
If you were a class monitor, <eob> you got to write down <eol> the names of noisemakers -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
which was having enough power of its own. <eob>
But my teacher would also give you <eol> a cane to hold in your hand <eob> while you walk around <eol> and patrol the class for noisemakers. <eob>
Now, of course you were not <eol> actually allowed to use the cane. <eob>
But it was an exciting prospect <eol> for the nine-year-old me. <eob>
I very much wanted <eol> to be the class monitor. <eob>
And I got the highest score on the test. <eob>
Then, to my surprise, my teacher said <eol> that the monitor had to be a boy. <eob>
She had forgotten <eol> to make that clear earlier <eob> because she assumed it was ... obvious. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A boy had the second highest <eol> score on the test, <eob> and he would be monitor. <eob>
Now, what was even more <eol> interesting about this <eob> is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul <eob> who had no interest <eol> in patrolling the class with the cane, <eob> while I was full of ambition to do so. <eob>
But I was female and he was male, <eob> and so he became the class monitor. <eob>
And I've never forgotten that incident. <eob>
I often make the mistake of thinking <eob> that something that is obvious to me <eol> is just as obvious to everyone else. <eob>
Now, take my dear friend Louis <eob> for example. <eob>
Louis is a brilliant, progressive man, <eob> and we would have conversations <eol> and he would tell me, <eob> "I don't know what you mean by things <eol> being different or harder for women. <eob>
Maybe in the past, but not now." <eob> And I didn't understand how Louis <eol> could not see what seems so self-evident. <eob>
Then one evening, in Lagos, <eol> Louis and I went out with friends. <eob>
And for people here <eol> who are not familiar with Lagos, <eob> there's that wonderful Lagos' fixture, <eob> the sprinkling of energetic men <eol> who hang around outside establishments <eob> and very dramatically <eol> "help" you park your car. <eob>
I was impressed <eol> with the particular theatrics <eob> of the man who found us <eol> a parking spot that evening. <eob>
And so as we were leaving, <eol> I decided to leave him a tip. <eob>
I opened my bag, <eob> put my hand inside my bag, <eob> brought out my money <eol> that I had earned from doing my work, <eob> and I gave it to the man. <eob>
And he, this man who was <eol> very grateful and very happy, <eob> took the money from me, <eob> looked across at Louis <eob> and said, "Thank you, sir!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Louis looked at me, surprised, <eob> and asked, "Why is he thanking me? <eob>
I didn't give him the money. <eob> "Then I saw realization dawn <eol> on Louis' face. <eob>
The man believed that whatever money I had <eob> had ultimately come from Louis. <eob>
Because Louis is a man. <eob>
Men and women are different. <eob>
We have different hormones, <eol> we have different sexual organs, <eob> we have different biological abilities. <eob>
Women can have babies, men can't. <eob>
At least not yet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Men have testosterone and are <eol> in general physically stronger than women. <eob>
There's slightly more women <eol> than men in the world, <eob> about 52 percent of the world's <eol> population is female. <eob>
But most of the positions of power <eol> and prestige are occupied by men. <eob>
The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate, <eob> Wangari Maathai, <eob> put it simply and well when she said: <eob> "The higher you go, <eol> the fewer women there are." <eob> In the recent US elections we kept hearing <eol> of the Lilly Ledbetter law, <eob> and if we go beyond the nicely <eol> alliterative name of that law, <eob> it was really about a man and a woman <eob> doing the same job, <eol> being equally qualified, <eob> and the man being paid more <eol> because he's a man. <eob>
So in the literal way, men rule the world, <eob> and this made sense a thousand years ago <eob> because human beings lived then in a world <eob> in which physical strength was <eol> the most important attribute for survival. <eob>
The physically stronger person <eol> was more likely to lead, <eob> and men, in general, <eol> are physically stronger. <eob>
Of course there are many exceptions. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But today we live <eol> in a vastly different world. <eob>
The person more likely to lead <eol> is not the physically stronger person; <eob> it is the more creative person, <eol> the more intelligent person, <eob> the more innovative person, <eob> and there are no hormones <eol> for those attributes. <eob>
A man is as likely as a woman <eol> to be intelligent, <eob> to be creative, to be innovative. <eob>
We have evolved; <eob> but it seems to me that our ideas <eol> of gender had not evolved. <eob>
Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby <eol> of one of the best Nigerian hotels. <eob>
I thought about naming the hotel, <eol> but I thought I probably shouldn't. <eob>
And a guard at the entrance stopped me <eol> and asked me annoying questions, <eob> because their automatic assumption is <eob> that a Nigerian female walking <eol> into a hotel alone is a sex worker. <eob>
And by the way, <eob> why do these hotels <eol> focus on the ostensible supply <eob> rather than the demand for sex workers? <eob>
In Lagos I cannot go alone <eol> into many "reputable" bars and clubs. <eob>
They just don't let you in <eol> if you're a woman alone, <eob> you have to be accompanied by a man. <eob>
Each time I walk into <eol> a Nigerian restaurant with a man, <eob> the waiter greets the man and ignores me. <eob>
The waiters are products -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At this some women felt like, <eol> "Yes! I thought that!" <eob> The waiters are products of a society <eob> that has taught them that men <eol> are more important than women. <eob>
And I know that waiters <eol> don't intend any harm. <eob>
But it's one thing to know intellectually <eol> and quite another to feel it emotionally. <eob>
Each time they ignore me, <eol> I feel invisible. <eob> I feel upset. <eob> I want to tell them <eol> that I am just as human as the man, <eob> that I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment. <eob>
These are little things, <eob> but sometimes it's the little things <eol> that sting the most. <eob>
And not long ago, I wrote an article <eob> about what it means <eol> to be young and female in Lagos, <eob> and the printers told me, <eob> "It was so angry." <eob> Of course it was angry! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am angry. <eob> Gender as it functions today <eol> is a grave injustice. <eob>
We should all be angry. <eob>
Anger has a long history <eol> of bringing about positive change; <eob> but, in addition to being angry, <eol> I'm also hopeful. <eob>
Because I believe deeply <eol> in the ability of human beings <eob> to make and remake <eol> themselves for the better. <eob>
Gender matters everywhere in the world, <eob> but I want to focus on Nigeria <eob> and on Africa in general, <eob> because it is where I know, <eol> and because it is where my heart is. <eob>
And I would like today to ask <eob> that we begin to dream about <eol> and plan for a different world, <eob> a fairer world, <eob> a world of happier men and happier women <eol> who are truer to themselves. <eob>
And this is how to start: <eob> we must raise our daughters differently. <eob>
We must also raise our sons differently. <eob>
We do a great disservice to boys <eol> on how we raise them; <eob> we stifle the humanity of boys. <eob>
We define masculinity <eol> in a very narrow way, <eob> masculinity becomes this hard, small cage <eob> and we put boys inside the cage. <eob>
We teach boys to be afraid of fear. <eob>
We teach boys to be afraid <eol> of weakness, of vulnerability. <eob>
We teach them to mask their true selves, <eob> because they have to be, <eol> in Nigerian speak, "hard man!" <eob> In secondary school, a boy and a girl, <eol> both of them teenagers, <eob> both of them with the same amount <eol> of pocket money, would go out <eob> and then the boy <eol> would be expected always to pay, <eob> to prove his masculinity. <eob>
And yet we wonder why boys are more likely <eol> to steal money from their parents. <eob>
What if both boys and girls were raised <eob> not to link masculinity with money? <eob>
What if the attitude <eol> was not "the boy has to pay" <eob> but rather "whoever has more should pay?" <eob> Now, of course because <eol> of that historical advantage, <eob> it is mostly men who will have more today, <eob> but if we start <eol> raising children differently, <eob> then in fifty years, in a hundred years, <eob> boys will no longer have the pressure <eol> of having to prove this masculinity. <eob>
But by far the worst thing we do to males, <eob> by making them feel <eol> that they have to be hard, <eob> is that we leave them <eol> with very fragile egos. <eob>
The more "hard man" <eol> the man feels compelled to be, <eob> the weaker his ego is. <eob>
And then we do a much greater <eol> disservice to girls <eob> because we raise them <eol> to cater to the fragile egos of men. <eob>
We teach girls to shrink themselves, <eol> to make themselves smaller, <eob> we say to girls, <eob> "You can have ambition, but not too much." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"You should aim to be successful, <eol> but not too successful, <eob> otherwise you would threaten the man." <eob> If you are the breadwinner <eol> in your relationship with a man, <eob> you have to pretend that you're not, <eob> especially in public, <eob> otherwise you will emasculate him. <eob>
But what if we question <eol> the premise itself? <eob>
Why should a woman's success <eol> be a threat to a man? <eob>
What if we decide <eol> to simply dispose of that word, <eob> and I don't think there's an English word <eol> I dislike more than "emasculation." <eob> A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me <eob> if I was worried that men <eol> would be intimidated by me. <eob>
I was not worried at all. <eob>
In fact, it had not occurred <eol> to me to be worried <eob> because a man who would <eol> be intimidated by me <eob> is exactly the kind of man <eol> I would have no interest in. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But still I was really struck by this. <eob>
Because I'm female, <eol> I'm expected to aspire to marriage; <eob> I'm expected to make my life choices <eob> always keeping in mind <eol> that marriage is the most important. <eob>
A marriage can be a good thing; <eob> it can be a source of joy <eol> and love and mutual support. <eob>
But why do we teach girls <eol> to aspire to marriage <eob> and we don't teach boys the same? <eob>
I know a woman <eol> who decided to sell her house <eob> because she didn't want <eol> to intimidate a man who might marry her. <eob>
I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria <eol> who, when she goes to conferences, <eob> wears a wedding ring <eob> because according to her, <eob> she wants the other participants <eol> in the conference to "give her respect." <eob> I know young women <eol> who are under so much pressure <eob> from family, from friends, <eol> even from work to get married, <eob> and they're pushed <eol> to make terrible choices. <eob>
A woman at a certain age who is unmarried, <eob> our society teaches her <eol> to see it as a deep, personal failure. <eob>
And a man at a certain age <eol> who is unmarried, <eob> we just think he hasn't come around <eol> to making his pick. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's easy for us to say, <eob> "Oh, but women can <eol> just say no to all of this." <eob> But the reality is more difficult <eol> and more complex. <eob>
We're all social beings. <eob>
We internalize ideas <eol> from our socialization. <eob>
Even the language we use <eob> in talking about marriage <eol> and relationships illustrates this. <eob>
The language of marriage <eol> is often the language of ownership <eob> rather than the language of partnership. <eob>
We use the word "respect" <eob> to mean something a woman shows a man <eob> but often not something <eol> a man shows a woman. <eob>
Both men and women in Nigeria will say -- <eob> this is an expression <eol> I'm very amused by -- <eob> "I did it for peace in my marriage." <eob> Now, when men say it, <eob> it is usually about something <eol> that they should not be doing anyway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sometimes they say it to their friends, <eob> it's something to say to their friends <eol> in a kind of fondly exasperated way, <eob> you know, something that ultimately <eol> proves how masculine they are, <eob> how needed, how loved. <eob> "Oh, my wife said <eol> I can't go to the club every night, <eob> so for peace in my marriage, <eol> I do it only on weekends." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, when a woman says, <eob> "I did it for peace in my marriage," <eob> she's usually talking about <eol> giving up a job, <eob> a dream, <eob> a career. <eob>
We teach females that in relationships, <eob> compromise is what women do. <eob>
We raise girls to see <eol> each other as competitors -- <eob> not for jobs or for accomplishments, <eol> which I think can be a good thing, <eob> but for attention of men. <eob>
We teach girls that they <eol> cannot be sexual beings <eob> in the way that boys are. <eob>
If we have sons, we don't mind <eol> knowing about our sons' girlfriends. <eob>
But our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But of course when the time is right, <eob> we expect those girls to bring back <eol> the perfect man to be their husbands. <eob>
We police girls, <eol> we praise girls for virginity, <eob> but we don't praise boys for virginity, <eob> and it's always made me wonder how exactly <eol> this is supposed to work out because ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I mean, the loss of virginity <eol> is usually a process that involves ... <eob>
Recently a young woman <eol> was gang raped in a university in Nigeria, <eob> I think some of us know about that. <eob>
And the response of many young Nigerians, <eol> both male and female, <eob> was something along the lines of this: <eob> "Yes, rape is wrong. <eob>
But what is a girl doing <eol> in a room with four boys?" <eob> Now, if we can forget <eol> the horrible inhumanity of that response, <eob> these Nigerians have been raised <eol> to think of women as inherently guilty, <eob> and they have been raised <eol> to expect so little of men <eob> that the idea of men as savage beings <eol> without any control <eob> is somehow acceptable. <eob>
We teach girls shame. <eob> "Close your legs." "Cover yourself." <eob> We make them feel <eol> as though by being born female <eob> they're already guilty of something. <eob>
And so, girls grow up to be women <eob> who cannot see they have desire. <eob>
They grow up to be women <eol> who silence themselves. <eob>
They grow up to be women <eol> who cannot say what they truly think, <eob> and they grow up -- <eob> and this is the worst thing <eol> we did to girls -- <eob> they grow up to be women <eol> who have turned pretense into an art form. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I know a woman who hates domestic work, <eob> she just hates it, <eob> but she pretends that she likes it, <eob> because she's been taught <eol> that to be "good wife material" <eob> she has to be -- <eol> to use that Nigerian word -- <eob> very "homely." <eob> And then she got married, <eob> and after a while her husband's family <eol> began to complain that she had changed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Actually, she had not changed, <eob> she just got tired of pretending. <eob>
The problem with gender, <eob> is that it prescribes how we should be <eob> rather than recognizing how we are. <eob>
Now imagine how much happier we would be, <eob> how much freer to be <eol> our true individual selves, <eob> if we didn't have the weight <eol> of gender expectations. <eob>
Boys and girls are <eol> undeniably different biologically, <eob> but socialization <eol> exaggerates the differences <eob> and then it becomes <eol> a self-fulfilling process. <eob>
Now, take cooking <eob> for example. <eob>
Today women in general are more likely <eol> to do the housework than men, <eob> the cooking and cleaning. <eob> But why is that? <eob> Is it because women <eol> are born with a cooking gene? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or because over years they have been <eol> socialized to see cooking as their role? <eob>
Actually, I was going to say that maybe <eol> women are born with a cooking gene, <eob> until I remember that the majority <eol> of the famous cooks in the world, <eob> whom we give the fancy title of "chefs," <eob> are men. <eob>
I used to look up to my grandmother <eob> who was a brilliant, brilliant woman, <eob> and wonder how she would have been <eob> if she had the same opportunities <eol> as men when she was growing up. <eob>
Now today, there are <eol> many more opportunities for women <eob> than there were <eol> during my grandmother's time <eob> because of changes in policy, <eol> changes in law, <eob> all of which are very important. <eob>
But what matters even more <eol> is our attitude, our mindset, <eob> what we believe <eol> and what we value about gender. <eob>
What if in raising children <eob> we focus on ability instead of gender? <eob>
What if in raising children <eob> we focus on interest instead of gender? <eob>
I know a family <eol> who have a son and a daughter, <eob> both of whom are brilliant at school, <eob> who are wonderful, lovely children. <eob>
When the boy is hungry, <eol> the parents say to the girl, <eob> "Go and cook Indomie noodles <eol> for your brother." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the daughter doesn't <eol> particularly like to cook Indomie noodles, <eob> but she's a girl, and so she has to. <eob>
Now, what if the parents, <eob> from the beginning, <eob> taught both the boy and the girl <eol> to cook Indomie? <eob>
Cooking, by the way, <eol> is a very useful skill for boys to have. <eob>
I've never thought it made sense <eol> to leave such a crucial thing, <eob> the ability to nourish oneself -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
in the hands of others. <eob>
I know a woman who has the same degree <eol> and the same job as her husband. <eob>
When they get back from work, <eol> she does most of the housework, <eob> which I think is true for many marriages. <eob>
But what struck me about them <eob> was that whenever her husband <eol> changed the baby's diaper, <eob> she said "thank you" to him. <eob>
Now, what if she saw this <eol> as perfectly normal and natural <eob> that he should, in fact, <eol> care for his child? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm trying to unlearn <eol> many of the lessons of gender <eob> that I internalized when I was growing up. <eob>
But I sometimes still feel very vulnerable <eol> in the face of gender expectations. <eob>
The first time I taught <eol> a writing class in graduate school, <eob> I was worried. <eob>
I wasn't worried <eol> about the material I would teach <eob> because I was well-prepared, <eob> and I was going to teach <eol> what I enjoy teaching. <eob>
Instead, <eob> I was worried <eob> about what to wear. <eob>
I wanted to be taken seriously. <eob>
I knew that because I was female <eob> I will automatically <eol> have to prove my worth. <eob>
And <eob> I was worried <eob> that if I looked too feminine, <eob> I would not be taken seriously. <eob>
I really wanted to wear <eol> my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt, <eob> but I decided not to. <eob>
Instead, I wore a very serious, <eob> very manly and very ugly suit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Because the sad truth is <eol> that when it comes to appearance <eob> we start off with men <eol> as the standard, as the norm. <eob>
If a man is getting ready <eol> for a business meeting, <eob> he doesn't worry <eol> about looking too masculine <eob> and therefore not being taken for granted. <eob>
If a woman has to get ready <eol> for business meeting, <eob> she has to worry <eol> about looking too feminine <eob> and what it says and whether or not <eol> she will be taken seriously. <eob>
I wish I had not worn <eol> that ugly suit that day. <eob>
I've actually banished it <eol> from my closet, by the way. <eob>
Had I then the confidence <eol> that I have now to be myself, <eob> my students would have benefited <eol> even more from my teaching, <eob> because I would have been more comfortable <eob> and more fully and more truly myself. <eob>
I have chosen to no longer <eol> be apologetic for my femaleness <eob> and for my femininity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I want to be respected <eol> in all of my femaleness <eob> because I deserve to be. <eob>
Gender is not an easy <eol> conversation to have. <eob>
For both men and women, <eob> to bring up gender is sometimes <eol> to encounter almost immediate resistance. <eob>
I can imagine some people here <eol> are actually thinking, <eob> "Women too do sef." <eob> Some of the men here might be thinking, <eob> "OK, all of this is interesting, <eob> but I don't think like that." <eob> And that is part of the problem. <eob>
That many men do not <eol> actively think about gender <eob> or notice gender <eob> is part of the problem of gender. <eob>
That many men, say, like my friend Louis, <eob> that everything is fine now. <eob>
And that many men do nothing to change it. <eob>
If you are a man and you walk <eol> into a restaurant with a woman <eob> and the waiter greets only you, <eob> does it occur to you to ask the waiter, <eob> "Why haven't you greeted her?" <eob> Because gender can be -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Actually, we may repose <eol> part of a longer version of this talk. <eob>
So, because gender can be <eol> a very uncomfortable conversation to have, <eob> there are very easy ways to close it, <eol> to close the conversation. <eob>
So some people will bring up <eol> evolutionary biology and apes, <eob> how, you know, female apes <eol> bow down to male apes <eob> and that sort of thing. <eob>
But the point is we're not apes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Apes also live on trees <eol> and have earthworms for breakfast, <eob> and we don't. <eob>
Some people will say, "Well, poor men <eol> also have a hard time." <eob> And this is true. <eob>
But that is not what this -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But this is not <eol> what this conversation is about. <eob>
Gender and class <eol> are different forms of oppression. <eob>
I actually learned quite a bit <eol> about systems of oppression <eob> and how they can be blind to one another <eob> by talking to black men. <eob>
I was once talking <eol> to a black man about gender <eob> and he said to me, <eob> "Why do you have to say <eol> 'my experience as a woman'? <eob>
Why can't it be <eob> 'your experience as a human being'?" <eob> Now, this was the same man <eob> who would often talk <eol> about his experience as a black man. <eob>
Gender matters. <eob> Men and women <eol> experience the world differently. <eob>
Gender colors the way <eol> we experience the world. <eob>
But we can change that. <eob>
Some people will say, <eob> "Oh, but women have the real power, <eob> bottom power." <eob> And for non-Nigerians, <eol> bottom power is an expression <eob> which I suppose means <eol> something like a woman <eob> who uses her sexuality <eol> to get favors from men. <eob>
But <eob> bottom power <eob> is not power at all. <eob>
Bottom power means that a woman <eob> simply has a good root to tap into, <eol> from time to time -- <eob> somebody else's power. <eob>
And then, of course, we have to wonder <eob> what happens when <eol> that somebody else is in a bad mood, <eob> or sick <eob> or impotent. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Some people will say <eob> that a woman being subordinate <eol> to a man is our culture. <eob>
But culture is constantly changing. <eob>
I have beautiful twin nieces <eol> who are fifteen and live in Lagos. <eob>
If they had been born a hundred years ago <eob> they would have been <eol> taken away and killed. <eob>
Because it was our culture, <eol> it was our culture to kill twins. <eob>
So what is the point of culture? <eob>
I mean there's the decorative, <eob> the dancing... <eob> but also, culture really is about preservation <eol> and continuity of a people. <eob>
In my family, <eob> I am the child who is most interested <eol> in the story of who we are, <eob> in our traditions, <eob> in the knowledge about ancestral lands. <eob>
My brothers are not as interested as I am. <eob>
But I cannot participate, <eob> I cannot go to umunna meetings, <eob> I cannot have a say. <eob>
Because I'm female. <eob>
Culture does not make people, <eob> people make culture. <eob>
So if it is in fact true — <eob>
So if it is in fact true <eob> that the full humanity <eol> of women is not our culture, <eob> then we must make it our culture. <eob>
I think very often of my dear friend, <eob> Okoloma Maduewesi. <eob>
May he and all the others <eol> who passed away in that Sosoliso crash <eob> continue to rest in peace. <eob>
He will always be remembered <eol> by those of us who loved him. <eob>
And he was right that day many years ago <eol> when he called me a feminist. <eob>
I am a feminist. <eob> And when I looked up the word <eol> in the dictionary that day, <eob> this is what it said: <eob> "Feminist: a person <eol> who believes in the social, political <eob> and economic equality of the sexes." <eob> My great grandmother, <eol> from the stories I've heard, <eob> was a feminist. <eob>
She ran away from the house of the man <eol> she did not want to marry <eob> and ended up marrying <eol> the man of her choice. <eob>
She refused, she protested, she spoke up <eob> whenever she felt she was being deprived <eol> of access, of land, that sort of thing. <eob>
My great grandmother <eol> did not know that word "feminist," <eob> but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one. <eob>
More of us should reclaim that word. <eob>
My own definition of feminist is: <eob> "A feminist is a man or a woman <eob> who says — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A feminist is a man or a woman <eob> who says, <eob> "Yes, there's a problem <eol> with gender as it is today, <eob> and we must fix it. <eob>
We must do better." <eob> The best feminist I know <eob> is my brother Kene. <eob>
He's also a kind, <eol> good-looking, lovely man, <eob> and he's very masculine. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Two months ago, my kids <eol> and I huddled around a cell phone <eob> watching the live stream <eol> of the Game Awards, <eob> one of the video game industry's biggest nights. <eob>
They announced the nominees <eol> for the Game for Impact, <eob> an award that's given <eol> to a thought-provoking video game <eob> with a profound prosocial message <eol> or meaning. <eob>
They opened the envelope <eob> and they read the title of our video game. <eob>
An award ... <eob> for impact. <eob>
It was almost funny, actually, <eob> because I always thought <eol> that winning an award like that <eob> would have this huge impact on my life, <eob> but I found that the opposite is true. <eob>
The big nights, <eob> the accomplishments -- <eob> they fade. <eob>
But the hardest nights <eol> of my life have stuck with me, <eob> impacting who I am <eob> and what I do. <eob>
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed <eol> with a rare and aggressive brain tumor. <eob>
And before that year was finished, <eob> doctors sat my husband and I down <eob> and let us know that his tumor had returned <eob> despite the most aggressive chemotherapy <eol> and radiation that they could offer him. <eob>
On that terrible night, <eob> after learning that Joel <eol> had perhaps four months to live, <eob> I cuddled up with my two older sons in bed -- <eob> they were five and three at the time -- <eob> and I never really knew how much they understood, <eob> so I started telling them a bedtime story. <eob>
I told them about this very <eol> brave knight named Joel <eob> and his adventure fighting <eol> a terrible dragon called cancer. <eob>
Every night, I told them <eol> more of the story, <eob> but I never let the story end. <eob>
I was just building up a context <eol> that they could understand <eob> and hoping that our prayers would be answered <eob> and I would never have to tell them that that knight, <eob> who had fought so bravely, <eob> was done fighting <eob> and could rest now, forever. <eob>
Fortunately, I never did have to finish <eol> that bedtime story. <eob>
My children outgrew it. <eob>
Joel responded better than anyone <eol> expected to palliative treatment, <eob> and so instead of months, <eob> we spent years learning how to love our dying <eol> child with all of our hearts. <eob>
Learning to recognize <eol> that shameful feeling <eob> of holding back just a little love <eob> to try to spare ourselves just a little pain <eob> somewhere further down the road. <eob>
We pushed past that self-preservation <eob> because Joel was worth loving <eol> even if that love could crush us. <eob>
And that lesson of intense vulnerability <eol> has changed me ... <eob> more than any award ever could. <eob>
We started living like Joel could live, <eob> and we began developing a video <eol> game called "That Dragon, Cancer." <eob> It was the story of Joel. <eob>
It was the story of hope <eol> in the shadow of death. <eob>
It was the story of faith <eob> and doubt, <eob> and the realization that a wrestle <eol> with doubt is a part of faith -- <eob> maybe the biggest part of it. <eob>
It was a story that began as a miracle <eob> and ended as a memorial. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
(Video) Dad: Bouncing around, <eol> do you like that? <eob>
I love your giggle. <eob>
When you play <eob> "That Dragon, Cancer," <eob> you're transformed into a witness <eol> of Joel's life, <eob> exploring an emotional landscape, <eob> clicking to discover <eol> more of what we as a family felt and experienced. <eob>
It feels a little bit <eol> like analyzing interactive poetry <eob> because every game mechanic <eol> is a metaphor, <eob> and so the more the player asks themselves <eob> what we as designers <eol> were trying to express and why, <eob> the richer the experience becomes. <eob>
We took that vulnerability <eol> that Joel taught us, <eob> and we encoded the game with it. <eob>
Players expect their video games <eol> to offer them branching narrative <eob> so that every decision <eol> that they make feels important <eob> and can change the outcome of the game. <eob>
We subverted that principle <eol> of game design, <eob> collapsing the choices <eol> in on the player <eob> so that they discover for themselves <eob> that there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for Joel. <eob>
And they feel that discovery <eol> as deeply and desperately as we felt it <eob> on nights when we held Joel <eol> in our arms praying for hours, <eob> stubbornly holding out hope for a grace <eol> that we could not create for ourselves. <eob>
We'd all prefer to win, <eob> but when you discover that you can't win, <eob> what do you value instead? <eob>
I never planned to write video games, <eob> but these moments <eol> that really change our lives, <eob> they often come as the result <eol> of our hardship -- and not our glory. <eob>
When we thought that Joel could live, <eob> I left the game designing to my husband. <eob>
I chimed in here and there <eob> with a scene or two and some suggestions. <eob>
But after the night that Joel died, <eob> the passion, <eob> the possibility of sharing Joel's life <eol> through our video game -- <eob> it was something <eol> that I couldn't resist. <eob>
I started writing more, <eob> I sat in on our team's design meetings, <eob> I added more ideas <eol> and I helped direct scenes. <eob>
And I discovered that creating a video <eol> game is telling a story, <eob> but with an entirely new vocabulary. <eob>
All the same elements of imagination <eol> and symbolism are there, <eob> but they're just partnered with player agency <eob> and system responsiveness. <eob>
It's challenging work. <eob>
I have to think in a totally <eol> new way to do it, <eob> but I love it. <eob>
And I wouldn't have known <eol> that without Joel. <eob>
Maybe you're a little surprised <eob> by our choice to share our story <eol> of terminal cancer through a video game. <eob>
Perhaps you're even thinking <eol> like so many people before you: <eob> cancer is not a game. <eob>
Well, tell that to any pediatric cancer parent <eob> that's ever taken <eol> an exam glove and blown it up into a balloon, <eob> or transformed a syringe <eol> into a rocket ship, <eob> or let their child ride their IV pole <eol> through the hospital halls <eob> like it was a race car. <eob>
Because when you have children, <eob> everything is a game. <eob>
And when your young child <eol> experiences something traumatic, <eob> you work even harder to make sure <eol> that their life feels like a game <eob> because children naturally explore <eol> their worlds through play. <eob>
While cancer can steal many <eol> things from a family, <eob> it shouldn't steal play. <eob>
If you're listening to me <eol> and you're trying to imagine this family <eob> that revolves entirely <eol> around a dying child, <eob> and you can't imagine joy <eol> as part of that picture, <eob> then we were right <eol> to share our story with you, <eob> because that season <eol> of our life was hard. <eob>
Unspeakably hard at times, <eob> but it was also pure hope, <eob> deep love <eob> and joy like I have never experienced since. <eob>
Our video game was our attempt <eol> to share that world <eob> with people who hadn't experienced <eol> it before, <eob> because we never could imagine <eol> that world until it became ours. <eob>
We made a video game that's hard to play. <eob>
It will never be a blockbuster. <eob>
People have to prepare themselves <eol> to invest emotionally <eob> in a story that they know <eol> will break their hearts. <eob>
But when our hearts break, <eob> they heal a little differently. <eob>
My broken heart has been healing <eol> with a new and a deeper compassion -- <eob> a desire to sit with people in their pain, <eob> to hear their stories and try to help tell them <eob> so that they know that they're seen. <eob>
On the night when <eob> "That Dragon, Cancer" <eob> won the Game for Impact Award, <eob> we cheered, <eob> we smiled and we talked about Joel <eob> and the impact he had on our life — <eob> on all of those hard <eol> and hopeful nights that we shared with him <eob> when he changed our hearts <eob> and taught us so much more about life <eol> and love and faith and purpose. <eob>
That award will never mean as much to me <eol> as even a single photograph of my son, <eob> but it does represent all of the people <eol> who his life has impacted, <eob> people I'll never meet. <eob>
They write me emails sometimes. <eob>
They tell me that they miss Joel, <eol> even though they never met him. <eob>
They describe the tears <eol> that they've shed for my son, <eob> and it makes my burden <eol> of grief just a little bit lighter <eob> knowing that it's shared <eol> with a 10-year-old <eob> watching a YouTube playthrough, <eob> or a doctor playing on his airplane <eol> with a smartphone, <eob> or a professor introducing Joel <eol> to her first-year philosophy students. <eob>
We made a video game that's hard to play. <eob>
But that feels just right to me, <eob> because the hardest <eol> moments of our lives <eob> change us more than any goal <eol> we could ever accomplish. <eob>
Tragedy has shifted my heart <eob> more than any dream <eol> I could ever see come true. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The school of architecture <eol> that I studied at some 30 years ago <eob> happened to be across the street <eol> from the wonderful art gallery <eob> designed by the great architect Louis Kahn. <eob>
I love the building, and I used <eol> to visit it quite often. <eob>
One day, <eob> I saw the security guard run <eol> his hand across the concrete wall. <eob>
And it was the way he did it, <eob> the expression on his face -- <eob> something touched me. <eob>
I could see that the security guard <eol> was moved by the building <eob> and that architecture <eol> has that capacity <eob> to move you. <eob>
I could see it, and I remember thinking, <eob> "Wow. <eob>
How does architecture do that? " <eob>
At school, I was learning to design, <eob> but here -- here was <eol> a reaction of the heart. <eob>
And it touched me to the core. <eob>
You know, you aspire for beauty, <eob> for sensuousness, <eol> for atmosphere, the emotional response. <eob>
That's the realm of the ineffable <eob> and the immeasurable. <eob>
And that's what you live for: <eob> a chance to try. <eob>
So in 2003, there was an open <eol> call for designs <eob> for the Bahá'í Temple for South America. <eob>
This was the first temple <eol> in all of South America. <eob>
It's a continental temple, <eob> a hugely important milestone <eol> for the Bahá'í community, <eob> because this would be the last <eol> of the continental temples <eob> and would open the door <eol> for national and local temples to be built <eob> around the world. <eob>
And the brief was deceptively simple <eob> and unique in the annals of religion: <eob> a circular room, nine sides, <eol> nine entrances, nine paths, <eob> allowing you to come to the temple <eol> from all directions, <eob> nine symbolizing completeness, <eob> perfection. <eob>
No pulpit, no sermons, <eob> as there are no clergy <eol> in the Bahá'í faith. <eob>
And in a world which is putting up walls, <eob> the design needed to express in form <eob> the very opposite. <eob>
It had to be open, welcoming <eob> to people of all faiths, walks of life, backgrounds, <eob> or no faith at all; <eob> a new form of sacred space <eob> with no pattern <eob> or models to draw from. <eob>
It was like designing one of the first <eol> churches for Christianity <eob> or one of the first mosques for Islam. <eob>
So we live in a secular world. <eob>
How do you design sacred space today? <eob>
And how do you even define <eol> what's sacred today? <eob>
I stumbled across this beautiful <eol> quote from the Bahá'í writings, <eob> and it speaks to prayer. <eob>
It says that if you reach out in prayer, <eob> and if your prayer is answered -- <eol> which is already very interesting -- <eob> that the pillars of your heart <eol> will become ashine. <eob>
And I loved this idea <eol> of the inner and the outer, <eob> like when you see someone and you say, <eol> "That person is radiant." <eob> And I was thinking, "My gosh, <eol> how could we make something <eob> architectural out of that, <eob> where you create a building <eob> and it becomes alive with light? <eob>
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light, <eol> it becomes alive. <eob>
And I drew this sketch, <eob> something with two layers, translucent <eob> with structure in between capturing light. <eob>
Maybe a pure form, a single <eol> form of emanation <eob> that you could imagine <eob> would be all dome <eob> and everything we kept making was <eol> looking too much like an egg. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A blob. <eob>
So you search. <eob> You all know this crazy search, <eol> letting the process take you, <eob> and you live for the surprises. <eob>
And I remember quite by accident <eob> I saw this little video <eol> of a plant moving in light, <eob> and it made me think of movement, <eob> reach, <eob> this idea that the temple <eol> could have reach, <eob> like this reach for the divine. <eob>
You can imagine also <eob> that movement within a circle <eol> could mean movement and stillness, <eob> like the cosmos, <eob> something you see in many places. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But rotation was not enough, <eob> because we needed a form. <eob>
In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about <eob> the temples being as perfect <eol> as is humanly possible, <eob> and we kept thinking, well, what is perfection? <eob>
And I remember I stumbled <eol> into this image of this Japanese basket <eob> and thinking our Western notions <eol> of perfection need to be challenged, <eob> that this wonderful silhouette <eol> of this basket, this wonkiness, <eob> and that it has the kind of dimple of what you might imagine a shoulder <eob> or the cheekbone, <eob> and that kind of organic form. <eob>
And so we drew and made models, <eob> these lines that merge at the top, <eob> soft lines, <eob> which became like drapery <eob> and translucent veils and folding, <eob> and the idea of not only folding <eol> but torquing -- <eob> you remember the plant and the way <eol> it was reaching. <eob>
And this started to become <eol> an interesting form, <eob> carving the base, <eol> making the entrances. <eob>
And then we ended up with this. <eob> This is this temple with two layers, <eob> nine luminous veils, <eob> embodied light, <eob> soft-flowing lines <eob> like luminescent drapery. <eob>
180 submissions were received <eol> from 80 countries, <eob> and this was selected. <eob>
So we went to the next stage <eol> of how to build it. <eob>
We had submitted alabaster. <eob> But alabaster was too soft, <eob> and we were experimenting, many experiments <eol> with materials, <eob> trying to think how we could have <eol> this kind of shimmer, <eob> and we ended up with borosilicate. <eob>
And borosilicate glass, <eol> as you know, is very strong, <eob> and if you break borosilicate <eol> rods just so and melt them <eob> at just the right temperature, <eob> we ended up with this new material, <eob> this new cast glass which took us about two years to make. <eob>
And it had this quality that we loved, <eob> this idea of the <eob> embodied light, <eob> but on the inside, we wanted <eol> something with a soft light, <eob> like the inner lining of a jacket. <eob>
On the outside you have protection, <eol> but on the inside you touch it. <eob>
So we found this tiny vein <eol> in a huge quarry in Portugal <eob> with this beautiful stone, <eob> which the owner had kept <eol> for seven generations in his family, <eob> waiting for the right project, <eol> if you can believe it. <eob>
Look at this material, it's beautiful. <eob>
And the way it lights up; <eol> it has that translucent quality. <eob>
So here you see the structure. <eob>
It lets the light through. <eob>
And looking down, <eob> the nine wings are bound, <eob> structurally but symbolically strong, <eob> a great symbol of unity: <eob> pure geometry, a perfect circle, <eob> 30 meters in section and in plan, <eob> perfectly symmetrical, <eob> like the idea of sacredness and geometry. <eob>
And here you see the building <eol> going up, <eob> 2,000 steel nodes, <eob> 9,000 pieces of steel, <eob> 7,800 stone pieces, <eob> 10,000 cast glass pieces, all individual shapes, <eob> the entire superstructure all described, <eob> engineered, fabricated with aerospace technology, <eob> prefabricated machine to machine, <eob> robotically, <eob> a huge team effort, you can imagine, <eob> of literally hundreds, <eob> and within three percent of our $30 million budget <eob> set in 2006. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Nine wings bound together <eob> forming a nine-pointed star, <eob> and the star shape moving in space, <eob> tracking the sun. <eob>
So here it is. <eob>
Audience: Wow! <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hopefully, a befitting response <eol> to that beautiful quote, <eob> "a prayer answered," <eob> open in all directions, <eob> capturing the blue light of dawn, <eob> tent-like white light of day, <eob> the gold light of the afternoon, <eob> and of course, at night, the reversal: <eob> sensuous, <eob> catching the light in all kinds <eol> of mysterious ways. <eob>
And the site: it's interesting; 14 years ago <eol> when we made the submission, <eob> we showed the temple <eol> set against the Andes. <eob>
We didn't have the Andes as our site, <eob> but after nine years, <eol> that's exactly where we ended up, <eob> the lines of the temple set <eol> against nothing but pure nature, <eob> and you turn around and you get nothing <eol> but the city below you, <eob> and inside, a view in all directions, <eob> radiating gardens <eob> from each of the alcoves, <eob> radiating paths. <eob>
Last October, the opening ceremonies -- <eob> a beautiful, sacred event, <eob> 5,000 people from 80 countries, <eob> a continuous river of visitors, <eob> indigenous people from all over South America, <eob> some who had never left their villages. <eob>
And of course, that this temple belongs to people, <eob> the collective, of many cultures <eol> and walks of life, <eob> many beliefs, <eob> and for me, what's most important <eol> is what it feels like on the inside; <eob> that it feel intimate, <eob> sacred, <eob> and that everyone is welcome. <eob>
And if even a few who come <eob> have the same reaction <eol> as that security guard, <eob> then it truly would be their temple. <eob>
And I would love that. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I would like to tell you <eol> about the most embarrassing thing <eob> that has ever happened to me <eol> in my years of working as a palliative care physician. <eob>
This happened a couple of years ago. <eob>
I was asked as a consultant <eol> to see a woman in her 70s -- <eob> retired English professor <eol> who had pancreatic cancer. <eob>
I was asked to see her <eol> because she had pain, nausea, vomiting ... <eob> When I went to see her, <eol> we talked about those symptoms <eob> and in the course of that consultation, <eob> she asked me whether I thought <eol> that medical marijuana might help her. <eob>
I thought back to everything <eob> that I had learned in medical school <eol> about medical marijuana, <eob> which didn't take very long <eol> because I had learned absolutely nothing. <eob>
And so I told her <eol> that as far as I knew, <eob> medical marijuana <eol> had no benefits whatsoever. <eob>
And she smiled and nodded <eol> and reached into the handbag next to the bed, <eob> and pulled out a stack <eol> of about a dozen randomized controlled trials <eob> showing that medical marijuana <eol> has benefits <eob> for symptoms like nausea <eol> and pain and anxiety. <eob>
She handed me those articles and said, <eob> "Maybe you should read <eol> these before offering an opinion ... <eob> doctor." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I did. <eob> That night I read all of those articles <eol> and found a bunch more. <eob>
When I came to see her the next morning, <eob> I had to admit that it looks <eol> like there is some evidence <eob> that marijuana <eol> can offer medical benefits <eob> and I suggested that if she really <eol> was interested, <eob> she should try it. <eob>
You know what she said? <eob>
This 73-year-old, <eol> retired English professor? <eob>
She said, "I did try it <eol> about six months ago. <eob> It was amazing. <eob> I've been using it every day since. <eob>
It's the best drug I've discovered. <eob>
I don't know why it took me 73 years <eol> to discover this stuff. It's amazing." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That was the moment at which I realized <eob> I needed to learn something <eol> about medical marijuana <eob> because what I was prepared for in medical school <eob> bore no relationship to reality. <eob>
So I started reading more articles, <eol> I started talking to researchers, <eob> I started talking to doctors, <eob> and most importantly, I started <eol> listening to patients. <eob>
I ended up writing a book <eol> based on those conversations, <eob> and that book really revolved <eol> around three surprises -- <eob> surprises to me, anyway. <eob>
One I already alluded to -- <eob> that there really are some benefits <eol> to medical marijuana. <eob>
Those benefits may not be <eol> as huge or as stunning <eob> as some of the most avid proponents <eol> of medical marijuana <eob> would have us believe, <eob> but they are real. <eob>
Surprise number two: <eob> medical marijuana does have some risks. <eob>
Those risks may not be <eol> as huge and as scary <eob> as some of the opponents <eol> of medical marijuana <eob> would have us believe, <eob> but they are real <eob> risks, nonetheless. <eob>
But it was the third surprise <eol> that was most ... <eob> surprising. <eob>
And that is that a lot <eol> of the patients I talked with <eob> who've turned to medical <eol> marijuana for help, <eob> weren't turning to medical <eol> marijuana because of its benefits <eob> or the balance <eol> of risks and benefits, <eob> or because they thought it was a wonder drug, <eob> but because it gave them control over their illness. <eob>
It let them manage their health <eob> in a way that was productive and efficient <eob> and effective and comfortable for them. <eob>
To show you what I mean, let me <eol> tell you about another patient. <eob>
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her. <eob>
She looked though like <eol> she was in her late 60s. <eob>
She had suffered from rheumatoid <eol> arthritis for the last 20 years, <eob> her hands were gnarled by arthritis, <eob> her spine was crooked, <eob> she had to rely on a wheelchair <eol> to get around. <eob>
She looked weak and frail, <eob> and I guess physically she probably was, <eob> but emotionally, cognitively, psychologically, <eob> she was among the toughest people <eol> I've ever met. <eob>
And when I sat down next to her <eob> in a medical marijuana <eol> dispensary in Northern California <eob> to ask her about why she turned <eol> to medical marijuana, <eob> what it did for her and how it helped her, <eob> she started out by telling me things <eob> that I had heard from many patients before. <eob>
It helped with her anxiety; <eob> it helped with her pain; <eob> when her pain was better, she slept better. <eob>
And I'd heard all that before. <eob>
But then she said something <eol> that I'd never heard before, <eob> and that is that it gave her <eol> control over her life <eob> and over her health. <eob>
She could use it when she wanted, <eob> in the way that she wanted, <eob> at the dose and frequency <eol> that worked for her. <eob>
And if it didn't work for her, <eol> then she could make changes. <eob>
Everything was up to her. <eob>
The most important thing she said <eob> was she didn't need anybody <eol> else's permission -- <eob> not a clinic appointment, <eol> not a doctor's prescription, <eob> not a pharmacist's order. <eob>
It was all up to her. <eob>
She was in control. <eob>
And if that seems like a little thing <eol> for somebody with chronic illness, <eob> it's not -- not at all. <eob>
When we face a chronic serious illness, <eob> whether it's rheumatoid <eol> arthritis or lupus or cancer or diabetes, <eob> or cirrhosis, <eob> we lose control. <eob>
And note what I said: "when," not "if." <eob> All of us at some point in our lives <eol> will face a chronic serious illness <eob> that causes us to lose control. <eob>
We'll see our function decline, <eol> some of us will see our cognition decline, <eob> we'll be no longer able to care for ourselves, <eob> to do the things that we want to do. <eob>
Our bodies will betray us, <eob> and in that process, we'll lose control. <eob>
And that's scary. <eob>
Not just scary -- that's frightening, <eob> it's terrifying. <eob>
When I talk to my patients, <eol> my palliative care patients, <eob> many of whom are facing illnesses <eol> that will end their lives, <eob> they have a lot of be frightened of -- <eob> pain, nausea, vomiting, <eol> constipation, fatigue, <eob> their impending mortality. <eob>
But what scares them more <eol> than anything else <eob> is this possibility that at some point, <eob> tomorrow or a month from now, <eob> they're going to lose control <eol> of their health, <eob> of their lives, <eob> of their healthcare, <eob> and they're going to become dependent on others, <eob> and that's terrifying. <eob>
So it's no wonder really <eol> that patients like Robin, <eob> who I just told you about, <eob> who I met in that clinic, <eob> turn to medical marijuana <eob> to try to claw back <eol> some semblance of control. <eob> How do they do it though? <eob> How do these medical marijuana dispensaries -- <eob> like the one where I met Robin -- <eob> how do they give patients <eol> like Robin back the sort of control that they need? <eob>
And how do they do it <eob> in a way that mainstream <eol> medical hospitals and clinics, <eob> at least for Robin, weren't able to? <eob>
What's their secret? <eob>
So I decided to find out. <eob>
I went to a seedy clinic in Venice Beach in California <eob> and got a recommendation <eob> that would allow me to be a medical <eol> marijuana patient. <eob> I got a letter of recommendation <eol> that would let me buy medical marijuana. <eob>
I got that recommendation illegally, <eob> because I'm not a resident <eol> of California -- <eob> I should note that. <eob>
I should also note, for the record, <eob> that I never used that letter <eol> of recommendation to make a purchase, <eob> and to all of you DEA agents out there -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
love the work that you're doing, <eob> keep it up. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Even though it didn't let me <eol> make a purchase though, <eob> that letter was priceless <eol> because it let me be a patient. <eob>
It let me experience what patients <eol> like Robin experience <eob> when they go to a medical <eol> marijuana dispensary. <eob>
And what I experienced — <eob> what they experience every day, <eob> hundreds of thousands <eol> of people like Robin — <eob> was really amazing. <eob>
I walked into the clinic, <eob> and from the moment that I entered <eol> many of these clinics and dispensaries, <eob> I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, <eob> was there for me. <eob>
There were questions at the outset <eol> about who I am, <eob> what kind of work I do, <eob> what my goals are in looking <eol> for a medical marijuana prescription, <eob> or product, <eob> what my goals are, <eol> what my preferences are, <eob> what my hopes are, <eob> how do I think, how do I hope this might help me, <eob> what am I afraid of. <eob>
These are the sorts of questions <eob> that patients like Robin get <eol> asked all the time. <eob>
These are the sorts of questions <eob> that make me confident <eob> that the person I'm talking with really <eol> has my best interests at heart <eob> and wants to get to know me. <eob>
The second thing I learned <eol> in those clinics <eob> is the availability of education. <eob>
Education from the folks behind the counter, <eob> but also education from folks <eol> in the waiting room. <eob>
People I met were more than happy, <eol> as I was sitting next to them -- <eob> people like Robin -- <eob> to tell me about who they are, <eol> why they use medical marijuana, <eob> what helps them, how it helps them, <eob> and to give me advice and suggestions. <eob>
Those waiting rooms really are a hive <eol> of interaction, advice and support. <eob>
And third, the folks behind the counter. <eob>
I was amazed at how willing <eol> those people were <eob> to spend sometimes an hour <eol> or more talking me through the nuances <eob> of this strain versus that strain, <eob> smoking versus vaporizing, <eob> edibles versus tinctures -- <eob> all, remember, without me making <eol> any purchase whatsoever. <eob>
Think about the last time <eol> you went to any hospital or clinic <eob> and the last time anybody spent an hour <eol> explaining those sorts of things to you. <eob>
The fact that patients like Robin <eol> are going to these clinics, <eob> are going to these dispensaries <eob> and getting that sort of personalized attention <eob> and education and service, <eob> really should be a wake-up call <eol> to the healthcare system. <eob>
People like Robin are turning away <eol> from mainstream medicine, <eob> turning to medical <eol> marijuana dispensaries <eob> because those dispensaries <eol> are giving them what they need. <eob>
If that's a wake-up call <eol> to the medical establishment, <eob> it's a wake-up call that many of my colleagues <eol> are either not hearing <eob> or not wanting to hear. <eob>
When I talk to my colleagues, physicians <eol> in particular, <eob> about medical marijuana, <eob> they say, "Oh, we need more evidence. <eob>
We need more research into benefits, <eol> we need more evidence about risks." <eob> And you know what? They're right. <eob> They're absolutely right. <eob>
We do need much more evidence about the benefits <eol> of medical marijuana. <eob>
We also need to ask the federal government <eol> to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, <eob> or to deschedule it entirely <eol> to make that research possible. <eob>
We also need more research <eol> into medical marijuana's risks. <eob>
Medical marijuana's risks -- <eob> we know a lot about the risks <eol> of recreational use, <eob> we know next to nothing about the risks <eol> of medical marijuana. <eob>
So we absolutely do need research, <eob> but to say that we need research <eob> and not that we need to make <eol> any changes now <eob> is to miss the point entirely. <eob>
People like Robin aren't seeking out medical <eol> marijuana <eob> because they think <eol> it's a wonder drug, <eob> or because they think <eol> it's entirely risk-free. <eob>
They seek it out because the context <eol> in which it's delivered and administered <eob> and used, <eob> gives them the sort of control <eol> they need over their lives. <eob>
And that's a wake-up call <eol> we really need to pay attention to. <eob>
The good news though is that <eol> there are lessons we can learn today <eob> from those medical marijuana dispensaries. <eob>
And those are lessons <eol> we really should learn. <eob>
These are often small, <eol> mom-and-pop operations <eob> run by people with no medical training. <eob>
And while it's embarrassing to think <eob> that many of these clinics <eol> and dispensaries are providing services <eob> and support and meeting patients' needs <eob> in ways that billion-dollar <eol> healthcare systems aren't -- <eob> we should be embarrassed by that -- <eob> but we can also learn from that. <eob>
And there are probably <eol> three lessons at least <eob> that we can learn from those small dispensaries. <eob>
One: we need to find ways <eol> to give patients more control <eob> in small but important ways. <eob>
How to interact with healthcare providers, <eob> when to interact <eol> with healthcare providers, <eob> how to use medications in ways <eol> that work for them. <eob>
In my own practice, <eob> I've gotten much more creative <eol> and flexible <eob> in supporting my patients <eol> in using drugs safely <eob> to manage their symptoms -- <eob> with the emphasis on safely. <eob>
Many of the drugs I prescribe <eol> are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines <eob> which can be dangerous if overused. <eob>
But here's the point. <eob> They can be dangerous <eol> if they're overused, <eob> but they can also be ineffective <eol> if they're not used in a way <eob> that's consistent with what patients <eol> want and need. <eob>
So that flexibility, <eol> if it's delivered safely, <eob> can be extraordinarily valuable <eol> for patients and their families. <eob>
That's number one. <eob>
Number two: education. <eob> Huge opportunities <eob> to learn from some of the tricks <eol> of those medical marijuana dispensaries <eob> to provide more education <eob> that doesn't require a lot of physician time necessarily, <eob> or any physician time, <eob> but opportunities to learn about what medications <eol> we're using <eob> and why, <eob> prognoses, trajectories of illness, <eob> and most importantly, <eob> opportunities for patients to learn from each other. <eob>
How can we replicate what goes on <eob> in those clinic and medical <eol> dispensary waiting rooms? <eob>
How patients learn from each other, <eol> how people share with each other. <eob>
And last but not least, <eob> putting patients first the way <eol> those medical marijuana dispensaries do, <eob> making patients feel legitimately <eol> like what they want, <eob> what they need, <eob> is why, as healthcare providers, <eob> we're here. <eob>
Asking patients about their hopes, <eol> their fears, their goals and preferences. <eob>
As a palliative care provider, <eob> I ask all my patients what they're hoping <eol> for and what they're afraid of. <eob> But here's the thing. <eob> Patients shouldn't <eob> have to wait <eol> until they're chronically seriously ill, <eob> often near the end of life, <eob> they shouldn't <eob> have to wait <eol> until they're seeing a physician like me <eob> before somebody asks them, <eob> "What are you hoping <eol> for?" <eob> "What are you afraid of?" <eob> That should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered. <eob>
We can do this -- <eob> we really can. <eob>
Medical marijuana dispensaries <eol> and clinics all across the country <eob> are figuring this out. <eob>
They're figuring this out <eob> in ways that larger, more mainstream <eol> health systems are years behind. <eob>
But we can learn from them, <eob> and we have to learn from them. <eob>
All we have to do is swallow our pride -- <eob> put aside the thought for a minute <eob> that because we have lots of letters after our name, <eob> because we're experts, <eob> because we're chief medical officers <eol> of a large healthcare system, <eob> we know all there is to know <eol> about how to meet patients' needs. <eob>
We need to swallow our pride. <eob>
We need to go visit <eol> a few medical marijuana dispensaries. <eob>
We need to figure out what they're doing. <eob>
We need to figure out why <eol> so many patients like Robin <eob> are leaving our mainstream medical clinics <eob> and going to these medical marijuana <eol> dispensaries instead. <eob>
We need to figure out <eol> what their tricks are, <eob> what their tools are, <eob> and we need to learn from them. <eob>
If we do, <eob> and I think we can, and I absolutely think <eol> we have to, <eob> we can guarantee all of our patients <eol> will have a much better experience. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Space, the final frontier. <eob>
I first heard these words <eol> when I was just six years old, <eob> and I was completely inspired. <eob>
I wanted to explore strange new worlds. <eob>
I wanted to seek out new life. <eob>
I wanted to see everything <eol> that the universe had to offer. <eob>
And those dreams, those words, <eol> they took me on a journey, <eob> a journey of discovery, <eob> through school, through university, <eob> to do a PhD and finally to become <eol> a professional astronomer. <eob>
Now, I learned two amazing things, <eob> one slightly unfortunate, <eob> when I was doing my PhD. <eob>
I learned that the reality was <eob> I wouldn't be piloting <eol> a starship anytime soon. <eob>
But I also learned that the universe <eol> is strange, wonderful and vast, <eob> actually too vast to be explored <eol> by spaceship. <eob>
And so I turned my attention to astronomy, <eol> to using telescopes. <eob>
Now, I show you before you <eol> an image of the night sky. <eob>
You might see it anywhere in the world. <eob>
And all of these stars are part <eol> of our local galaxy, the Milky Way. <eob>
Now, if you were to go <eol> to a darker part of the sky, <eob> a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert, <eob> you might see the center of our Milky Way galaxy <eob> spread out before you, hundreds of billions <eol> of stars. <eob>
And it's a very beautiful image. <eob> It's colorful. <eob> And again, this is just a local corner <eol> of our universe. <eob>
You can see there's a sort <eol> of strange dark dust across it. <eob>
Now, that is local dust <eob> that's obscuring the light of the stars. <eob>
But we can do a pretty good job. <eob>
Just with our own eyes, we can explore <eol> our little corner of the universe. <eob>
It's possible to do better. <eob>
You can use wonderful telescopes <eol> like the Hubble Space Telescope. <eob>
Now, astronomers have put <eol> together this image. <eob>
It's called the Hubble Deep Field, <eob> and they've spent hundreds of hours <eol> observing just a tiny patch of the sky <eob> no larger than your thumbnail <eol> held at arm's length. <eob>
And in this image <eob> you can see thousands of galaxies, <eob> and we know that there must be hundreds <eol> of millions, billions of galaxies <eob> in the entire universe, <eob> some like our own and some very different. <eob>
So you think, OK, well, <eol> I can continue this journey. <eob> This is easy. I can just use <eol> a very powerful telescope <eob> and just look at the sky, no problem. <eob>
It's actually really missing out <eol> if we just do that. <eob>
Now, that's because everything <eol> I've talked about so far <eob> is just using the visible spectrum, <eol> just the thing that your eyes can see, <eob> and that's a tiny slice, <eob> a tiny, tiny slice <eol> of what the universe has to offer us. <eob>
Now, there's also two very important <eol> problems with using visible light. <eob>
Not only are we missing out <eol> on all the other processes <eob> that are emitting other kinds of light, <eob> but there's two issues. <eob>
Now, the first is that dust <eol> that I mentioned earlier. <eob>
The dust stops the visible light <eol> from getting to us. <eob>
So as we look deeper into the universe, <eol> we see less light. <eob>
The dust stops it getting to us. <eob>
But there's a really strange problem <eol> with using visible light <eob> in order to try and explore the universe. <eob>
Now take a break for a minute. <eob> Say you're standing on a corner, <eol> a busy street corner. <eob>
There's cars going by. <eob> An ambulance approaches. <eob> It has a high-pitched siren. <eob>
(Imitates a siren passing by) <eob>
The siren appeared to change in pitch <eob> as it moved towards and away from you. <eob>
The ambulance driver did not change <eol> the siren just to mess with you. <eob>
That was a product of your perception. <eob>
The sound waves, as the ambulance approached, <eob> were compressed, <eob> and they changed higher in pitch. <eob>
As the ambulance receded, <eol> the sound waves were stretched, <eob> and they sounded lower in pitch. <eob>
The same thing happens with light. <eob>
Objects moving towards us, <eob> their light waves are compressed <eol> and they appear bluer. <eob>
Objects moving away from us, <eob> their light waves are stretched, <eol> and they appear redder. <eob>
So we call these effects blueshift <eol> and redshift. <eob>
Now, our universe is expanding, <eob> so everything is moving away <eol> from everything else, <eob> and that means everything appears <eol> to be red. <eob>
And oddly enough, as you look <eol> more deeply into the universe, <eob> more distant objects are moving <eol> away further and faster, <eob> so they appear more red. <eob>
So if I come back <eol> to the Hubble Deep Field <eob> and we were to continue <eol> to peer deeply into the universe <eob> just using the Hubble, <eob> as we get to a certain distance away, <eob> everything becomes red, <eob> and that presents something of a problem. <eob>
Eventually, we get so far away <eob> everything is shifted into the infrared <eob> and we can't see anything at all. <eob>
So there must be a way around this. <eob>
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey. <eob>
I wanted to explore the whole universe, <eob> not just whatever I can see, <eol> you know, before the redshift kicks in. <eob>
There is a technique. <eob>
It's called radio astronomy. <eob>
Astronomers have been <eol> using this for decades. <eob>
It's a fantastic technique. <eob>
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope, <eol> affectionately known as "The Dish." <eob> You may have seen the movie. <eob>
And radio is really brilliant. <eob>
It allows us to peer much more deeply. <eob>
It doesn't get stopped by dust, <eob> so you can see everything <eol> in the universe, <eob> and redshift is less of a problem <eob> because we can build receivers <eol> that receive across a large band. <eob>
So what does Parkes see <eol> when we turn it to the center of the Milky Way? <eob>
We should see something fantastic, right? <eob>
Well, we do see something interesting. <eob>
All that dust has gone. <eob>
As I mentioned, radio goes straight <eol> through dust, so not a problem. <eob>
But the view is very different. <eob>
We can see that the center <eol> of the Milky Way is aglow, <eob> and this isn't starlight. <eob>
This is a light called synchrotron radiation, <eob> and it's formed from electrons spiraling <eol> around cosmic magnetic fields. <eob>
So the plane is aglow with this light. <eob>
And we can also see strange tufts <eol> coming off of it, <eob> and objects which don't appear <eol> to line up <eob> with anything that we can see <eol> with our own eyes. <eob>
But it's hard <eol> to really interpret this image, <eob> because as you can see, <eol> it's very low resolution. <eob>
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long, <eob> and that makes their resolution poorer. <eob>
This image is also black and white, <eob> so we don't really know what is the color <eol> of everything in here. <eob> Well, fast-forward to today. <eob>
We can build telescopes <eob> which can get over these problems. <eob>
Now, I'm showing you here an image <eol> of the Murchison Radio Observatory, <eob> a fantastic place <eol> to build radio telescopes. <eob>
It's flat, it's dry, <eob> and most importantly, <eol> it's radio quiet: <eob> no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing, <eob> just very, very radio quiet, <eob> so a perfect place to build <eol> a radio telescope. <eob>
Now, the telescope that I've been working <eol> on for a few years <eob> is called the Murchison Widefield Array, <eob> and I'm going to show you a little time lapse <eol> of it being built. <eob>
This is a group of undergraduate <eol> and postgraduate students <eob> located in Perth. <eob>
We call them the Student Army, <eob> and they volunteered their time <eol> to build a radio telescope. <eob>
There's no course credit for this. <eob>
And they're putting together <eol> these radio dipoles. <eob>
They just receive at low frequencies, <eol> a bit like your FM radio or your TV. <eob>
And here we are deploying them <eol> across the desert. <eob>
The final telescope covers 10 square kilometers <eob> of the Western Australian desert. <eob>
And the interesting thing is, <eol> there's no moving parts. <eob>
We just deploy these little antennas <eob> essentially on chicken mesh. <eob>
It's fairly cheap. <eob>
Cables take the signals <eob> from the antennas <eob> and bring them to central processing units. <eob>
And it's the size of this telescope, <eob> the fact that we've built it <eol> over the entire desert <eob> that gives us a better resolution <eol> than Parkes. <eob>
Now, eventually all those cables <eol> bring them to a unit <eob> which sends it off to a supercomputer here in Perth, <eob> and that's where I come in. <eob>
(Sighs) <eob>
Radio data. <eob> I have spent the last five years <eob> working with very difficult, <eol> very interesting data <eob> that no one had really looked at before. <eob>
I've spent a long time calibrating it, <eob> running millions of CPU hours on supercomputers <eob> and really trying to understand that data. <eob>
And with this telescope, <eob> with this data, <eob> we've performed a survey <eol> of the entire southern sky, <eob> the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey, <eob> or GLEAM, as I call it. <eob>
And I'm very excited. <eob>
This survey is just about to be published, <eol> but it hasn't been shown yet, <eob> so you are literally <eol> the first people <eob> to see this southern survey <eol> of the entire sky. <eob>
So I'm delighted to share <eol> with you some images from this survey. <eob>
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison, <eob> you camped out underneath the stars <eob> and you looked towards the south. <eob>
You saw the south's celestial pole, <eob> the galaxy rising. <eob>
If I fade in the radio light, <eob> this is what we observe with our survey. <eob>
You can see that the galactic plane <eol> is no longer dark with dust. <eob> It's alight with synchrotron radiation, <eob> and thousands of dots are in the sky. <eob>
Our large Magellanic Cloud, <eol> our nearest galactic neighbor, <eob> is orange instead of its more <eol> familiar blue-white. <eob>
So there's a lot going on in this. <eob>
Let's take a closer look. <eob> If we look back <eol> towards the galactic center, <eob> where we originally saw the Parkes image <eol> that I showed you earlier, <eob> low resolution, black and white, <eob> and we fade to the GLEAM view, <eob> you can see the resolution <eol> has gone up by a factor of a hundred. <eob>
We now have a color view of the sky, <eob> a technicolor view. <eob>
Now, it's not a false color view. <eob>
These are real radio colors. <eob>
What I've done is I've colored <eol> the lowest frequencies red <eob> and the highest frequencies blue, <eob> and the middle ones green. <eob>
And that gives us this rainbow view. <eob>
And this isn't just false color. <eob>
The colors in this image tell us <eol> about the physical processes <eob> going on in the universe. <eob>
So for instance, if you look along <eol> the plane of the galaxy, <eob> it's alight with synchrotron, <eob> which is mostly reddish orange, <eob> but if we look very closely, <eol> we see little blue dots. <eob>
Now, if we zoom in, <eob> these blue dots are ionized plasma <eob> around very bright stars, <eob> and what happens is that <eol> they block the red light, <eob> so they appear blue. <eob>
And these can tell us <eol> about these star-forming regions <eob> in our galaxy. <eob>
And we just see them immediately. <eob>
We look at the galaxy, and the color <eol> tells us that they're there. <eob>
You can see little soap bubbles, <eob> little circular images <eol> around the galactic plane, <eob> and these are supernova remnants. <eob>
When a star explodes, <eob> its outer shell <eol> is cast off <eob> and it travels outward <eol> into space gathering up material, <eob> and it produces a little shell. <eob>
It's been a long-standing mystery <eol> to astronomers <eob> where all the supernova <eol> remnants are. <eob>
We know that there must be <eol> a lot of high-energy electrons in the plane <eob> to produce the synchrotron radiation <eol> that we see, <eob> and we think they're produced <eol> by supernova remnants, <eob> but there don't seem to be enough. <eob>
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really good <eol> at detecting supernova remnants, <eob> so we're hoping to have <eol> a new paper out on that soon. <eob> Now, that's fine. <eob>
We've explored our little local universe, <eob> but I wanted to go deeper, <eol> I wanted to go further. <eob>
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way. <eob>
Well, as it happens, we can see <eol> a very interesting object in the top right, <eob> and this is a local radio galaxy, <eob> Centaurus A. <eob> If we zoom in on this, <eob> we can see that there are two huge plumes <eol> going out into space. <eob>
And if you look right in the center <eol> between those two plumes, <eob> you'll see a galaxy <eol> just like our own. <eob>
It's a spiral. <eob>
It has a dust lane. <eob>
It's a normal galaxy. <eob>
But these jets <eol> are only visible in the radio. <eob>
If we looked in the visible, we wouldn't even know <eol> they were there, <eob> and they're thousands of times <eol> larger than the host galaxy. <eob>
What's going on? <eol> What's producing these jets? <eob>
At the center of every galaxy <eol> that we know about <eob> is a supermassive black hole. <eob>
Now, black holes are invisible. <eob>
That's why they're called that. <eob> All you can see <eol> is the deflection of the light around them, <eob> and occasionally, when a star <eol> or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit, <eob> it is ripped apart by tidal forces, <eob> forming what we call an accretion disk. <eob>
The accretion disk glows <eol> brightly in the x-rays, <eob> and huge magnetic fields <eol> can launch the material into space <eob> at nearly the speed of light. <eob>
So these jets are visible in the radio <eob> and this is what we pick up in our survey. <eob>
Well, very well, so we've seen one radio <eol> galaxy. That's nice. <eob> But if you just look at the top of that image, <eob> you'll see another radio <eol> galaxy. <eob>
It's a little bit smaller, <eol> and that's just because it's further away. <eob> OK. Two radio galaxies. <eob> We can see this. This is fine. <eob> Well, what about all the other dots? <eob>
Presumably those are just stars. <eob> They're not. <eob> They're all radio galaxies. <eob>
Every single one of the dots <eol> in this image <eob> is a distant galaxy, <eob> millions to billions of light-years away <eob> with a supermassive black hole <eol> at its center <eob> pushing material into space <eob> at nearly the speed of light. <eob> It is mind-blowing. <eob> And this survey is even larger <eol> than what I've shown here. <eob>
If we zoom out <eol> to the full extent of the survey, <eob> you can see I found 300,000 <eol> of these radio galaxies. <eob>
So it's truly an epic journey. <eob>
We've discovered all of these galaxies <eob> right back to the very <eol> first supermassive black holes. <eob>
I'm very proud of this, <eol> and it will be published next week. <eob>
Now, that's not all. <eob>
I've explored the furthest reaches <eol> of the galaxy with this survey, <eob> but there's something even more in this image. <eob>
Now, I'll take you right back <eol> to the dawn of time. <eob>
When the universe formed, it was a big bang, <eob> which left the universe <eol> as a sea of hydrogen, <eob> neutral hydrogen. <eob>
And when the very first stars <eol> and galaxies switched on, <eob> they ionized that hydrogen. <eob>
So the universe went from neutral to ionized. <eob>
That imprinted a signal all around us. <eob>
Everywhere, it pervades us, <eob> like the Force. <eob>
Now, because that happened so long ago, <eob> the signal was redshifted, <eob> so now that signal is at <eol> very low frequencies. <eob>
It's at the same frequency as my survey, <eob> but it's so faint. <eob>
It's a billionth the size <eol> of any of the objects in my survey. <eob>
So our telescope may not be quite sensitive <eol> enough to pick up this signal. <eob>
However, there's a new radio telescope. <eob>
So I can't have a starship, <eob> but I can hopefully have <eob> one of the biggest <eol> radio telescopes in the world. <eob>
We're building the Square Kilometre Array, <eol> a new radio telescope, <eob> and it's going to be a thousand times <eol> bigger than the MWA, <eob> a thousand times more sensitive, <eol> and have an even better resolution. <eob>
So we should find tens <eol> of millions of galaxies. <eob>
And perhaps, deep in that signal, <eob> I will get to look upon <eol> the very first stars and galaxies switching on, <eob> the beginning of time itself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to tell you a story about a girl. <eob>
But I can't tell you her real name. <eob> So let's just call her Hadiza. <eob>
Hadiza is 20. <eob> She's shy, <eob> but she has a beautiful smile <eol> that lights up her face. <eob>
But she's in constant pain. <eob>
And she will likely be on medication <eol> for the rest of her life. <eob>
Do you want to know why? <eob> Hadiza is a Chibok girl, <eob> and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped <eob> by Boko Haram terrorists. <eob>
She managed to escape, though, <eob> by jumping off the truck <eol> that was carrying the girls. <eob>
But when she landed, <eol> she broke both her legs, <eob> and she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes. <eob>
She told me she was terrified <eol> that Boko Haram would come back for her. <eob>
She was one of 57 girls who would escape <eol> by jumping off trucks that day. <eob>
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples <eob> around the world. <eob>
People like Michelle Obama, Malala and others <eob> lent their voices in protest, <eob> and at about the same time -- <eol> I was living in London at the time -- <eob> I was sent from London to Abuja <eol> to cover the World Economic Forum <eob> that Nigeria was hosting <eol> for the first time. <eob>
But when we arrived, it was clear <eol> that there was only one story in town. <eob>
We put the government under pressure. <eob> We asked tough questions <eol> about what they were doing <eob> to bring these girls back. <eob>
Understandably, <eob> they weren't too happy <eol> with our line of questioning, <eob> and let's just say we received <eol> our fair share of "alternative facts." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Influential Nigerians <eol> were telling us at the time <eob> that we were naïve, <eob> we didn't understand <eol> the political situation in Nigeria. <eob>
But they also told us <eob> that the story of the Chibok girls <eob> was a hoax. <eob>
Sadly, this hoax narrative <eol> has persisted, <eob> and there are still people in Nigeria today <eob> who believe that the Chibok girls <eol> were never kidnapped. <eob>
Yet I was talking to people like these -- <eob> devastated parents, <eob> who told us that on the day Boko Haram <eol> kidnapped their daughters, <eob> they ran into the Sambisa Forest <eol> after the trucks carrying their daughters. <eob>
They were armed with machetes, <eol> but they were forced to turn back <eob> because Boko Haram had guns. <eob>
For two years, inevitably, <eol> the news agenda moved on, <eob> and for two years, <eob> we didn't hear much about the Chibok girls. <eob>
Everyone presumed they were dead. <eob>
But in April last year, <eob> I was able to obtain this video. <eob>
This is a still from the video <eob> that Boko Haram filmed <eol> as a proof of life, <eob> and through a source, <eol> I obtained this video. <eob>
But before I could publish it, <eob> I had to travel <eol> to the northeast of Nigeria <eob> to talk to the parents, <eol> to verify it. <eob>
I didn't have to wait <eol> too long for confirmation. <eob>
One of the mothers, when she watched <eol> the video, told me <eob> that if she could have reached into the laptop <eob> and pulled our her child from the laptop, <eob> she would have done so. <eob>
For those of you who are parents, <eol> like myself, in the audience, <eob> you can only imagine <eol> the anguish <eob> that that mother felt. <eob>
This video would go on <eol> to kick-start negotiation talks with Boko Haram. <eob>
And a Nigerian senator told me <eol> that because of this video <eob> they entered into those talks, <eob> because they had long presumed <eol> that the Chibok girls were dead. <eob>
Twenty-one girls were <eol> freed in October last year. <eob>
Sadly, nearly 200 of them <eol> still remain missing. <eob>
I must confess that I have not been <eol> a dispassionate observer <eob> covering this story. <eob>
I am furious when I think <eol> about the wasted opportunities <eob> to rescue these girls. <eob>
I am furious when I think <eol> about what the parents have told me, <eob> that if these were daughters <eol> of the rich and the powerful, <eob> they would have been found much earlier. <eob>
And I am furious <eob> that the hoax narrative, <eob> I firmly believe, <eob> caused a delay; <eob> it was part of the reason <eol> for the delay in their return. <eob>
This illustrates to me the deadly <eol> danger of fake news. <eob>
So what can we do about it? <eob>
There are some very smart people, <eob> smart engineers at Google and Facebook, <eob> who are trying to use technology <eol> to stop the spread of fake news. <eob>
But beyond that, I think <eol> everybody here -- you and I -- <eob> we have a role to play in that. <eob>
We are the ones who share the content. <eob>
We are the ones <eol> who share the stories online. <eob>
In this day and age, we're all publishers, <eob> and we have responsibility. <eob>
In my job as a journalist, <eob> I check, I verify. <eob>
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions. <eob>
Why is this person telling me this story? <eob>
What do they have to gain <eol> by sharing this information? <eob>
Do they have a hidden agenda? <eob>
I really believe that we must all start <eol> to ask tougher questions <eob> of information that we discover online. <eob>
Research shows that some of us <eol> don't even read beyond headlines <eob> before we share stories. <eob>
Who here has done that? <eob>
I know I have. <eob>
But what if <eob> we stopped taking information <eol> that we discover at face value? <eob>
What if we stop to think <eol> about the consequence <eob> of the information that we pass on <eob> and its potential to incite violence or hatred? <eob>
What if we stop to think <eol> about the real-life consequences <eob> of the information that we share? <eob>
Thank you very much for listening. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Fresh out of college, <eob> I went to work for a consulting firm. <eob>
During orientation, <eol> the leaders dished out advice. <eob>
Amongst them was one pithy counsel <eol> I will never forget. <eob> He told us, "Be easy to manage." <eob> Considering how naïve I really was at the time, <eob> I took his advice to heart. <eob>
I told myself, <eob> "Yes, I will be the ultimate team player. <eob>
I will do everything I'm told. <eob>
I will be easy to manage." <eob> It wasn't until I arrived in graduate school <eob> and witnessed firsthand the criminal <eol> actions of scientists and engineers <eob> in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan <eob> that I realized how dangerous <eol> and yet surprisingly common <eob> this line of thinking really is. <eob>
Make no mistake: <eob> the Flint water crisis is one of the most <eol> egregious environmental injustices <eob> of our time. <eob>
For over 18 months, <eob> 100,000 residents, including thousands of young children, <eob> were exposed to contaminated drinking water <eol> with high levels of lead. <eob>
Lead is a potent neurotoxin <eob> which causes cognitive and developmental disabilities <eob> and is especially harmful to growing <eol> fetuses and young children. <eob>
We've known about its dangers <eol> since the Roman Empire. <eob>
Amongst a whole host of health issues, <eob> 12 people died by contracting Legionnaires' disease. <eob>
Flint's water infrastructure -- <eob> the complex network of underground pipes -- <eob> has been severely damaged. <eob>
And while the water quality <eol> is slowly improving <eob> and the pipes are being replaced now, <eob> more than two years later, <eob> the water is still not safe to drink. <eob>
So, people are still in shock. <eob>
They ask themselves, <eob> "How could this have happened?" <eob> The short answer is: the crisis <eol> began when an emergency manager, <eob> appointed by Michigan's governor, <eob> decided to switch their water source <eol> to a local river to save money. <eob>
But it continued for so long <eob> because scientists <eol> and engineers at government agencies <eob> in the state of Michigan <eol> and in the federal government <eob> did not follow federal regulations <eol> for treating the water right. <eob>
What was more, <eob> they actively cheated <eol> on the law and orchestrated cover-ups. <eob>
They ridiculed residents <eol> asking for help, <eob> while publicly insisting that the brown, smelly water <eol> coming out of the tap <eob> was safe to drink. <eob>
The system at the local, state <eol> and federal levels completely failed <eob> to protect our most vulnerable, <eob> and an entire population <eol> was left to fend for itself. <eob>
Now, amidst this injustice, Flint residents <eol> were rallying together. <eob>
Amongst them were some amazing <eol> women of Flint -- <eob> mothers concerned about their kids -- <eob> who came together forming many grassroots coalitions, <eob> and these groups started protesting <eol> and demanding change. <eob>
The group also reached out <eol> to outside scientists for help, <eob> and a few responded. <eob>
Amongst them was a guy named Miguel Del Toral, <eob> a water expert at the US EPA -- the Environmental <eol> Protection Agency -- <eob> who actually wrote this scientific memo <eob> and sent it to the state of Michigan <eol> and the federal government <eob> to bring their attention to this problem. <eob>
He was characterized a "rogue employee," <eob> and silenced. <eob>
In collaboration with Flint residents, <eob> our research team here at Tech, <eob> of students and scientists <eol> led by professor Marc Edwards, <eob> conducted citywide testing <eob> to prove that Flint's water <eol> was indeed contaminated, <eob> even toxic in some homes. <eob>
We substantiated what Flint had <eol> been screaming for months, <eob> and put it on the Internet <eol> for the world to see. <eob>
Now, when I was getting involved, <eob> when I said yes to this, <eob> I had no idea what I was getting into. <eob>
But every second of this journey <eol> has been totally worth it. <eob>
This was science in service to the public. <eob>
This is what I came to graduate school for, <eob> and this is how I would rather <eol> spend my life. <eob>
And so this coalition -- <eob> this unlikely coalition of citizens, <eol> pastors, journalists and scientists -- <eob> came together to uncover the truth <eol> using science, advocacy and activism. <eob>
A local pediatrician figured out <eob> that the instances of childhood lead <eol> poisoning had indeed doubled <eob> in Flint during the crisis. <eob>
And the state of Michigan <eol> was forced to acknowledge the problem <eob> and take steps to correct it. <eob>
This group and many others <eol> got Flint's kids protected. <eob>
A few months later, <eob> President Obama came <eol> in and declared a federal emergency, <eob> and now Flint is getting more than 600 million dollars <eob> in healthcare, nutrition, education <eob> and overhauling their water infrastructure. <eob>
However, the arrogance and the callous disregard <eol> for public health <eob> shown by scientists and engineers <eol> at these government agencies <eob> is beyond belief. <eob>
These unhealthy cultures <eol> that are festering in these groups, <eob> where the focus is on meeting regulations <eol> and checking boxes <eob> as opposed to protecting public health, <eob> is just appalling. <eob> Just consider this email <eol> that an EPA employee wrote, <eob> where she goes, <eob> "I'm not so sure Flint <eol> is a community we want to go out on a limb for." <eob> The dehumanization of an entire population <eol> could not be more obvious. <eob>
Now, contrast that to the first <eol> canon of engineering, <eob> which, in my opinion, <eol> should be the first law of humanity: <eob> "To hold paramount the health, <eol> safety and welfare of the public," <eob> above all else. <eob>
This is the Hippocratic Oath <eol> we've rarely acknowledged, <eob> let alone embraced. <eob>
And so when scientists and engineers, <eol> very much like medical doctors, <eob> screw up, <eob> people can get hurt — <eob> even die. <eob>
If our professionals and even students <eol> fail to get that, <eob> society pays a huge price. <eob>
Buried deep in history <eol> lies a character I deeply admire -- <eob> an engineer named Peter Palchinsky. <eob>
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union. <eob>
And Palchinsky repeatedly <eol> got in trouble for his radical honesty <eob> and willingness to point out major <eol> flaws in the Soviets' mindless pursuit <eob> of rapid industrialization. <eob>
Everyone was expected to follow <eol> orders coming from the top. <eob>
Anyone asking questions <eol> or offering feedback was unwelcome. <eob>
The Soviets had created the largest army <eol> of engineers the world had ever seen, <eob> and yet most of them <eol> were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom. <eob>
Palchinsky, on the other hand, <eol> implored engineers <eob> to look at the economic, political <eol> and social consequences of their actions; <eob> in other words, be more public-focused. <eob>
His fearless voice of reason <eol> was seen as a threat <eob> to the political establishment, <eob> and Joseph Stalin had him <eol> executed in 1929. <eob>
Palchinsky's view on technocrats <eol> is very different <eob> from one that is still very popular, <eol> still very common -- <eob> that of a dispassionate researcher <eob> working <eol> in his ivory tower lab, <eob> or a nerdy engineer working <eol> in his cubicle. <eob>
Brilliant, no doubt, <eob> yet somehow cut off from the world, <eob> shows little emotion -- <eob> kind of like Spock from <eol> "Star Trek," you know? <eob> This guy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's try and do the Spock salute. <eob>
I don't think I'll succeed ... <eob> See, I can't be Spock. <eob>
Thank goodness I can't be Spock. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was reminded of this distinction <eol> because a recent article came out <eob> in a very reputed scientific journal, <eob> which kind of characterized <eol> our Flint work as driven by "youthful idealism," <eob> and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities." <eob> It asks scientists to protect their research <eol> funding and institutions <eob> at all costs, no matter how just the cause. <eob>
And if you think you have to get <eol> involved in something, <eob> even if it's an emergency, <eob> try finding an activist group <eol> or an NGO, <eob> and obtain the full support <eol> of the academic community -- <eob> whatever that means -- <eob> before you get involved. <eob>
Not one mention of our moral <eol> and professional obligation <eob> of preventing harm to the public, <eob> or the fact that we have all this expertise, <eob> resources and, for some, <eol> even tenure <eob> to, you know, accomplish this task. <eob>
I'm not saying every scientist <eol> should be an activist. <eob>
There are real and sometimes very painful <eol> consequences of speaking up. <eob>
But to denounce this idea, <eol> this possibility so completely <eob> so that you can protect research funding, <eob> simply screams of self-serving cowardice, <eob> and these are not the ideals <eol> we would want to pass to our students. <eob>
And so you may think, "OK, <eol> all this sounds great, <eob> but you'll never completely change <eol> organizational cultures, <eob> or imbibe mindsets in students <eol> and professionals <eob> to look at their work <eol> as a public good -- <eob> science in service to the public." <eob> Maybe so. <eob>
But could a big reason for that be <eob> that we are not training <eol> our students right? <eob>
Because if you look closely, <eob> our education system today <eol> is focused more on creating <eob> what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz calls "excellent sheep" -- <eob> young people <eol> who are smart and ambitious, <eob> and yet somehow risk-averse, timid, directionless <eob> and, sometimes, full of themselves. <eob>
Now, kids... you know, <eob> we fell in love with science <eol> when we were kids, <eob> and yet we somehow spend most <eob> of our time <eob> during high school and college <eob> just jumping through hoops <eob> and doing things so that <eol> we can polish our résumé <eob> instead of sitting down <eob> and reflecting <eol> on what we want to do and who we want to be. <eob>
And so, <eob> the markers of empathy in our college graduates <eob> have been dropping dramatically <eol> in the past two decades, <eob> while those of narcissism are on the rise. <eob>
There is also a growing culture <eol> of disengagement <eob> between engineering students <eol> and the public. <eob>
We are trained to build bridges <eol> and solve complex problems <eob> but not how to think or live <eol> or be a citizen of this world. <eob>
My undergraduate years <eol> were explicit job preparation, <eob> and I cannot tell you how suffocating <eol> and painful it was at times. <eob>
Maybe so. <eob> And so, <eob> some people think the solution <eol> to great engineers, to great scientists, <eob> is more technical training. <eob> But where are the discussions <eol> on ethical decision-making, <eob> or building character, <eob> or discerning right from wrong? <eob>
Consider this project <eol> that I deeply love and admire. <eob>
It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project." <eob> A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo, <eob> famous for the Stanford <eol> Prison Experiment, <eob> this program seeks to train <eol> school-going children around the world <eob> to look at themselves <eol> as heroes-in-waiting, <eob> or heroes-in-training. <eob>
So, these young minds work <eol> over time to develop skills and virtues <eob> so that when the opportunity comes, <eob> no matter what that opportunity be, <eob> to stand up and do the right thing. <eob>
In other words, <eob> anyone can be a hero. <eob>
Think about that idea for a second. <eob>
Why don't we teach science <eol> and engineering like that -- <eob> where heroism and public service <eol> are seen as key values, <eob> because indeed, it's often heroism <eob> that is not only the antidote <eol> to public indifference, <eob> but also to systemic evil <eol> like we saw in Flint. <eob>
And so, dream with me <eob> what a 21st-century scientist <eol> slash engineer could look like: <eob> individuals who are driven <eol> to master the sciences <eob> so that they can serve society, <eob> and are also aware <eob> of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have; <eob> folks who are developing their moral courage <eol> at all times, <eob> and who realize that conflict and controversy <eob> are not necessarily bad things <eob> if our ultimate loyalty is to the public and the planet. <eob>
These are the people <eol> who will stand up like we did in Flint -- <eob> not to be saviors <eol> or heroes in the media, <eob> but altruistic and fundamentally good actors <eol> that you and I can trust. <eob>
Imagine fostering such a public-focused mindset <eob> in classes, on service trips <eol> and during activities <eob> during college or even high school, <eob> so that these young minds <eol> will hold onto those ideals <eob> when they actually enter the real world, <eob> whether that be consulting, academia, policy making -- <eob> or even becoming the president of a country. <eob>
Some of mankind's greatest <eol> challenges lie ahead of us; <eob> contaminated drinking water <eol> is just one example. <eob>
We could definitely use more -- <eob> nay, we desperately need <eol> more -- compassionate upstanders <eob> and public-focused scientists and engineers <eob> who will strive to the do right thing, <eob> and not be easy to manage. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Last year ... <eob> was hell. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was my first time <eol> eating Nigerian "jollof." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Actually, in all seriousness, <eob> I was going through a lot <eol> of personal turmoil. <eob>
Faced with enormous stress, <eob> I suffered an anxiety attack. <eob>
On some days, I could do no work. <eob>
On other days, <eob> I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry. <eob>
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak <eol> with a mental health professional <eob> about my stress and anxiety. <eob> Mental health? <eob> I clammed up and violently <eol> shook my head in protest. <eob>
I felt a profound sense of a shame. <eob>
I felt the weight of stigma. <eob>
I have a loving, supportive family <eob> and incredibly loyal friends, <eob> yet I could not entertain the idea <eol> of speaking to anyone <eob> about my feeling of pain. <eob>
I felt suffocated <eol> by the rigid architecture <eob> of our African masculinity. <eob> "People have real problems, Sangu. <eob> Get over yourself!" <eob>
The first time I heard "mental health," <eob> I was a boarding school student <eol> fresh off the boat from Ghana, <eob> at the Peddie School in New Jersey. <eob>
I had just gone through <eol> the brutal experience <eob> of losing seven loved ones <eol> in the same month. <eob>
The school nurse, <eob> concerned about what I'd gone through -- <eol> God bless her soul -- <eob> she inquired about my mental health. <eob> "Is she mental?" I thought. <eob>
Does she not know I'm an African man? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart," <eob> we African men neither process <eol> nor express our emotions. <eob>
We deal with our problems. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We deal with our problems. <eob>
I called my brother and laughed about "Oyibo" people -- white people -- <eob> and their strange diseases -- <eob> depression, ADD and those "weird things." <eob> Growing up in West Africa, <eob> when people used the term "mental," <eol> what came to mind was a madman <eob> with dirty, dread-locked hair, <eob> bumbling around half-naked on the streets. <eob>
We all know this man. <eob>
Our parents warned us about him. <eob> "Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?" <eob> "Drugs! <eob>
If you even look at drugs, <eol> you end up like him." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Come down with pneumonia, <eob> and your mother will rush you <eol> to the nearest hospital <eob> for medical treatment. <eob>
But dare to declare depression, <eob> and your local pastor <eol> will be driving out demons <eob> and blaming witches in your village. <eob>
According to the World Health Organization, <eob> mental health is about <eol> being able to cope <eob> with the normal stressors of life; <eob> to work productively and fruitfully; <eob> and to be able to make <eol> a contribution to your community. <eob>
Mental health <eob> includes our emotional, psychological <eol> and social well-being. <eob>
Globally, 75 percent <eol> of all mental illness cases <eob> can be found in low-income countries. <eob>
Yet most African governments <eob> invest less than one percent <eol> of their health care budget <eob> in mental health. <eob>
Even worse, <eob> we have a severe shortage <eol> of psychiatrists in Africa. <eob>
Nigeria, for example, <eol> is estimated to have 200 -- <eob> in a country of almost 200 million. <eob>
In all of Africa, <eob> 90 percent of our people <eol> lack access to treatment. <eob>
As a result, <eob> we suffer in solitude, <eob> silenced by stigma. <eob>
We as Africans often respond <eol> to mental health with distance, <eob> ignorance, <eob> guilt, <eob> fear <eob> and anger. <eob>
In a study conducted <eol> by Arboleda-Flórez, <eob> directly asking, "What is the cause <eol> of mental illness?" <eob> 34 percent of Nigerian respondents <eol> cited drug misuse; <eob> 19 percent said divine wrath <eol> and the will of God -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
12 percent, <eob> witchcraft and spiritual possession. <eob>
But few cited other known <eol> causes of mental illness, <eob> like genetics, <eob> socioeconomic status, <eob> war, <eob> conflict <eob> or the loss <eol> of a loved one. <eob>
The stigmatization against mental illness <eob> often results in the ostracizing <eol> and demonizing of sufferers. <eob>
Photojournalist Robin Hammond has documented <eol> some of these abuses ... <eob> in Uganda, <eob> in Somalia, <eob> and here in Nigeria. <eob>
For me, <eob> the stigma is personal. <eob>
In 2009, <eob> I received a frantic call <eol> in the middle of the night. <eob>
My best friend in the world -- <eob> a brilliant, philosophical, <eol> charming, hip young man -- <eob> was diagnosed with schizophrenia. <eob>
I witnessed some of the friends <eol> we'd grown up with recoil. <eob>
I heard the snickers. <eob>
I heard the whispers. <eob> "Did you hear he has gone mad?" <eob> (Kru English) "He has gone crazy!" <eob> Derogatory, demeaning commentary <eol> about his condition — <eob> words we would never say about someone with cancer <eob> or someone with malaria. <eob>
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness, <eob> our ignorance eviscerates all empathy. <eob>
I stood by his side <eol> as his community isolated him, <eob> but our love never wavered. <eob>
Tacitly, I became passionate <eol> about mental health. <eob>
Inspired by his plight, <eob> I helped found the mental health <eol> special interest alumni group <eob> at my college. <eob>
And during my tenure <eol> as a resident tutor in graduate school, <eob> I supported many undergraduates <eol> with their mental health challenges. <eob>
I saw African students struggle <eob> and unable to speak to anyone. <eob>
Even with this knowledge <eol> and with their stories in tow, <eob> I, in turn, struggled, <eob> and could not speak to anyone <eol> when I faced my own anxiety, <eob> so deep is our <eob> fear <eob> of being the madman. <eob>
All of us -- <eob> but we Africans especially -- <eob> need to realize that our mental <eol> struggles do not detract from our virility, <eob> nor does our trauma taint our strength. <eob>
We need to see mental health <eol> as important as physical health. <eob>
We need to stop suffering in silence. <eob>
We must stop stigmatizing disease <eob> and traumatizing the afflicted. <eob>
Talk to your friends. <eob> Talk to your loved ones. <eob>
Talk to health professionals. <eob> Be vulnerable. <eob> Do so with the confidence <eob> that you are not alone. <eob>
Speak up if you're struggling. <eob>
Being honest about how we feel <eob> does not make us weak; <eob> it makes us human. <eob>
It is time to end the stigma <eol> associated with mental illness. <eob>
So the next time your hear "mental," <eob> do not just think of the madman. <eob> Think of me. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I was 14 years old <eob> inside of a bowling alley, <eob> burglarizing an arcade game, <eob> and upon exiting the building <eob> a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran. <eob>
I ran down the street, and I jumped <eol> on top of a fence. <eob>
And when I got to the top, <eob> the weight of 3,000 <eol> quarters in my book bag <eob> pulled me back down to the ground. <eob>
So when I came to, the security guard <eol> was standing on top of me, <eob> and he said, "Next time you little punks <eol> steal something you can carry." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I was taken to juvenile hall <eob> and when I was released <eol> into the custody of my mother, <eob> the first words my uncle said was, <eol> "How'd you get caught?" <eob> I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy." <eob> He said, "Man, you weren't supposed <eol> to take all the quarters." <eob> I said, "Man, they were small. <eob>
What am I supposed to do? <eob> "And 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize <eol> another arcade game. <eob>
We needed gas money to get home. <eob>
That was my life. <eob>
I grew up in Oakland, California, <eob> with my mother and members <eol> of my immediate family <eob> addicted to crack cocaine. <eob>
My environment consisted <eol> of living with family, friends, <eob> and homeless shelters. <eob>
Oftentimes, dinner was served <eol> in breadlines and soup kitchens. <eob>
The big homey told me this: <eob> money rules the world <eob> and everything in it. <eob>
And in these streets, money is king. <eob>
And if you follow the money, <eob> it'll lead you to the bad guy <eol> or the good guy. <eob>
Soon after, I committed my first crime, <eob> and it was the first time that I was told <eol> that I had potential <eob> and felt like somebody believed in me. <eob>
Nobody ever told me <eol> that I could be a lawyer, <eob> doctor or engineer. <eob>
I mean, how was I supposed to do that? <eob>
I was illiterate. <eob> So I always thought crime <eol> was my way to go. <eob> I couldn't read, write or spell. <eob>
And then one day <eob> I was talking to somebody <eob> and he was telling me <eol> about this robbery that we could do. <eob>
And we did it. <eob>
The reality was that I was growing up <eob> in the strongest financial nation in the world, <eob> the United States of America, <eob> while I watched my mother stand in line <eol> at a blood bank <eob> to sell her blood for 40 dollars <eol> just to try to feed her kids. <eob>
She still has the needle marks on her arms <eol> to day to show for that. <eob>
So I never cared about my community. <eob>
They didn't care about my life. <eob>
Everybody there was doing what they were doing <eol> to take what they wanted, <eob> the drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank. <eob>
Everybody was taking blood money. <eob>
So I got mine by any means necessary. <eob> I got mine. <eob> Financial literacy really did rule the world, <eob> and I was a child slave to it <eob> following the bad guy. <eob>
At 17 years old, <eol> I was arrested for robbery and murder <eob> and I soon learned that finances in prison rule <eol> more than they did on the streets, <eob> so I wanted in. <eob>
One day, I rushed to grab <eol> the sports page of the newspaper <eob> so my cellie could read it to me, <eob> and I accidentally picked up <eol> the business section. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And this old man said, <eol> "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?" <eob> And I said, "What's that?" <eob> He said, "That's the place <eol> where white folks keep all their money." <eob>
And it was the first time <eol> that I saw a glimpse of hope, <eob> a future. <eob> He gave me this brief description <eol> of what stocks were, <eob> but it was just a glimpse. <eob>
I mean, how was I supposed to do it? <eob>
I couldn't read, write or spell. <eob>
The skills that I had developed <eol> to hide my illiteracy <eob> no longer worked in this environment. <eob>
I was trapped in a cage, prey among predators, <eob> fighting for freedom I never had. <eob>
I was lost, tired, <eob> and I was out of options. <eob>
So at 20 years old, <eob> I did the hardest thing <eol> I'd ever done in my life. <eob>
I picked up a book, <eob> and it was the most agonizing <eol> time of my life, <eob> trying to learn how to read, <eob> the ostracizing from my family, <eob> the homeys. <eob>
It was rough, man. <eob>
It was a struggle. <eob>
But little did I know <eob> I was receiving the greatest gifts <eol> I had ever dreamed of: <eob> self-worth, <eob> knowledge, discipline. <eob>
I was so excited to be reading that I read <eol> everything I could get my hands on: <eob> candy wrappers, clothing logos, <eol> street signs, everything. <eob>
I was just reading stuff! <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Just reading stuff. <eob> I was so excited to know how to read <eol> and know how to spell. <eob>
The homey came up, said, <eol> "Man, what you eating?" <eob> I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy." <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> He said, "Let me get some." <eol> I said, "N-O. No." <eob>
It was awesome. <eob> I mean, I can actually now <eol> for the first time in my life read. <eob>
The feeling that I got from it <eol> was amazing. <eob>
And then at 22, feeling myself, <eob> feeling confident, <eob> I remembered what the OG told me. <eob>
So I picked up the business <eol> section of the newspaper. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I wanted to find these rich white folks. <eob> So I looked for that glimpse. <eob>
As I furthered my career <eob> in teaching others how to financially <eol> manage money and invest, <eob> I soon learned that I had to take responsibility <eol> for my own actions. <eob>
True, I grew up in a very complex environment, <eob> but I chose to commit crimes, <eob> and I had to own up to that. <eob>
I had to take responsibility <eol> for that, and I did. <eob>
I was building a curriculum that could teach <eol> incarcerated men <eob> how to manage money through prison employments. <eob>
Properly managing our lifestyle <eol> would provide transferrable tools <eob> that we can use to manage money <eol> when we reenter society, <eob> like the majority of people <eol> did who didn't commit crimes. <eob>
Then I discovered <eob> that according to MarketWatch, <eob> over 60 percent of the American population <eob> has under 1,000 dollars in savings. <eob>
Sports Illustrated said that over 60 percent <eol> of NBA players <eob> and NFL players go broke. <eob>
40 percent of marital problems <eol> derive from financial issues. <eob> What the hell? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> You mean to tell me that people <eol> worked their whole lives, <eob> buying cars, clothes, homes and material stuff <eob> but were living check to check? <eob>
How in the world were members of society <eol> going to help incarcerated individuals <eob> back into society <eob> if they couldn't manage they own stuff? <eob> We screwed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I needed a better plan. <eob>
This is not going to work out too well. <eob>
So... <eob> I thought. <eob>
I now had an obligation <eol> to meet those on the path <eob> and help, <eob> and it was crazy because I now cared about my community. <eob>
Wow, imagine that. <eob>
I cared about my community. <eob>
Financial illiteracy is a disease <eob> that has crippled minorities <eol> and the lower class in our society <eob> for generations and generations, <eob> and we should be furious about that. <eob>
Ask yourselves this: <eob> How can 50 percent of the American population <eob> be financially illiterate <eol> in a nation driven by financial prosperity? <eob>
Our access to justice, our social status, <eob> living conditions, transportation and food <eob> are all dependent on money <eol> that most people can't manage. <eob> It's crazy! <eob> It's an epidemic <eob> and a bigger danger <eol> to public safety than any other issue. <eob>
According to the California <eol> Department of Corrections, <eob> over 70 percent of those incarcerated <eob> have committed or have been charged <eol> with money-related crimes: <eob> robberies, burglaries, fraud, larceny, extortion — <eob> and the list goes on. <eob>
Check this out: <eob> a typical incarcerated person <eob> would enter the California prison system <eob> with no financial education, <eob> earn 30 cents an hour, <eob> over 800 dollars a year, <eob> with no real expenses and save no money. <eob>
Upon his parole, he will be given <eol> 200 dollars gate money and told, <eob> "Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble. <eob>
Don't come back to prison. <eob> "With no meaningful preparation <eol> or long-term financial plan, <eob> what does he do...? <eob> At 60? <eob> Get a good job, <eob> or go back to the very criminal behavior <eol> that led him to prison in the first place? <eob>
You taxpayers, you choose. <eob>
Well, his education already <eol> chose for him, probably. <eob>
So how do we cure this disease? <eob>
I cofounded a program <eob> that we call Financial Empowerment <eol> Emotional Literacy. <eob>
We call it FEEL, <eob> and it teaches how do you <eol> separate your emotional decisions <eob> from your financial decisions, <eob> and the four timeless rules <eol> to personal finance: <eob> the proper way to save, <eob> control your cost of living, <eob> borrow money effectively <eob> and diversify your finances <eol> by allowing your money to work for you <eob> instead of you working for it. <eob>
Incarcerated people need these life <eol> skills before we reenter society. <eob>
You can't have full rehabilitation <eol> without these life skills. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> This idea that only professionals <eol> can invest and manage money <eob> is absolutely ridiculous, <eob> and whoever told you that is lying. <eob>
A professional is a person <eob> who knows his craft better than most, <eob> and nobody knows how much money <eol> you need, have or want better than you, <eob> which means you are the professional. <eob>
Financial literacy is not a skill, <eol> ladies and gentlemen. <eob> It's a lifestyle. <eob>
Financial stability is a byproduct <eol> of a proper lifestyle. <eob>
A financially sound incarcerated <eol> person can become a taxpaying citizen, <eob> and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one. <eob>
This allows us to create a bridge <eol> between those people who we influence: <eob> family, friends and those young people <eob> who still believe that crime and money <eol> are related. <eob>
So let's lose the fear and anxiety <eob> of all the big financial words <eob> and all that other nonsense <eol> that you've been out there hearing. <eob>
And let's get to the heart of what's been <eol> crippling our society <eob> from taking care of your responsibility <eol> to be better life managers. <eob>
And let's provide a simple <eol> and easy to use curriculum <eob> that gets to the heart, the heart <eob> of what financial empowerment <eol> and emotional literacy really is. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, if you're sitting <eol> out here in the audience and you said, <eob> "Oh yeah, well, that ain't me <eol> and I don't buy it," <eob> then come take my class -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you very much. Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
As patients, <eob> we usually remember <eol> the names of our doctors, <eob> but often we forget the names of our nurses. <eob> I remember one. <eob> I had breast cancer a few years ago, <eob> and somehow I managed to get <eol> through the surgeries <eob> and the beginning of the treatment just fine. <eob>
I could hide what was going on. <eob>
Everybody didn't really have to know. <eob>
I could walk my daughter to school, <eob> I could go out to dinner with my husband; <eob> I could fool people. <eob>
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin <eob> and that terrified me <eob> because I knew that I was going <eol> to lose every single hair on my body <eob> because of the kind of chemo <eol> that I was going to have. <eob>
I wasn't going to be able to pretend anymore <eob> as though everything was normal. <eob>
I was scared. <eob> I knew what it felt like to have <eol> everybody treating me with kid gloves, <eob> and I just wanted to feel normal. <eob>
I had a port installed in my chest. <eob>
I went to my first day of chemotherapy, <eob> and I was an emotional wreck. <eob>
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door, <eob> and every bone in my body <eol> was telling me to get up out of that chair <eob> and take for the hills. <eob>
But Joanne looked at me and talked to me <eol> like we were old friends. <eob>
And then she asked me, <eob> "Where'd you get your highlights done?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I was like, are you kidding me? <eob>
You're going to talk to me <eob> about my hair when I'm on the verge <eol> of losing it? <eob> I was kind of angry, <eob> and I said, "Really? Hair?" <eob> And with a shrug <eol> of her shoulders she said, <eob> "It's gonna grow back." <eob> And in that moment she said <eol> the one thing I had overlooked, <eob> and that was that at some point, <eol> my life would get back to normal. <eob>
She really believed that. <eob>
And so I believed it, too. <eob>
Now, worrying about losing your hair <eol> when you're fighting cancer <eob> may seem silly at first, <eob> but it's not just that you're worried <eol> about how you're going to look. <eob>
It's that you're worried <eol> that everybody's going to treat you so carefully. <eob>
Joanne made me feel normal <eol> for the first time in six months. <eob>
We talked about her boyfriends, <eob> we talked about looking for apartments <eol> in New York City, <eob> and we talked about my reaction <eol> to the chemotherapy -- <eob> all kind of mixed in together. <eob>
And I always wondered, <eob> how did she so instinctively know <eol> just how to talk to me? <eob>
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her <eob> marked the beginning of my journey <eol> into the world of nurses. <eob>
A few years later, <eol> I was asked to do a project <eob> that would celebrate <eol> the work that nurses do. <eob>
I started with Joanne, <eob> and I met over 100 nurses <eol> across the country. <eob>
I spent five years interviewing, <eol> photographing and filming nurses <eob> for a book and a documentary film. <eob>
With my team, <eob> we mapped a trip <eol> across America that would take us to places <eob> dealing with some of the biggest public health <eol> issues facing our nation -- <eob> aging, war, poverty, prisons. <eob>
And then we went places <eob> where we would find <eol> the largest concentration of patients <eob> dealing with those issues. <eob>
Then we asked hospitals and facilities <eol> to nominate nurses <eob> who would best represent them. <eob>
One of the first nurses <eol> I met was Bridget Kumbella. <eob>
Bridget was born in Cameroon, <eob> the oldest of four children. <eob>
Her father was at work <eol> when he had fallen from the fourth floor <eob> and really hurt his back. <eob>
And he talked a lot about what it was like <eol> to be flat on your back <eob> and not get the kind of care <eol> that you need. <eob>
And that propelled Bridget <eol> to go into the profession of nursing. <eob>
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx, <eob> she has a really diverse group <eol> of patients that she cares for, <eob> from all walks of life, <eob> and from all different religions. <eob>
And she's devoted her career <eol> to understanding the impact <eob> of our cultural differences <eol> when it comes to our health. <eob>
She spoke of a patient -- <eob> a Native American patient <eol> that she had -- <eob> that wanted to bring a bunch <eol> of feathers into the ICU. <eob>
That's how he found spiritual comfort. <eob>
And she spoke of advocating for him <eob> and said that patients <eol> come from all different religions <eob> and use all different kinds <eol> of objects for comfort; <eob> whether it's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather, <eob> it all needs to be supported. <eob>
This is Jason Short. <eob> Jason is a home health <eol> nurse in the Appalachian mountains, <eob> and his dad had a gas station <eol> and a repair shop when he was growing up. <eob>
So he worked on cars in the community <eol> that he now serves as a nurse. <eob>
When he was in college, <eob> it was just not macho <eol> at all to become a nurse, <eob> so he avoided it for years. <eob>
He drove trucks for a little while, <eob> but his life path <eol> was always pulling him back to nursing. <eob>
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains, <eob> Jason goes places that an ambulance <eol> can't even get to. <eob>
In this photograph, <eol> he's standing in what used to be a road. <eob>
Top of the mountain mining <eol> flooded that road, <eob> and now the only way for Jason <eol> to get to the patient <eob> living in that house <eol> with black lung disease <eob> is to drive his SUV against <eol> the current up that creek. <eob>
The day I was with him, we ripped <eol> the front fender off the car. <eob>
The next morning he got up, <eol> put the car on the lift, <eob> fixed the fender, <eob> and then headed out to meet <eol> his next patient. <eob>
I witnessed Jason caring <eol> for this gentleman <eob> with such enormous compassion, <eob> and I was struck again by how intimate <eol> the work of nursing really is. <eob>
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw. <eob>
He had just come back from a deployment <eob> and he hadn't really settled back <eol> in to life in San Diego yet. <eob>
He talked about his experience <eol> of being a nurse in Germany <eob> and taking care of the soldiers coming right <eol> off the battlefield. <eob>
Very often, he would be the first person <eol> they would see <eob> when they opened their eyes in the hospital. <eob>
And they would look at him <eol> as they were lying there, <eob> missing limbs, <eob> and the first thing <eol> they would say is, <eob> "When can I go back? <eob>
I left my brothers out there. <eob> "And Brian would have to say," <eob> You're not going anywhere. <eob>
You've already given enough, brother." <eob> Brian is both a nurse and a soldier <eol> who's seen combat. <eob>
So that puts him in a unique position <eob> to be able to relate <eol> to and help heal the veterans in his care. <eob>
This is Sister Stephen, <eob> and she runs a nursing home <eol> in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto. <eob>
And the entire circle of life <eol> can be found under her roof. <eob>
She grew up wishing <eol> they lived on a farm, <eob> so given the opportunity <eol> to adopt local farm animals, <eob> she enthusiastically brings them in. <eob>
And in the springtime, those animals have babies. <eob> And Sister Stephen <eol> uses those baby ducks, goats and lambs <eob> as animal therapy for the residents <eol> at Villa Loretto <eob> who sometimes can't remember <eol> their own name, <eob> but they do rejoice <eol> in the holding of a baby lamb. <eob>
The day I was with Sister Stephen, <eob> I needed to take her away <eol> from Villa Loretto <eob> to film part of her story. <eob>
And before we left, <eob> she went into the room of a dying patient. <eob>
And she leaned over and she said, <eob> "I have to go away for the day, <eob> but if Jesus calls you, <eob> you go. <eob>
You go straight home to Jesus." <eob> I was standing there and thinking <eob> it was the first time in my life <eob> I witnessed that you could show <eol> someone you love them completely <eob> by letting go. <eob>
We don't have to hold on so tightly. <eob>
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto <eob> than I have ever seen at any other time <eol> at any other place in my life. <eob>
We live in a complicated time <eol> when it comes to our health care. <eob>
It's easy to lose sight <eol> of the need for quality of life, <eob> not just quantity of life. <eob>
As new life-saving technologies are created, <eob> we're going to have really complicated <eol> decisions to make. <eob>
These technologies often save lives, <eob> but they can also prolong pain <eol> and the dying process. <eob>
How in the world are we supposed <eol> to navigate these waters? <eob>
We're going to need <eol> all the help we can get. <eob>
Nurses have a really unique relationship with us <eob> because of the time spent at bedside. <eob>
During that time, <eob> a kind of emotional intimacy develops. <eob>
This past summer, on August 9, <eob> my father died of a heart attack. <eob>
My mother was devastated, <eob> and she couldn't imagine her world <eol> without him in it. <eob>
Four days later she fell, <eob> she broke her hip, <eob> she needed surgery <eob> and she found herself fighting <eol> for her own life. <eob>
Once again I found myself <eob> on the receiving end <eol> of the care of nurses -- <eob> this time for my mom. <eob>
My brother and my sister <eol> and I stayed by her side <eob> for the next three days <eol> in the ICU. <eob>
And as we tried to make <eol> the right decisions <eob> and follow my mother's wishes, <eob> we found that we were depending <eol> upon the guidance of nurses. <eob>
And once again, <eob> they didn't let us down. <eob>
They had an amazing insight <eol> in terms of how to care for my mom <eob> in the last four days of her life. <eob>
They brought her comfort <eol> and relief from pain. <eob>
They knew to encourage my sister <eol> and I to put a pretty nightgown on my mom, <eob> long after it mattered to her, <eob> but it sure meant a lot to us. <eob>
And they knew to come and wake me <eol> up just in time for my mom's last breath. <eob>
And then they knew how long <eol> to leave me in the room <eob> with my mother after she died. <eob>
I have no idea how they know these things, <eob> but I do know that I am eternally grateful <eob> that they've guided me once again. <eob>
Thank you so very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So there's this thing called <eol> the law of unintended consequences. <eob>
I thought it was just like a saying, <eob> but it actually exists, I guess. <eob>
There's, like, academic papers about it. <eob>
And I'm a designer. <eob>
I don't like unintended consequences. <eob>
People hire me because they have <eol> consequences that they really intend, <eob> and what they intend is for me <eol> to help them achieve those consequences. <eob>
So I live in fear <eol> of unintended consequences. <eob>
And so this is a story about <eol> consequences intended and unintended. <eob>
I got called by an organization <eol> called Robin Hood <eob> to do a favor for them. <eob>
Robin Hood is based in New York, <eol> a wonderful philanthropic organization <eob> that does what it says in the name. <eob> They take from rich people, <eol> give it to poor people. <eob>
In this case, what they wanted to benefit <eol> was the New York City school system, <eob> a huge enterprise that educates <eol> more than a million students at a time, <eob> and in buildings that are like this one, <eob> old buildings, big buildings, <eob> drafty buildings, sometimes buildings <eol> that are in disrepair, <eob> certainly buildings <eol> that could use a renovation. <eob>
Robin Hood had this ambition <eol> to improve these buildings in some way, <eob> but what they realized was <eob> to fix the buildings would be <eol> too expensive and impractical. <eob>
So instead they tried to figure out <eol> what one room they could go into <eob> in each of these buildings, <eol> in as many buildings that they could, <eob> and fix that one room <eob> so that they could improve <eol> the lives of the children inside <eob> as they were studying. <eob>
And what they came up with <eol> was the school library, <eob> and they came up with this idea <eol> called the Library Initiative. <eob>
All the students <eol> have to pass through the library. <eob>
That's where the books are. <eob> That's where the heart <eol> and soul of the school is. <eob>
So let's fix these libraries. <eob>
So they did this wonderful thing <eol> where they brought in <eob> first 10, then 20, then more architects, <eob> each one of whom was assigned a library <eol> to rethink what a library was. <eob>
They trained special librarians. <eob>
So they started this mighty enterprise <eob> to reform public schools <eol> by improving these libraries. <eob>
Then they called me up and they said, <eol> "Could you make a little contribution?" <eob> I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?" <eob> And they said, "Well, <eol> we want you to be the graphic designer <eob> in charge of the whole thing." <eob> And so I thought, I know what that means. <eob>
That means I get to design a logo. <eob>
I know how to design that. I design logos. <eob> That's what people come to me for. <eob>
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing. <eob>
Easy to do, actually, <eol> compared with architecture <eob> and being a librarian. <eob>
Just do a logo, make a contribution, <eol> and then you're out, <eob> and you feel really good about yourself. <eob>
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel <eol> good about myself when I do these favors. <eob>
So I thought, let's overdeliver. <eob>
I'm going to give you three logos, <eol> all based on this one idea. <eob>
So you have three options, <eol> pick any of the three. <eob>
They're all great, I said. <eob>
So the basic idea was <eol> these would be new school libraries <eob> for New York schools, <eob> and so the idea is that it's a new thing, <eol> a new idea that needs a new name. <eob>
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea <eol> that these were musty old libraries, <eob> the kind of places <eol> that everyone is bored with, <eob> you know, not your grandparents' library. <eob>
Don't worry about that at all. <eob> This is going to this new, exciting thing, <eob> not a boring library. <eob>
So option number one: <eob> so instead of thinking of it as a library, <eob> think of it as a place where it is like: <eol> do talk, do make loud noises. <eob> Right? So no shushing, <eol> it's like a shush-free zone. <eob>
We're going to call it the Reading Room. <eob>
That was option number one. <eob>
OK, option number two. <eob> Option number two was, wait for it, <eob> OWL. <eob> I'll meet you at OWL. <eob>
I'm getting my book from the <eob> OWL. <eob>
Meet you after school down at <eob> OWL. <eob> I like that, right? <eob>
Now, what does OWL stand for? <eob>
Well, it could be One World Library, <eob> or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn. <eob> Or it could be -- and I figure librarians <eol> could figure out other things it could be <eob> because they know about words. <eob> So other things, right? <eob>
And then look at this. <eol> It's like the eye of the owl. <eob> This is irresistible in my opinion. <eob>
But there's even another idea. <eob> Option number three. <eob> Option number three <eol> was based actually on language. <eob>
It's the idea that "read" <eol> is the past tense of "read," <eob> and they're both spelled the same way. <eob>
So why don't we call <eol> this place The Red Zone? <eob> I'll meet you at the Red Zone. <eob> Are you Red? Get Red. <eob> I'm well Red. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
I really loved this idea, <eob> and I somehow was not focused on the idea <eob> that librarians as a class are sort of <eol> interested in spelling and I don't know. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But sometimes cleverness <eol> is more important than spelling, <eob> and I thought this would be <eol> one of those instances. <eob>
So usually when I make these presentations <eob> I say there's just one question <eol> and the question should be, <eob> "How can I thank you, Mike?" <eob> But in this case, <eol> the question was more like, <eob> "Um, are you kidding?" <eob> Because, they said, <eob> the premise of all this work <eob> was that kids were bored <eol> with old libraries, musty old libraries. <eob> They were tired of them. <eob>
And instead, they said, these kids <eol> have never really seen a library. <eob>
The school libraries in these schools <eob> are really so dilapidated, <eol> if they're there at all, <eob> that they haven't bored anyone. <eob>
They haven't even been there <eol> to bore anyone at all. <eob>
So the idea was, just forget <eol> about giving it a new name. <eob>
Just call it, one last try, a library. <eob> Right? OK. <eob> So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph? <eob> Exclamation point? <eob> Then -- this is because I'm clever -- <eob> move that into the "i," <eob> make it red, <eob> and there you have it, <eol> the Library Initiative. <eob>
So I thought, mission accomplished, <eol> there's your logo. <eob>
So what's interesting about this logo, <eol> an unintended consequence, <eob> was that it turned out that <eol> they didn't really even need my design <eob> because you could type it any font, <eol> you could write it by hand, <eob> and when they started <eol> sending emails around, <eob> they just would use Shift and 1, <eob> they'd get their own logo <eol> just right out of the thing. <eob>
And I thought, well, that's fine. <eob>
Feel free to use that logo. <eob> And then I embarked <eol> on the real rollout of this thing -- <eob> working with every one of the architects <eob> to put this logo on the front door <eol> of their own library. Right? <eob>
So here's the big rollout. <eob> Basically I'd work <eol> with different architects. <eob>
First Robin Hood was my client. <eol> Now these architects were my client. <eob>
Put it on both doors. "" <eob> Here's your logo. Put it off to the side. <eob> "" <eob> Here's your logo repeated <eol> all over to the top. <eob> "So everything was going swimmingly. <eob>
I just was saying, <eol> "Here's your logo. Here's your logo." <eob>
Then I got a call <eol> from one of the architects, <eob> a guy named Richard Lewis, <eol> and he says, "I've got a problem. <eob> You're the graphics guy. <eob>
Can you solve it? <eob> "And I said, OK, sure." <eob> And he said, "The problem <eol> is that there's a space <eob> between the shelf and the ceiling." <eob> So that sounds like an architectural issue to me, <eob> not a graphic design issue, <eol> so I'm, "Go on." <eob> And Richard says, "Well, the top shelf <eol> has to be low enough <eob> for the kid to reach it, <eob> but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings <eol> are really high, <eob> so actually I've got all this space up there <eob> and I need something like a mural." <eob> And I'm like, "Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer. <eob>
I'm not Diego Rivera or something. <eob>
I'm not a muralist. <eob> "And so he said," But can't you think of anything? <eob> "So I said," OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school <eob> and just put them around the top of the thing, <eob> and maybe that could work. <eob> "And my wife is a photographer, <eob> and I said," Dorothy, there's no budget, <eob> can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures? <eob> "And she did, <eob> and if you go in Richard's library, <eob> which is one of the first that opened, <eob> it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school, <eob> oversized, looking down <eob> into the little dollhouse of the real library, right? <eob>
And the kids were great, <eol> hand-selected by the principals <eob> and the librarian. <eob>
It just kind of created <eol> this heroic atmosphere in this library, <eob> this very dignified setting below <eol> and the joy of the children above. <eob>
So naturally all the other librarians <eol> in the other schools see this <eob> and they said, well, we want murals too. <eob>
And I'm like, OK. <eob>
So then I think, well, <eol> it can't be the same mural every time, <eob> so Dorothy did another one, <eol> and then she did another one, <eob> but then we needed more help, <eob> so I called an illustrator I knew <eol> named Lynn Pauley, <eob> and Lynn did these beautiful <eol> paintings of the kids. <eob>
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin <eol> at a place called Automatic Design. <eob>
He did these amazing collages. <eob> We had Rafael Esquer <eob> do these great silhouettes. <eob>
He would work with the kids, <eol> asking for words, <eob> and then based on those prompts, <eob> come up with this little, <eol> delirious kind of constellation <eob> of silhouettes <eol> of things that are in books. <eob>
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids <eob> and had them talk <eol> about their favorite books <eob> and he put their testimony <eol> as a frieze up there. <eob>
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu <eob> and they did this amazing <eol> manga-style statement, <eob> "Everyone who is honest is interesting," <eob> that goes all the way around. <eob>
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator, <eob> did a whole series of things <eob> where he embedded books <eol> into the faces and characters <eob> and images and places <eol> that you find in the books. <eob>
And then even Maira Kalman <eob> did this amazing cryptic installation <eol> of objects and words <eob> that kind of go all around <eol> and will fascinate students <eob> for as long as it's up there. <eob>
So this was really satisfying, <eob> and basically my role here was reading <eol> a series of dimensions to these artists, <eob> and I would say, <eob> "Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want. <eob>
Let me know if you have <eol> any problem with that. <eob> "And they would go and install these. <eob>
It just was the greatest thing. <eob>
But the greatest thing, actually, was -- <eob> Every once in a while, <eob> I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail <eol> made of construction paper, <eob> and it would say, "You are invited <eol> to the opening of our new library." <eob> So you'd go to the library, <eol> say, you'd go to PS10, <eob> and you'd go inside. <eob>
There'd be balloons, <eol> there'd be a student ambassador, <eob> there'd be speeches that were read, <eob> poetry that was written <eol> specifically for the opening, <eob> dignitaries would present people <eol> with certificates, <eob> and the whole thing <eol> was just a delirious, fun party. <eob>
So I loved going to these things. <eob>
I would stand there dressed like this, <eol> obviously not belonging, <eob> and someone would say, <eol> "What are you doing here, mister?" <eob> And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team <eol> that designed this place." <eob> And they'd said, "You do these shelves?" <eob> And I said, "No." <eol> "You took the pictures up above." <eob> "No." <eob> "Well, what did you do?" <eob> "You know when you came in? <eol> The sign over the door?" <eob> "The sign that says library?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Yeah, I did that!" <eob> And then they'd sort of go, "OK. <eob>
Nice work if you can get it. <eob> "So it was so satisfying <eol> going to these little openings <eob> despite the fact that I was kind <eol> of largely ignored or humiliated, <eob> but it was actually fun <eol> going to the openings, <eob> so I decided that I wanted <eol> to get the people in my office <eob> who had worked on these projects, <eol> get the illustrators and photographers, <eob> and I said, why don't we rent a van <eob> and drive around the five boroughs of New York <eob> and see how many we could hit at one time. <eob>
And eventually there were <eol> going to be 60 of these libraries, <eob> so we probably got to see <eol> maybe half a dozen in one long day. <eob>
And the best thing of all <eol> was meeting these librarians <eob> who kind of were running these, <eol> took possession of these places <eob> like their private stage <eol> upon which they were invited <eob> to mesmerize their students <eol> and bring the books to life, <eob> and it was just <eol> this really exciting experience <eob> for all of us to actually <eol> see these things in action. <eob>
So we spent a long day doing this <eob> and we were in the very last library. <eob>
It was still winter, <eol> because it got dark early, <eob> and the librarian <eob> says, "I'm about to close down. <eob>
So really nice having you here. <eob>
Hey, wait a second, do you want <eol> to see how I turn off the lights? <eob> "I'm like," OK. <eob> "And she said," I have this special way <eol> that I do it. <eob> "And then she showed me. <eob>
What she did was she turned out <eol> every light one by one by one by one, <eob> and the last light she left on <eob> was the light that illuminated <eol> the kids' faces, <eob> and she said, "That's the last light <eol> I turn off every night, <eob> because I like to remind myself <eol> why I come to work." <eob>
So when I started this whole thing, <eob> remember, it was just <eol> about designing that logo <eob> and being clever, come up with a new name? <eob>
The unintended consequence here, <eob> which I would like to take credit for <eob> and like to think I can think through <eol> the experience to that extent, <eob> but I can't. <eob>
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me, <eol> as far as I could reach with my own hands. <eob>
Instead, way off in the distance <eob> was a librarian <eob> who was going to find <eol> the chain of consequences <eob> that we had set in motion, <eob> a source of inspiration <eob> so that she in this case <eol> could do her work really well. <eob>
40,000 kids a year <eol> are affected by these libraries. <eob>
They've been happening <eol> for more than 10 years now, <eob> so those librarians have kind of turned on <eol> a generation of children to books <eob> and so it's been a thrill to find out <eob> that sometimes unintended consequences <eol> are the best consequences. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
I come to you today to speak of liars, <eob> lawsuits <eob> and laughter. <eob>
The first time I heard <eol> about Holocaust denial, <eob> I laughed. <eob> Holocaust denial? <eob> The Holocaust which has the dubious distinction <eob> of being the best-documented <eol> genocide in the world? <eob>
Who could believe it didn't happen? <eob>
Think about it. <eob> For deniers to be right, <eob> who would have to be wrong? <eob>
Well, first of all, the victims -- <eob> the survivors who have told us <eol> their harrowing stories. <eob>
Who else would have to be wrong? <eob> The bystanders. <eob> The people who lived in the myriads <eol> of towns and villages and cities <eob> on the Eastern front, <eob> who watched their neighbors <eol> be rounded up -- <eob> men, women, children, young, old -- <eob> and be marched to the outskirts of the town <eob> to be shot and left <eol> dead in ditches. <eob>
Or the Poles, <eob> who lived in towns and villages <eol> around the death camps, <eob> who watched day after day <eob> as the trains went in filled with people <eob> and came out empty. <eob>
But above all, <eob> who would have to be wrong? <eob> The perpetrators. <eob> The people who say, "We did it. <eob>
I did it." <eob> Now, maybe they add a caveat. <eob>
They say, "I didn't have a choice; <eol> I was forced to do it." <eob> But nonetheless, they say, <eob> "I did it." <eob> Think about it. <eob>
In not one war crimes trial <eol> since the end of World War II <eob> has a perpetrator of any nationality <eol> ever said, "It didn't happen." <eob> Again, they may have said, <eol> "I was forced," but never that it didn't happen. <eob>
Having thought that through, <eob> I decided denial was not <eol> going to be on my agenda; <eob> I had bigger things to worry <eol> about, to write about, to research, <eob> and I moved on. <eob>
Fast-forward a little over a decade, <eob> and two senior scholars -- <eob> two of the most prominent historians of the Holocaust -- <eob> approached me and said, <eob> "Deborah, let's have coffee. <eob>
We have a research idea <eol> that we think is perfect for you. <eob> "Intrigued and flattered <eol> that they came to me with an idea <eob> and thought me worthy of it, <eob> I asked," What is it? <eob> "And they said," <eob> Holocaust denial. <eob> "And for the second time, <eob> I laughed. <eob> Holocaust denial? <eob> The Flat Earth folks? <eob> The Elvis-is-alive people? <eob> I should study them? <eob>
And these two guys said, <eob> "Yeah, we're intrigued. <eob>
What are they about? <eob>
What's their objective? <eob>
How do they manage to get people <eol> to believe what they say?" <eob>
So thinking, if they thought it was worthwhile, <eob> I would take a momentary diversion -- <eob> maybe a year, maybe two, three, maybe even four -- <eob> in academic terms, that's momentary. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> We work very slowly. <eob>
And I would look at them. <eob> So I did. <eob> I did my research, and I came up <eol> with a number of things, <eob> two of which I'd like <eol> to share with you today. <eob>
One: <eob> deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing. <eob>
They are the same: Nazis, <eol> neo-Nazis -- <eob> you can decide whether you want <eol> to put a "neo" there or not. <eob>
But when I looked at them, <eob> I didn't see any SS-like uniforms, <eob> swastika-like symbols on the wall, <eob> Sieg Heil salutes -- <eob> none of that. <eob>
What I found instead <eob> were people parading <eol> as respectable academics. <eob>
What did they have? <eob> They had an institute. <eob>
An "Institute for Historical Review." <eob> They had a journal — a slick journal — <eob> a "Journal of Historical Review." <eob> One filled with papers — <eob> footnote-laden papers. <eob>
And they had a new name. <eob>
Not neo-Nazis, <eob> not anti-Semites -- <eob> revisionists. <eob>
They said, "We are <eob> revisionists. <eob> We are out to do one thing: <eob> to revise mistakes in history." <eob> But all you had to do was go <eol> one inch below the surface, <eob> and what did you find there? <eob> The same adulation of Hitler, <eob> praise of the Third Reich, <eob> anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice. <eob>
This is what intrigued me. <eob>
It was <eob> anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice, <eob> parading as rational discourse. <eob>
The other thing I found — <eob> many of us have been taught to think <eol> there are facts and there are opinions — <eob> after studying deniers, <eob> I think differently. <eob>
There are facts, <eob> there are opinions <eob> and there are lies. <eob>
And what deniers want to do <eol> is take their lies, <eob> dress them up as opinions -- <eob> maybe edgy opinions, <eob> maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions -- <eob> but then if they're opinions, <eob> they should be part of the conversation. <eob>
And then they encroach on the facts. <eob>
I published my work -- <eob> the book was published, <eob> "Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory," <eob> it came out in many different countries, <eob> including here in Penguin UK, <eob> and I was done with those folks <eol> and ready to move on. <eob>
Then came the letter from Penguin UK. <eob>
And for the third time, <eob> I laughed... <eob> mistakenly. <eob>
I opened the letter, <eob> and it informed me that David Irving was bringing <eol> a libel suit against me <eob> in the United Kingdom <eob> for calling him a Holocaust denier. <eob>
David Irving suing me? <eob> Who was David Irving? <eob>
David Irving was a writer <eol> of historical works, <eob> most of them about World War II, <eob> and virtually all of those <eol> works took the position <eob> that the Nazis were really not so bad, <eob> and the Allies were really not so good. <eob>
And the Jews, whatever happened to them, <eob> they sort of deserved it. <eob>
He knew the documents, <eob> he knew the facts, <eob> but he somehow twisted them <eol> to get this opinion. <eob>
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier, <eob> but in the late '80s, <eob> he embraced it with great vigor. <eob>
The reason I laughed also <eol> was this was a man <eob> who not only was a Holocaust denier, <eob> but seemed quite proud of it. <eob>
Here was a man -- and I quote -- <eob> who said, "I'm going to sink <eol> the battleship Auschwitz." <eob> Here was a man <eob> who pointed to the number tattooed <eol> on a survivor's arm and said, <eob> "How much money have you made <eob> from having that number tattooed <eol> on your arm?" <eob> Here was a man who said, <eob> "More people died in Senator Kennedy's car <eob> at Chappaquiddick <eob> than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz." <eob> That's an American reference, but you can look it up. <eob>
This was not a man who seemed <eol> at all ashamed or reticent <eob> about being a Holocaust denier. <eob>
Now, lots of my academic colleagues <eol> counseled me -- <eob> "Eh, Deborah, just ignore it." <eob> When I explained you can't <eol> just ignore a libel suit, <eob> they said, "Who's going <eol> to believe him anyway?" <eob> But here was the problem: <eob> British law put the onus, <eol> put the burden of proof on me <eob> to prove the truth of what I said, <eob> in contrast to as it would have been <eol> in the United States <eob> and in many other countries: <eob> on him to prove the falsehood. <eob>
What did that mean? <eob> That meant if I didn't fight, <eob> he would win by default. <eob>
And if he won by default, <eob> he could then legitimately say, <eob> "My David Irving version <eol> of the Holocaust is a legitimate version. <eob> Deborah Lipstadt <eol> was found to have libeled me <eob> when she called me a Holocaust denier. <eob>
Ipso facto, I, David Irving, <eol> am not a Holocaust denier." <eob> And what is that version? <eob>
There was no plan to murder the Jews, <eob> there were no gas chambers, <eob> there were no mass shootings, <eob> Hitler had nothing to do <eol> with any suffering that went on, <eob> and the Jews <eol> have made this all up <eob> to get money from Germany <eob> and to get a state, <eob> and they've done it with the aid <eol> and abettance of the Allies — <eob> they've planted the documents <eol> and planted the evidence. <eob>
I couldn't let that stand <eob> and ever face a survivor <eob> or a child of survivors. <eob>
I couldn't let that stand <eob> and consider myself a responsible historian. <eob> So we fought. <eob> And for those of you <eol> who haven't seen "Denial," <eob> spoiler alert: <eob> we won. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> The judge found David Irving <eob> to be a liar, <eob> a racist, <eob> an anti-Semite. <eob> His view of history was tendentious, <eob> he lied, he distorted -- <eob> and most importantly, <eob> he did it deliberately. <eob>
We showed a pattern, in over 25 <eol> different major instances. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Not small things -- many of us <eol> in this audience write books, <eob> are writing books; <eob> we always make mistakes, <eol> that's why we're glad to have second editions: <eob> correct the mistakes. <eob>
And what did we find? <eob> Not in most cases, <eob> and not in the preponderance of cases, <eob> but in every single instance where <eol> he made some reference to the Holocaust, <eob> that his supposed evidence was distorted, <eob> half-truth, <eob> date-changed, <eob> sequence-changed, <eob> someone put at a meeting who wasn't there. <eob>
In other words, <eol> he didn't have the evidence. <eob> His evidence didn't prove it. <eob>
We didn't prove what happened. <eob>
We proved that what he said happened -- <eob> and by extension, all deniers, <eol> because he either quotes them <eob> or they get their arguments from him -- <eob> is not true. <eob>
What they claim -- <eob> they don't have the evidence to prove it. <eob>
So why is my story more <eol> than just the story <eob> of a quirky, long, six-year, difficult lawsuit, <eob> an American professor being dragged <eol> into a courtroom <eob> by a man that the court declared <eol> in its judgment <eob> was a neo-Nazi polemicist? <eob>
What message does it have? <eob>
I think in the context <eol> of the question of truth, <eob> it has a very significant message. <eob>
Because today, <eob> as we well know, <eob> truth and facts are under assault. <eob>
Social media, for all the gifts <eol> it has given us, <eob> has also allowed the difference <eol> between facts -- established facts -- <eob> and lies <eob> to be flattened. <eob>
Third of all: <eob> extremism. <eob>
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes, <eob> you may not see burning crosses, <eob> you may not even hear outright white <eol> supremacist language. <eob> It may go by names: "alt-right," "National Front" — pick your names. <eob> But underneath, it's that same extremism <eol> that I found in <eob> Holocaust denial <eob> parading as rational discourse. <eob>
We live in an age where truth <eol> is on the defensive. <eob>
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon. <eob>
A quiz show recently appeared <eol> in "The New Yorker" <eob> where the host of the quiz show <eol> is saying to one of the contestants, <eob> "Yes, ma'am, <eol> you had the right answer. <eob> But your opponent yelled more loudly <eol> than you did, <eob> so he gets the point." <eob>
What can we do? <eob> First of all, <eob> we cannot be beguiled <eol> by rational appearances. <eob>
We've got to look underneath, <eob> and we will find there the <eob> extremism. <eob>
Second of all, <eob> we must understand <eol> that truth is not relative. <eob>
Number three, <eob> we must go on the offensive, <eob> not the defensive. <eob>
When someone makes an outrageous claim, <eob> even though they may hold one <eol> of the highest offices in the land, <eob> if not the world -- <eob> we must say to them, <eob> "Where's the proof? <eob>
Where's the evidence?" <eob> We must hold their feet to the fire. <eob>
We must not treat it as if their lies <eol> are the same as the facts. <eob>
And as I said earlier, <eol> truth is not relative. <eob>
Many of us have grown up <eol> in the world of the academy <eob> and enlightened liberal thought, <eob> where we're taught everything <eol> is open to debate. <eob> But that's not the case. <eob>
There are certain things that are true. <eob>
There are indisputable facts -- <eob> objective truths. <eob>
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago. <eob>
Even after being forced <eol> to recant by the Vatican <eob> that the Earth moved around the Sun, <eob> he came out, <eob> and what is he reported to have said? <eob> "And yet, it still moves." <eob> The Earth is not flat. <eob>
The climate is changing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob> Elvis is not alive. <eob> And most importantly, <eob> truth and fact are under assault. <eob>
The job ahead of us, <eob> the task ahead of us, <eob> the challenge ahead of us <eob> is great. <eob>
The time to fight is short. <eob>
We must act now. <eob>
Later will be too late. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams, <eob> or should we say, have a seat, mom. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
So no doubt, you guys are like me. <eob>
You saw the release of Serena <eob> in that great yellow bathing <eol> suit last week <eob> and when I saw it, <eol> all I could think of was, <eob> "Gosh, why couldn't she have waited til <eol> we sat onstage for TED?" <eob> I was very selfish, I know. <eob>
So I asked you about that picture, <eob> and you said nobody was supposed <eol> to see that picture. <eob>
What do you mean? <eob> Serena Williams: Well, actually, <eol> it was an accident. <eob>
I was on vacation, just taking <eol> some time for myself, <eob> and I have this thing <eol> where I've been checking my status <eob> and taking pictures every week <eol> to see how far along I'm going -- <eob>
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe? <eob>
SW: No, actually I have <eol> just been saving it, <eob> and I didn't really tell <eol> a lot of people, <eob> to be quite honest, <eob> and I'd been saving it, <eob> and you know how social media <eol> is, you press the wrong button and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
GK: And there it was. <eob>
SW: So 30 minutes later -- <eol> my phone doesn't ring that much -- <eob> and 30 minutes later, <eol> I missed like four calls, <eob> and I'm like, that's weird, <eob> and then I picked it up <eol> and I was like, oh no. <eob>
But it was a good moment. <eob>
I was gonna wait literally just five <eol> or six more days -- that's OK. <eob>
GK: I know, because it was weird, Serena, because it only said 20 weeks, <eob> so it's not like there was a whole lot <eol> of information on it. <eob>
SW: Exactly, so that's what I've been doing all this time. <eob> I've been just tracking it. <eob>
18, 19 -- every week I'd just take <eol> a picture and save it, <eob> and I've been so good about it, <eob> and this was the one time <eol> that I slipped. <eob>
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations. <eob>
SW: Yes, thank you. <eob>
GK: It really is OK. <eol> When you heard the news, <eob> were you excited? Were you afraid? Were you worried? <eob> That you were pregnant, I mean. <eob>
SW: So I heard it two days before the beginning <eol> of the Australian Open, <eob> which is one of the biggest grand slams. <eob>
GK: You found out two days before? <eob>
SW: Yeah, so it was two days <eol> before, and I knew. <eob> I was nervous. <eob> I wasn't quite sure what to think, <eob> but I just knew that at that moment <eob> it was really important for me <eol> to just focus right there <eob> at the Australian Open, <eob> and I was definitely not sure what to do. <eob>
I was like, can I play? <eob>
I know it's very dangerous, <eol> maybe, sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so, <eob> so I had a lot of questions. <eob>
GK: But not only did you play, <eol> Ms. Williams, you won. <eob>
SW: Yeah. <eob> May I just say, 23 grand slams to you. <eob>
SW: Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> GK: While pregnant! <eob>
SW: Well, I was looking <eol> for another handicap, so... no. <eob>
GK: Did you play differently that game, <eol> knowing you were pregnant? <eob>
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy. <eob>
You hear all these stories about people <eol> when they're pregnant, <eob> they get sick and they get tired. <eob>
GK: Have you had morning sickness? <eob>
SW: No, I've been so fortunate <eol> and so I haven't. <eob>
But they get really tired <eol> and they get really stressed out, <eob> and I had to really take <eol> all that energy, <eob> put it in a paper bag, so to say, <eob> and throw it away, <eob> because I really felt <eol> like I didn't have time <eob> to deal with any extra emotions, <eol> any extra anything, <eob> because pregnant or not, no one knew, <eob> and I was supposed <eol> to win that tournament <eob> as I am every tournament that I show up. <eob>
I am expected to win, <eob> and if I don't win, it's actually much bigger news. <eob>
GK: Yeah, when you don't win, <eol> that's a big story. <eob>
SW: Yes, so for me, I had to really take <eol> anything negative <eob> and any emotions that I was feeling at that point <eob> and kind of just bottle them up <eob> and really figure out what the next step <eol> for me to do was. <eob>
GK: You have a lot of support. <eol> You have a lot of love. <eob>
Even when I was coming here, <eol> people stopped me at the airport. <eob>
I was saying to the flight attendant, <eol> the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?" <eob> They said, "Oh my God, we're so glad she's pregnant." <eob> But then you always have <eol> these cranky Yankees. <eob>
On the way over here, somebody <eol> was telling me about Ilie Nastase, <eob> who said some very unkind, inappropriate, <eol> dare I say racial things. <eob>
You have responded to him. <eob>
I'm not even going <eol> to dignify what he said, <eob> but you responded. Why did you respond? <eob>
SW: Well, I think there are very <eol> inappropriate comments, <eob> and not only that, I've been really supportive of my peers <eob> and the people that I've worked with. <eob>
I've been a pro for almost 20 years, <eob> and so for me, it's really important <eol> to hold women up, <eob> and it's something <eol> that these young women, <eob> they'll come to the locker room, <eol> they'll want to take pictures with me, <eob> and for me, it's just like, <eob> I want to be able to be a good leader <eol> and a good example for them. <eob> So not only — <eob>
Not only did he have rude things <eol> to say about me and my peers, <eob> I felt it was important for us <eol> to stand up for each other <eob> and to stand up for myself. <eob>
And at that point it was really <eol> important for me to say, <eob> like, I'm not afraid, <eol> I'm not going anywhere, <eob> but this is inappropriate, <eob> and there's time and there's <eol> a place for everything. <eob>
And that really wasn't <eol> the time and the place. <eob>
GK: We cut the part where you said <eol> you're not going anywhere, <eob> because you'll be 36 in September. Baby's coming, 36. <eob>
And your coach said age <eol> is always important, <eob> but in tennis it's very important, <eob> but he has no doubt that you're coming back. <eob>
Have you thought, am I coming back? <eob>
Will I take some time off? <eob>
I know the women on the tour are saying, <eob> "How long does it take to have a baby? <eob>
Two years will she be gone? <eob> "What are you thinking? <eob>
SW: Well, I'm always trying <eol> to defy the odds, you know, <eob> so for me everything is really mental. <eob>
I definitely plan on coming back. <eob>
I'm not done yet. <eob>
I'm really inspired by my sister. <eob>
She's a year older than me, <eol> and that's something that -- <eob> if she's still playing, I know I can play. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And there's so many -- Roger Federer, he's a little bit older than me <eob> and he's still winning everything, <eol> so I'm like, I know I can do that too. <eob>
So that's been so inspiring to me, <eol> especially recently, <eob> and I know that it's something <eol> I want to do. <eob>
And my story is definitely not over yet. <eob>
I was talking to my coach about it, <eob> and we were talking about <eol> how this is just a new part of my life, <eob> and my baby's going to be in the stands <eob> and hopefully cheering for me, <eol> not crying too much. <eob>
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful letter <eol> to your baby yesterday <eob> that you said -- from the oldest mommy <eol> to the youngest one, <eob> to the oldest, to the youngest, <eol> I can't wait for you to get here. <eob> A lot of people feel that. <eob>
I saw you about a year ago, <eol> because I think about your life, Serena. <eob>
You've had three life-changing things <eol> in a six-month time: <eob> pregnant, huge win, fell in love. <eob>
And when I saw you last year, <eob> I was saying, "How's your love life? <eob>
Da da da. <eob> "You said," I met a guy. <eol> He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy. <eob>
You won't know who he is." <eob> I said, "What's his name?" <eob>
SW: I remember talking <eol> to you about that, yes. <eob>
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian." <eol> I said, "I know him!" He's awesome. <eob>
But I would never put you <eol> with a nerdy geek, <eob> and you said, you neither. <eob>
SW: I'm going to be honest with you, <eol> I didn't either, <eob> but it's been the best thing for me. <eob>
GK: The best thing why? <eob> Does that look like a nerdy geek? <eob> Look at the shirt. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, he's a very nice guy. <eob>
SW: You can tell he's into technology. <eob>
GK: He's a very, very nice guy. <eob>
I like him very much. <eob>
So how did he succeed <eol> when others have failed? <eob>
How was he the one that you knew, <eol> this is the one for me? <eob>
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that, <eob> SW: Well ... <eob>
SW: Well ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
GK: But you know what I mean. <eob>
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind, <eol> and my mom says he's very considerate, <eob> and when she said that to me, <eob> I was like, you know, <eol> he really is, <eob> and it's the little things <eol> that really make a huge difference in life. <eob>
GK: Like? <eob>
SW: Something simple. <eob> My fashion company, we have a show every year, <eob> so in our show last year, <eol> I was running around like crazy, <eob> because I do everything for the show, <eob> and everything for it, <eob> so I was running around like crazy, <eob> and he, it was a simple gesture <eol> of this shirt that he had, <eob> and he just wanted to make sure <eol> that I had the same one, <eob> and it was -- it's a weird story. <eob>
It was better in person, I promise. <eob>
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal? <eob>
Or was it a Beyoncé song? <eob> "If you like it then you ought <eol> to put a ring on it"? <eob>
Were you feeling pressure to get married? <eob> Did you know it was coming? <eob>
SW: Yeah, <eob> I actually never felt pressure <eol> to get married <eob> and I can't say I'm the marrying <eol> type of person. <eob>
I really love my life. <eob>
I love my freedom. <eob> I heard that kind of changes. <eob>
But I love everything that I do, <eob> and I love my career, <eob> and I always felt like I didn't want <eol> anything to interfere with that. <eob>
I've actually been so career-oriented <eob> and in fact, when he proposed, <eob> I was almost angry. <eob> Not almost. I was angry, <eob> because it was right in the middle <eol> of my training season, <eob> and I said, "I gotta win <eol> the Australian Open. <eob>
I can't fly to Rome. <eob> "Because he wanted to take me to Rome, <eob> and I said," I can't. <eob>
I gotta win. <eob> "But that's how focused I was. <eob>
GK: This is a girl that says, <eol> "No, I can't go to Rome." OK. <eob>
SW: But I was really focused <eol> on reaching my goals <eob> and I knew at that point there was one player <eol> that I wanted to pass. <eob>
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record, <eob> and that really meant a lot to me, <eob> and when I put my mind to something, <eob> I really am determined to reach it <eob> no matter what. <eob>
GK: You know, you said that for you -- <eob> I've heard you say that winning <eol> is addictive to you. <eob>
SW: It is. <eob>
GK: <eob> What do you mean? <eob>
SW: I feel like winning <eol> for me is superaddictive. <eob>
I feel like once you experience it, <eob> you always want to get that feeling again, <eob> and when I won my first championship, <eol> I was only 17 years old, <eob> but I never forgot that feeling, <eob> and I feel like every time I win one, <eob> I want to reach that feeling <eol> of your first championship. <eob>
There's really no feeling <eol> in the world like that. <eob> And it's like, all these years of training <eob> and being a little kid and playing, <eob> and then winning is a wonderful experience. <eob>
So for me I've always felt <eol> like I loved that feeling, <eob> and obviously I don't like the feeling <eol> of losing. I feel like -- <eob>
GK: No, in fact, people close <eol> to you say you're a very bad loser. <eob>
SW: I'm not the best loser. <eob>
GK: That you're very, very, very bad. <eob>
Listen, no athlete, <eol> no champion likes to lose. <eob> I get that. <eob> But they say when it comes to losing, <eol> you are very, very, very bad at it. <eob>
SW: I'm number one at losing too, <eol> so you know, that's all I can say. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
GK: I'm always curious <eol> about the dynamic between you and Venus, <eob> because everybody that knows <eol> you and has followed the story <eob> knows that you two are very close, <eob> and you always bring your A game <eol> in whatever you do, <eob> but I often wonder, when you're playing her, <eob> do you bring your A- game <eol> because you want to do something for her <eob> or do you bring your A++ game <eol> because you want to crush her. <eob>
Is it harder for you <eol> playing her or easier? <eob>
SW: Well, playing Venus is like playing myself, <eob> because we grew up playing each other, <eol> we grew up practicing together. <eob>
And it was something <eol> that has been difficult, <eob> because she's my toughest opponent. <eob>
She's tall, she's fast, <eob> she hits hard like me, she serves like me. <eob>
It's really like playing a wall. <eob>
GK: She knows you. <eob>
SW: She knows where I'm hitting the ball before I hit it, <eob> so it's something that is not very easy, <eob> but it's really about, <eol> when I go out there, <eob> I really have to shut down my mind <eol> and I have to say to myself, <eob> "You know what? <eob>
I'm just playing a great player, <eol> but today I have to be better. <eob>
I don't care who it is, if it's my sister <eol> or it's my friend, <eob> today is the day I have to show up <eol> and I have to be better <eob> and I have to want it more <eol> than anyone else at this moment <eob> anywhere on this world." <eob>
GK: So never on the court <eol> do you fall back for Venus? <eob> Because, you know, it was always Venus and Serena. <eob>
SW: <eob> Yes. <eob> GK: And now baby sister <eol> has surpassed older sister. <eob> Do you feel guilt about that? <eob> Do you feel joy in that? <eob>
Is that a difficult position for you? <eob>
SW: I don't feel anything in there. <eob>
In my life, it still and forever <eol> is always going to be Venus and Serena. <eob>
She's really love of my life, <eol> she's my best friend, <eob> she's my soul mate. <eob>
I mean -- <eob> There's pictures of her pushing me, <eob> really low-quality pictures or else <eol> I would have shared them, <eob> of her pushing me in a stroller <eol> on a tennis court, <eob> and she always took care of me. <eob>
I used to spend all of my allowance money <eol> on the ice cream truck and stuff, <eob> and she would take her money <eol> and give it to me at school <eob> and make sure I had something to eat <eol> and she would go without, <eob> and that's the kind of person she actually is <eob> since I've always known her. <eob>
So we always have this incredible <eol> respect for each other <eob> and this incredible love, <eob> and I think it's important for people to realize <eol> you can be successful <eob> but you can still have <eol> a wonderful relationship. <eob>
On the court we are mortal enemies, <eob> but the second we shake hands, <eol> we are best friends again. <eob>
And if I lose, it might be <eol> a day later for me, <eob> but for Venus -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> GK: There's never a time on the court <eol> where you hit the ball <eob> and say, "That's for seventh grade <eol> when you did the blah blah blah"? <eob>
You never have any moment like that? <eob>
SW: I feel like she should have <eol> those moments, <eob> because she's never done anything bad to me, <eob> but I'm the youngest. <eob>
I'm the younger sister. <eob>
GK: Serena, she's never done <eol> anything bad to you? Really? <eob> I have three sisters. <eob>
I can think of some stuff I've done bad. <eob>
SW: Unless she brainwashed me <eol> to forget them. <eob>
GK: No, but the love you have for her I know <eol> is very pure. I know that. <eob>
SW: <eob> Yes. <eob> GK: I know that. <eob>
SW: We were always brought up <eol> to be superclose, <eob> and we are incredibly close. <eob> Not only her. <eob> I have three other sisters <eol> as well, and we were always so close. <eob>
GK: So before a big match, the two <eol> of you don't get together <eob> and say, look, we're going to go out there <eol> and -- there's nothing? <eob>
SW: Well, it's funny. <eob>
Before the Australian Open, <eob> we were in the locker room together, <eob> and I always pick on her, so I pulled out my camera <eol> while she was changing. <eob> I started taking pictures of her, <eol> which is totally inappropriate, <eob> but she was so mad at me. <eob>
She's like, "Serena, stop!" And I was just <eol> laughing at her. <eob>
But that's the kind of relationship <eol> that we have, and like I said, <eob> the second we step on the court, <eob> it was like, we were definitely <eol> mortal enemies, <eob> but the second we stepped off, <eol> and moments before, we're just -- <eob> It is what it is, because at the end of the day, <eob> she'll always be my sister. <eob>
I'm not going to play Australia in -- <eob> Well, who knows, <eol> I've been playing forever, <eob> but I don't think I'll be playing <eol> in 50 years, say? <eob>
Let's be safe and say 50 years. <eob>
GK: I don't know, Serena. <eob>
There's never been anybody like you. <eob> When you think about it, <eol> never been anybody <eob> who has intersected gender <eol> and race the way you have, <eob> the dominance that you have <eol> and the scrutiny that you have. <eob>
And when you were growing up, <eol> did you say, "I want to be like that"? <eob>
Because now little girls <eol> are looking at you <eob> saying, "I want to be like that." <eob> Who was the "I want <eol> to be like that" for you? <eob>
SW: Well, it's interesting, <eol> and I'm glad you brought that up. <eob>
For me, when I grew up, <eol> I always wanted to be the best, <eob> and I said, if you want to be the best, <eol> you've got to emulate the best. <eob>
So when I started to go on tour when I was really young, <eob> I would see Steffi Graf, I would see Monica Seles, <eob> and I would even see Pete Sampras, <eob> and I would see what they did, <eob> and I noticed that Steffi and Monica <eob> didn't really talk to a lot of the other players, <eob> and they kind of were on their own, <eob> and they were just so focused <eob> and I would see Pete Sampras, the technique that he did, <eob> and I was like, "I want to do that." <eob> So I did that, and I felt that to be the best, <eob> and if you want to be the best, <eob> you have to hang around people <eob> and you have to look at people that are the best, <eob> because you're not going to be the best <eob> if you're looking at someone that's not at the top level. <eob>
GK: People say nobody works <eol> as hard as you. <eob>
SW: I'm a very hard worker. <eob>
GK: That's what I heard. <eob>
SW: People say, "Oh, she's talented, <eol> she's athletic." <eob> Actually, I wasn't. <eol> I was really small for my age. <eob>
I grew up when I got older, <eob> and I had to work really hard, <eob> and I think one of the reasons <eol> why I fight so hard and I work so hard <eob> is because I was really, really, really small. <eob>
GK: Yeah. <eob> You are no longer small. <eob>
SW: No, I'm fully grown now. <eob>
But I was small when I was really young <eol> for whatever reason. <eob>
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties. <eob>
GK: You know, the other thing people <eol> talk about is your body. <eob>
Your body brings men <eol> and women to their knees. <eob>
And I mean in a good way. <eob>
A lot has been made about your body. <eob>
It's a work of art, <eol> it's masculine, it's glorious, <eob> there's never been anything like it. <eob>
Did you have body issues <eol> when you were growing up? <eob>
Have you always been comfortable <eol> with your body? <eob>
SW: It's interesting, <eol> because when you're a teenage female <eob> growing up in the public eye, <eob> it is a lot of scrutiny <eol> that you face, <eob> and as any female <eol> that's a teenager, <eob> I definitely was not <eol> comfortable in my body. <eob>
I didn't like it. <eob>
I didn't understand why I had muscles. <eob>
And I stopped lifting weights. <eob>
I was like, I'm not going to do this. <eob>
But then after I won the US Open, <eob> I realized that my body <eol> helped me reach goals that I wanted to reach, <eob> and I wanted to be happy with it, <eob> and I was so appreciative of it. <eob>
I'm always healthy. <eob>
I'm really fortunate and superblessed, <eob> and I felt like not only am <eol> I happy with my body, <eob> but I want other people <eol> and other young girls <eob> that have experienced <eol> what I've experienced <eob> to be happy with themselves. <eob>
So whatever people say -- <eob> masculine, whatever, too much, too little -- <eob> I'm OK with it as long as I love myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning, <eob> but what have you learned from losing? <eob>
SW: I hate to lose, but I think losing has brought me here today. <eob>
The only reason I am who I am <eol> is because of my losses, <eob> and some of them <eol> are extremely painful, <eob> but I wouldn't take any of them away, <eob> because every time I lose, <eob> it takes a really long time <eol> for me to lose again <eob> because I learn so much from it. <eob>
And I encourage everyone that I talk to -- <eob> I'm like, listen, <eol> if you lose or if something happens -- <eob> not in sports -- <eol> in business or in school -- <eob> learn from it. <eob>
Don't live in the past, <eol> live in the present, <eob> and don't make the same mistakes in the future. <eob>
That's something that I always <eol> try to live by. <eob>
GK: Now you're planning a wedding <eob> and I want to know, is it a destination wedding <eob> in the Catskills or Poconos or are you <eol> going to do it in Florida? <eob>
What are you thinking? <eob> Big or small? <eob>
SW: We're thinking medium size. <eob>
We don't want to do too big, <eob> but then we're like, OK, we can't say <eol> no to this person, this person. <eob>
So we're thinking medium size <eol> and we're just thinking — <eob> My personality <eol> is a lot of fun. <eob>
Hopefully you can see that today. <eob>
I'm not too serious. <eob>
GK: And you like to dance. <eob>
And the next chapter for Serena Williams is what? <eob> SW: Oh, next for me. <eob>
Obviously I'm going to have a baby <eob> and I'm going to stay fit and kind <eol> of come back and play tennis <eob> and keep working on my fashion line. <eob>
That'll be really fun. <eob>
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl? <eob>
SW: I don't. I have a feeling <eol> of one or the other. <eob>
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling. <eob>
GK: Gayle is a unisex name. <eob>
Whatever you and Alexis decide, <eol> we are cheering you on! <eob> SW: Thank you <eob> for that. GK: You're welcome. <eob>
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams. <eob>
SW: Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you guys. <eob>
How many people here would like to live <eol> to be at least 80 years old? <eob> Yeah. <eob> I think we all have this hopeful expectation <eob> of living into old age. <eob>
Let's project out into the future, <eob> to your future "you's," <eob> and let's imagine that we're all 85. <eob>
Now, everyone look at two people. <eob>
One of you probably <eol> has Alzheimer's disease. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Alright, alright. <eob> And maybe you're thinking, <eol> "Well, it won't be me." <eob> Then, OK. You are a caregiver. <eob> So -- <eob>
so in some way, <eob> this terrifying disease is likely <eol> to affect us all. <eob>
Part of the fear around Alzheimer's <eol> stems from the sense <eob> that there's nothing we can do about it. <eob>
Despite decades of research, <eol> we still have no disease-modifying treatment <eob> and no cure. <eob>
So if we're lucky enough <eol> to live long enough, <eob> Alzheimer's appears to be our brain's destiny. <eob>
But maybe it doesn't have to be. <eob>
What if I told you we could change <eol> these statistics, <eob> literally change our brain's destiny, <eob> without relying on a cure <eol> or advancements in medicine? <eob>
Let's begin by looking <eol> at what we currently understand <eob> about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's. <eob>
Here's a picture <eol> of two neurons connecting. <eob>
The point of connection, <eol> this space circled in red, <eob> is called the synapse. <eob>
The synapse is where neurotransmitters <eol> are released. <eob>
This is where signals <eol> are transmitted, where communication happens. <eob>
This is where we think, feel, <eol> see, hear, desire ... <eob> and remember. <eob>
And the synapse is where Alzheimer's happens. <eob>
Let's zoom in on the synapse <eob> and look at a cartoon representation <eol> of what's going on. <eob>
During the business of communicating information, <eob> in addition to releasing <eol> neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse, <eob> neurons also release a small peptide <eol> called amyloid beta. <eob>
Normally, amyloid <eol> beta is cleared away metabolized by microglia, <eob> the janitor cells of our brains. <eob>
While the molecular causes of Alzheimer's <eol> are still debated, <eob> most neuroscientists believe <eol> that the disease begins <eob> when amyloid beta begins <eol> to accumulate. <eob>
Too much is released, or not enough <eol> is cleared away, <eob> and the synapse begins <eol> to pile up with amyloid beta. <eob>
And when this happens, <eol> it binds to itself, <eob> forming sticky aggregates <eol> called amyloid plaques. <eob>
How many people here <eol> are 40 years old or older? <eob>
You're afraid to admit it now. <eob>
This initial step into the disease, <eob> this presence of amyloid <eol> plaques accumulating, <eob> can already be found in your brains. <eob>
The only way we could be sure of this <eol> would be through a PET scan, <eob> because at this point, you <eol> are blissfully unaware. <eob>
You're not showing any impairments <eol> in memory, language, or cognition ... <eob> yet. <eob>
We think it takes at least 15 <eol> to 20 years of amyloid plaque accumulation <eob> before it reaches a tipping point, <eob> then triggering a molecular cascade <eob> that causes the clinical symptoms <eol> of the disease. <eob>
Prior to the tipping point, <eob> your lapses in memory <eol> might include things like, <eob> "Why did I come in this room?" <eob> or "Oh ... what's his name?" <eob> or "Where did I put my keys?" <eob>
Now, before you all start freaking out again, <eob> because I know half of you did <eol> at least one of those in the last 24 hours -- <eob> these are all normal kinds of forgetting. <eob>
In fact, I would argue that these examples <eob> might not even involve your memory, <eob> because you didn't pay attention <eol> to where you put your keys <eob> in the first place. <eob>
After the tipping point, <eob> the glitches in memory, language <eol> and cognition are different. <eob>
Instead of eventually finding your keys <eol> in your coat pocket <eob> or on the table by the door, <eob> you find them in the refrigerator, <eob> or you find them and you think, <eob> "What are these for?" <eob>
So what happens when amyloid <eol> plaques accumulate to this tipping point? <eob>
Our microglia janitor cells <eol> become hyper-activated, <eob> releasing chemicals that cause <eol> inflammation and cellular damage. <eob>
We think they might actually <eol> start clearing away <eob> the synapses themselves. <eob>
A crucial neural transport protein called <eol> "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated <eob> and twists itself into something <eol> called "tangles," <eob> which choke off the neurons from the inside. <eob>
By mid-stage Alzheimer's, <eol> we have massive inflammation and tangles <eob> and all-out war at the synapse <eob> and cell death. <eob>
So if you were a scientist <eol> trying to cure this disease, <eob> at what point would you <eol> ideally want to intervene? <eob>
Many scientists are betting big on the simplest solution: <eob> keep amyloid plaques <eol> from reaching that tipping point, <eob> which means that drug discovery <eol> is largely focused on developing a compound <eob> that will prevent, eliminate, <eol> or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation. <eob>
So the cure for Alzheimer's <eol> will likely be a preventative medicine. <eob>
We're going to have to take this pill <eol> before we reach that tipping point, <eob> before the cascade is triggered, <eob> before we start leaving our keys <eol> in the refrigerator. <eob>
We think this is why, to date, <eol> these kinds of drugs have failed <eob> in clinical trials -- <eob> not because the science wasn't sound, <eob> but because the people in these trials <eol> were already symptomatic. <eob>
It was too late. <eob>
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match. <eob>
At the tipping point, the match <eol> sets fire to the forest. <eob>
Once the forest is ablaze, <eob> it doesn't do any good <eol> to blow out the match. <eob>
You have to blow out the match <eol> before the forest catches fire. <eob>
Even before scientists sort this out, <eob> this information is actually <eol> really good news for us, <eob> because it turns out that the way <eol> we live can influence the accumulation <eob> of amyloid plaques. <eob>
And so there are things we can do <eob> to keep us from reaching <eol> that tipping point. <eob>
Let's picture your risk <eol> of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale. <eob>
We're going to pile risk factors on one arm, <eob> and when that arm hits the floor, <eol> you are symptomatic <eob> and diagnosed with Alzheimer's. <eob>
Let's imagine you're 50 years old. <eob>
You're not a spring chicken anymore, <eob> so you've accumulated some <eol> amyloid plaques with age. <eob>
Your scale is tipped a little bit. <eob>
Now let's look at your DNA. <eob> We've all inherited our genes <eol> from our moms and our dads. <eob>
Some of these genes will increase <eol> our risk and some will decrease it. <eob>
If you're like Alice <eol> in "Still Alice," <eob> you've inherited a rare genetic <eol> mutation that cranks out amyloid beta, <eob> and this alone will tip your scale <eol> arm to the ground. <eob>
But for most of us, the genes we inherit <eol> will only tip the arm a bit. <eob>
For example, APOE4 is a gene <eol> variant that increases amyloid, <eob> but you can inherit a copy <eol> of APOE4 from mom and dad <eob> and still never get Alzheimer's, <eob> which means that for most of us, <eob> our DNA alone <eol> does not determine whether we get Alzheimer's. <eob> So what does? <eob> We can't do anything about getting older <eol> or the genes we've inherited. <eob>
So far, we haven't changed <eol> our brain's destiny. <eob>
What about sleep? <eob> In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid <eob> throughout our brains, <eob> clearing away metabolic waste <eol> that accumulated in our synapses <eob> while we were awake. <eob>
Deep sleep is like a power <eol> cleanse for the brain. <eob>
But what happens if you short <eol>change yourself on sleep? <eob>
Many scientists believe <eob> that poor sleep hygiene might actually be <eol> a predictor of Alzheimer's. <eob>
A single night of sleep deprivation <eol> leads to an increase in amyloid beta. <eob>
And amyloid accumulation <eol> has been shown to disrupt sleep, <eob> which in turn causes more amyloid <eol> to accumulate. <eob>
And so now we have <eol> this positive feedback loop <eob> that's going to accelerate <eol> the tipping of that scale. <eob>
What else? <eob> Cardiovascular health. <eob> High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, <eob> have all been shown to increase our risk <eol> of developing Alzheimer's. <eob>
Some autopsy studies have shown <eob> that as many as 80 percent <eol> of people with Alzheimer's <eob> also had cardiovascular disease. <eob>
Aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies <eol> to decrease amyloid beta <eob> in animal models of the disease. <eob>
So a heart-healthy Mediterranean lifestyle <eol> and diet <eob> can help to counter <eol> the tipping of this scale. <eob>
So there are many things we can do <eob> to prevent or delay <eol> the onset of Alzheimer's. <eob>
But let's say you haven't done <eol> any of them. <eob>
Let's say you're 65; <eob> there's Alzheimer's in your family, <eol> so you've likely inherited a gene or two <eob> that tips your scale arm a bit; <eob> you've been burning the candle <eol> at both ends for years; <eob> you love bacon; <eob> and you don't run unless someone's chasing you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's imagine that your amyloid <eol> plaques have reached that tipping point. <eob>
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor. <eob>
You've tripped the cascade, <eob> setting fire to the forest, <eob> causing inflammation, tangles, <eob> and cell death. <eob>
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's. <eob>
You should be having trouble <eol> finding words and keys <eob> and remembering what I said <eol> at the beginning of this talk. <eob> But you might not be. <eob>
There's one more thing you can do <eol> to protect yourself <eob> from experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's, <eob> even if you have the full-blown disease <eol> pathology ablaze in your brain. <eob>
It has to do with neural plasticity <eol> and cognitive reserve. <eob>
Remember, the experience <eol> of having Alzheimer's <eob> is ultimately a result of losing synapses. <eob>
The average brain has over <eol> a hundred trillion synapses, <eob> which is fantastic; we've got <eol> a lot to work with. <eob>
And this isn't a static number. <eob>
We gain and lose synapses all the time, <eob> through a process called neural plasticity. <eob>
Every time we learn something new, <eob> we are creating and strengthening <eol> new neural connections, <eob> new synapses. <eob>
In the Nun Study, <eob> 678 nuns, all over the age of 75 <eol> when the study began, <eob> were followed for more <eol> than two decades. <eob> They were regularly given physical checkups <eol> and cognitive tests, <eob> and when they died, their brains <eol> were all donated for autopsy. <eob>
In some of these brains, scientists <eol> discovered something surprising. <eob>
Despite the presence of plaques <eol> and tangles and brain shrinkage -- <eob> what appeared to be unquestionable Alzheimer's -- <eob> the nuns who had belonged <eol> to these brains showed no signs <eob> of having the disease <eol> while they were alive. <eob>
How can this be? <eob> We think it's because these nuns had a high level <eol> of cognitive reserve, <eob> which is a way of saying <eol> that they had more functional synapses. <eob>
People who have more years <eol> of formal education, <eob> who have a high degree <eol> of literacy, <eob> who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities, <eob> all have more cognitive reserve. <eob>
They have an abundance and a redundancy <eol> in neural connections. <eob>
So even if they have a disease like Alzheimer's <eob> compromising some of their synapses, <eob> they've got many extra backup connections, <eob> and this buffers them from noticing <eol> that anything is amiss. <eob>
Let's imagine a simplified example. <eob> Let's say you only know <eol> one thing about a subject. <eob>
Let's say it's about me. <eob>
You know that Lisa Genova <eol> wrote "Still Alice," <eob> and that's the only thing <eol> you know about me. <eob>
You have that single neural connection, <eob> that one synapse. <eob>
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's. <eob>
You have plaques and tangles <eol> and inflammation <eob> and microglia devouring that synapse. <eob>
Now when someone asks you, <eol> "Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'" <eob> you can't remember, <eob> because that synapse is either <eol> failing or gone. <eob>
You've forgotten me forever. <eob>
But what if you had learned more about me? <eob>
Let's say you learned <eol> four things about me. <eob>
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's. <eob> and three of those synapses <eol> are damaged or destroyed. <eob>
You still have a way <eol> to detour the wreckage. <eob>
You can still remember my name. <eob>
So we can be resilient <eol> to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology <eob> through the recruitment <eol> of yet-undamaged pathways. <eob>
And we create these pathways, <eol> this cognitive reserve, <eob> by learning new things. <eob>
Ideally, we want these new things <eol> to be as rich in meaning as possible, <eob> recruiting sight and sound <eol> and associations and emotion. <eob>
So this really doesn't mean <eol> doing crossword puzzles. <eob>
You don't want to simply retrieve <eol> information you've already learned, <eob> because this is like traveling down old, familiar streets, <eob> cruising neighborhoods you already know. <eob>
You want to pave new neural roads. <eob>
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain <eob> means learning to speak Italian, <eob> meeting new friends, <eob> reading a book, <eob> or listening to a great TED Talk. <eob>
And if, despite all of this, <eol> you are someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's, <eob> there are three lessons <eol> I've learned from my grandmother <eob> and the dozens of people I've come <eol> to know living with this disease. <eob>
Diagnosis doesn't mean <eol> you're dying tomorrow. <eob> Keep living. <eob> You won't lose your emotional memory. <eob>
You'll still be able <eol> to understand love and joy. <eob>
You might not remember <eol> what I said five minutes ago, <eob> but you'll remember <eol> how I made you feel. <eob>
And you are more than <eol> what you can remember. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Let's say you despise <eob> Western democracy. <eob>
Democracy, in all its trappings, <eob> free elections, town halls, <eob> endless debates about <eol> the proper role of government. <eob>
Too messy, <eob> too unpredictable, <eob> too constraining for your taste. <eob>
And the way these democracies band <eol> together and lecture everyone else <eob> about individual rights and freedoms -- <eob> it gets under your skin. <eob>
So what to do about it? <eob> You can call out the hypocrisy and failures <eol> of Western democracies <eob> and explain how your way is better, <eob> but that's never really worked for you. <eob>
What if you could get the people <eob> whose support is the very <eol> foundation of these democracies <eob> to start questioning the system? <eob>
Make the idea occur in their own minds <eob> that democracy and its institutions <eol> are failing them, <eob> their elite are corrupt puppet masters <eob> and the country they knew <eol> is in free fall. <eob>
To do that, <eob> you'll need to infiltrate <eol> the information spheres <eob> of these democracies. <eob>
You'll need to turn their most powerful <eol> asset -- <eob> an open mind -- <eob> into their greatest vulnerability. <eob>
You'll need people to question the truth. <eob>
Now, you'll be familiar of hacking and leaks <eol> that happened in 2016. <eob>
One was the Democratic National Committee's networks, <eob> and the personal email <eol> accounts of its staff, <eob> later released on WikiLeaks. <eob>
After that, various online personas, <eob> like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal <eol> who didn't speak Romanian, <eob> aggressively pushed news <eol> of these leaks to journalists. <eob>
The media took the bait. <eob>
They were consumed by how <eol> much the DNC hated Bernie. <eob>
At the time, it was that narrative <eol> that far outshined the news <eob> that a group of Russian government <eol> sponsored hackers <eob> who we called "Advanced Persistent Threat 28," <eob> or "APT28" for short, <eob> was carrying out these operations <eol> against the US. <eob>
And there was no shortage of evidence. <eob>
This group of Russian government hackers <eol> hadn't just appeared out of nowhere <eob> in 2016. <eob>
We had started tracking this group <eol> back in 2014. <eob>
And the tools that APT28 used to compromise <eol> its victims' networks <eob> demonstrated a thoughtful, well-resourced effort <eob> that had taken place for now over a decade <eob> in Moscow's time zone <eob> from about 9 am to 6 pm. <eob>
APT28 loved to prey <eol> on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya, <eob> the Georgian government, eastern <eol> European defense attachés — <eob> all targets with an undeniable <eol> interest to the Russian government. <eob>
We weren't the only ones onto this. <eob>
Governments, research teams <eol> across the world, <eob> were coming to similar conclusions <eob> and observing the same types of operations. <eob>
But what Russia was doing <eob> in 2016 <eob> went far beyond espionage. <eob>
The DNC hack was just one of many <eol> where stolen data was posted online <eob> accompanied by a sensational narrative, <eob> then amplified in social media <eob> for lightning-speed adoption <eol> by the media. <eob>
This didn't ring the alarm bells <eob> that a nation-state was trying <eol> to interfere with the credibility <eob> of another's internal affairs. <eob>
So why, collectively, <eol> did we not see this coming? <eob>
Why did it take months before Americans understood <eob> that they were under a state-sponsored <eol> information attack? <eob>
The easy answer is politics. <eob>
The Obama Administration <eol> was caught in a perfect catch-22. <eob>
By raising the specter that the Russian government <eol> was interfering <eob> in the US presidential campaign, <eob> the Administration risked appearing <eol> to meddle in the campaign itself. <eob>
But the better answer, I think, <eob> is that the US and the West <eol> were utterly unequipped <eob> to recognize and respond <eol> to a modern information operation, <eob> despite the fact <eol> that the US had wielded information <eob> with devastating success in an era <eol> not so long ago. <eob>
Look, so while the US and the West <eol> spent the last 20 years <eob> caught up in cybersecurity -- <eob> what networks to harden, <eob> which infrastructure to deem critical, <eob> how to set up armies of cyber warriors <eol> and cyber commands -- <eob> Russia was thinking in far <eol> more consequential terms. <eob>
Before the first iPhone even hit the shelf, <eob> the Russian government <eol> understood the risks and the opportunity <eob> that technology provided <eob> and the inter-communication <eol> and instant communication it provided us. <eob>
As our realities are increasingly <eol> based on the information <eob> that we're consuming <eol> at the palm of our hand <eob> and from the news feeds <eol> that we're scanning <eob> and the hashtags <eol> and stories that we see trending, <eob> the Russian government <eol> was the first to recognize <eob> how this evolution <eob> had turned your mind <eol> into the most exploitable device on the planet. <eob>
And your mind is particularly exploitable <eob> if you're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information, <eob> now increasingly curated <eol> to your own tastes. <eob>
This panorama of information <eol> that's so interesting to you <eob> gives a state, or anyone for that matter, <eol> a perfect back door into your mind. <eob>
It's this new brand of state-spons <eol>ored information operations <eob> that can be that much more successful, <eob> more insidious, <eob> and harder for the target audience -- <eol> that includes the media -- <eob> to decipher and characterize. <eob>
If you can get a hashtag trending on Twitter, <eob> or chum the waters with fake news <eob> directed to audiences primed <eol> to receive it, <eob> or drive journalists <eol> to dissect terabytes of email <eob> for a cent of impropriety -- <eob> all tactics used in Russian operations -- <eob> then you've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations <eob> in the mind of your target. <eob>
This is what Russia's long called <eol> "reflexive control." <eob> It's the ability to use <eol> information on someone else <eob> so that they make a decision <eob> on their own accord <eob> that's favorable to you. <eob>
This is nation-state-grade image control <eol> and perception management, <eob> and it's conducted by any means, <eob> with any tools, network-based or otherwise, <eol> that will achieve it. <eob>
Take this for another example. <eob> In early February 2014, a few weeks <eol> before Russia would invade Crimea, <eob> a phone call is posted on YouTube. <eob> In it, there's two US diplomats. <eob>
They sound like they're playing <eol> kingmaker in Ukraine, <eob> and worse, they curse the EU for its lack of speed and leadership <eob> in resolving the crisis. <eob>
The media covers the phone call, <eob> and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash <eob> leaves Washington and Europe reeling. <eob>
And it creates a fissured response <eol> and a feckless attitude <eob> towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine. <eob> Mission accomplished. <eob>
So while hacked phone calls and emails <eol> and networks <eob> keep grabbing the headlines, <eob> the real operations are the ones <eob> that are influencing the decisions you make <eob> and the opinions you hold, <eob> all in the service of a nation-state's strategic interest. <eob>
This is power in the information age. <eob>
And this information <eol> is all that much more seductive, <eob> all that much easier to take <eol> at face value and pass on, <eob> when it's authentic. <eob>
Who's not interested in the truth <eol> that's presented in phone calls and emails <eob> that were never intended <eol> for public consumption? <eob>
But how meaningful is that truth <eob> if you don't know why it's being revealed to you? <eob>
We must recognize that this place <eol> where we're increasingly living, <eob> which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace," <eob> isn't defined by ones and zeroes, <eob> but by information and the people behind it. <eob>
This is far more than a network <eol> of computers and devices. <eob>
This is a network composed of minds <eob> interacting with computers and devices. <eob>
And for this network, <eob> there's no encryption, <eol> there's no firewall, <eob> no two-factor authentication, <eob> no password complex enough to protect you. <eob>
What you have for defense <eob> is far stronger, it's more adaptable, <eol> it's always running the latest version. <eob> It's the ability to think critically: <eob> call out falsehood, <eob> press for the facts. <eob>
And above all, you must have the courage <eob> to unflinchingly pursue the truth. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: Elon, <eol> hey, welcome back to TED. <eob>
It's great to have you here. <eob>
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. <eob>
CA: So, in the next half hour or so, <eob> we're going to spend some time <eob> exploring your vision for what an exciting <eol> future might look like, <eob> which I guess makes the first <eol> question a little ironic: <eob> Why are you boring? <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> I ask myself that frequently. <eob>
We're trying to dig a hole under LA, <eob> and this is to create the beginning <eob> of what will hopefully be a 3D <eol> network of tunnels <eob> to alleviate congestion. <eob>
So right now, one of the most soul-destroying <eol> things is traffic. <eob>
It affects people <eol> in every part of the world. <eob>
It takes away so much of your life. <eob> It's horrible. <eob> It's particularly horrible in LA. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: I think you've brought with you <eob> the first visualization <eol> that's been shown of this. <eob> Can I show this? <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> absolutely. <eob>
So this is the first time — <eob> Just to show what we're talking about. <eob>
So a couple of key things <eol> that are important <eob> in having a 3D tunnel network. <eob>
First of all, you have to be able <eob> to integrate the entrance and exit <eol> of the tunnel <eob> seamlessly into the fabric <eol> of the city. <eob>
So by having an elevator, <eob> sort of a car skate, <eol> that's on an elevator, <eob> you can integrate the entrance and exits <eol> to the tunnel network <eob> just by using two parking spaces. <eob>
And then the car gets on a skate. <eob>
There's no speed limit here, <eob> so we're designing this to be able <eol> to operate at 200 kilometers an hour. <eob>
CA: How much? <eob>
EM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 <eol> miles per hour. <eob>
So you should be able to get from, say, <eol> Westwood to LAX <eob> in six minutes -- five, six minutes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: So possibly, initially done, <eob> it's like on a sort <eol> of toll road-type basis. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob>
CA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic <eob> from the surface streets as well. <eob>
EM: So, I don't know if people noticed it in the video, <eob> but there's no real limit to how many <eol> levels of tunnel you can have. <eob>
You can go much further deep <eol> than you can go up. <eob>
The deepest mines are much deeper <eol> than the tallest buildings are tall, <eob> so you can alleviate any arbitrary level <eol> of urban congestion <eob> with a 3D tunnel network. <eob>
This is a very important point. <eob>
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels <eol> is that if you add one layer of tunnels, <eob> that will simply alleviate <eol> congestion, it will get used up, <eob> and then you'll be back <eol> where you started, back with congestion. <eob>
But you can go to any <eol> arbitrary number of tunnels, <eob> any number of levels. <eob>
CA: But people -- seen traditionally, <eol> it's incredibly expensive to dig, <eob> and that would block this idea. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Well, they're right. <eob> To give you an example, the LA <eol> subway extension, <eob> which is — I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension <eob> that was just completed <eol> for two billion dollars. <eob>
So it's roughly a billion dollars <eol> a mile to do the subway extension in LA. <eob>
And this is not the highest <eol> utility subway in the world. <eob>
So yeah, it's quite difficult <eol> to dig tunnels normally. <eob>
I think we need to have <eol> at least a tenfold improvement <eob> in the cost per mile of tunneling. <eob>
CA: And how could you achieve that? <eob>
EM: Actually, if you just do two things, <eob> you can get to approximately an order <eol> of magnitude improvement, <eob> and I think you can go beyond that. <eob>
So the first thing to do <eol> is to cut the tunnel diameter <eob> by a factor of two or more. <eob>
So a single road lane tunnel <eol> according to regulations <eob> has to be 26 feet, <eol> maybe 28 feet in diameter <eob> to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles <eob> and sufficient ventilation <eol> for combustion engine cars. <eob>
But if you shrink that diameter <eol> to what we're attempting, <eob> which is 12 feet, <eol> which is plenty to get an electric skate through, <eob> you drop the diameter by a factor of two <eob> and the cross-sectional area <eol> by a factor of four, <eob> and the tunneling cost scales <eol> with the cross-sectional area. <eob>
So that's roughly a half-order <eol> of magnitude improvement right there. <eob>
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel <eol> for half the time, then they stop, <eob> and then the rest of the time <eol> is putting in reinforcements <eob> for the tunnel wall. <eob>
So if you design the machine instead <eob> to do continuous tunneling <eol> and reinforcing, <eob> that will give you a factor <eol> of two improvement. <eob>
Combine that and that's a factor of eight. <eob>
Also these machines are far from being <eol> at their power or thermal limits, <eob> so you can jack up the power <eol> to the machine substantially. <eob>
I think you can get at least <eol> a factor of two, <eob> maybe a factor of four or five improvement <eol> on top of that. <eob>
So I think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps <eob> to get somewhere in excess <eol> of an order of magnitude improvement <eob> in the cost per mile, <eob> and our target actually is -- <eob> we've got a pet snail called Gary, <eob> this is from Gary the snail <eol> from "South Park," <eob> I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So Gary is capable of -- <eob> currently he's capable <eol> of going 14 times faster <eob> than a tunnel-boring machine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: You want to beat Gary. <eob>
EM: We want to beat Gary. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He's not a patient little fellow, <eob> and that will be victory. <eob>
Victory is beating the snail. <eob>
CA: But a lot of people imagining, <eol> dreaming about future cities, <eob> they imagine that actually the solution <eol> is flying cars, drones, etc. <eob> You go aboveground. <eob> Why isn't that a better solution? <eob>
You save all that tunneling cost. <eob>
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things. <eob>
Obviously, I do rockets, <eol> so I like things that fly. <eob>
This is not some inherent bias <eol> against flying things, <eob> but there is a challenge with flying cars <eob> in that they'll be quite noisy, <eob> the wind force generated will be very high. <eob>
Let's just say that if something's flying <eol> over your head, <eob> a whole bunch of flying cars <eol> going all over the place, <eob> that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. <eob>
You don't think to yourself, <eol> "Well, I feel better about today." <eob> You're thinking, "Did they service their hubcap, <eob> or is it going to come off <eol> and guillotine me?" <eob> Things like that. <eob>
CA: So you've got this vision <eob> of future cities with these rich, <eol> 3D networks of tunnels underneath. <eob>
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? <eob>
Could you apply these tunnels <eol> to use for this Hyperloop idea <eob> you released a few years ago. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> so we've been sort of puttering around <eob> with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. <eob>
We built a Hyperloop test <eol> track adjacent to SpaceX, <eob> just for a student competition, <eob> to encourage innovative ideas in transport. <eob>
And it actually ends up being <eol> the biggest vacuum chamber in the world <eob> after the Large Hadron Collider, <eob> by volume. <eob>
So it was quite fun to do that, <eol> but it was kind of a hobby thing, <eob> and then we think we might -- <eob> so we've built a little pusher car <eol> to push the student pods, <eob> but we're going to try seeing <eol> how fast we can make the pusher go <eob> if it's not pushing something. <eob>
So we're cautiously optimistic <eob> we'll be able to be faster <eol> than the world's fastest bullet train <eob> even in a .8-mile stretch. <eob>
CA: Whoa. Good brakes. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> I mean, it's — yeah. <eob>
It's either going to smash <eol> into tiny pieces or go quite fast. <eob>
CA: But you can picture, then, <eol> a Hyperloop in a tunnel <eob> running quite long distances. <eob>
EM: Exactly. <eob> And looking at tunneling technology, <eob> it turns out that in order <eol> to make a tunnel, <eob> you have to -- <eob> In order to seal against the water table, <eob> you've got to typically design a tunnel <eol> wall to be good <eob> to about five or six atmospheres. <eob>
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, <eob> or near-vacuum. <eob>
So actually, it sort of turns out <eol> that automatically, <eob> if you build a tunnel that is good enough <eol> to resist the water table, <eob> it is automatically capable <eol> of holding vacuum. <eob>
CA: Huh. <eob>
EM: So, yeah. <eob>
CA: And so you could actually picture, <eob> what kind of length tunnel <eol> is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop? <eob>
EM: I think there's no real length limit. <eob>
You could dig as much as you want. <eob>
I think if you were to do something <eob> like a DC-to-New York <eol> Hyperloop, <eob> I think you'd probably want <eol> to go underground the entire way <eob> because it's a high-density area. <eob>
You're going under a lot <eol> of buildings and houses, <eob> and if you go deep enough, <eob> you cannot detect the tunnel. <eob>
Sometimes people think, well, <eol> it's going to be pretty annoying <eob> to have a tunnel dug <eol> under my house. <eob>
Like, if that tunnel is dug <eob> more than about three or four tunnel <eol> diameters beneath your house, <eob> you will not be able to detect it <eol> being dug at all. <eob>
In fact, if you're able to detect <eol> the tunnel being dug, <eob> whatever device you are using, <eob> you can get a lot of money <eol> for that device from the Israeli military, <eob> who is trying to detect tunnels <eol> from Hamas, <eob> and from the US Customs and Border patrol <eol> that try and detect drug tunnels. <eob>
So the reality is <eob> that earth is incredibly good <eol> at absorbing vibrations, <eob> and once the tunnel <eol> depth is below a certain level, <eob> it is undetectable. <eob>
Maybe if you have a very <eol> sensitive seismic instrument, <eob> you might be able to detect it. <eob>
CA: So you've started <eol> a new company to do this <eob> called The Boring Company. <eob> Very nice. Very funny. <eob>
EM: What's funny about that? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: How much <eob> of your time is this? <eob>
EM: It's maybe ... <eob> two or three percent. <eob>
CA: You've bought a hobby. <eob>
This is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EM: I mean, it really is, like -- <eob> This is basically interns <eol> and people doing it part time. <eob>
We bought some second-hand machinery. <eob>
It's kind of puttering along, <eol> but it's making good progress, so -- <eob>
CA: So an even bigger part of your time <eob> is being spent on electrifying cars <eol> and transport through Tesla. <eob>
Is one of the motivations <eol> for the tunneling project <eob> the realization that actually, <eob> in a world where cars are electric <eol> and where they're self-driving, <eob> there may end up being more cars <eol> on the roads <eob> on any given hour <eol> than there are now? <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> exactly. <eob>
A lot of people think <eol> that when you make cars autonomous, <eob> they'll be able to go faster <eol> and that will alleviate congestion. <eob>
And to some degree that will be true, <eob> but once you have shared autonomy <eol> where it's much cheaper to go by car <eob> and you can go point to point, <eob> the affordability of going in a car <eol> will be better than that of a bus. <eob>
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. <eob>
So the amount of driving that will occur <eol> will be much greater with shared autonomy, <eob> and actually traffic will get far worse. <eob>
CA: You started Tesla with the goal <eol> of persuading the world <eob> that electrification was the future of cars, <eob> and a few years ago, <eol> people were laughing at you. <eob>
Now, not so much. <eob>
EM: OK. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I don't know. I don't know. <eob>
CA: But isn't it true <eol> that pretty much every auto manufacturer <eob> has announced serious electrification plans <eob> for the short- to medium-term future? <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Yeah. <eob> I think almost every automaker <eol> has some electric vehicle program. <eob>
They vary in seriousness. <eob>
Some are very serious about transitioning <eol> entirely to electric, <eob> and some are just dabbling in it. <eob>
And some, amazingly, are still <eol> pursuing fuel cells, <eob> but I think that won't last much longer. <eob>
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon, <eob> where you can now just declare victory <eol> and say, you know, "We did it." <eob> Let the world electrify, <eol> and you go on and focus on other stuff? <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> I intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine, <eob> and there are a lot of exciting <eol> things that we have coming. <eob>
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. <eob>
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. <eob>
CA: OK, we're going to come to this. <eob>
So Model 3, it's supposed <eol> to be coming in July-ish. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> it's looking quite good <eol> for starting production in July. <eob>
CA: Wow. <eob> One of the things that people <eol> are so excited about <eob> is the fact that it's got autopilot. <eob>
And you put out this video a while back <eob> showing what that technology <eol> would look like. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> There's obviously autopilot <eol> in Model S right now. <eob> What are we seeing here? <eob> Yeah. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> so this is using only cameras and GPS. <eob>
So there's no LIDAR <eol> or radar being used here. <eob>
This is just using passive optical, <eol> which is essentially what a person uses. <eob>
The whole road system <eol> is meant to be navigated <eob> with passive optical, or cameras, <eob> and so once you solve cameras <eob> or vision, <eob> then autonomy is solved. <eob>
If you don't solve vision, <eol> it's not solved. <eob>
So that's why our focus is so heavily <eol> on having a vision neural net <eob> that's very effective for road conditions. <eob>
CA: Right. Many other people <eol> are going the LIDAR route. <eob>
You want cameras plus radar is most of it. <eob>
EM: You can absolutely be superhuman <eol> with just cameras. <eob>
Like, you can probably do it <eol> ten times better than humans would, <eob> just cameras. <eob>
CA: So the new cars being sold right now <eol> have eight cameras in them. <eob>
They can't yet do what that showed. <eob>
When will they be able to? <eob>
EM: I think we're still on track <eol> for being able to go cross-country <eob> from LA to New York by the end of the year, <eol> fully autonomous. <eob>
CA: OK, so by the end <eol> of the year, you're saying, <eob> someone's going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel, <eob> tap in "New York," off it goes. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob>
CA: Won't ever have to touch <eol> the wheel -- by the end of 2017. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Essentially, November <eol> or December of this year, <eob> we should be able to go <eol> all the way from a parking lot in California <eob> to a parking lot in New York, <eob> no controls touched at any point <eol> during the entire journey. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: Amazing. <eob> But part of that is possible <eob> because you've already got a fleet <eol> of Teslas driving all these roads. <eob>
You're accumulating a huge amount <eol> of data of that national road system. <eob>
EM: Yes, but the thing <eol> that will be interesting <eob> is that I'm actually fairly confident it <eol> will be able to do that route <eob> even if you change the route dynamically. <eob>
So, it's fairly easy -- <eob> If you say I'm going to be really good <eol> at one specific route, that's one thing, <eob> but it should be able to go, <eol> really be very good, <eob> certainly once you enter a highway, <eob> to go anywhere on the highway system <eob> in a given country. <eob>
So it's not sort of limited <eol> to LA to New York. <eob>
We could change it and make <eol> it Seattle-Florida, <eob> that day, in real time. <eob>
So you were going from LA to New York. <eob>
Now go from LA to Toronto. <eob>
CA: So leaving aside <eol> regulation for a second, <eob> in terms of the technology alone, <eob> the time when someone will be able <eol> to buy one of your cars <eob> and literally just take <eol> the hands off the wheel and go to sleep <eob> and wake up and find <eol> that they've arrived, <eob> how far away is that, to do that safely? <eob>
EM: I think that's about two years. <eob>
So the real trick of it is not <eol> how do you make it work <eob> say 99.9 percent of the time, <eob> because, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times, <eob> then you're probably still not going <eol> to be comfortable falling asleep. <eob>
You shouldn't be, certainly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's never going to be perfect. <eob>
No system is going to be perfect, <eob> but if you say it's perhaps -- <eob> the car is unlikely to crash <eob> in a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes, <eob> then people are like, OK, wow, <eol> if I were to live a thousand lives, <eob> I would still most likely never experience <eol> a crash, <eob> then that's probably OK. <eob>
CA: To sleep. <eob> I guess the big concern of yours <eol> is that people may actually <eob> get seduced too early <eol> to think that this is safe, <eob> and that you'll have some horrible <eol> incident happen that puts things back. <eob>
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy <eol> system is likely to at least mitigate the crash, <eob> except in rare circumstances. <eob>
The thing to appreciate <eol> about vehicle safety <eob> is this is probabilistic. <eob>
I mean, there's some chance that any time <eol> a human driver gets in a car, <eob> that they will have an accident <eol> that is their fault. <eob>
It's never zero. <eob>
So really the key threshold for autonomy <eob> is how much better does autonomy <eol> need to be than a person <eob> before you can rely on it? <eob>
CA: But once you get <eol> literally safe hands-off driving, <eob> the power to disrupt the whole <eol> industry seems massive, <eob> because at that point you've spoken of people <eol> being able to buy a car, <eob> drops you off at work, <eol> and then you let it go <eob> and provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people, <eob> earn you money, <eob> maybe even cover the cost <eol> of your lease of that car, <eob> so you can kind of get a car for free. <eob>
Is that really likely? <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Absolutely this is what will happen. <eob>
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet <eob> where you buy your car <eob> and you can choose to use <eol> that car exclusively, <eob> you could choose to have <eol> it be used only by friends and family, <eob> only by other drivers <eol> who are rated five star, <eob> you can choose to share it <eol> sometimes but not other times. <eob>
That's 100 percent what will occur. <eob>
It's just a question of when. <eob>
CA: Wow. <eob> So you mentioned the Semi <eob> and I think you're planning <eol> to announce this in September, <eob> but I'm curious whether there's anything <eol> you could show us today? <eob>
EM: I will show you a teaser <eol> shot of the truck. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's alive. <eob>
CA: OK. <eob>
EM: That's definitely a case <eol> where we want to be cautious <eob> about the autonomy features. <eob> Yeah. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: We can't see that much of it, <eob> but it doesn't look like just <eol> a little friendly neighborhood truck. <eob>
It looks kind of badass. <eob>
What sort of semi is this? <eob>
EM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck. <eob>
So it's the highest weight capability <eob> and with long range. <eob>
So essentially it's meant <eol> to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads. <eob>
And this is something <eol> which people do not today think is possible. <eob>
They think the truck doesn't have enough power <eol> or it doesn't have enough range, <eob> and then with the Tesla Semi <eob> we want to show that no, an electric truck <eob> actually can out-torque <eol> any diesel semi. <eob>
And if you had a tug-of-war competition, <eob> the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: That's pretty cool. <eob>
And short term, these aren't driverless. <eob>
These are going to be trucks <eol> that truck drivers want to drive. <eob>
EM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this <eob> is you have a flat torque RPM curve <eol> with an electric motor, <eob> whereas with a diesel motor or any <eol> kind of internal combustion engine car, <eob> you've got a torque RPM curve <eol> that looks like a hill. <eob>
So this will be a very spry truck. <eob>
You can drive this around <eol> like a sports car. <eob>
There's no gears. It's, <eol> like, single speed. <eob>
CA: There's a great movie <eol> to be made here somewhere. <eob>
I don't know what it is and I don't know <eol> that it ends well, <eob> but it's a great movie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving. <eob>
When I was driving the test prototype <eol> for the first truck. <eob> It's really weird, because you're driving around <eob> and you're just so nimble, <eol> and you're in this giant truck. <eob>
CA: Wait, you've already <eol> driven a prototype? <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> I drove it around the parking lot, <eob> and I was like, this is crazy. <eob>
CA: Wow. <eob> This is no vaporware. <eob>
EM: It's just like, driving <eol> this giant truck <eob> and making these mad maneuvers. <eob>
CA: <eob> This is cool. <eob>
OK, from a really badass picture <eob> to a kind of less badass picture. <eob>
This is just a cute house <eol> from "Desperate Housewives" or something. <eob>
What on earth is going on here? <eob> EM: Well, this illustrates <eol> the picture of the future <eob> that I think is how things <eol> will evolve. <eob>
You've got an electric car <eol> in the driveway. <eob>
If you look in between <eol> the electric car and the house, <eob> there are actually three Powerwalls stacked <eol> up against the side of the house, <eob> and then that house roof <eol> is a solar roof. <eob>
So that's an actual solar glass roof. <eob>
CA: OK. <eob>
EM: That's a picture of a real -- <eol> well, admittedly, it's a real fake house. <eob>
That's a real fake house. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: So these roof tiles, <eob> some of them have in them basically <eol> solar power, the ability to -- <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Solar glass tiles <eob> where you can adjust <eol> the texture and the color <eob> to a very fine-grained level, <eob> and then there's sort <eol> of microlouvers in the glass, <eob> such that when you're looking <eol> at the roof from street level <eob> or close to street level, <eob> all the tiles look the same <eob> whether there is a solar cell behind it or not. <eob>
So you have an even color <eob> from the ground level. <eob>
If you were to look at it from a helicopter, <eob> you would be actually able to look <eol> through and see <eob> that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell <eol> behind them and some do not. <eob>
CA: You put them in the ones <eol> that are likely to see a lot of sun, <eob> and that makes these roofs <eol> super affordable, right? <eob>
They're not that much more expensive <eol> than just tiling the roof. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> We're very confident <eol> that the cost of the roof <eob> plus the cost of electricity -- <eob> A solar glass roof will be less <eol> than the cost of a normal roof <eob> plus the cost of electricity. <eob>
So in other words, <eob> this will be economically a no-brainer, <eob> we think it will look great, <eob> and it will last -- <eob> We thought about having the warranty be infinity, <eob> but then people thought, <eob> well, that might sound like <eol> were just talking rubbish, <eob> but actually this is toughened glass. <eob>
Well after the house has collapsed <eob> and there's nothing there, <eob> the glass tiles will still be there. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: I mean, this is cool. <eob>
So you're rolling this out <eol> in a couple week's time, I think, <eob> with four different roofing types. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> we're starting off with two, <eol> two initially, <eob> and the second two will be introduced <eol> early next year. <eob>
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here? <eob>
How many houses do you believe could end <eol> up having this type of roofing? <eob>
EM: I think eventually <eob> almost all houses will have a solar roof. <eob>
The thing is to consider <eol> the time scale here <eob> to be probably on the order <eob> of 40 or 50 years. <eob>
So on average, a roof <eol> is replaced every 20 to 25 years. <eob>
But you don't start replacing <eol> all roofs immediately. <eob>
But eventually, if you say <eol> were to fast-forward <eob> to say 15 years from now, <eob> it will be unusual to have a roof <eol> that does not have solar. <eob>
CA: Is there a mental model thing <eol> that people don't get here <eob> that because of the shift in the cost, <eol> the economics of solar power, <eob> most houses actually have enough sunlight <eol> on their roof <eob> pretty much to power <eol> all of their needs. <eob>
If you could capture the power, <eob> it could pretty much power <eol> all their needs. <eob>
You could go off-grid, kind of. <eob>
EM: It depends on where you are <eob> and what the house size <eol> is relative to the roof area, <eob> but it's a fair statement to say <eob> that most houses in the US <eol> have enough roof area <eob> to power all the needs of the house. <eob>
CA: So the key <eol> to the economics <eob> of the cars, the Semi, of these houses <eob> is the falling price of lithium-ion batteries, <eob> which you've made a huge bet <eol> on as Tesla. <eob>
In many ways, that's almost <eol> the core competency. <eob>
And you've decided <eob> that to really, like, own that competency, <eob> you just have to build the world's largest <eol> manufacturing plant <eob> to double the world's supply <eol> of lithium-ion batteries, <eob> with this guy. What is this? <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> so that's the Gigafactory, <eob> progress so far on the Gigafactory. <eob>
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see <eob> that there's sort of a diamond shape overall, <eob> and when it's fully done, <eol> it'll look like a giant diamond, <eob> or that's the idea behind it, <eob> and it's aligned on true north. <eob>
It's a small detail. <eob>
CA: And capable of producing, eventually, <eob> like a hundred gigawatt hours <eol> of batteries a year. <eob>
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours. <eol> We think probably more, but yeah. <eob>
CA: And they're actually <eol> being produced right now. <eob>
EM: They're in production already. <eob>
CA: You guys put out this video. <eob>
I mean, is that speeded up? <eob>
EM: That's the slowed down version. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: How fast does it actually go? <eob>
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed, <eob> you can't actually see <eol> the cells without a strobe light. <eob> It's just blur. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon, <eol> about what makes an exciting future <eob> is a future where we no longer <eol> feel guilty about energy. <eob>
Help us picture this. <eob>
How many Gigafactories, if you like, <eol> does it take to get us there? <eob>
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly. <eob> It's not 10, it's not a thousand. <eob> Most likely a hundred. <eob>
CA: See, I find this amazing. <eob>
You can picture what it would take <eob> to move the world off <eol> this vast fossil fuel thing. <eob> It's like you're building one, <eob> it costs five billion dollars, <eob> or whatever, five <eol> to 10 billion dollars. <eob>
Like, it's kind of cool <eol> that you can picture that project. <eob>
And you're planning to do, <eol> at Tesla -- announce another two this year. <eob>
EM: I think we'll announce locations <eob> for somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year. <eob>
Yeah, probably four. <eob>
CA: Whoa. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> No more teasing from you for here? <eob>
Like -- where, continent? <eob> You can say no. <eob>
EM: We need to address a global market. <eob>
CA: OK. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is cool. <eob> I think we should talk for — <eob> Actually, global market. <eob>
I'm going to ask you one question <eol> about politics, only one. <eob>
I'm kind of sick of politics, <eol> but I do want to ask you this. <eob>
You're on a body now <eol> giving advice to a guy -- <eob>
EM: Who? <eob>
CA: Who has said he doesn't really believe <eol> in climate change, <eob> and there's a lot of people out there <eol> who think you shouldn't be doing that. <eob> They'd like you to walk away from that. <eob> What would you say to them? <eob>
EM: Well, I think that first of all, <eob> I'm just on two advisory councils <eob> where the format consists <eol> of going around the room <eob> and asking people's opinion on things, <eob> and so there's like a meeting every month or two. <eob>
That's the sum total of my contribution. <eob>
But I think to the degree <eol> that there are people in the room <eob> who are arguing in favor <eol> of doing something about climate change, <eob> or social issues, <eob> I've used the meetings <eol> I've had thus far <eob> to argue in favor of immigration <eol> and in favor of climate change. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And if I hadn't done that, <eob> that wasn't on the agenda before. <eob>
So maybe nothing will happen, <eol> but at least the words were said. <eob>
CA: OK. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars. <eob>
Last time you were here, <eob> you spoke about what seemed like <eol> a kind of incredibly ambitious dream <eob> to develop rockets <eol> that were actually reusable. <eob>
And you've only gone and done it. <eob>
EM: Finally. It took a long time. <eob>
CA: Talk us through this. <eol> What are we looking at here? <eob>
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters <eob> coming back from very high <eol> and fast in space. <eob>
So just delivered the upper stage <eob> at high velocity. <eob>
I think this might have been <eol> at sort of Mach 7 or so, <eob> delivery of the upper stage. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: So that was a sped-up -- <eob>
EM: That was the slowed down version. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: I thought that was <eol> the sped-up version. <eob>
But I mean, that's amazing, <eob> and several of these failed <eob> before you finally figured out <eol> how to do it, <eob> but now you've done this, <eol> what, five or six times? <eob>
EM: We're at eight or nine. <eob>
CA: And for the first time, <eob> you've actually reflown one <eol> of the rockets that landed. <eob>
EM: Yeah, <eob> so we landed the rocket booster <eob> and then prepped it for flight <eol> again and flew it again, <eob> so it's the first reflight <eol> of an orbital booster <eob> where that reflight is relevant. <eob>
So it's important to appreciate <eol> that reusability is only relevant <eob> if it is rapid and complete. <eob>
So like an aircraft or a car, <eob> the reusability is rapid and complete. <eob>
You do not send your aircraft <eol> to Boeing in-between flights. <eob>
CA: Right. So this is allowing you <eol> to dream of this really ambitious idea <eob> of sending many, many, <eol> many people to Mars <eob> in, what, 10 or 20 years time, <eol> I guess. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob>
CA: And you've designed <eol> this outrageous rocket to do it. <eob>
Help us understand <eol> the scale of this thing. <eob>
EM: Well, visually you can see <eol> that's a person. <eob>
Yeah, and that's the vehicle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: So if that was a skyscraper, <eob> that's like, did I read <eol> that, a 40-story skyscraper? <eob>
EM: Probably a little more, yeah. <eob>
The thrust level of this <eol> is really -- <eob> This configuration is about four times <eol> the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. <eob>
CA: Four times the thrust <eol> of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before. <eob>
EM: Yeah. <eob> Yeah. <eob>
CA: As one does. <eob> EM: Yeah. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In units of 747, a 747 is only about <eol> a quarter of a million pounds of thrust, <eob> so for every 10 million <eol> pounds of thrust, <eob> there's 40 747s. <eob>
So this would be the thrust <eol> equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing. <eob>
CA: And so even with a machine designed <eol> to escape Earth's gravity, <eob> I think you told me last time <eob> this thing could actually take <eol> a fully loaded 747, <eob> people, cargo, everything, <eob> into orbit. <eob>
EM: Exactly. <eob> This can take a fully loaded 747 <eol> with maximum fuel, <eob> maximum passengers, maximum cargo <eol> on the 747 — <eob> this can take it as cargo. <eob>
CA: So based on this, <eob> you presented recently this Interplanetary <eol> Transport System <eob> which is visualized this way. <eob>
This is a scene you picture in, <eol> what, 30 years time? 20 years time? <eob> People walking into this rocket. <eob>
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of an eight- <eol> to 10-year time frame. <eob>
Aspirationally, that's our target. <eob>
Our internal targets are more <eol> aggressive, but I think -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: OK. <eob>
EM: While vehicle seems quite large <eob> and is large by comparison <eol> with other rockets, <eob> I think the future spacecraft <eob> will make this look like a rowboat. <eob>
The future spaceships <eol> will be truly enormous. <eob>
CA: Why, Elon? <eob>
Why do we need to build a city on Mars <eob> with a million people <eol> on it in your lifetime, <eob> which I think is kind of what you've said <eol> you'd love to do? <eob>
EM: I think it's important to have <eob> a future that is inspiring and appealing. <eob>
I just think there have to be reasons <eob> that you get up in the morning <eol> and you want to live. <eob>
Like, why do you want to live? <eob>
What's the point? What inspires you? <eob> What do you love about the future? <eob>
And if we're not out there, <eob> if the future does not include <eol> being out there among the stars <eob> and being a multiplanet species, <eob> I find that it's incredibly depressing <eob> if that's not the future <eol> that we're going to have. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: People want to position <eol> this as an either or, <eob> that there are so many desperate things <eol> happening on the planet now <eob> from climate to poverty to, <eol> you know, you pick your issue. <eob>
And this feels like a distraction. <eob> You shouldn't be thinking about this. <eob> You should be solving what's here and now. <eob>
And to be fair, you've done a fair old bit <eol> to actually do that <eob> with your work on sustainable energy. <eob> But why not just do that? <eob>
EM: I think there's -- <eob> I look at the future <eol> from the standpoint of probabilities. <eob>
It's like a branching stream <eol> of probabilities, <eob> and there are actions that we can take <eol> that affect those probabilities <eob> or that accelerate one thing <eol> or slow down another thing. <eob>
I may introduce something new <eol> to the probability stream. <eob>
Sustainable energy will happen <eol> no matter what. <eob>
If there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed, <eob> it would have to happen <eol> out of necessity. <eob> It's tautological. <eob> If you don't have sustainable energy, <eol> it means you have unsustainable energy. <eob>
Eventually you will run out, <eob> and the laws of economics <eol> will drive civilization <eob> towards sustainable energy, <eob> inevitably. <eob>
The fundamental value <eol> of a company like Tesla <eob> is the degree to which <eol> it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy, <eob> faster than it would otherwise occur. <eob>
So when I think, like, <eob> what is the fundamental good <eol> of a company like Tesla, <eob> I would say, hopefully, <eob> if it accelerated that by a decade, <eol> potentially more than a decade, <eob> that would be quite a good <eol> thing to occur. <eob>
That's what I consider to be <eob> the fundamental aspirational <eol> good of Tesla. <eob>
Then there's becoming a multiplanet species <eol> and space-faring civilization. <eob> This is not inevitable. <eob>
It's very important to appreciate <eol> this is not inevitable. <eob>
The sustainable energy future <eol> I think is largely inevitable, <eob> but being a space-faring civilization <eol> is definitely not inevitable. <eob>
If you look at the progress in space, <eob> in 1969 you were able <eol> to send somebody to the moon. <eob> 1969. <eob> Then we had the Space Shuttle. <eob>
The Space Shuttle could only take people <eol> to low Earth orbit. <eob>
Then the Space Shuttle retired, <eob> and the United States <eol> could take no one to orbit. <eob>
So that's the trend. <eob>
The trend is like down to nothing. <eob>
People are mistaken when they think <eob> that technology just automatically <eol> improves. <eob>
It does not automatically improve. <eob>
It only improves if a lot of people <eol> work very hard to make it better, <eob> and actually it will, I think, <eol> by itself degrade, actually. <eob>
You look at great civilizations <eol> like Ancient Egypt, <eob> and they were able to make <eol> the pyramids, <eob> and they forgot how to do that. <eob>
And then the Romans, they built <eol> these incredible aqueducts. <eob>
They forgot how to do it. <eob>
CA: Elon, it almost seems, <eol> listening to you <eob> and looking at the different things <eol> you've done, <eob> that you've got this unique <eol> double motivation on everything <eob> that I find so interesting. <eob> One is this desire to work <eol> for humanity's long-term good. <eob>
The other is the desire to do <eol> something exciting. <eob>
And often it feels like you feel <eol> like you need the one to drive the other. <eob>
With Tesla, you want <eol> to have sustainable energy, <eob> so you made these super sexy, <eol> exciting cars to do it. <eob>
Solar energy, we need to get there, <eob> so we need to make these beautiful roofs. <eob>
We haven't even spoken about <eol> your newest thing, <eob> which we don't have time to do, <eob> but you want to save humanity <eol> from bad AI, <eob> and so you're going to create <eol> this really cool brain-machine interface <eob> to give us all infinite memory <eol> and telepathy and so forth. <eob>
And on Mars, it feels like <eol> what you're saying is, <eob> yeah, we need to save humanity <eob> and have a backup plan, <eob> but also we need to inspire humanity, <eob> and this is a way to inspire. <eob>
EM: I think the value <eol> of beauty and inspiration <eob> is very much underrated, <eob> no question. <eob> But I want to be clear. <eob>
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. <eob>
That is not the -- <eob> I'm just trying to think about the future <eob> and not be sad. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: Beautiful statement. <eob> I think everyone here would agree <eob> that it is not — <eob> None of this is going to happen <eob> inevitably. <eob>
The fact that in your mind, <eol> you dream this stuff, <eob> you dream stuff that no one else <eol> would dare dream, <eob> or no one else would be capable of dreaming <eob> at the level of complexity that you do. <eob>
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk, <eol> is a really remarkable thing. <eob>
Thank you for helping us all <eol> to dream a bit bigger. <eob>
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever starts <eol> getting genuinely insane, right? <eob>
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk. <eob>
That was really, really fantastic. <eob>
That was really fantastic. <eob>
Getting a college education <eob> is a 20-year investment. <eob>
When you're growing up poor, <eob> you're not accustomed to thinking <eol> that far ahead. <eob>
Instead, you're thinking about where <eol> you're going to get your next meal <eob> and how your family is going <eol> to pay rent that month. <eob>
Besides, my parents <eol> and my friends' parents <eob> seemed to be doing just fine <eol> driving taxis and working as janitors. <eob>
It wasn't until I was a teenager <eob> when I realized I didn't want <eol> to do those things. <eob>
By then, I was two-thirds <eol> of the way through my education, <eob> and it was almost too late <eol> to turn things around. <eob>
When you grow up poor, <eol> you want to be rich. <eob>
I was no different. <eob>
I'm the second-oldest of seven, <eob> and was raised by a single mother <eol> on government aid <eob> in Queens, New York. <eob>
By virtue of growing up low-income, <eob> my siblings and I went to some <eol> of New York City's <eob> most struggling public schools. <eob>
I had over 60 absences <eol> when I was in seventh grade, <eob> because I didn't feel like going to class. <eob>
My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate, <eob> and even worse, <eob> only 20 percent of the kids graduating <eob> were college-ready. <eob>
When I actually did make it to college, <eob> I told my friend Brennan <eob> how our teachers would always <eol> ask us to raise our hands <eob> if we were going to college. <eob>
I was taken aback when Brennan said, <eob> "Karim, I've never been asked <eol> that question before." <eob> It was always, "What college are you going to?" <eob> Just the way that question is phrased <eob> made it unacceptable for him <eol> not to have gone to college. <eob>
Nowadays I get asked a different question. <eob> "How were you able to make it out?" <eob> For years I said I was lucky, <eob> but it's not just luck. <eob>
When my older brother <eol> and I graduated from high school <eob> at the very same time <eob> and he later dropped <eol> out of a two-year college, <eob> I wanted to understand <eol> why he dropped out <eob> and I kept studying. <eob>
It wasn't until I got to Cornell <eol> as a Presidential Research Scholar <eob> that I started to learn about the very real <eol> educational consequences <eob> of being raised by a single mother <eol> on government aid <eob> and attending the schools that I did. <eob>
That's when my older brother's trajectory <eol> began to make complete sense to me. <eob>
I also learned that our most admirable <eol> education reformers, <eob> people like Arne Duncan, the former US Secretary of Education, <eob> or Wendy Kopp, the founder <eol> of Teach For America, <eob> had never attended an inner city public school like I had. <eob>
So much of our education reform <eol> is driven by a sympathetic approach, <eob> where people are saying, <eob> "Let's go and help <eol> these poor inner city kids, <eob> or these poor black and Latino kids," <eob> instead of an empathetic approach, <eob> where someone like me, who had grown up <eol> in this environment, could say, <eob> "I know the adversities that you're facing <eob> and I want to help you overcome them." <eob>
Today when I get questions <eol> about how I made it out, <eob> I share that one of the biggest reasons <eob> is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help. <eob>
In a typical middle class <eol> or affluent household, <eob> if a kid is struggling, <eob> there's a good chance that a parent or a teacher <eol> will come to their rescue <eob> even if they don't ask for help. <eob>
However, if that same kid <eol> is growing up poor <eob> and doesn't ask for help, <eob> there's a good chance that no one will help them. <eob>
There are virtually no social safety <eol> nets available. <eob>
So seven years ago, <eob> I started to reform <eol> our public education system <eob> shaped by my firsthand perspective. <eob>
And I started with summer school. <eob>
Research tells us that two-thirds <eol> of the achievement gap, <eob> which is the disparity <eol> in educational attainment <eob> between rich kids and poor kids <eob> or black kids and white kids, <eob> could be directly attributed <eol> to the summer learning loss. <eob>
In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget <eol> almost three months <eob> of what they learned during the school year <eob> over the summer. <eob>
They return to school in the fall, <eob> and their teachers <eol> spend another two months <eob> reteaching them old material. <eob>
That's five months. <eob>
The school year in the United States <eol> is only 10 months. <eob>
If kids lose five months <eol> of learning every single year, <eob> that's half of their education. <eob> Half. <eob>
If kids were in school <eob> over the summer, <eob> then they couldn't regress, <eob> but traditional summer school <eol> is poorly designed. <eob>
For kids it feels like punishment, <eob> and for teachers <eol> it feels like babysitting. <eob>
But how can we expect principals <eol> to execute an effective summer program <eob> when the school year ends <eol> the last week of June <eob> and then summer school <eol> starts just one week later? <eob>
There just isn't enough time <eol> to find the right people, <eob> sort out the logistics, <eob> and design an engaging curriculum <eol> that excites kids and teachers. <eob>
But what if we created a program <eob> over the summer <eob> that empowered teachers <eol> as teaching coaches <eob> to develop aspiring educators? <eob>
What if we empowered <eol> college-educated role models <eob> as teaching fellows <eob> to help kids realize their college ambitions? <eob>
What if empowered high-achieving kids <eob> as mentors to tutor their younger peers <eob> and inspire them to invest <eol> in their education? <eob>
What if we empowered <eol> all kids as scholars, <eob> asked them what colleges <eol> they were going to, <eob> designed a summer school <eol> they want to attend <eob> to completely eliminate the summer learning loss <eob> and close two-thirds <eol> of the achievement gap? <eob>
By this summer, my team will have served <eol> over 4,000 low-income children, <eob> trained over 300 aspiring teachers <eob> and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs <eob> across some of New York City's <eol> most disadvantaged neighborhoods. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And our kids are succeeding. <eob> Two years of independent evaluations <eob> tell us that our kids <eol> eliminate the summer learning loss <eob> and make growth of one month in math <eob> and two months in reading. <eob>
So instead of returning to school <eol> in the fall three months behind, <eob> they now go back four months ahead in math <eob> and five months ahead in reading. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Ten years ago, if you would have told me <eob> that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent of my class <eol> from an Ivy League institution <eob> and have an opportunity <eol> to make a dent on our public education system <eob> just by tackling two months <eol> of the calendar year, <eob> I would have said, <eob> "Nah. <eob>
No way. <eob> "What's even more exciting <eob> is that if we can prevent <eol> five months of lost time <eob> just by redesigning two months, <eob> imagine the possibilities <eol> that we can unlock <eob> by tackling the rest of the calendar year. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In 1956, a documentary <eol> by Jacques Cousteau won <eob> both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award. <eob>
This film was called, "Le Monde Du Silence," <eob> or, "The Silent World." <eob> The premise of the title was that the underwater <eol> world was a quiet world. <eob>
We now know, 60 years later, <eob> that the underwater world <eol> is anything but silent. <eob>
Although the sounds are inaudible above water <eob> depending on where you are <eol> and the time of year, <eob> the underwater soundscape <eol> can be as noisy as any jungle or rainforest. <eob>
Invertebrates like snapping shrimp, <eol> fish and marine mammals <eob> all use sound. <eob>
They use sound to study their habitat, <eob> to keep in communication with each other, <eob> to navigate, <eob> to detect predators and prey. <eob>
They also use sound by listening to know <eol> something about their environment. <eob>
Take, for an example, the Arctic. <eob>
It's considered a vast, <eol> inhospitable place, <eob> sometimes described as a desert, <eob> because it is so cold and so remote <eob> and ice-covered for much of the year. <eob>
And despite this, <eob> there is no place on Earth <eol> that I would rather be than the Arctic, <eob> especially as days lengthen <eol> and spring comes. <eob>
To me, the Arctic really embodies <eol> this disconnect <eob> between what we see on the surface <eol> and what's going on underwater. <eob>
You can look out across the ice -- <eol> all white and blue and cold -- <eob> and see nothing. <eob>
But if you could hear underwater, <eob> the sounds you would hear would at first amaze <eob> and then delight you. <eob>
And while your eyes are seeing <eol> nothing for kilometers but ice, <eob> your ears are telling you that <eol> out there are bowhead and beluga whales, <eob> walrus and bearded seals. <eob>
The ice, too, makes sounds. <eob>
It screeches and cracks <eol> and pops and groans, <eob> as it collides and rubs <eol> when temperature or currents or winds change. <eob>
And under 100 percent sea ice <eol> in the dead of winter, <eob> bowhead whales are singing. <eob>
And you would never expect that, <eob> because we humans, <eob> we tend to be very visual animals. <eob>
For most of us, but not all, <eob> our sense of sight <eol> is how we navigate our world. <eob>
For marine mammals <eol> that live underwater, <eob> where chemical cues <eol> and light transmit poorly, <eob> sound is the sense by which they see. <eob>
And sound transmits very well underwater, <eob> much better than it does in air, <eob> so signals can be heard <eol> over great distances. <eob>
In the Arctic, this is especially important, <eob> because not only do Arctic <eol> marine mammals have to hear each other, <eob> but they also have to listen <eol> for cues in the environment <eob> that might indicate heavy ice <eol> ahead or open water. <eob>
Remember, although they spend <eol> most of their lives underwater, <eob> they are mammals, <eob> and so they have to surface <eol> to breathe. <eob>
So they might listen for thin ice <eol> or no ice, <eob> or listen for echoes off nearby ice. <eob>
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich <eol> and varied underwater soundscape. <eob>
In the spring, <eob> it can be a cacophony of sound. <eob>
(Marine mammal sounds) <eob>
But when the ice is frozen solid, <eob> and there are no big temperature <eol> shifts or current changes, <eob> the underwater Arctic has some <eol> of the lowest ambient noise levels <eob> of the world's oceans. <eob>
But this is changing. <eob>
This is primarily due to a decrease <eol> in seasonal sea ice, <eob> which is a direct result <eol> of human greenhouse gas emissions. <eob>
We are, in effect, <eol> with climate change, <eob> conducting a completely uncontrolled <eol> experiment with our planet. <eob>
Over the past 30 years, <eob> areas of the Arctic have seen <eol> decreases in seasonal sea ice <eob> from anywhere <eol> from six weeks to four months. <eob>
This decrease in sea ice is sometimes <eol> referred to as an increase <eob> in the open water season. <eob>
That is the time of year <eol> when the Arctic is navigable to vessels. <eob>
And not only is the extent <eol> of ice changing, <eob> but the age and the width <eol> of ice is, too. <eob>
Now, you may well have heard <eob> that a decrease in seasonal sea ice <eol> is causing a loss of habitat <eob> for animals that rely on sea ice, <eob> such as ice seals, or walrus, <eol> or polar bears. <eob>
Decreasing sea ice is also causing <eol> increased erosion along coastal villages, <eob> and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals. <eob>
Climate change and decreases in sea ice <eob> are also altering <eol> the underwater soundscape of the Arctic. <eob>
What do I mean by soundscape? <eob>
Those of us who eavesdrop <eol> on the oceans for a living <eob> use instruments called hydrophones, <eob> which are underwater microphones, <eob> and we record ambient noise -- <eob> the noise all around us. <eob>
And the soundscape describes <eol> the different contributors <eob> to this noise field. <eob>
What we are hearing <eol> on our hydrophones <eob> are the very real sounds of climate change. <eob>
We are hearing these changes <eol> from three fronts: <eob> from the air, <eob> from the water <eob> and from land. <eob>
First: air. <eob> Wind on water creates waves. <eob>
These waves make bubbles; <eob> the bubbles break, <eob> and when they do, <eob> they make noise. <eob>
And this noise is like a hiss <eol> or a static in the background. <eob>
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered, <eob> most of the noise from wind <eol> doesn't make it into the water column, <eob> because the ice acts as a buffer <eol> between the atmosphere and the water. <eob>
This is one of the reasons <eob> that the Arctic can have very low <eol> ambient noise levels. <eob>
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice, <eob> not only is the Arctic <eol> now open to this wave noise, <eob> but the number of storms <eol> and the intensity of storms in the Arctic <eob> has been increasing. <eob>
All of this is raising noise levels <eol> in a previously quiet ocean. <eob>
Second: water. <eob> With less seasonal sea ice, <eob> subarctic species are moving north, <eob> and taking advantage of the new habitat <eol> that is created by more open water. <eob>
Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead, <eob> they have no dorsal fin, <eob> because they have evolved to live and swim <eol> in ice-covered waters, <eob> and having something sticking off <eol> of your back is not very conducive <eob> to migrating through ice, <eob> and may, in fact, be excluding animals <eol> from the ice. <eob>
But now, everywhere we've listened, <eob> we're hearing the sounds of fin <eol> whales and humpback whales <eob> and killer whales, <eob> further and further north, <eob> and later and later in the season. <eob>
We are hearing, in essence, <eob> an invasion of the Arctic <eol> by subarctic species. <eob>
And we don't know what this means. <eob>
Will there be competition for food <eol> between Arctic and subarctic animals? <eob>
Might these subarctic species introduce <eol> diseases or parasites into the Arctic? <eob>
And what are the new sounds <eol> that they are producing <eob> doing to the soundscape underwater? <eob>
And third: land. <eob> And by land ... <eob> I mean people. <eob>
More open water means increased <eol> human use of the Arctic. <eob>
Just this past summer, <eob> a massive cruise ship made its way <eol> through the Northwest Passage -- <eob> the once-mythical route <eol> between Europe and the Pacific. <eob>
Decreases in sea ice have allowed <eol> humans to occupy the Arctic more often. <eob>
It has allowed increases in oil <eol> and gas exploration and extraction, <eob> the potential for commercial shipping, <eob> as well as increased tourism. <eob>
And we now know that ship noise increases <eol> levels of stress hormones in whales <eob> and can disrupt feeding behavior. <eob>
Air guns, which produce loud, <eol> low-frequency "whoomps" <eob> every 10 to 20 seconds, <eob> changed the swimming and vocal <eol> behavior of whales. <eob>
And all of these sound sources <eol> are decreasing the acoustic space <eob> over which Arctic marine mammals <eol> can communicate. <eob>
Now, Arctic marine mammals are used <eol> to very high levels of noise <eob> at certain times of the year. <eob>
But this is primarily from other <eol> animals or from sea ice, <eob> and these are the sounds with which <eol> they've evolved, <eob> and these are sounds that are vital <eol> to their very survival. <eob>
These new sounds are loud <eol> and they're alien. <eob>
They might impact the environment <eol> in ways that we think we understand, <eob> but also in ways that we don't. <eob>
Remember, sound is the most important <eol> sense for these animals. <eob>
And not only is the physical habitat <eol> of the Arctic changing rapidly, <eob> but the acoustic habitat is, too. <eob>
It's as if we've plucked these animals <eol> up from the quiet countryside <eob> and dropped them into a big city <eol> in the middle of rush hour. <eob>
And they can't escape it. <eob>
So what can we do now? <eob>
We can't decrease wind speeds <eob> or keep subarctic animals <eol> from migrating north, <eob> but we can work on local solutions <eob> to reducing human-caused underwater noise. <eob>
One of these solutions <eol> is to slow down ships <eob> that traverse the Arctic, <eob> because a slower ship <eol> is a quieter ship. <eob>
We can restrict access <eol> in seasons and regions <eob> that are important <eol> for mating or feeding or migrating. <eob>
We can get smarter about quieting ships <eob> and find better ways <eol> to explore the ocean bottom. <eob>
And the good news is, <eob> there are people working <eol> on this right now. <eob>
But ultimately, <eob> we humans have to do the hard work <eob> of reversing or at the very least decelerating <eob> human-caused atmospheric changes. <eob>
So, let's return to this idea <eol> of a silent world underwater. <eob>
It's entirely possible <eob> that many of the whales swimming <eol> in the Arctic today, <eob> especially long-lived species <eol> like the bowhead whale <eob> that the Inuits say can live <eol> two human lives -- <eob> it's possible that these whales <eol> were alive in 1956, <eob> when Jacques Cousteau made his film. <eob>
And in retrospect, <eob> considering all the noise <eol> we are creating in the oceans today, <eob> perhaps it really was "The Silent World." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A few days after my husband Paul <eol> was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, <eob> we were lying in our bed at home, <eob> and Paul said, <eob> "It's going to be OK." <eob> And I remember answering back, <eob> "Yes. <eob>
We just don't know what OK means yet." <eob>
Paul and I had met as first-year <eol> medical students at Yale. <eob>
He was smart and kind and super funny. <eob>
He used to keep a gorilla suit <eol> in the trunk of his car, <eob> and he'd say, "It's <eol> for emergencies only." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I fell in love with Paul as I watched the care <eol> he took with his patients. <eob>
He stayed late talking with them, <eob> seeking to understand <eol> the experience of illness <eob> and not just its technicalities. <eob>
He later told me he fell in love with me <eob> when he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart <eol> that had ceased beating. <eob>
We didn't know it yet, <eob> but even in the heady days of young love, <eob> we were learning how to approach <eol> suffering together. <eob>
We got married and became doctors. <eob>
I was working as an internist <eob> and Paul was finishing <eol> his training as a neurosurgeon <eob> when he started to lose weight. <eob>
He developed excruciating <eol> back pain and a cough that wouldn't go away. <eob>
And when he was admitted <eol> to the hospital, <eob> a CT scan revealed tumors in <eol> Paul's lungs and in his bones. <eob>
We had both cared for patients <eol> with devastating diagnoses; <eob> now it was our turn. <eob>
We lived with Paul's illness <eol> for 22 months. <eob>
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. <eob>
I gave birth to our daughter Cady, <eob> and we loved her and each other. <eob>
We learned directly how to struggle <eol> through really tough medical decisions. <eob>
The day we took Paul <eol> into the hospital for the last time <eob> was the most difficult day of my life. <eob>
When he turned to me at the end <eob> and said, "I'm ready," <eob> I knew that wasn't just a brave decision. <eob>
It was the right one. <eob>
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR. <eob>
In that moment, <eob> the most important thing to Paul <eob> was to hold our baby daughter. <eob>
Nine hours later, <eob> Paul died. <eob>
I've always thought of myself <eol> as a caregiver -- <eob> most physicians do -- <eob> and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant. <eob>
Watching him reshape his identity <eol> during his illness, <eob> learning to witness and accept his pain, <eob> talking together through his choices -- <eob> those experiences taught me <eob> that resilience does not mean bouncing <eol> back to where you were before, <eob> or pretending that the hard stuff <eol> isn't hard. <eob>
It is so hard. <eob>
It's painful, messy stuff. <eob>
But it's the stuff. <eob>
And I learned that when we approach it together, <eob> we get to decide what success <eol> looks like. <eob>
One of the first things Paul said <eol> to me after his diagnosis was, <eob> "I want you to get remarried." <eob> And I was like, whoa, I guess <eol> we get to say anything out loud. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was so shocking <eob> and heartbreaking ... <eob> and generous, <eob> and really comforting <eob> because it was so starkly honest, <eob> and that honesty turned out <eol> to be exactly what we needed. <eob>
Early in Paul's illness, <eob> we agreed we would just keep saying <eol> things out loud. <eob>
Tasks like making a will, <eob> or completing our advance directives -- <eob> tasks that I had always avoided -- <eob> were not as daunting as they once seemed. <eob>
I realized that completing an advance <eol> directive is an act of love -- <eob> like a wedding vow. <eob>
A pact to take care of someone, <eob> codifying the promise <eob> that til death do us part, <eob> I will be there. <eob>
If needed, I will speak for you. <eob>
I will honor your wishes. <eob>
That paperwork became a tangible part <eol> of our love story. <eob>
As physicians, <eob> Paul and I were in a good position <eob> to understand and even accept <eol> his diagnosis. <eob>
We weren't angry about it, <eob> luckily, <eob> because we'd seen so many patients <eol> in devastating situations, <eob> and we knew that death <eol> is a part of life. <eob>
But it's one thing to know that; <eob> it was a very different experience <eob> to actually live with the sadness <eol> and uncertainty of a serious illness. <eob>
Huge strides are being made against lung cancer, <eob> but we knew that Paul likely had months <eol> to a few years left to live. <eob>
During that time, <eob> Paul wrote about his transition <eol> from doctor to patient. <eob>
He talked about feeling <eol> like he was suddenly at a crossroads, <eob> and how he would have thought <eol> he'd be able to see the path, <eob> that because he treated so many patients, <eob> maybe he could follow <eol> in their footsteps. <eob>
But he was totally disoriented. <eob>
Rather than a path, <eob> Paul wrote, <eob> "I saw instead <eob> only a harsh, vacant, <eol> gleaming white desert. <eob>
As if a sandstorm had erased <eol> all familiarity. <eob>
I had to face my mortality <eob> and try to understand <eol> what made my life worth living, <eob> and I needed my oncologist's help <eol> to do so." <eob>
The clinicians taking care of Paul <eob> gave me an even deeper appreciation <eol> for my colleagues in health care. <eob>
We have a tough job. <eob>
We're responsible for helping patients <eol> have clarity around their prognoses <eob> and their treatment options, <eob> and that's never easy, but it's especially tough <eob> when you're dealing with potentially <eol> terminal illnesses like cancer. <eob>
Some people don't want to know <eol> how long they have left, <eob> others do. <eob>
Either way, we never have those answers. <eob>
Sometimes we substitute hope <eob> by emphasizing the best-case scenario. <eob>
In a survey of physicians, <eob> 55 percent said they painted <eol> a rosier picture <eob> than their honest opinion <eob> when describing a patient's prognosis. <eob>
It's an instinct born out of kindness. <eob>
But researchers have found <eob> that when people better understand <eol> the possible outcomes of an illness, <eob> they have less anxiety, <eob> greater ability to plan <eob> and less trauma for their families. <eob>
Families can struggle <eol> with those conversations, <eob> but for us, we also found that information immensely <eol> helpful with big decisions. <eob>
Most notably, <eob> whether to have a baby. <eob>
Months to a few years meant <eol> Paul was not likely to see her grow up. <eob>
But he had a good chance <eol> of being there for her birth <eob> and for the beginning of her life. <eob>
I remember asking Paul <eob> if he thought having <eol> to say goodbye to a child <eob> would make dying even more painful. <eob>
And his answer astounded me. <eob>
He said, <eob> "Wouldn't it be great if it did?" <eob> And we did it. <eob>
Not in order to spite cancer, <eob> but because we were learning <eob> that living fully means accepting suffering. <eob>
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo <eob> so he could continue working <eol> as a neurosurgeon, <eob> which initially we thought <eol> was totally impossible. <eob>
When the cancer advanced <eob> and Paul shifted <eol> from surgery to writing, <eob> his palliative care doctor <eol> prescribed a stimulant medication <eob> so he could be more focused. <eob>
They asked Paul about his priorities <eol> and his worries. <eob>
They asked him what trade-offs <eol> he was willing to make. <eob>
Those conversations are the best way to ensure <eob> that your health care matches your values. <eob>
Paul joked that it's not like <eol> that "birds and bees" talk <eob> you have with your parents, <eob> where you all get it <eol> over with as quickly as possible, <eob> and then pretend it never happened. <eob>
You revisit the conversation <eol> as things change. <eob>
You keep saying things out loud. <eob>
I'm forever grateful <eob> because Paul's clinicians felt <eob> that their job wasn't to try to give us answers <eol> they didn't have, <eob> or only to try to fix things for us, <eob> but to counsel Paul through painful choices ... <eob> when his body was failing <eol> but his will to live wasn't. <eob>
Later, after <eob> Paul died, <eob> I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, <eob> but I sent just one... <eob> to Paul's oncologist, <eob> because she supported his goals <eob> and she helped him weigh his choices. <eob>
She knew that living means <eol> more than just staying alive. <eob>
A few weeks ago, a patient <eol> came into my clinic. <eob>
A woman dealing with <eol> a serious chronic disease. <eob>
And while we were talking <eol> about her life and her health care, <eob> she said, "I love my palliative care team. <eob>
They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'." <eob> Yeah, I thought, of course it is. <eob>
But many patients don't feel that. <eob>
Compassion and Choices did a study <eob> where they asked people <eol> about their health care preferences. <eob>
And a lot of people started <eol> their answers with the words <eob> "Well, if I had a choice ..." <eob> If I had a choice. <eob>
And when I read that "if," <eob> I understood better <eob> why one in four people <eob> receives excessive <eol> or unwanted medical treatment, <eob> or watches a family member <eol> receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment. <eob>
It's not because doctors don't get it. <eob> We do. <eob> We understand the real <eol> psychological consequences <eob> on patients and their families. <eob>
The things is, we deal with them, too. <eob>
Half of critical care nurses <eol> and a quarter of ICU doctors <eob> have considered quitting their jobs <eob> because of distress over feeling <eol> that for some of their patients, <eob> they've provided care that didn't fit <eol> with the person's values. <eob>
But doctors can't make sure <eol> your wishes are respected <eob> until they know what they are. <eob>
Would you want to be on life support <eol> if it offered any chance of longer life? <eob>
Are you most worried <eol> about the quality of that time, <eob> rather than quantity? <eob>
Both of those choices <eol> are thoughtful and brave, <eob> but for all of us, it's our choice. <eob>
That's true at the end of life <eob> and for medical care throughout our lives. <eob>
If you're pregnant, do you <eol> want genetic screening? <eob>
Is a knee replacement right or not? <eob>
Do you want to do dialysis <eol> in a clinic or at home? <eob>
The answer is: <eob> it depends. <eob>
What medical care will help <eol> you live the way you want to? <eob>
I hope you remember that question <eob> the next time you face <eol> a decision in your health care. <eob>
Remember that you always have a choice, <eob> and it is OK to say no to a treatment <eol> that's not right for you. <eob>
There's a poem by W.S. Merwin -- <eob> it's just two sentences long -- <eob> that captures how I feel now. <eob> "Your absence has gone through me <eob> like thread through a needle. <eob>
Everything I do <eol> is stitched with its color." <eob> For me that poem evokes my love for Paul, <eob> and a new fortitude <eob> that came from loving and losing him. <eob>
When Paul said, <eob> "It's going to be OK," <eob> that didn't mean <eol> that we could cure his illness. <eob>
Instead, we learned to accept both joy <eol> and sadness at the same time; <eob> to uncover beauty and purpose <eob> both despite and because we are all born <eob> and we all die. <eob>
And for all the sadness and sleepless nights, <eob> it turns out there is joy. <eob>
I leave flowers on Paul's grave <eob> and watch our two-year-old run <eol> around on the grass. <eob>
I build bonfires on the beach <eol> and watch the sunset with our friends. <eob>
Exercise and mindfulness <eol> meditation have helped a lot. <eob>
And someday, <eob> I hope I do get remarried. <eob>
Most importantly, <eol> I get to watch our daughter grow. <eob>
I've thought a lot about <eol> what I'm going to say to her <eob> when she's older. <eob> "Cady, <eob> engaging in the full range <eol> of experience -- <eob> living and dying, <eob> love and loss -- <eob> is what we get to do. <eob>
Being human doesn't happen <eol> despite suffering. <eob>
It happens within it. <eob>
When we approach suffering together, <eob> when we choose not to hide from it, <eob> our lives don't diminish, <eob> they expand." <eob>
I've learned that cancer <eol> isn't always a battle. <eob>
Or if it is, <eob> maybe it's a fight for something <eol> different than we thought. <eob>
Our job isn't to fight fate, <eob> but to help each other through. <eob>
Not as soldiers <eob> but as shepherds. <eob>
That's how we make it OK, <eob> even when it's not. <eob>
By saying it out loud, <eob> by helping each other through ... <eob> and a gorilla suit never hurts, either. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: So Robert spent <eol> the last few years <eob> think about how weird human behavior is, <eob> and how inadequate most of our language <eol> trying to explain it is. <eob>
And it's very exciting to hear him explain <eol> some of the thinking behind it <eob> in public for the first time. <eob>
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you. <eob> The fantasy always runs something like this. <eob> I've overpowered his elite guard, <eob> burst into his secret bunker <eob> with my machine gun ready. <eob>
He lunges for his Luger. <eob>
I knock it out of his hand. <eob>
He lunges for his cyanide pill. <eob>
I knock that out of his hand. <eob>
He snarls, <eob> comes at me with otherworldly strength. <eob>
We grapple, we fight, <eob> I manage to pin him down <eob> and put on handcuffs. <eob> "Adolf Hitler," I say, <eob> "I arrest you <eol> for crimes against humanity." <eob>
Here's where the Medal of Honor version <eol> of the fantasy ends <eob> and the imagery darkens. <eob>
What would I do if I had Hitler? <eob>
It's not hard to imagine <eol> once I allow myself. <eob>
Sever his spine at the neck. <eob>
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument. <eob> Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue. <eob>
Leave him alive on a respirator, <eob> tube-fed, not able to speak <eol> or move or see or hear, just to feel, <eob> and then inject him with something cancerous <eob> that's going to fester and pustulate <eob> until every cell in his body <eol> is screaming in agony, <eob> until every second feels like an eternity in hell. <eob>
That's what I would do to Hitler. <eob>
I've had this fantasy <eol> since I was a kid, <eob> still do sometimes, <eob> and when I do, my heart speeds up -- <eob> all these plans for the most evil, <eol> wicked soul in history. <eob>
But there's a problem, <eob> which is I don't actually believe <eol> in souls or evil, <eob> and I think wicked belongs <eol> in a musical. <eob>
But there's some people <eol> I would like to see killed, <eob> but I'm against the death penalty. <eob>
But I like schlocky violent movies, <eob> but I'm for strict gun control. <eob>
But then there was a time <eol> I was at a laser tag place, <eob> and I had such a good time hiding <eol> in a corner shooting at people. <eob>
In other words, I'm your basic confused <eol> human when it comes to violence. <eob>
Now, as a species, we obviously <eol> have problems with violence. <eob>
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas, <eob> letters with anthrax, <eol> airplanes as weapons, <eob> mass rape as a military strategy. <eob>
We're a miserably violent species. <eob>
But there's a complication, <eob> which is we don't hate violence, <eob> we hate the wrong kind. <eob>
And when it's the right kind, <eob> we cheer it on, we hand out medals, <eob> we vote for, we mate <eol> with our champions of it. <eob>
When it's the right kind of violence, <eob> we love it. <eob>
And there's another complication, <eob> which is, in addition to us <eol> being this miserably violent species, <eob> we're also this extraordinarily altruistic, <eol> compassionate one. <eob>
So how do you make sense <eol> of the biology of our best behaviors, <eob> our worst ones and all of those <eol> ambiguously in between? <eob>
Now, for starters, <eob> what's totally boring <eol> is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior. <eob>
Your brain tells your spine, <eol> tells your muscles <eob> to do something or other, <eob> and hooray, you've behaved. <eob>
What's hard is understanding <eol> the meaning of the behavior, <eob> because in some settings, pulling <eol> a trigger is an appalling act; <eob> in others, it's heroically self-sacrificial. <eob>
In some settings, putting your hand <eol> one someone else's <eob> is deeply compassionate. <eob>
In others, it's a deep betrayal. <eob>
The challenge is to understand <eob> the biology of the context <eol> of our behaviors, <eob> and that's real tough. <eob>
One thing that's clear, though, is you're not <eol> going to get anywhere <eob> if you think there's going to be <eol> the brain region or the hormone <eob> or the gene or the childhood experience <eob> or the evolutionary mechanism <eol> that explains everything. <eob>
Instead, every bit of behavior has multiple <eol> levels of causality. <eob>
Let's look at an example. <eob> You have a gun. <eob>
There's a crisis going on: <eob> rioting, violence, people running around. <eob>
A stranger is running at you <eol> in an agitated state -- <eob> you can't quite tell <eol> if the expression is frightened, threatening, angry -- <eob> holding something that kind <eol> of looks like a handgun. <eob>
You're not sure. <eob>
The stranger comes running at you <eob> and you pull the trigger. <eob>
And it turns out that thing <eol> in this person's hand <eob> was a cell phone. <eob>
So we asked this biological question: <eob> what was going on that <eol> caused this behavior? <eob>
What caused this behavior? <eob>
And this is a multitude of questions. <eob>
We start. <eob> What was going on in your brain one second <eol> before you pulled that trigger? <eob>
And this brings us into the realm <eol> of a brain region called the amygdala. <eob>
The amygdala, which is central <eob> to violence, central <eol> to fear, <eob> initiates volleys of cascades <eob> that produce pulling of a trigger. <eob>
What was the level of activity <eol> in your amygdala one second before? <eob>
But to understand that, <eol> we have to step back a little bit. <eob>
What was going on <eol> in the environment seconds to minutes before <eob> that impacted the amygdala? <eob>
Now, obviously, the sights, <eol> the sounds of the rioting, <eob> that was pertinent. <eob>
But in addition, <eob> you're more likely to mistake <eol> a cell phone for a handgun <eob> if that stranger was male <eob> and large and of a different race. <eob>
Furthermore, if you're in pain, <eob> if you're hungry, if you're exhausted, <eob> your frontal cortex is not <eol> going to work as well, <eob> part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time <eob> saying, "Are you really sure <eol> that's a gun there?" <eob>
But we need to step further back. <eob>
Now we have to look at hours to days before, <eob> and with this, we have entered <eol> the realm of hormones. <eob>
For example, testosterone, <eob> where regardless of your sex, <eob> if you have elevated testosterone <eol> levels in your blood, <eob> you're more likely to think <eol> a face with a neutral expression <eob> is instead looking threatening. <eob>
Elevated testosterone levels, <eol> elevated levels of stress hormones, <eob> and your amygdala is going to be more active <eob> and your frontal cortex <eol> will be more sluggish. <eob>
Pushing back further, weeks to months before, <eob> where's the relevance there? <eob>
This is the realm of neural plasticity, <eob> the fact that your brain <eol> can change in response to experience, <eob> and if your previous months have been filled <eol> with stress and trauma, <eob> your amygdala will have enlarged. <eob>
The neurons will have become <eol> more excitable, <eob> your frontal cortex <eol> would have atrophied, <eob> all relevant to what happens <eol> in that one second. <eob>
But we push back even more, back years, <eob> back, for example, to your adolescence. <eob>
Now, the central fact <eol> of the adolescent brain <eob> is all of it is going full blast <eob> except the frontal cortex, <eob> which is still half-baked. <eob>
It doesn't fully mature <eol> until you're around 25. <eob>
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood <eob> are the years where environment <eol> and experience sculpt your frontal cortex <eob> into the version you're going to have <eol> as an adult in that critical moment. <eob>
But pushing back even further, <eob> even further back to childhood <eol> and fetal life <eob> and all the different versions <eol> that that could come in. <eob>
Now, obviously, that's the time <eol> that your brain is being constructed, <eob> and that's important, <eob> but in addition, experience <eol> during those times <eob> produce what are called <eol> epigenetic changes, <eob> permanent, in some cases, <eob> permanently activating certain genes, <eol> turning off others. <eob>
And as an example of this, <eob> if as a fetus you were exposed <eol> to a lot of stress hormones through your mother, <eob> epigenetics is going to produce <eol> your amygdala in adulthood <eob> as a more excitable form, <eob> and you're going to have elevated stress hormone levels. <eob>
But pushing even further back, <eob> back to when you were <eol> just a fetus, <eob> back to when all you were <eol> was a collection of genes. <eob>
Now, genes are really <eol> important to all of this, <eob> but critically, genes <eol> don't determine anything, <eob> because genes work differently <eol> in different environments. <eob>
Key example here: <eob> there's a variant of a gene <eol> called MAO-A, <eob> and if you have that variant, <eob> you are far more likely to commit <eol> antisocial violence <eob> if, and only if, you were abused <eol> as a child. <eob>
Genes and environment interact, <eob> and what's happening in that one second <eol> before you pull that trigger <eob> reflects your lifetime of those gene-environment interactions. <eob>
Now, remarkably enough, <eol> we've got to push even further back now, <eob> back centuries. <eob>
What were your ancestors up to. <eob>
And if, for example, <eol> they were nomadic pastoralists, <eob> they were pastoralists, <eob> people living in deserts or grasslands <eob> with their herds of camels, cows, goats, <eob> odds are they would have invented <eol> what's called a culture of honor <eob> filled with warrior classes, <eob> retributive violence, clan vendettas, <eob> and amazingly, centuries later, <eob> that would still be influencing the values <eol> with which you were raised. <eob>
But we've got to push even further back, <eob> back millions of years, <eob> because if we're talking about genes, <eob> implicitly we're now talking <eol> about the evolution of genes. <eob>
And what you see is, for example, <eob> patterns across different primate species. <eob>
Some of them have evolved <eol> for extremely low levels of aggression, <eob> others have evolved in the opposite direction, <eob> and floating there in between <eol> by every measure are humans, <eob> once again this confused, <eol> barely defined species <eob> that has all these potentials to go <eol> one way or the other. <eob>
So what has this gotten us to? <eob>
Basically, what we're seeing here is, <eob> if you want to understand a behavior, <eob> whether it's an appalling one, <eol> a wondrous one, <eob> or confusedly in between, <eob> if you want to understand that, <eob> you've got take into account what happened <eol> a second before <eob> to a million years before, <eob> everything in between. <eob>
So what can we conclude at this point? <eob>
Officially, it's complicated. <eob>
Wow, that's really helpful. <eob> It's complicated, <eob> and you'd better be real careful, real cautious <eob> before you conclude <eol> you know what causes a behavior, <eob> especially if it's a behavior <eol> you're judging harshly. <eob>
Now, to me, the single most important <eol> point about all of this <eob> is one having to do with change. <eob>
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here <eol> can change in different circumstances. <eob>
For example, ecosystems change. <eob>
Thousands of years ago, <eol> the Sahara was a lush grassland. <eob> Cultures change. <eob> In the 17th century, the most terrifying people <eol> in Europe were the Swedes, <eob> rampaging all over the place. <eob>
This is what the Swedish military <eol> does now. <eob>
They haven't had a war in 200 years. <eob>
Most importantly, <eob> brains change. <eob>
Neurons grow new processes. <eob> Circuits disconnect. <eob> Everything in the brain changes, <eob> and out of this come extraordinary <eol> examples of human change. <eob>
First one: <eob> this is a man named John Newton, <eob> a British theologian <eob> who played a central role <eol> in the abolition of slavery from the British Empire <eob> in the early 1800s. <eob>
And amazingly, this man <eol> spent decades as a younger man <eob> as the captain <eol> of a slave ship, <eob> and then as an investor in slavery, <eob> growing rich from this. <eob>
And then something changed. <eob>
Something changed in him, <eob> something that Newton himself celebrated <eol> in the thing that he's most famous for, <eob> a hymn that he wrote: <eob> "Amazing Grace." <eob>
This is a man named Zenji Abe on the morning <eol> of December 6, 1941, <eob> about to lead a squadron <eol> of Japanese bombers to attack Pearl Harbor. <eob>
And this is the same man 50 years later to the day <eob> hugging a man <eol> who survived the attack on the ground. <eob>
And as an old man, <eob> Zenji Abe came to a collection <eol> of Pearl Harbor survivors <eob> at a ceremony there <eob> and in halting English apologized <eol> for what he had done as a young man. <eob>
Now, it doesn't always require decades. <eob>
Sometimes, extraordinary change <eol> could happen in just hours. <eob>
Consider the World War I Christmas truce <eol> of 1914. <eob>
The powers that be had negotiated <eol> a brief truce <eob> so that soldiers could go out, <eob> collect bodies from no-man's-land <eol> in between the trench lines. <eob>
And soon British and German soldiers <eob> were doing that, <eob> and then helping each other carry bodies, <eob> and then helping each other dig graves in the frozen ground, <eob> and then praying together, <eob> and then having Christmas together <eol> and exchanging gifts, <eob> and by the next day, <eol> they were playing soccer together <eob> and exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war. <eob>
That truce kept going until <eol> the officers had to arrive <eob> and said, "We will shoot you <eob> unless you go back to trying to kill <eol> each other." <eob> And all it took here was hours <eob> for these men to develop <eol> a completely new category of "us," <eob> all of us in the trenches here <eob> on both sides, dying for no damn reason, <eob> and who is a "them," <eol> those faceless powers behind the lines <eob> who were using them as pawns. <eob>
And sometimes, change <eol> can occur in seconds. <eob>
Probably the most horrifying event <eol> in the Vietnam War <eob> was the My Lai Massacre. <eob>
A brigade of American soldiers <eob> went into an undefended <eol> village full of civilians <eob> and killed between 350 and 500 of them, <eob> mass-raped women and children, <eob> mutilated bodies. <eob> It was appalling. <eob> It was appalling because it occurred, <eol> because the government denied it, <eob> because the US government <eol> eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist, <eob> and appalling because it almost certainly <eol> was not a singular event. <eob>
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man <eol> who stopped the My Lai Massacre. <eob>
He was piloting <eol> a helicopter gunship, <eob> landed there, got out <eob> and saw American soldiers <eol> shooting babies, <eob> shooting old women, <eob> figured out what was going on, <eob> and he then took his helicopter <eob> and did something that undid <eol> his lifetime of conditioning <eob> as to who is an "us" and who is a "them." <eob> He landed his helicopter <eob> in between some surviving villagers <eol> and American soldiers <eob> and he trained his machine guns on his fellow Americans, <eob> and said, "If you don't stop the killing, I will mow you down." <eob>
Now, these people are no more <eol> special than any of us. <eob>
Same neurons, same neurochemicals, <eob> same biology. <eob>
What we're left with here <eol> is this inevitable cliche: <eob> "Those who don't study history <eol> are destined to repeat it." <eob> What we have here is the opposite of it. <eob>
Those who don't study <eol> the history of extraordinary human change, <eob> those who don't study the biology <eol> of what can transform us <eob> from our worst to our best behaviors, <eob> those who don't do this are destined <eol> not to be able <eob> to repeat these incandescent, magnificent moments. <eob>
So thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: Talks that really give you <eol> a new mental model about something, <eob> those are some of my favorite TED Talks, <eob> and we just got one. <eob> Robert, thank you so much for that. <eob>
Good luck with the book. <eob> That was amazing, <eob> and we're going to try and get you <eol> to come here in person one year. <eob> Thank you so much. <eob>
RS: Thank you. Thank you all. <eob>
Namaskar. <eob>
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age, <eob> and I don't use Botox as yet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I'm clean, but I do behave <eol> like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies. <eob>
Yeah, I do that. <eob>
I sell dreams and I peddle love to millions <eol> of people back home in India <eob> who assume that I'm the best lover in the world. <eob>
If you don't tell anyone, I'm going <eol> to tell you I'm not, <eob> but I never let that assumption go away. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I've also been made to understand <eob> there are lots of you here <eol> who haven't seen my work, <eob> and I feel really sad for you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> That doesn't take away from the fact <eol> that I'm completely self-obsessed, <eob> as a movie star should be. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's when my friends, <eol> Chris and Juliet called me here <eob> to speak about the future "you." <eob> Naturally, it follows I'm going to speak <eol> about the present me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Because I truly believe <eol> that humanity is a lot like me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It is. It is. <eob> It's an aging movie star, <eob> grappling with all the newness around itself, <eob> wondering whether it got <eol> it right in the first place, <eob> and still trying to find a way <eob> to keep on shining regardless. <eob>
I was born in a refugee colony <eol> in the capital city of India, New Delhi. <eob>
And my father was a freedom fighter. <eob>
My mother was, well, <eol> just a fighter like mothers are. <eob>
And much like the original homo sapiens, <eob> we struggled to survive. <eob>
When I was in my early 20s, <eob> I lost both my parents, <eob> which I must admit seems a bit careless of me now, <eob> but — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I do remember the night my father died, <eob> and I remember the driver of a neighbor <eol> who was driving us to the hospital. <eob>
He mumbled something about "dead <eol> people don't tip so well" <eob> and walked away into the dark. <eob>
And I was only 14 then, <eob> and I put my father's dead body <eol> in the back seat of the car, <eob> and my mother besides me, <eob> I started driving back from the hospital <eol> to the house. <eob>
And in the middle of her quiet crying, <eol> my mother looked at me and she said, <eob> "Son, when did you learn to drive?" <eob> And I thought about it and realized, <eol> and I said to my mom, <eob> "Just now, Mom." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So from that night onwards, <eob> much akin to humanity in its adolescence, <eob> I learned the crude tools of survival. <eob>
And the framework of life was very, <eol> very simple then, to be honest. <eob>
You know, you just ate what you got <eob> and did whatever you were told to do. <eob>
I thought celiac was a vegetable, <eob> and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's lost comrade <eol> in "Star Trek." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You married the first girl that you dated, <eob> and you were a techie if you could fix <eol> the carburetor in your car. <eob>
I really thought that gay was <eol> a sophisticated English word for happy. <eob>
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital <eol> of Portugal, as you all know. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Where was I? <eob> We relied on systems <eob> created through the toil <eol> and sacrifice of generations before <eob> to protect us, <eob> and we felt that governments <eol> actually worked for our betterment. <eob>
Science was simple and logical, <eob> Apple was still then just a fruit <eob> owned by Eve first and then Newton, <eob> not by Steve Jobs, until then. <eob> And "Eureka!" was what you screamed <eob> when you wanted to run naked on the streets. <eob>
You went wherever life took you for work, <eob> and people were mostly welcoming of you. <eob>
Migration was a term then <eob> still reserved for Siberian cranes, not human beings. <eob>
Most importantly, you were who you were <eob> and you said what you thought. <eob>
Then in my late 20s, <eob> I shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai, <eob> and my framework, <eob> like the newly industrialized <eol> aspirational humanity, <eob> began to alter. <eob>
In the urban rush for a new, <eol> more embellished survival, <eob> things started to look a little different. <eob>
I met people who had descended <eol> from all over the world, <eob> faces, races, <eol> genders, money-lenders. <eob>
Definitions became more and more fluid. <eob>
Work began to define you at that time <eob> in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner, <eob> and all the systems started <eol> to feel less reliable to me, <eob> almost too thick to hold on <eob> to the diversity of mankind <eob> and the human need to progress and grow. <eob>
Ideas were flowing <eol> with more freedom and speed. <eob>
And I experienced the miracle <eol> of human innovation and cooperation, <eob> and my own creativity, <eob> when supported by the resourcefulness <eol> of this collective endeavor, <eob> catapulted me into superstardom. <eob>
I started to feel that I had arrived, <eob> and generally, by the time <eol> I was 40, I was really, really flying. <eob> I was all over the place. <eob> You know? I'd done 50 films by then <eob> and 200 songs, <eob> and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians. <eob>
I had been given the highest civil honor <eol> by the French government, <eob> the title of which for the life of me <eol> I can't pronounce even until now. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm sorry, France, and thank you, <eol> France, for doing that. <eob>
But much bigger than that, <eol> I got to meet Angelina Jolie -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
for two and a half seconds. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I'm sure she also remembers <eol> that encounter somewhere. <eob>
OK, maybe not. <eob>
And I sat next to Hannah Montana <eol> on a round dinner table <eob> with her back towards me <eol> most of the time. <eob>
Like I said, I was flying, <eol> from Miley to Jolie, <eob> and humanity was soaring with me. <eob>
We were both pretty much flying <eol> off the handle, actually. <eob>
And then you all know what happened. <eob> The internet happened. <eob> I was in my late 40s, <eob> and I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage <eob> and assuming that, you know, <eol> people who peered into my world <eob> would admire it <eob> for the miracle I believed it to be. <eob>
But something else awaited <eol> me and humanity. <eob>
You know, we had expected an expansion <eol> of ideas and dreams <eob> with the enhanced connectivity of the world. <eob>
We had not bargained for the village-like <eol> enclosure of thought, <eob> of judgment, of definition <eob> that flowed from the same place <eob> that freedom and revolution <eol> was taking place in. <eob>
Everything I said took a new meaning. <eob>
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly -- <eob> was there for the world to comment <eol> upon and judge. <eob>
As a matter of fact, everything <eol> I didn't say or do also <eob> met with the same fate. <eob>
Four years ago, <eob> my lovely wife Gauri and me <eol> decided to have a third child. <eob>
It was claimed on the net <eob> that he was the love child <eob> of our first child <eob> who was 15 years old. <eob>
Apparently, he had sown his wild <eol> oats with a girl <eob> while driving her car in Romania. <eob>
And yeah, there was a fake video <eol> to go with it. <eob>
And we were so disturbed as a family. <eob>
My son, who is 19 now, <eob> even now when you say "hello" to him, <eob> he just turns around and says, <eob> "But bro, I didn't even have <eol> a European driving license." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> In this new world, <eob> slowly, reality became <eol> virtual and virtual became real, <eob> and I started to feel <eob> that I could not be who I wanted to be <eol> or say what I actually thought, <eob> and humanity at this time <eob> completely identified with me. <eob>
I think both of us were going <eol> through our midlife crisis, <eob> and humanity, like me, was becoming <eol> an overexposed prima donna. <eob>
I started to sell everything, <eob> from hair oil to diesel generators. <eob>
Humanity was buying everything <eob> from crude oil to nuclear reactors. <eob>
You know, I even tried to get <eol> into a skintight superhero suit <eob> to reinvent myself. <eob>
I must admit I failed miserably. <eob>
And just an aside I want to say <eol> on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men <eob> and Supermen of the world, <eob> you have to commend them, <eob> because it really hurts <eol> in the crotch, that superhero suit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, I'm being honest. <eob>
I need to tell you this here. <eob> Really. <eob> And accidentally, I happened <eol> to even invent a new dance form <eob> which I didn't realize, and it became a rage. <eob>
So if it's all right, <eob> and you've seen a bit of me, so <eol> I'm quite shameless, I'll show you. <eob>
It was called the Lungi dance. <eob>
So if it's all right, <eob> I'll just show you. <eob>
I'm talented otherwise. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
So it went something like this. <eob>
Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. <eob> Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. <eob> Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi. <eob>
That's it. It became a rage. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
It really did. <eob> Like you notice, nobody could make any sense <eol> of what was happening except me, <eob> and I didn't give a damn, really, <eob> because the whole world, <eol> and whole humanity, <eob> seemed as confused <eol> and lost as I was. <eob>
I didn't give up then. <eob>
I even tried to reconstruct <eol> my identity on the social media <eob> like everyone else does. <eob>
I thought if I put <eol> on philosophical tweets out there <eob> people will think I'm with it, <eob> but some of the responses <eol> I got from those tweets <eob> were extremely confusing acronyms <eol> which I didn't understand. You know? <eob> ROFL, LOL. <eob> "Adidas," somebody wrote back <eol> to one of my more thought-provoking tweets <eob> and I was wondering why would you name a sneaker, <eob> I mean, why would you write back <eol> the name of a sneaker to me? <eob>
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter, <eol> and she enlightened me. <eob> "Adidas" now means "All day <eol> I dream about sex." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Really. <eob> I didn't know if you know that. <eob>
So I wrote back, "WTF" in bold <eol> to Mr. Adidas, <eob> thanking secretly that some acronyms <eol> and things won't change at all. <eob> WTF. <eob>
But here we are. <eob> I am 51 years old, like I told you, <eob> and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding, <eob> I just want to tell you <eob> if there has been a momentous <eol> time for humanity to exist, <eob> it is now, <eob> because the present you is brave. <eob> The present you is hopeful. <eob> The present you is innovative and resourceful, <eob> and of course, the present you is annoyingly indefinable. <eob>
And in this spell-binding, <eob> imperfect moment of existence, <eob> feeling a little brave just before <eol> I came here, <eob> I decided to take a good, hard look at my face. <eob>
And I realized that I'm beginning <eol> to look more and more <eob> like the wax statue of me <eol> at Madame Tussaud's. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, and in that moment of realization, <eob> I asked the most central <eol> and pertinent question to humanity and me: <eob> Do I need to fix my face? <eob> Really. <eob> I'm an actor, like I told you, <eob> a modern expression of human creativity. <eob>
The land I come from <eob> is the source of inexplicable <eol> but very simple spirituality. <eob>
Yeah. <eob> In its immense generosity, <eob> India decided somehow <eob> that I, the Muslim son <eol> of a broke freedom fighter <eob> who accidentally ventured <eol> into the business of selling dreams, <eob> should become its king of romance, <eob> the "Badhshah of Bollywood," <eob> the greatest lover the country <eol> has ever seen ... <eob> with this face. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which has alternately been described <eol> as ugly, unconventional, <eob> and strangely, not chocolatey enough. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The people of this ancient land <eob> embraced me in their limitless love, <eob> and I've learned from these people <eob> that neither power nor poverty <eob> can make your life more magical <eob> or less tortuous. <eob>
I've learned from the people of my country <eob> that the dignity of a life, <eob> a human being, a culture, <eol> a religion, a country <eob> actually resides in its ability <eob> for grace and compassion. <eob>
I've learned that whatever moves you, <eob> whatever urges you to create, to build, <eob> whatever keeps you from failing, <eob> whatever helps you survive, <eob> is perhaps the oldest and the simplest <eol> emotion known to mankind, <eob> and that is love. <eob>
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote, <eob>
(Recites poem in Hindi) <eob> (Poem ends) <eob>
Which loosely translates <eol> into that whatever -- <eob> yeah, if you know Hindi, please clap, yeah. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's very difficult to remember. <eob>
Which loosely translates into actually saying <eob> that all the books of knowledge <eol> that you might read <eob> and then go ahead and impart your knowledge <eob> through innovation, through creativity, <eol> through technology, <eob> but mankind will never <eol> be the wiser about its future <eob> unless it is coupled with a sense of love <eol> and compassion for their fellow beings. <eob>
The two and a half alphabets <eol> which form the word "प्रेम," <eob> which means "love," <eob> if you are able to understand that <eob> and practice it, <eob> that itself is enough to enlighten mankind. <eob>
So I truly believe the future "you" <eob> has to be a you that loves. <eob>
Otherwise it will cease to flourish. <eob>
It will perish in its own self-absorption. <eob>
So you may use your power <eob> to build walls <eob> and keep people outside, <eob> or you may use it to break barriers <eol> and welcome them in. <eob>
You may use your faith <eob> to make people afraid <eob> and terrify them <eol> into submission, <eob> or you can use it to give courage <eol> to people <eob> so they rise to the greatest heights <eol> of enlightenment. <eob>
You can use your energy <eob> to build nuclear bombs <eol> and spread the darkness of destruction, <eob> or you can use it to spread <eol> the joy of light to millions. <eob>
You may filthy up the oceans callously <eol> and cut down all the forests. <eob>
You can destroy the ecology, <eob> or turn to them with love <eob> and regenerate life <eol> from the waters and trees. <eob>
You may land on Mars <eob> and build armed citadels, <eob> or you may look for life-forms <eol> and species to learn from and respect. <eob>
And you can use all the moneys <eol> we all have earned <eob> to wage futile wars <eob> and give guns in the hands <eol> of little children <eob> to kill each other with, <eob> or you can use it <eob> to make more food <eob> to fill their stomachs with. <eob>
My country has taught me <eob> the capacity for a human being to love <eol> is akin to godliness. <eob>
It shines forth in a world <eob> which civilization, I think, <eol> already has tampered too much with. <eob>
In the last few days, the talks <eol> here, the wonderful people <eob> coming and showing their talent, <eob> talking about individual <eol> achievements, the innovation, the technology, <eob> the sciences, the knowledge <eol> we are gaining by being here <eob> in the presence of TED Talks and all of you <eob> are reasons enough for us <eol> to celebrate the future "us." <eob> But within that celebration <eob> the quest to cultivate <eol> our capacity for love and compassion <eob> has to assert itself, <eol> has to assert itself, <eob> just as equally. <eob>
So I believe the future "you" <eob> is an infinite you. <eob>
It's called a chakra <eol> in India, like a circle. <eob>
It ends where it begins <eol> from to complete itself. <eob>
A you that perceives time <eol> and space differently <eob> understands both <eob> your unimaginable <eob> and fantastic importance <eob> and your complete unimportance in the larger context <eol> of the universe. <eob>
A you that returns back <eob> to the original innocence <eol> of humanity, <eob> which loves from the purity of heart, <eob> which sees from the eyes of truth, <eob> which dreams from the clarity <eol> of an untampered mind. <eob>
The future "you" has to be <eob> like an aging movie star <eob> who has been made to believe <eol> that there is a possibility <eob> of a world which is completely, <eob> wholly, self-obsessively <eob> in love with itself. <eob>
A world -- really, it has to be a you <eob> to create a world <eob> which is its own best lover. <eob>
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> should be the future "you." <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> Shukriya. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
This is Lee Sedol. <eob> Lee Sedol is one of the world's greatest Go players, <eob> and he's having what my friends <eol> in Silicon Valley call <eob> a "Holy Cow" moment -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a moment where we realize <eob> that AI is actually progressing <eol> a lot faster than we expected. <eob>
So humans have lost on the Go board. <eob>
What about the real world? <eob>
Well, the real world is much bigger, <eob> much more complicated than the Go board. <eob>
It's a lot less visible, <eob> but it's still a decision problem. <eob>
And if we think about <eol> some of the technologies <eob> that are coming down the pike ... <eob> Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading <eol> is not yet happening in machines, <eob> at least with understanding. <eob>
But that will happen, <eob> and when that happens, <eob> very soon afterwards, <eob> machines will have read everything <eol> that the human race has ever written. <eob>
And that will enable machines, <eob> along with the ability to look <eol> further ahead than humans can, <eob> as we've already seen in Go, <eob> if they also have access <eol> to more information, <eob> they'll be able to make better decisions <eol> in the real world than we can. <eob>
So is that a good thing? <eob>
Well, I hope so. <eob>
Our entire civilization, <eol> everything that we value, <eob> is based on our intelligence. <eob>
And if we had access <eol> to a lot more intelligence, <eob> then there's really no limit <eol> to what the human race can do. <eob>
And I think this could be, as some people <eol> have described it, <eob> the biggest event in human history. <eob>
So why are people <eol> saying things like this, <eob> that AI might spell <eol> the end of the human race? <eob> Is this a new thing? <eob>
Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates <eol> and Stephen Hawking? <eob>
Actually, no. This idea <eol> has been around for a while. <eob>
Here's a quotation: <eob> "Even if we could keep the machines <eol> in a subservient position, <eob> for instance, by turning off the power <eol> at strategic moments" — <eob> and I'll come back to that <eol> "turning off the power" idea later on — <eob> "we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled." <eob> So who said this? <eob>
This is Alan Turing in 1951. <eob>
Alan Turing, as you know, <eol> is the father of computer science <eob> and in many ways, the father <eol> of AI as well. <eob>
So if we think about this problem, <eob> the problem of creating something <eol> more intelligent than your own species, <eob> we might call this "the gorilla problem," <eob> because gorillas' ancestors <eol> did this a few million years ago, <eob> and now we can ask the gorillas: <eob> Was this a good idea? <eob>
So here they are having a meeting <eol> to discuss whether it was a good idea, <eob> and after a little while, <eol> they conclude, no, <eob> this was a terrible idea. <eob> Our species is in dire straits. <eob> In fact, you can see <eol> the existential sadness in their eyes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this queasy feeling that making <eol> something smarter than your own species <eob> is maybe not a good idea -- <eob> what can we do about that? <eob>
Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI, <eob> and because of all the benefits <eol> that I mentioned <eob> and because I'm an AI researcher, <eob> I'm not having that. <eob>
I actually want to be able <eol> to keep doing AI. <eob>
So we actually need to nail <eol> down the problem a bit more. <eob>
What exactly is the problem? <eob>
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe? <eob>
So here's another quotation: <eob> "We had better be quite sure <eol> that the purpose put into the machine <eob> is the purpose which we really desire." <eob> This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, <eob> shortly after he watched one of the very early learning systems <eob> learn to play checkers better <eol> than its creator. <eob>
But this could equally have been said <eob> by King Midas. <eob> King Midas said, "I want everything <eol> I touch to turn to gold," <eob> and he got exactly what he asked for. <eob>
That was the purpose <eol> that he put into the machine, <eob> so to speak, <eob> and then his food and his drink <eol> and his relatives turned to gold <eob> and he died in misery and starvation. <eob>
So we'll call this "the King Midas problem" <eob> of stating an objective which is not, in fact, <eob> truly aligned with what we want. <eob>
In modern terms, we call this <eol> "the value alignment problem." <eob>
Putting in the wrong objective <eol> is not the only part of the problem. <eob>
There's another part. <eob>
If you put an objective into a machine, <eob> even something as simple <eol> as, "Fetch the coffee," <eob> the machine says to itself, <eob> "Well, how might I fail <eol> to fetch the coffee? <eob>
Someone might switch me off. <eob>
OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. <eob>
I will disable my 'off' switch. <eob>
I will do anything <eol> to defend myself against interference <eob> with this objective that I have been given." <eob> So this single-minded pursuit <eob> in a very defensive mode of an objective <eol> that is, in fact, <eob> not aligned with the true objectives <eol> of the human race -- <eob> that's the problem that we face. <eob>
And in fact, that's the high-value <eol> takeaway from this talk. <eob>
If you want to remember one thing, <eob> it's that you can't fetch the coffee <eol> if you're dead. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's very simple. Just remember that. Repeat it <eol> to yourself three times a day. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And in fact, this is exactly the plot <eob> of "2001: [A Space Odyssey]" <eob> HAL has an objective, a mission, <eob> which is not aligned <eol> with the objectives of the humans, <eob> and that leads to this conflict. <eob>
Now fortunately, HAL <eol> is not superintelligent. <eob>
He's pretty smart, <eol> but eventually Dave outwits him <eob> and manages to switch him off. <eob>
But we might not be so lucky. <eob>
So what are we going to do? <eob>
I'm trying to redefine AI <eob> to get away from this classical notion <eob> of machines that intelligently pursue objectives. <eob>
There are three principles involved. <eob>
The first one is a principle <eol> of altruism, if you like, <eob> that the robot's only objective <eob> is to maximize the realization <eol> of human objectives, <eob> of human values. <eob>
And by values here <eol> I don't mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values. <eob>
I just mean whatever it is that <eol> the human would prefer <eob> their life to be like. <eob>
And so this actually violates Asimov's law <eob> that the robot has to protect <eol> its own existence. <eob>
It has no interest in preserving <eol> its existence whatsoever. <eob>
The second law is a law <eol> of humility, if you like. <eob>
And this turns out to be really important <eol> to make robots safe. <eob>
It says that the robot <eol> does not know <eob> what those human values are, <eob> so it has to maximize them, <eol> but it doesn't know what they are. <eob>
And that avoids this problem <eol> of single-minded pursuit <eob> of an objective. <eob>
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. <eob>
Now, in order to be useful to us, <eob> it has to have some idea of what we want. <eob>
It obtains that information primarily <eol> by observation of human choices, <eob> so our own choices reveal information <eob> about what it is that we prefer our lives <eol> to be like. <eob>
So those are the three principles. <eob>
Let's see how that applies <eol> to this question of: <eob> "Can you switch the machine off?" <eol> as Turing suggested. <eob>
So here's a PR2 robot. <eob> This is one that we have in our lab, <eob> and it has a big red "off" <eol> switch right on the back. <eob>
The question is: Is it going <eol> to let you switch it off? <eob> If we do it the classical way, <eob> we give it the objective of, <eol> "Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee, <eob> I can't fetch the coffee <eol> if I'm dead," <eob> so obviously the PR2 <eol> has been listening to my talk, <eob> and so it says, therefore, <eol> "I must disable my 'off' switch, <eob> and probably taser all the other people in Starbucks <eob> who might interfere with me." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this seems to be inevitable, right? <eob>
This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable, <eob> and it follows from having a concrete, <eol> definite objective. <eob>
So what happens if the machine is uncertain <eol> about the objective? <eob>
Well, it reasons in a different way. <eob>
It says, "OK, <eol> the human might switch me off, <eob> but only if I'm doing something wrong. <eob>
Well, I don't really know what wrong is, <eob> but I know that I don't want to do it." <eob> So that's the first <eol> and second principles right there. <eob> "So I should let <eol> the human switch me off." <eob> And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot <eol> has <eob> to allow the human to switch it off, <eob> and it's directly tied to the degree <eob> of uncertainty about the underlying objective. <eob>
And then when the machine is switched off, <eob> that third principle comes into play. <eob>
It learns something about the objectives <eol> it should be pursuing, <eob> because it learns that what it did wasn't right. <eob>
In fact, we can, with suitable use <eol> of Greek symbols, <eob> as mathematicians usually do, <eob> we can actually prove a theorem <eob> that says that such a robot is provably <eol> beneficial to the human. <eob>
You are provably better off with a machine <eol> that's designed in this way <eob> than without it. <eob>
So this is a very simple example, <eol> but this is the first step <eob> in what we're trying to do <eol> with human-compatible AI. <eob>
Now, this third principle, <eob> I think is the one that you're probably <eol> scratching your head over. <eob>
You're probably thinking, <eol> "Well, you know, I behave badly. <eob>
I don't want my robot to behave like me. <eob>
I sneak down in the middle of the night <eol> and take stuff from the fridge. <eob>
I do this and that." <eob> There's all kinds of things <eol> you don't want the robot doing. <eob>
But in fact, <eol> it doesn't quite work that way. <eob>
Just because you behave badly <eob> doesn't mean the robot <eol> is going to copy your behavior. <eob>
It's going to understand your motivations <eol> and maybe help you resist them, <eob> if appropriate. <eob>
But it's still difficult. <eob>
What we're trying to do, in fact, <eob> is to allow machines to predict <eol> for any person and for any possible life <eob> that they could live, <eob> and the lives of everybody else: <eob> Which would they prefer? <eob>
And there are many, many difficulties <eol> involved in doing this; <eob> I don't expect that this is going <eol> to get solved very quickly. <eob>
The real difficulties, in fact, are us. <eob>
As I have already mentioned, <eol> we behave badly. <eob>
In fact, some of us are downright nasty. <eob>
Now the robot, as I said, <eol> doesn't have to copy the behavior. <eob>
The robot does not <eol> have any objective of its own. <eob>
It's purely altruistic. <eob>
And it's not designed just to satisfy <eol> the desires of one person, the user, <eob> but in fact it has to respect <eol> the preferences of everybody. <eob>
So it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness, <eob> and it can even understand <eol> that your nastiness, for example, <eob> you may take bribes as a passport official <eob> because you need to feed your family <eol> and send your kids to school. <eob>
It can understand that; <eol> it doesn't mean it's going to steal. <eob>
In fact, it'll just help you <eol> send your kids to school. <eob>
We are also computationally limited. <eob>
Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player, <eob> but he still lost. <eob>
So if we look at his actions, he took <eol> an action that lost the game. <eob>
That doesn't mean he wanted to lose. <eob>
So to understand his behavior, <eob> we actually have to invert through <eol> a model of human cognition <eob> that includes our computational limitations -- <eol> a very complicated model. <eob>
But it's still something <eol> that we can work on understanding. <eob>
Probably the most difficult part, <eol> from my point of view as an AI researcher, <eob> is the fact that there are <eol> lots of us, <eob> and so the machine has to somehow trade <eol> off, weigh up the preferences <eob> of many different people, <eob> and there are different ways to do that. <eob>
Economists, sociologists, moral philosophers <eol> have understood that, <eob> and we are actively looking for collaboration. <eob>
Let's have a look and see what happens <eol> when you get that wrong. <eob>
So you can have a conversation, for example, <eob> with your intelligent personal assistant <eob> that might be available <eol> in a few years' time. <eob>
Think of a Siri on steroids. <eob>
So Siri says, "Your wife <eol> called to remind you about dinner tonight." <eob> And of course, you've forgotten. <eol> "What? What dinner? <eob> What are you talking about?" <eob>
"Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm." <eob>
"I can't do that. <eob>
I'm meeting with the secretary-general <eol> at 7: 30. <eob>
How could this have happened?" <eob>
"Well, I did warn you, <eol> but you overrode my recommendation." <eob>
"Well, what am I going to do? <eob>
I can't just tell him I'm too busy. " <eob>
"Don't worry. I arranged <eol> for his plane to be delayed." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Some kind of computer malfunction." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Really? You can do that?" <eob>
"He sends his profound apologies <eob> and looks forward to meeting you <eol> for lunch tomorrow." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the values here -- <eol> there's a slight mistake going on. <eob>
This is clearly following my wife's values <eob> which is "Happy wife, happy life." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It could go the other way. <eob>
You could come home <eol> after a hard day's work, <eob> and the computer says, "Long day?" <eob>
"Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch." <eob>
"You must be very hungry." <eob>
"Starving, yeah. Could <eol> you make some dinner?" <eob>
"There's something I need to tell you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"There are humans in South Sudan <eol> who are in more urgent need than you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we have to solve these problems, <eob> and I'm looking forward <eol> to working on them. <eob>
There are reasons for optimism. <eob>
One reason is, <eob> there is a massive amount of data. <eob>
Because remember -- I said <eol> they're going to read everything <eob> the human race has ever written. <eob>
Most of what we write <eol> about is human beings doing things <eob> and other people getting upset about it. <eob>
So there's a massive amount <eol> of data to learn from. <eob>
There's also a very strong <eol> economic incentive <eob> to get this right. <eob>
So imagine your domestic robot's at home. <eob>
You're late from work again <eol> and the robot has to feed the kids, <eob> and the kids are hungry <eol> and there's nothing in the fridge. <eob>
And the robot sees the cat. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And the robot hasn't quite learned <eol> the human value function properly, <eob> so it doesn't understand <eob> the sentimental value of the cat outweighs <eol> the nutritional value of the cat. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So then what happens? <eob> Well, it happens like this: <eob> "Deranged robot cooks kitty <eol> for family dinner." <eob> That one incident would be <eol> the end of the domestic robot industry. <eob>
So there's a huge incentive <eob> to get this right <eob> long before we reach <eol> superintelligent machines. <eob>
So to summarize: <eob> I'm actually trying to change <eol> the definition of AI <eob> so that we have provably <eol> beneficial machines. <eob>
And the principles are: <eob> machines that are altruistic, <eob> that want to achieve <eol> only our objectives, <eob> but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, <eob> and will watch all of us <eob> to learn more about what it <eol> is that we really want. <eob>
And hopefully in the process, <eol> we will learn to be better people. <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart. <eob>
We're going to stand here a bit <eol> because I think they're setting up <eob> for our next speaker. <eob>
A couple of questions. <eob> So the idea of programming in ignorance <eol> seems intuitively really powerful. <eob>
As you get to superintelligence, <eob> what's going to stop a robot <eob> reading literature and discovering <eol> this idea that knowledge <eob> is actually better than ignorance <eob> and still just shifting its own goals <eol> and rewriting that programming? <eob>
Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want it <eol> to learn more, as I said, <eob> about our objectives. <eob>
It'll only become more certain <eol> as it becomes more correct, <eob> so the evidence is there <eob> and it's going to be designed <eol> to interpret it correctly. <eob>
It will understand, for example, <eol> that books are very biased <eob> in the evidence they contain. <eob>
They only talk about kings and princes <eob> and elite white male people doing stuff. <eob>
So it's a complicated problem, <eob> but as it learns more <eob> about our objectives <eob> it will become more and more useful to us. <eob>
CA: And you couldn't just boil it down <eol> to one law, <eob> you know, hardwired in: <eob> "if any human ever tries to switch me off, <eob> I comply. I comply." <eob>
SR: Absolutely not. <eob> That would be a terrible idea. <eob>
So imagine that you have <eol> a self-driving car <eob> and you want to send <eol> your five-year-old <eob> off to preschool. <eob>
Do you want your five-year-old <eol> to be able to switch off the car <eob> while it's driving along? <eob> Probably not. <eob> So it needs to understand how rational <eol> and sensible the person is. <eob>
The more rational the person, <eob> the more willing you are <eol> to be switched off. <eob>
If the person is completely random <eol> or even malicious, <eob> then you're less willing <eol> to be switched off. <eob>
CA: All right. Stuart, <eol> can I just say, <eob> I really, really hope you figure <eol> this out for us. <eob>
Thank you so much for that talk. <eol> That was amazing. <eob>
Do you ever think about how important <eol> the oceans are in our daily lives? <eob>
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet. <eob>
They provide half the oxygen we breathe. <eob>
They moderate our climate. <eob>
And they provide jobs <eol> and medicine and food <eob> including 20 percent of protein <eol> to feed the entire world population. <eob>
People used to think <eol> that the oceans were so vast <eob> that they wouldn't be affected <eol> by human activities. <eob>
Well today I'm going to tell you <eol> about a serious reality <eob> that is changing our oceans <eol> called ocean acidification, <eob> or the evil twin of climate change. <eob>
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed <eol> 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide <eob> that we have emitted to the atmosphere? <eob>
Now this is just another great service <eol> provided by the oceans <eob> since carbon dioxide <eol> is one of the greenhouse gases <eob> that's causing climate change. <eob>
But as we keep pumping <eol> more and more and more <eob> carbon dioxide into the atmosphere <eob> more is dissolving into the oceans. <eob>
And this is what's changing <eol> our ocean chemistry. <eob>
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, <eob> it undergoes a number <eol> of chemical reactions. <eob>
Now lucky for you, <eob> I don't have time to get into <eol> the details of the chemistry for today, <eob>
But I'll tell you as more carbon <eol> dioxide enters the ocean, <eob> the seawater pH goes down. <eob>
And this basically means that there <eol> is an increase in ocean acidity. <eob>
And this whole process <eol> is called ocean acidification. <eob>
And it's happening <eol> alongside climate change. <eob>
Scientists have been monitoring <eol> ocean acidification for over two decades. <eob>
This figure is an important <eol> time series in Hawaii, <eob> and the top line shows steadily increasing <eol> concentrations of carbon dioxide, <eob> or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere. <eob>
And this is directly as a result <eol> of human activities. <eob>
The line underneath shows the increasing <eol> concentrations of carbon dioxide <eob> that is dissolved <eol> in the surface of the ocean <eob> which you can see is increasing <eol> at the same rate <eob> as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere <eol> since measurements began. <eob>
The line on the bottom shows <eol> then shows the change in chemistry. <eob>
As more carbon dioxide <eol> has entered the ocean, <eob> the seawater pH has gone down, <eob> which basically means there has been <eol> an increase in ocean acidity. <eob>
Now in Ireland, scientists are also <eol> monitoring ocean acidification -- <eob> scientists at the Marine <eol> Institute and NUI Galway. <eob>
And we, too, are seeing <eol> acidification at the same rate <eob> as these main ocean time-series <eol> sites around the world. <eob>
So it's happening right at our doorstep. <eob>
Now I'd like to give you an example <eol> of just how we collect our data <eob> to monitor a changing ocean. <eob>
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples <eol> in the middle of winter. <eob>
So as you can imagine, <eol> in the North Atlantic <eob> we get hit with some seriously <eol> stormy conditions -- <eob> so not for any of you <eol> who get a little motion sickness, <eob> but we are collecting <eol> some very valuable data. <eob>
So we lower this instrument <eol> over the side of the ship, <eob> and there are sensors <eol> that are mounted on the bottom <eob> that can tell us information about <eol> the surrounding water, <eob> such as temperature <eol> or dissolved oxygen. <eob>
And then we can collect our seawater <eol> samples in these large bottles. <eob>
So we start at the bottom, <eol> which can be over four kilometers deep <eob> just off our continental shelf, <eob> and we take samples at regular intervals <eol> right up to the surface. <eob>
We take the seawater back on the deck, <eob> and then we can either <eol> analyze them on the ship <eob> or back in the laboratory <eol> for the different chemicals parameters. <eob>
But why should we care? <eob>
How is ocean acidification <eol> going to affect all of us? <eob>
Well, here are the worrying facts. <eob>
There has already been an increase <eol> in ocean acidity of 26 percent <eob> since pre-industrial times, <eol> which is directly due to human activities. <eob>
Unless we can start slowing down <eol> our carbon dioxide emissions, <eob> we're expecting an increase <eol> in ocean acidity of 170 percent <eob> by the end of this century. <eob>
I mean this is within <eol> our children's lifetime. <eob>
This rate of acidification <eol> is 10 times faster <eob> than any acidification in our oceans <eol> for over 55 million years. <eob>
So our marine life have never, <eol> ever experienced <eob> such a fast rate of change before. <eob>
So we literally could not know <eol> how they're going to cope. <eob>
Now there was a natural acidification <eol> event millions of years ago, <eob> which was much slower <eol> than what we're seeing today. <eob>
And this coincided with a mass extinction <eol> of many marine species. <eob>
So is that what we're headed for? <eob> Well, maybe. <eob> Studies are showing <eol> some species are actually doing quite well <eob> but many are showing a negative response. <eob>
One of the big concerns is <eol> as ocean acidity increases, <eob> the concentration of carbonate <eol> ions in seawater decrease. <eob>
Now these ions are basically <eol> the building blocks <eob> for many marine species <eol> to make their shells, <eob> for example crabs or mussels, oysters. <eob>
Another example are corals. <eob> They also need these carbonate <eol> ions in seawater <eob> to make their coral structure <eol> in order to build coral reefs. <eob>
As ocean acidity increases <eob> and the concentration <eol> of carbonate ions decrease, <eob> these species first find it more difficult <eol> to make their shells. <eob>
And at even even lower levels, <eol> they can actually begin to dissolve . <eob>
This here is a pteropod, it's called <eol> a sea butterfly. <eob>
And it's an important food source <eol> in the ocean for many species, <eob> from krill to salmon right up to whales. <eob>
The shell of the pteropod <eol> was placed into seawater at a pH that we're expecting <eob> by the end of this century. <eob>
After only 45 days <eol> at this very realistic pH, <eob> you can see the shell <eol> has almost completely dissolved. <eob>
So ocean acidification could affect <eol> right up through the food chain -- <eob> and right onto our dinner plates. <eob>
I mean who here <eol> likes shellfish? Or salmon? <eob> Or many other fish species <eob> whose food source <eol> in the ocean could be affected? <eob>
just off our continental shelf, <eob> These are cold-water corals. <eob> And did you know we actually have <eol> cold-water corals in Irish waters, <eob>
And they support rich biodiversity, <eol> including some very important fisheries. <eob>
It's projected that <eob> by the end of this century, <eob> 70 percent of all known <eol> cold-water corals in the entire ocean <eob> will be surrounded by seawater <eol> that is dissolving their coral structure. <eob>
The last example I have <eol> are these healthy tropical corals. <eob>
They were placed in seawater at a pH <eol> we're expecting by the year 2100. <eob>
After six months, the coral <eol> has almost completely dissolved. <eob>
Now coral reefs support <eob> 25 percent of all marine life <eol> in the entire ocean. <eob> All marine life. <eob>
So you can see: ocean <eol> acidification is a global threat. <eob>
I have an eight-month-old baby boy. <eob>
Unless we start now to slow this down, <eob> I dread to think what our oceans <eol> will look like when he's a grown man. <eob>
We will see acidification. <eob>
We have already put too much <eob> carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. <eob>
But we can slow this down. <eob>
We can prevent the worst-case scenario. <eob>
The only way of doing that <eob> is by reducing our <eol> carbon dioxide emissions. <eob>
This is important for both you and I, <eol> for industry, for governments. <eob>
We need to work together, <eol> slow down global warming <eob> slow down ocean acidification <eob> and help to maintain a healthy ocean <eol> and a healthy planet <eob> for our generation <eol> and for generations to come. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's six o'clock in the morning, <eob> pitch black outside. <eob>
My 14-year-old son <eol> is fast asleep in his bed, <eob> sleeping the reckless, deep sleep of a teenager. <eob>
I flip on the light and physically <eol> shake the poor boy awake, <eob> because I know that, like ripping <eol> off a Band-Aid, <eob> it's better to get it <eol> over with quickly. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I have a friend who yells "Fire!" just <eol> to rouse her sleeping teen. <eob>
And another who got so fed up <eob> that she had to dump cold water <eol> on her son's head <eob> just to get him out of bed. <eob>
Sound brutal ... <eob> but perhaps familiar? <eob>
Every morning I ask myself, <eob> "How can I — <eob> knowing what I know <eob> and doing what I do for a living — <eob> be doing this to my own son?" <eob> You see, <eob> I'm a sleep researcher. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So I know far too much about sleep <eob> and the consequences of sleep loss. <eob>
I know that I'm depriving my son <eol> of the sleep he desperately needs <eob> as a rapidly growing teenager. <eob>
I also know that by waking him up <eob> hours before his natural biological <eol> clock tells him he's ready, <eob> I'm literally robbing him <eol> of his dreams -- <eob> the type of sleep most associated with learning, <eol> memory consolidation <eob> and emotional processing. <eob>
But it's not just my kid <eol> that's being deprived of sleep. <eob>
Sleep deprivation <eol> among American teenagers is an epidemic. <eob>
Only about one in 10 gets the eight <eol> to 10 hours of sleep per night <eob> recommended by sleep scientists <eol> and pediatricians. <eob>
Now, if you're thinking to yourself, <eob> "Phew, we're doing good, <eol> my kid's getting eight hours," <eob> remember, <eob> eight hours is the minimum recommendation. <eob>
You're barely passing. <eob>
Eight hours is kind of like getting <eol> a C on your report card. <eob>
There are many factors <eol> contributing to this epidemic, <eob> but a major factor preventing teens <eol> from getting the sleep they need <eob> is actually a matter of public policy. <eob>
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat. <eob>
Across the country, <eob> many schools are starting around 7: <eol> 30am or earlier, <eob> despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend <eob> that middle and high school start no earlier than 8: 30am. <eob>
These early start policies have <eol> a direct effect on how much -- <eob> or really how little sleep American teenagers <eol> are getting. <eob>
They're also pitting teenagers <eol> and their parents <eob> in a fundamentally unwinnable fight <eol> against their own bodies. <eob>
Around the time of puberty, <eob> teenagers experience <eol> a delay in their biological clock, <eob> which determines when we feel most awake <eol> and when we feel most sleepy. <eob>
This is driven in part by a shift <eol> in the release of the hormone melatonin. <eob>
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing <eol> melatonin until around 11pm, <eob> which is two hours later than what we see <eol> in adults or younger children. <eob>
This means that waking a teenager up <eol> at 6am is the biological equivalent <eob> of waking an adult up at 4am. <eob>
On the unfortunate days when I have <eol> to wake up at 4am, <eob> I'm a zombie. <eob> Functionally useless. <eob> I can't think straight, <eob> I'm irritable, <eob> and I probably shouldn't be driving a car. <eob>
But this is how many American teenagers <eol> feel every single school day. <eob>
In fact, many of the, shall we say, <eob> unpleasant characteristics <eol> that we chalk up to being a teenager -- <eob> moodiness, irritability, laziness, depression -- <eob> could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation. <eob>
For many teens battling <eol> chronic sleep loss, <eob> their go-to strategy <eol> to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine <eob> in the form of venti frappuccinos, <eob> or energy drinks and shots. <eob>
So essentially, <eob> we've got an entire population <eol> of tired but wired youth. <eob>
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times know <eob> that adolescence is a period <eol> of dramatic brain development, <eob> particularly in the parts of the brain <eob> that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes, <eob> including reasoning, problem-solving <eol> and good judgment. <eob>
In other words, the very type <eol> of brain activity that's responsible <eob> for reining in those impulsive <eol> and often risky behaviors <eob> that are so characteristic <eol> of adolescence <eob> and that are so terrifying to us <eol> parents of teenagers. <eob>
They know that like the rest of us, <eob> when teenagers don't get <eol> the sleep they need, <eob> their brains, their bodies and behaviors suffer <eob> with both immediate and lasting effects. <eob>
They can't concentrate, <eob> their attention plummets <eob> and many will even show behavioral <eol> signs that mimic ADHD. <eob>
But the consequences of teen <eol> sleep loss go well beyond the classroom, <eob> sadly contributing to many <eol> of the mental health problems <eob> that skyrocket during adolescence, <eob> including substance use, <eob> depression and suicide. <eob>
In our work with teens <eol> from LA Unified School District, <eob> we found that teens with sleep problems <eob> were 55 percent more likely to have used <eol> alcohol in the past month. <eob>
In another study <eol> with over 30,000 high school students, <eob> they found that for each hour <eol> of lost sleep, <eob> there was a 38 percent increase <eol> in feeling sad or hopeless, <eob> and a 58 percent increase in teen suicide attempts. <eob>
And if that's not enough, <eob> teens who skip out <eol> on sleep are at increased risk <eob> for a host of physical health problems <eol> that plague our country, <eob> including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. <eob>
Then there's the risk of putting <eol> a sleep-deprived teen, <eob> with a newly minted driver's license, <eob> behind the wheel. <eob>
Studies have shown <eol> that getting five hours or less of sleep per night <eob> is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content <eol> above the legal limit. <eob>
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times, <eob> and researchers in this area, <eob> have produced tremendous science <eob> showing the tremendous benefits <eol> of later start times. <eob>
The findings are unequivocal, <eob> and as a sleep scientist, <eob> I rarely get to speak <eol> with that kind of certainty. <eob>
Teens from districts with later <eol> start times get more sleep. <eob>
To the naysayers who may think <eol> that if schools start later, <eob> teens will just stay up later, <eob> the truth is, <eob> their bedtimes stay the same, <eob> but their wake-up times get extended, <eob> resulting in more sleep. <eob>
They're more likely to show up for school; <eob> school absences dropped by 25 percent <eol> in one district. <eob>
And they're less likely to drop out. <eob>
Not surprisingly, <eol> they do better academically. <eob>
So this has real implications <eol> for reducing the achievement gap. <eob>
Standardized test <eol> scores in math and reading <eob> go up by two to three percentage <eol> points. <eob>
That's as powerful <eob> as reducing class sizes by one-third <eol> fewer students, <eob> or replacing a so-so teacher <eol> in the classroom <eob> with a truly outstanding one. <eob>
Their mental and physical health improves, <eob> and even their families are happier. <eob>
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little more <eol> pleasantness from our teens, <eob> and a little less crankiness? <eob>
Even their communities are safer <eob> because car crash rates go down -- <eob> a 70 percent reduction in one district. <eob>
Given these tremendous benefits, <eob> you might think, <eob> well, this is a no-brainer, right? <eob>
So why have we as a society <eol> failed to heed this call? <eob>
Often the argument against later start <eol> times goes something like this: <eob> "Why should we delay start times for teenagers? <eob>
We need to toughen them up <eol> so they're ready for the real world! <eob> "But that's like saying <eol> to the parent of a two-year-old," <eob> Don't let Johnny nap, <eob> or he won't be ready for kindergarten. <eob> "(Laughter) <eob>
Not just for students and their families, <eob> but for communities as a whole. <eob> Updating bus routes, <eob> increased transportation costs, <eob> impact on sports, <eob> care before or after school. <eob>
These are the same concerns that come up <eol> in district after district, <eob> time and again around the country <eob> as school start times are debated. <eob>
And they're legitimate concerns, <eob> but these are problems <eol> we have to work through. <eob>
They are not valid excuses <eob> for failing to do the right thing <eol> for our children, <eob> which is to start middle and high schools <eol> no earlier than 8: 30am. <eob>
And in districts around the country, <eob> big and small, who have made this change, <eob> they found that these fears are often unfounded <eob> and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits <eol> for student health <eob> and performance, <eob> and our collective public safety. <eob>
So tomorrow morning, <eob> when coincidentally we get <eol> to set our clocks back by an hour <eob> and you get that delicious extra hour of sleep, <eob> and the day seems a little longer, <eob> and a little more full of hope, <eob> think about the tremendous power of sleep. <eob>
And think about what a gift it would be <eob> for our children to be able <eol> to wake up naturally, <eob> in harmony <eol> with their own biology. <eob>
Thank you, <eob> and pleasant dreams. <eob>
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya <eob> who is under the mistaken impression <eob> that this conference is named in honor <eol> of her father. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Who am I to contradict my baby girl? <eob>
As many of you know, there's something <eol> about becoming a parent <eob> that concentrates the mind on long-term problems <eol> like climate change. <eob>
It was the birth of my daughter <eol> that inspired me <eob> to launch this climate organization, <eob> in order to counteract <eol> the excessive polarization of this issue <eob> in the United States, <eob> and to find a conservative pathway forward. <eob>
Yes, folks, a Republican <eol> climate solution is possible, <eob> and you know what? <eob>
It may even be better. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let me try to prove that to you. <eob>
What we really need is a killer <eol> app to climate policy. <eob>
In the technology world, a killer app <eol> is an application so transformative <eob> that it creates its own market, <eob> like Uber. <eob>
In the climate world, <eob> a killer app is a new solution <eol> so promising <eob> that it can break through <eol> the seemingly insurmountable <eob> barriers to progress. <eob>
These include the psychological barrier. <eob>
Climate advocates have long been encouraging <eol> their fellow citizens <eob> to make short-term sacrifices now <eob> for benefits that accrue to other people <eob> in other countries 30 or 40 years in the future. <eob>
It just doesn't fly because it runs <eol> contrary to basic human nature. <eob>
Next is the geopolitical barrier. <eob>
Under the current rules of global trade, <eob> countries have a strong incentive <eol> to free ride off the emissions reductions <eob> of other nations, <eob> instead of strengthening their own programs. <eob>
This has been the curse <eob> of every international climate negotiations, <eol> including Paris. <eob>
Finally, we have the partisan barrier. <eob>
Even the most committed countries — <eob> Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada — <eob> are nowhere near reducing <eol> emissions at the required scale and speed. <eob> Not even close. <eob> And the partisan climate divide <eol> is far more acute <eob> here <eob> in the United States. <eob>
We are fundamentally stuck, <eob> and that is why we need a killer <eol> app of climate policy <eob> to break through each of these barriers. <eob>
I'm convinced that the road <eol> to climate progress <eob> in the United States <eob> runs through the Republican Party <eob> and the business community. <eob>
So in launching the Climate <eol> Leadership Council, <eob> I started by reaching out <eol> to a who's who of Republican elder statesmen <eob> and business leaders, <eob> including James Baker <eol> and George Schultz, <eob> the two most respected Republican elder statesmen in America; <eob> Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw, <eob> the two most respected conservative economists in the country; <eob> and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton, <eob> two of the most successful <eol> and admired business leaders. <eob>
Together, we co-authored <eob> "The Conservative Case <eol> For Carbon Dividends." <eob> This represents the first time <eob> that Republican leaders put forth <eob> a concrete market-based climate solution. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We presented our plan at the White House <eob> two weeks after President Trump moved in. <eob>
Almost every leading editorial board <eol> in the country <eob> has since endorsed our plan, <eob> and Fortune 100 companies <eol> from a wide range of industries <eob> are now getting behind it. <eob>
So by now you're probably wondering, <eob> what exactly is this plan? <eob>
Well, our carbon dividends solution <eol> is based on four pillars. <eob>
The first is a gradually <eol> rising carbon tax. <eob>
Although capitalism is a wonderful system, <eob> like many operating systems, <eol> it's prone to bugs, <eob> which, in this case, are called "market failures." <eob> By far the largest is that market prices fail to take <eob> social and environmental costs into account. <eob>
That means every market transaction <eol> is based on incorrect information. <eob>
This fundamental bug of capitalism, more <eol> than any other single factor, <eob> is to blame for our climate predicament. <eob>
Now in theory, this should be <eol> an easy problem to fix. <eob>
Economists agree <eob> that the best solution is to put a price <eol> on the carbon content of fossil fuels, <eob> otherwise known as a carbon tax. <eob>
This would discourage carbon emissions <eob> in every single economic transaction, <eob> every day of the year. <eob>
However, a carbon tax by itself <eol> has proven to be unpopular <eob> and a political dead end. <eob>
The answer is to return <eol> all the money raised <eob> directly to citizens, <eob> in the form of equal monthly dividends. <eob>
This would transform an unpopular carbon tax <eob> into a popular and populist solution, <eob> and it would also solve <eob> the underlying psychological barrier <eol> that we discussed, <eob> by giving everyone a concrete benefit <eol> in the here and now. <eob>
And these benefits would be significant. <eob>
Assuming a carbon tax rate <eol> that starts at 40 dollars per ton, <eob> a family of four would receive <eol> 2,000 dollars per year <eob> from the get-go. <eob>
According to the US Treasury Department, <eob> the bottom 70 percent of Americans <eol> would receive more in dividends <eob> than they would pay in increased energy prices. <eob>
That means 223 million Americans <eol> would win economically <eob> from solving climate change. <eob> And that -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
is revolutionary, <eob> and could fundamentally <eol> alter climate politics. <eob>
But there's another revolutionary <eol> element here. <eob>
The amount of the dividend would grow <eob> as the carbon tax rate increases. <eob>
The more we protect our climate, <eob> the more our citizens benefit. <eob>
This creates a positive feedback loop, <eob> which is crucial, <eob> because the only way we will reach <eol> our long-term emission-reduction goals <eob> is if the carbon tax rate <eol> goes up every year. <eob>
The third pillar of our program <eol> is eliminating regulations <eob> that are no longer needed <eob> once a carbon dividends plan <eol> is enacted. <eob>
This is a key selling point to Republicans <eob> and business leaders. <eob>
So why should we trade <eob> climate regulations for a price on carbon? <eob>
Well, let me show you. <eob>
Our plan would achieve <eol> nearly twice the emissions reductions <eob> of all Obama-era climate regulations combined, <eob> and nearly three times the new baseline <eob> after President Trump repeals <eol> all of those regulations. <eob>
That assumes a carbon tax starting <eol> at 40 dollars per ton, <eob> which translates into roughly an extra 36 cents <eol> per gallon of gas. <eob>
Our plan by itself <eob> would meet the high end <eol> of America's commitment <eob> under the Paris Climate Agreement, <eob> and as you can see, <eob> the emissions reductions <eol> would continue over time. <eob>
This illustrates the power <eol> of a conservative climate solution <eob> based on free markets <eol> and limited government. <eob>
We would end up with less regulation <eob> and far less pollution <eol> at the same time, <eob> while helping working-class Americans get ahead. <eob>
Doesn't that sound like something <eol> we could all support? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The fourth and final pillar of our program <eol> is a new climate domino effect, <eob> based on border carbon adjustments. <eob>
Now that may sound complicated, <eob> but it, too, <eob> is revolutionary, <eob> because it provides us a whole new strategy <eob> to reach a global price on carbon, <eob> which is ultimately what we need. <eob>
Let me show you an example. <eob>
Suppose Country A adopts <eol> a carbon dividends plan, <eob> and Country B does not. <eob>
Well, to level the playing field <eob> and protect the competitiveness <eol> of its industries, <eob> Country A would tax imports from Country B <eob> based on their carbon content. <eob> Fair enough. <eob> But here's where it gets really interesting, <eob> because the money raised <eol> at the border would increase the dividends <eob> going to the citizens of Country A. <eob> Well, how long do you think it would take <eol> the public in Country B to realize <eob> that that money should be going to them, <eob> and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land? <eob>
Add a few more countries, <eob> and we get a new climate domino effect. <eob>
Once one major country <eol> or region adopts carbon dividends <eob> with border carbon adjustments, <eob> other countries are compelled <eol> to follow suit. <eob>
One by one the dominoes fall. <eob>
And this domino effect <eol> could start anywhere. <eob>
My preference, strongly, is the United States, <eob> but it could also start in the United Kingdom, <eob> in Germany or another European country, <eob> or even in China. <eob>
Let's take China as an example. <eob>
China is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, <eob> but what its leaders care <eol> even more about <eob> is transitioning their economy <eol> to consumer-led economic development. <eob>
Well, nothing could do more <eol> to hasten that transition <eob> than giving every Chinese <eol> citizen a monthly dividend. <eob>
In fact, this is the only policy solution <eob> that would enable China <eol> to meet its environmental and economic goals <eob> at the same time. <eob>
That's why this is the killer <eol> app of climate policy, <eob> because it would enable us to overcome <eob> each of the barriers we discussed earlier: <eob> the psychological barrier, <eol> the partisan barrier, <eob> and, as we've just seen, <eol> the geopolitical barrier. <eob>
All we need is a country to lead the way. <eob>
And one method of finding <eol> what you're looking for <eob> is to take out an ad. <eob>
So let's read this one together. <eob>
Wanted: country to pioneer carbon <eol> dividends plan. <eob>
Cost to country: zero. <eob>
Starting date: as soon as possible. <eob>
Advantages: most effective climate solution, <eob> popular and populist, <eob> pro-growth and pro-business, <eob> shrinks government <eol> and helps the working class. <eob>
Additional compensation: gratitude of current <eol> and future generations, <eob> including my daughter. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: Just one question <eol> for you, Ted. <eob>
I'm actually not sure <eob> I've seen a conservative get <eol> a standing O at TED before that. <eob>
That's pretty cool. <eob>
The logic seems really powerful, <eob> but some people you talk <eol> to in politics <eob> say it's hard to imagine <eol> this still getting through Congress. <eob>
How are you feeling <eol> about momentum behind this? <eob>
Ted Halstead: So I understand <eol> that many are very pessimistic <eob> about what's happening <eob> in the United States <eob> with President Trump. <eob>
I'm less pessimistic; here's why. <eob> The actions of this White House, <eol> the early actions on climate, <eob> are just the first move <eol> in a complex game of climate chess. <eob>
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy; <eob> the pressure is going to mount <eol> for a replacement program, <eob> which is where we come in. <eob>
And there are three reasons why, <eol> which I'll go through real quickly. <eob>
One, the business community <eol> is fundamentally parting ways <eob> with the White House <eol> on climate change. <eob>
In fact, we're finding <eob> a number of Fortune 100 companies <eol> supporting our program. <eob>
Within two months, <eol> we're going to be announcing <eob> some really surprising names <eol> coming out in favor of this program. <eob>
Two, there is no issue in American politics <eob> where there's a more fundamental gap <eol> between the Republican base <eob> and the Republican leadership than climate change. <eob>
And three, thinking of this <eol> analogy of chess, <eob> the big decision up ahead is: <eol> Does the administration stay in Paris? <eob>
Well, let's pan it out both ways. <eob>
If it stays in Paris, as many are pushing <eol> for in the administration, <eob> well then that begs a question: <eol> What's the plan? <eob>
We have the plan. <eob>
But if they don't stay in Paris, <eob> the international pressure <eol> will be overwhelming. <eob>
Our Secretary of State will be asking other <eol> countries for NATO contributions, <eob> and they'll be saying, "No, give us our Paris commitment. <eob>
Come through on your commitments, <eol> we'll come through on ours." <eob>
So, international, business <eol> and even the Republican base <eob> will all be calling for a Republican replacement plan. <eob>
And, hopefully, we've provided one. <eob>
CA: <eob> Thank you <eob> so much, Ted. <eob>
TH: <eob> Thank you, <eob> Chris. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'd like to start with a simple question: <eob> Why do the poor make so many <eol> poor decisions? <eob>
I know it's a harsh question, <eob> but take a look at the data. <eob> The poor borrow more, save less, <eob> smoke more, exercise less, drink more <eob> and eat less healthfully. <eob> Why? <eob>
Well, the standard explanation <eob> was once summed up by the British <eol> Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. <eob>
And she called poverty <eol> "a personality defect." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A lack of character, basically. <eob>
Now, I'm sure not many of you <eol> would be so blunt. <eob>
But the idea that there's something <eol> wrong with the poor themselves <eob> is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher. <eob>
Some of you may believe <eol> that the poor should be held responsible <eob> for their own mistakes. <eob>
And others may argue that we should help them <eol> to make better decisions. <eob>
But the underlying assumption is the same: <eob> there's something wrong with them. <eob>
If we could just change them, <eob> if we could just teach them <eol> how to live their lives, <eob> if they would only listen. <eob>
And to be honest, <eob> this was what I thought for a long time. <eob>
It was only a few years ago that I discovered <eob> that everything I thought I knew <eol> about poverty was wrong. <eob>
It all started when I accidentally <eol> stumbled upon a paper <eob> by a few American psychologists. <eob>
They had traveled 8,000 miles, <eol> all the way to India, <eob> for a fascinating study. <eob>
And it was an experiment <eol> with sugarcane farmers. <eob>
You should know that these farmers <eol> collect about 60 percent <eob> of their annual income all at once, <eob> right after the harvest. <eob>
This means that they're relatively <eol> poor one part of the year <eob> and rich the other. <eob>
The researchers asked them to do an IQ test <eol> before and after the harvest. <eob>
What they subsequently discovered <eol> completely blew my mind. <eob>
The farmers scored much worse <eol> on the test before the harvest. <eob>
The effects of living in poverty, <eol> it turns out, <eob> correspond to losing 14 points of IQ. <eob>
Now, to give you an idea, <eob> that's comparable to losing a night's sleep <eob> or the effects of alcoholism. <eob>
A few months later, I heard <eol> that Eldar Shafir, <eob> a professor at Princeton University <eol> and one of the authors of this study, <eob> was coming over to Holland, <eol> where I live. <eob>
So we met up in Amsterdam <eob> to talk about his revolutionary <eol> new theory of poverty. <eob>
And I can sum it up in just two words: <eob> scarcity mentality. <eob>
It turns out that people behave <eol> differently <eob> when they perceive a thing to be scarce. <eob>
And what that thing <eol> is doesn't much matter -- <eob> whether it's not enough time, <eol> money or food. <eob>
You all know this feeling, <eob> when you've got too much to do, <eob> or when you've put off breaking for lunch <eob> and your blood sugar takes a dive. <eob>
This narrows your focus <eol> to your immediate lack -- <eob> to the sandwich <eol> you've got to have now, <eob> the meeting that's starting in five minutes <eob> or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow. <eob>
So the long-term perspective <eol> goes out the window. <eob>
You could compare it to a new computer <eob> that's running 10 heavy programs at once. <eob>
It gets slower and slower, making errors. <eob>
Eventually, it freezes -- <eob> not because it's a bad computer, <eob> but because it has too much to do at once. <eob>
The poor have the same problem. <eob>
They're not making dumb decisions <eol> because they are dumb, <eob> but because they're living in a context <eob> in which anyone would make dumb decisions. <eob>
So suddenly I understood <eob> why so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work. <eob>
Investments in education, for example, <eol> are often completely ineffective. <eob>
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge. <eob>
A recent analysis of 201 studies <eob> on the effectiveness of money-management training <eob> came to the conclusion that it <eol> has almost no effect at all. <eob>
Now, don't get me wrong -- <eob> this is not to say <eol> the poor don't learn anything -- <eob> they can come out wiser for sure. <eob>
But it's not enough. <eob>
Or as Professor Shafir told me, <eob> "It's like teaching someone to swim <eob> and then throwing them in a stormy sea." <eob>
I still remember sitting there, <eob> perplexed. <eob>
And it struck me <eob> that we could have figured <eol> this all out decades ago. <eob>
I mean, these psychologists <eol> didn't need any complicated brain scans; <eob> they only had to measure <eol> the farmer's IQ, <eob> and IQ tests were invented <eol> more than 100 years ago. <eob>
Actually, I realized I had read about <eol> the psychology of poverty before. <eob>
George Orwell, one of the greatest <eol> writers who ever lived, <eob> experienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s. <eob> "The essence of poverty," <eol> he wrote back then, <eob> is that it "annihilates the future." <eob> And he marveled at, quote, <eob> "How people take it for granted <eol> they have the right to preach at you <eob> and pray over you <eob> as soon as your income <eol> falls below a certain level." <eob>
Now, those words are every bit <eol> as resonant today. <eob>
The big question is, of course: <eob> What can be done? <eob>
Modern economists have a few <eol> solutions up their sleeves. <eob> We could help the poor <eol> with their paperwork <eob> or send them a text message <eol> to remind them to pay their bills. <eob>
This type of solution <eol> is hugely popular with modern politicians, <eob> mostly because, <eob> well, they cost next to nothing. <eob>
These solutions are, I think, <eol> a symbol of this era <eob> in which we so often treat the symptoms, <eob> but ignore the underlying cause. <eob>
So I wonder: <eob> Why don't we just change the context <eol> in which the poor live? <eob>
Or, going back to our computer analogy: <eob> Why keep tinkering around with the software <eob> when we can easily solve the problem <eol> by installing some extra memory instead? <eob>
At that point, Professor Shafir <eol> responded with a blank look. <eob>
And after a few seconds, he said, <eob> "Oh, I get it. <eob>
You mean you want to just hand <eol> out more money to the poor <eob> to eradicate poverty. <eob>
Uh, sure, that'd be great. <eob>
But I'm afraid that brand <eol> of left-wing politics <eob> you've got in Amsterdam -- <eob> it doesn't exist in the States." <eob>
But is this really an old-fashioned, leftist idea? <eob>
I remembered reading about an old plan -- <eob> something that has been proposed <eol> by some of history's leading thinkers. <eob>
The philosopher Thomas More first hinted <eol> at it in his book, "Utopia," <eob> more than 500 years ago. <eob>
And its proponents have spanned <eol> the spectrum from the left to the right, <eob> from the civil rights campaigner, Martin Luther King, <eob> to the economist Milton Friedman. <eob>
And it's an incredibly simple idea: <eob> basic income guarantee. <eob>
What it is? <eob> Well, that's easy. <eob> It's a monthly grant, enough to pay <eol> for your basic needs: <eob> food, shelter, education. <eob>
It's completely unconditional, <eob> so no one's going to tell you <eol> what you have to do for it, <eob> and no one's going to tell you <eol> what you have to do with it. <eob>
The basic income is not a favor, <eol> but a right. <eob>
There's absolutely no stigma attached. <eob>
So as I learned about the true <eol> nature of poverty, <eob> I couldn't stop wondering: <eob> Is this the idea we've all been waiting for? <eob>
Could it really be that simple? <eob>
And in the three years that followed, <eob> I read everything I could find <eol> about basic income. <eob>
I researched the dozens of experiments <eob> that have been conducted <eol> all over the globe, <eob> and it didn't take long before I stumbled <eol> upon a story of a town <eob> that had done it -- had actually <eol> eradicated poverty. <eob>
But then ... <eob> nearly everyone forgot about it. <eob>
This story starts in Dauphin, Canada. <eob>
In 1974, everybody in this small town <eol> was guaranteed a basic income, <eob> ensuring that no one fell below <eol> the poverty line. <eob>
At the start of the experiment, <eob> an army of researchers <eol> descended on the town. <eob>
For four years, all went well. <eob>
But then a new government <eol> was voted into power, <eob> and the new Canadian cabinet saw <eol> little point to the expensive experiment. <eob>
So when it became clear there was no money <eol> left to analyze the results, <eob> the researchers decided to pack their files away <eol> in some 2,000 boxes. <eob>
Twenty-five years went by, <eob> and then Evelyn Forget, <eol> a Canadian professor, <eob> found the records. <eob>
For three years, she subjected the data <eol> to all manner of statistical analysis, <eob> and no matter what she tried, <eob> the results were the same every time: <eob> the experiment <eol> had been a resounding success. <eob>
Evelyn Forget discovered <eob> that the people in Dauphin <eol> had not only become richer <eob> but also smarter and healthier. <eob>
The school performance of kids <eol> improved substantially. <eob>
The hospitalization rate decreased <eol> by as much as 8.5 percent. <eob>
Domestic violence incidents were down, <eob> as were mental health complaints. <eob>
And people didn't quit their jobs. <eob>
The only ones who worked a little less <eol> were new mothers and students -- <eob> who stayed in school longer. <eob>
Similar results have since been found <eob> in countless other experiments <eol> around the globe, <eob> from the US to India. <eob>
So... <eob> here's what I've learned. <eob>
When it comes to poverty, <eob> we, the rich, should stop <eol> pretending we know best. <eob> We should stop sending shoes and teddy bears <eol> to the poor, <eob> to people we have never met. <eob> And we should get rid of the vast industry <eol> of paternalistic bureaucrats <eob> when we could simply hand over <eol> their salaries <eob> to the poor they're supposed to help. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Because, I mean, the great thing about money <eob> is that people can use it <eol> to buy things they need <eob> instead of things that self-appointed <eol> experts think they need. <eob>
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists <eol> and entrepreneurs and writers, <eob> like George Orwell, <eob> are now withering away in scarcity. <eob>
Imagine how much energy and talent <eol> we would unleash <eob> if we got rid of poverty <eol> once and for all. <eob>
I believe that a basic income <eol> would work like venture capital for the people. <eob>
And we can't afford not to do it, <eob> because poverty is hugely expensive. <eob>
Just look at the cost of child poverty <eol> in the US, for example. <eob>
It's estimated at 500 billion dollars each year, <eob> in terms of higher health care spending, <eol> higher dropout rates, <eob> and more crime. <eob>
Now, this is an incredible <eol> waste of human potential. <eob>
But let's talk about <eol> the elephant in the room. <eob>
How could we ever afford a <eob> basic income guarantee? <eob>
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper <eol> than you may think. <eob>
What they did in Dauphin <eol> is finance it with a negative income tax. <eob>
This means that your income <eol> is topped up <eob> as soon as you fall below <eol> the poverty line. <eob>
And in that scenario, <eob> according to our economists' best estimates, <eob> for a net cost of 175 billion -- <eob> a quarter of US military spending, <eol> one percent of GDP -- <eob> you could lift all impoverished Americans <eol> above the poverty line. <eob>
You could actually eradicate poverty. <eob>
Now, that should be our goal. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The time for small thoughts <eol> and little nudges is past. <eob>
I really believe that the time <eol> has come for radical new ideas, <eob> and basic income is so much more <eol> than just another policy. <eob>
It is also a complete rethink <eol> of what work actually is. <eob>
And in that sense, <eob> it will not only free the poor, <eob> but also the rest of us. <eob>
Nowadays, millions of people feel <eob> that their jobs have little <eol> meaning or significance. <eob>
A recent poll among 230,000 employees <eob> in 142 countries <eob> found that only 13 percent <eol> of workers actually like their job. <eob>
And another poll found that as much <eol> as 37 percent of British workers <eob> have a job that they think <eol> doesn't even need to exist. <eob>
It's like Brad Pitt says <eol> in "Fight Club," <eob> "Too often we're working jobs <eol> we hate so we can buy shit we don't need." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, don't get me wrong -- <eob> I'm not talking about <eol> the teachers and the garbagemen <eob> and the care workers here. <eob>
If they stopped working, <eob> we'd be in trouble. <eob>
I'm talking about all those well-paid professionals <eol> with excellent résumés <eob> who earn their money doing ... <eob> strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings <eob> while brainstorming the value add-on <eol> of disruptive co-creation <eob> in the network society. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or something like that. <eob> Just imagine again how much talent <eol> we're wasting, <eob> simply because we tell our kids <eol> they'll have to "earn a living." <eob> Or think of what a math whiz working <eol> at Facebook lamented a few years ago: <eob> "The best minds of my generation <eob> are thinking about how <eol> to make people click ads." <eob>
I'm a historian. <eob> And if history teaches us anything, <eob> it is that things could be different. <eob>
There is nothing inevitable <eob> about the way we structured our society <eol> and economy right now. <eob>
Ideas can and do change the world. <eob>
And I think that especially in the past few years, <eob> it has become abundantly clear <eob> that we cannot stick to the status quo -- <eob> that we need new ideas. <eob>
I know that many of you may feel <eol> pessimistic <eob> about a future of rising inequality, <eob> xenophobia <eob> and climate change. <eob>
But it's not enough <eob> to know what we're against. <eob>
We also need to be for something. <eob>
Martin Luther King <eol> didn't say, "I have a nightmare." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He had a dream. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So... <eob> here's my dream: <eob> I believe in a future <eob> where the value of your work <eol> is not determined <eob> by the size of your paycheck, <eob> but by the amount of happiness you spread <eob> and the amount of meaning <eol> you give. <eob>
I believe in a future <eob> where the point of education <eol> is not to prepare you for another useless job <eob> but for a life well-lived. <eob>
I believe in a future <eob> where an existence <eol> without poverty is not a privilege <eob> but a right we all deserve. <eob> So here we are. <eob> Here we are. <eob> We've got the research, we've got the evidence <eob> and we've got the means. <eob>
Now, more than 500 years <eol> after Thomas More first wrote about a basic income, <eob> and 100 years after George Orwell discovered <eol> the true nature of poverty, <eob> we all need to change our worldview, <eob> because poverty is not a lack of character. <eob>
Poverty is a lack of cash. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I have a confession. <eob> I have been in an affair <eob> since I was 17 years old. <eob>
I wish I could talk <eol> about butterflies in my stomach <eob> or maps I drew on the ground <eob> when I think about this affair, <eob> but I cannot. <eob>
but I cannot. <eob> I wish I could talk <eol> about sweet words spoken <eob> or gifts that I received <eob> from this affair, <eob>
All I can tell you about is the aftermath, <eob> about days I spent constantly asking: <eob> Why, why, why me? <eob>
I remember how it all began. <eob>
I was in my final year of high school, <eob> and my class had just <eol> won in sports, <eob> so we were singing and dancing <eol> and hugging each other. <eob>
I went and took a shower. <eob>
Then I went for dinner. <eob>
And when I sat down to eat, <eob> my teeth started chattering, <eob> and so I couldn't put <eol> the spoon in my mouth. <eob>
I rushed to the nurse's office, <eob> and because I couldn't talk, <eol> I just pointed at my mouth. <eob>
She didn't know what was happening, <eob> so she told me to lie down, <eob> and it worked -- <eob> after a few minutes, <eol> the chattering stopped. <eob>
I was about to dash out, <eol> and she told me -- <eob> no, she insisted -- that I go up <eol> to the dormitories to sleep. <eob>
Here <eob> I was in my final year <eol> of high school, <eob> just a few months from doing <eol> my end of high school exams <eob> and a few days from doing a set <eol> of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks," <eob> which are somehow meant to gauge <eol> how prepared one is for the final exams. <eob>
There is no way I was going to sleep <eob> and let a set of exams mock me. <eob>
I went to class, sat down, <eob> took my Kenyan history notes, <eob> and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town, <eob> with the great Mekatilili wa Menza, <eob> the Giriama woman <eol> who led her people against British colonial rule. <eob>
Then, without any notice, <eob> my left hand started jerking, <eob> and it was as if I was marking imaginary papers. <eob>
In and out it went, <eob> and with every stroke, one by one, <eob> my classmates stopped concentrating <eol> on their reading <eob> and started looking at me. <eob>
And I tried really hard to stop it, <eob> but I couldn't, <eob> because it had a life of its own. <eob>
And then, when it was sure <eol> everybody was looking at us, <eob> in its final show <eol> and official introduction, <eob> I had my first full-blown seizure, <eob> which was the beginning of what has been <eol> a 15-year-long affair. <eob>
Seizures are the trademark characteristic <eol> for most types of epilepsy, <eob> and every first-ever seizure needs <eol> to be assessed by a doctor <eob> to determine if one <eol> has epilepsy <eob> or if it's a symptom of something else. <eob>
In my case, it was confirmed <eol> that I had epilepsy. <eob>
I spent a large chunk <eol> of my time in hospital and at home, <eob> and only went back to do <eol> my final exams. <eob>
I had seizures in between papers, <eob> but managed to get <eol> good enough grades <eob> to be admitted <eol> for an actuarial science degree <eob> at the University of Nairobi. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Unfortunately, I had to drop out <eol> in my second year. <eob>
I didn't have good enough coping skills <eob> and a support community around me. <eob>
I was lucky enough to get a job, <eob> but I was fired from that job <eol> when I had a seizure in the workplace. <eob>
So I found myself in a space <eob> where I was constantly asking myself <eob> why this had to happen to me. <eob>
I lived in denial for a long time, <eob> and the denial was maybe <eol> because of the things that had happened, <eob> dropping out of school <eol> and being fired from my job. <eob>
Or maybe it was because of the things <eol> I had heard about epilepsy <eob> and about people living with epilepsy: <eob> that they would never live on their own; <eob> that they would never travel <eol> on their own <eob> or even get work; <eob> that they were outcasts, <eob> with a spirit in them <eol> that they needed to be delivered from. <eob>
And so the more I thought about these things, <eob> the more my seizures became, <eob> and I spent days with my legs locked, <eob> my speech became blurred <eob> and on days on end, <eol> this is how I'd be. <eob>
Two or three days after a seizure, <eob> my head and my hand would still <eol> be twitching. <eob>
I felt lost, <eob> like I'd lost everything, <eob> and sometimes, <eob> even the will to live. <eob>
I had so much frustration in me. <eob> And so I started writing, <eob> because the people around me <eol> didn't have answers <eob> to the questions that I had. <eob>
And so I wrote my fears <eob> and my doubts. <eob>
I wrote about my good days <eol> and my bad days and my really ugly days, <eob> and I shared them on a blog. <eob>
And before long, <eob> I began to be seen and heard <eol> by people who had epilepsy <eob> and their families, <eob> and even those who did not <eol> have the diagnosis. <eob>
And I moved from that girl <eol> who constantly asked why me <eob> to one who not only self-advocates, <eob> but does it for those who are yet <eol> to find their voices. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My seizures are greatly reduced, <eol> from two to three times a day, <eob> to sometimes two to three times in one year. <eob>
I went on -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I went on to employ five people, <eob> when I began what was Kenya's first <eob> free mental health and epilepsy support line. <eob>
And I travel -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I travel to speak about my affair, <eob> all these things <eol> that I had been told <eob> people like me living with epilepsy <eol> could never be able to do. <eob>
Every year, a population as big <eol> as 80 percent of Nairobi <eob> gets diagnosed with epilepsy <eob> across the globe. <eob>
And they, like me, <eob> go through the emotions <eol> of stigma and exclusion. <eob>
And so I have made it my life journey <eob> to keep these conversations <eol> going, <eob> and I keep confessing about my affair <eob> so that those people who do not <eol> have the diagnosis <eob> might know and might have a constant reminder <eob> that it is alright to engage with people like us, <eob> that as long as they pull down <eol> the walls of stigma and exclusion, <eob> that we, just like them, <eob> can be able to take <eol> anything life throws at us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This story begins in 1985, <eob> when at age 22, <eob> I became the World Chess Champion <eob> after beating Anatoly Karpov. <eob>
Earlier that year, <eob> I played what is called <eol> simultaneous exhibition <eob> against 32 of the world's <eol> best chess-playing machines <eob> in Hamburg, Germany. <eob>
I won all the games, <eob> and then it was not considered <eol> much of a surprise <eob> that I could beat 32 computers <eol> at the same time. <eob>
To me, that was the golden age. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Machines were weak, <eob> and my hair was strong. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just 12 years later, <eob> I was fighting for my life <eol> against just one computer <eob> in a match <eob> called by the cover of "Newsweek" <eob> "The Brain's Last Stand." <eob> No pressure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
From mythology to science fiction, <eob> human versus machine <eob> has been often portrayed <eol> as a matter of life and death. <eob>
John Henry, <eob> called the steel-driving man <eob> in the 19th century <eol> African American folk legend, <eob> was pitted in a race <eob> against a steam-powered hammer <eob> bashing a tunnel through mountain rock. <eob>
John Henry's legend <eol> is a part of a long historical narrative <eob> pitting humanity versus technology. <eob>
And this competitive rhetoric <eol> is standard now. <eob>
We are in a race against the machines, <eob> in a fight or even in a war. <eob> Jobs are being killed off. <eob> People are being replaced <eol> as if they had vanished from the Earth. <eob>
It's enough to think that the movies <eol> like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix" <eob> are nonfiction. <eob>
There are very few instances of an arena <eob> where the human body and mind <eol> can compete on equal terms <eob> with a computer or a robot. <eob>
Actually, I wish there were a few more. <eob>
Instead, <eob> it was my blessing and my curse <eob> to literally become the proverbial man <eob> in the man versus machine competition <eob> that everybody is still talking about. <eob>
In the most famous human-machine <eol> competition since <eob> John Henry, <eob> I played two matches <eob> against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue. <eob>
Nobody remembers <eol> that I won the first match -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch <eol> the following year in New York. <eob>
But I guess that's fair. <eob>
There is no day in history, <eol> special calendar entry <eob> for all the people <eol> who failed to climb Mt. Everest <eob> before Sir Edmund Hillary <eol> and Tenzing Norgay <eob> made it to the top. <eob>
And in 1997, I was still <eol> the world champion <eob> when chess computers finally came of age. <eob> I was Mt. Everest, <eob> and Deep Blue reached the summit. <eob>
I should say of course, <eol> not that Deep Blue did it, <eob> but its human creators -- <eob> Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu. <eob>
Hats off to them. <eob>
As always, machine's triumph <eol> was a human triumph, <eob> something we tend to forget when humans <eol> are surpassed by our own creations. <eob>
Deep Blue was victorious, <eob> but was it intelligent? <eob>
No, no it wasn't, <eob> at least not in the way Alan Turing <eol> and other founders of computer science <eob> had hoped. <eob>
It turned out that chess <eol> could be crunched by brute force, <eob> once hardware got fast enough <eob> and algorithms got smart enough. <eob>
Although by the definition of the output, <eob> grandmaster-level chess, <eob> Deep Blue was intelligent. <eob>
But even at the incredible speed, <eob> 200 million positions per second, <eob> Deep Blue's method <eob> provided little of the dreamed-of insight <eol> into the mysteries of human intelligence. <eob>
Soon, <eob> machines will be taxi drivers <eob> and doctors and professors, <eob> but will they be "intelligent?" <eob> I would rather leave these definitions <eob> to the philosophers and to the dictionary. <eob>
What really matters is how we humans <eob> feel about living and working <eol> with these machines. <eob>
When I first met Deep Blue <eol> in 1996 in February, <eob> I had been the world champion <eol> for more than 10 years, <eob> and I had played 182 <eol> world championship games <eob> and hundreds of games against <eol> other top players in other competitions. <eob>
I knew what to expect from my opponents <eob> and what to expect from myself. <eob>
I was used to measure their moves <eob> and to gauge their emotional state <eob> by watching their body language <eol> and looking into their eyes. <eob>
And then I sat across <eol> the chessboard from Deep Blue. <eob>
I immediately sensed something new, <eob> something unsettling. <eob>
You might experience a similar feeling <eob> the first time you ride <eol> in a driverless car <eob> or the first time your new computer <eol> manager issues an order at work. <eob>
But when I sat at that first game, <eob> I couldn't be sure <eob> what is this thing capable of. <eob>
Technology can advance in leaps, <eol> and IBM had invested heavily. <eob>
I lost that game. <eob>
And I couldn't help wondering, <eob> might it be invincible? <eob> Was my beloved game of chess over? <eob>
These were human doubts, human fears, <eob> and the only thing I knew for sure <eob> was that my opponent Deep Blue <eol> had no such worries at all. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I fought back <eob> after this devastating blow <eob> to win the first match, <eob> but the writing was on the wall. <eob>
I eventually lost to the machine <eob> but I didn't suffer <eol> the fate of <eob> John Henry <eob> who won but died with his hammer in his hand. <eob> [John Henry Died with a Hammer in His <eob> Hand Palmer C. Hayden] [The Museum <eol> of African American Art, Los Angeles] <eob> It turned out that the world of chess <eob> still wanted to have a human chess champion. <eob>
And even today, <eob> when a free chess app <eol> on the latest mobile phone <eob> is stronger than Deep Blue, <eob> people are still playing chess, <eob> even more than ever before. <eob>
Doomsayers predicted <eol> that nobody would touch the game <eob> that could be conquered by the machine, <eob> and they were wrong, proven wrong, <eob> but doomsaying has always been <eol> a popular pastime <eob> when it comes to technology. <eob>
What I learned from my own experience <eob> is that we must face our fears <eob> if we want to get the most <eol> out of our technology, <eob> and we must conquer those fears <eob> if we want to get the best <eol> out of our humanity. <eob>
While licking my wounds, <eob> I got a lot of inspiration <eob> from my battles against Deep Blue. <eob>
As the old Russian saying goes, <eol> if you can't beat them, join them. <eob>
Then I thought, <eob> what if I could play with a computer — <eob> together with a computer at my side, <eol> combining our strengths, <eob> human intuition plus <eol> machine's calculation, <eob> human strategy, machine tactics, <eob> human experience, machine's memory. <eob>
Could it be the perfect game ever played? <eob>
My idea came to life <eob> in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess <eob> when I played this human-plus-machine <eol> competition against another elite player. <eob>
But in this first experiment, <eob> we both failed to combine <eol> human and machine skills effectively. <eob>
Advanced Chess found <eol> its home on the internet, <eob> and in 2005, a so-called <eol> freestyle chess tournament <eob> produced a revelation. <eob>
A team of grandmasters <eol> and top machines participated, <eob> but the winners were not grandmasters, <eob> not a supercomputer. <eob>
The winners were a pair <eol> of amateur American chess players <eob> operating three ordinary PCs <eol> at the same time. <eob>
Their skill of coaching their machines <eob> effectively counteracted <eol> the superior chess knowledge <eob> of their grandmaster opponents <eob> and much greater <eol> computational power of others. <eob>
And I reached this formulation. <eob> A weak human player plus a machine <eob> plus a better process is superior <eob> to a very powerful machine alone, <eob> but more remarkably, <eol> is superior to a strong human player <eob> plus machine <eob> and an inferior process. <eob>
This convinced me that we would need <eob> better interfaces <eol> to help us coach our machines <eob> towards more useful intelligence. <eob>
Human <eob> plus machine <eob> isn't the future, <eob> it's the present. <eob>
Everybody that's used online translation <eob> to get the gist of a news article <eol> from a foreign newspaper, <eob> knowing its far from perfect. <eob>
Then we use our human experience <eob> to make sense out of that, <eob> and then the machine <eol> learns from our corrections. <eob>
This model is spreading and investing <eol> in medical diagnosis, security analysis. <eob>
The machine crunches data, <eob> calculates probabilities, <eob> gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent, <eob> making it easier for analysis <eob> and decision-making of the human party. <eob>
But you are not going to send your kids <eob> to school in a self-driving car <eol> with 90 percent accuracy, <eob> even with 99 percent. <eob>
So we need a leap forward <eob> to add a few more crucial decimal places. <eob>
Twenty years after my match <eol> with Deep Blue, <eob> second match, <eob> this sensational <eob> "The Brain's Last Stand" <eob> headline <eob> has become commonplace <eob> as intelligent machines <eob> move <eob> in every sector, <eol> seemingly every day. <eob>
But unlike in the past, <eob> when machines replaced <eob> farm animals, manual labor, <eob> now they are coming <eol> after people with college degrees <eob> and political influence. <eob>
And as someone <eol> who fought machines and lost, <eob> I am here to tell you <eol> this is excellent, excellent news. <eob>
Eventually, every profession <eob> will have to feel these pressures <eob> or else it will mean humanity <eol> has ceased to make progress. <eob>
We don't <eob> get to choose <eob> when and where <eol> technological progress stops. <eob>
We cannot <eob> slow down. <eob>
In fact, <eob> we have to speed up. <eob>
Our technology excels at removing <eob> difficulties and uncertainties from our lives, <eob> and so we must seek out <eob> ever more difficult, <eob> ever more uncertain challenges. <eob> Machines have <eob> calculations. <eob> We have understanding. <eob> Machines have instructions. <eob> We have purpose. <eob> Machines have <eob> objectivity. <eob> We have passion. <eob> We should not worry about <eol> what our machines can do today. <eob>
Instead, <eob> we should worry <eol> about what they still cannot do today, <eob> because we will need the help <eol> of the new, intelligent machines <eob> to turn our grandest dreams into reality. <eob>
And if we fail, <eob> if we fail, it's not because our machines <eol> are too intelligent, <eob> or not intelligent enough. <eob>
If we fail, it's because <eol> we grew complacent <eob> and limited our ambitions. <eob>
Our humanity is not defined by any skill, <eob> like swinging a hammer <eol> or even playing chess. <eob>
There's one thing only a human can do. <eob> That's dream. <eob> So let us dream big. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa, <eob> daughter of Annette, <eob> daughter of Olympia, <eob> daughter of Melvina, <eob> daughter of Katie, born 1878, <eob> Parish County, Louisiana. <eob>
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan, <eob> daughter of Carol, daughter of Letha, <eol> daughter of Willie, <eob> daughter of Sarah, born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky. <eob>
VG: And in the tradition of our families, <eob> the great oral tradition of almost <eol> every black church we know <eob> honoring the culture from which we draw <eol> so much power, <eob> we're gonna start the way our mommas <eol> and grandmas would want us to start. <eob>
TMD: In prayer. Let the words <eol> of my mouth, <eob> the meditation of our hearts, <eol> be acceptable in thy sight, <eob> oh Lord, my strength <eol> and my redeemer. <eob>
VG: We call the names and rituals <eol> of our ancestors into this room today <eob> because from them we received <eol> a powerful blueprint for survival, <eob> strategies and tactics for healing carried <eol> across oceans by African women, <eob> passed down to generations of black women in America <eob> who used those skills <eol> to navigate institutions of slavery <eob> and state-sponsored discrimination <eob> in order that we might stand on this stage. <eob>
We walk in the footsteps of those women, <eob> our foremothers, legends <eob> like Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer, <eob> from whom we learned the power of organizing <eob> after she would had single-handedly registered <eob> 60,000 voters <eol> in Jim Crow Mississippi. <eob>
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people, so if you can imagine <eob> me and Vanessa inspiring 60,000 women to walk with us last year, <eob> we were fired up. <eob>
But today, 100,000 black women and girls <eol> stand on this stage with us. <eob>
We are committed to healing ourselves, <eob> to lacing up our sneakers, <eol> to walking out of our front door <eob> every single day for total healing <eol> and transformation in our communities, <eob> because we understand <eob> that we are in the footsteps <eol> of a civil rights legacy <eob> like no other time before, <eob> and that we are facing a health crisis <eol> like never ever before. <eob>
And so we've had a lot of moments, <eol> great moments, <eob> including the time we had on our pajamas, <eol> we were working on our computer <eob> and Michelle Obama emailed us and invited us <eol> to the White House, <eob> and we thought it was spam. <eob>
But this moment here is an opportunity. <eob>
It is an opportunity <eol> that we don't take for granted, <eob> and so we thought long and hard <eol> about how we would use it. <eob>
Would we talk to the women <eol> we hope to inspire, <eob> a million in the next year, <eob> or would we talk to you? <eob>
We decided to talk to you, <eob> and to talk to you about a question <eol> that we get all the time, <eob> so that the millions of women <eol> who hopefully will watch this <eob> will never have to answer it again. <eob>
It is: Why are black women dying <eob> faster and at higher rates <eob> than any other group of people <eol> in America <eob> from preventable, obesity-related diseases? <eob>
The question hurts me. <eob> I'm shaking a little bit. <eob> It feels value-laden. <eob> It hurts my body because the weight <eol> represents so much. <eob>
But we're going to talk about it <eob> and invite you into an inside conversation today <eob> because it is necessary, and because we need you. <eob>
VG: Each night, before <eol> the first day of school, <eob> my grandmother would sit me next to the stove <eob> and with expert precision use a hot comb <eol> to press my hair. <eob>
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud. <eob>
She filled up a room <eol> with laughter and oftentimes curse words. <eob>
She cooked a mean peach cobbler, <eob> had 11 children, a house <eol> full of grandchildren, <eob> and like every black woman I know, <eob> like most all women I know, <eob> she had prioritized the care of others <eol> over caring for herself. <eob>
We measured her strength by her capacity <eol> to endure pain and suffering. <eob>
We celebrated her for it, and our choice <eol> would prove to be deadly. <eob>
One night after pressing my hair <eol> before the first day of eighth grade, <eob> my grandmother went to bed <eol> and never woke up, <eob> dead at 66 years old <eol> from a heart attack. <eob>
By the time I would graduate college, <eob> I would lose two more beloved <eol> family members to chronic disease: <eob> my aunt Diane, dead at 55, my aunt Tricia, dead at 63. <eob>
After living with these losses, <eol> the hole that they left, <eob> I decided to calculate <eol> the life expectancy of the women in my family. <eob>
Staring back at me, the number 65. <eob>
I knew I could not sit by <eob> and watch another woman <eol> I loved die an early death. <eob>
TMD: So we don't usually put our business <eol> in the streets. <eob>
Let's just put that out there. <eob>
But I have to tell you the statistics. <eob>
Black women are dying <eol> at alarming rates, <eob> and I used to be a classroom teacher, <eob> and I was at South Atlanta High School, <eob> and I remember standing in front of my classroom, <eob> and I remember a statistic <eol> that half of black girls will get diabetes <eob> unless diet and levels of activity change. <eob>
Half of the girls in my classroom. <eob>
So I couldn't teach anymore. <eob>
So I started taking girls hiking, <eol> which is why we're called GirlTrek, <eob> but Vanessa was like, <eob> that is not going to move <eol> the dial on the health crisis; it's cute. <eob>
She was like, it's a cute hiking club. <eob>
So what we thought <eob> is if we could rally a million <eol> of their mothers ... <eob> 82 percent of black women <eol> are over a healthy weight right now. <eob>
53 percent of us are obese. <eob>
But the number that I cannot, <eob> that I cannot get out of my head <eob> is that every single day in America, <eob> 137 black women <eob> die from a preventable disease, <eob> heart disease. <eob>
That's every 11 minutes. <eob>
137 is more than gun violence, <eob> cigarette smoking and HIV combined, <eob> every day. <eob>
It is roughly the amount of people <eob> that were on my plane <eol> from New Jersey to Vancouver. <eob> Can you imagine that? <eob> A plane filled with black women <eol> crashing to the ground every day, <eob> and no one is talking about it. <eob>
VG: So the question that you're all asking yourselves <eol> right now is why? <eob> Why are black women dying? <eob>
We asked ourselves that same question. <eob>
Why is what's out <eol> there not working for them? <eob>
Private weight loss companies, <eol> government interventions, <eob> public health campaigns. <eob>
I'm going to tell you why: <eob> because they focus on weight loss <eob> or looking good in skinny jeans <eob> without acknowledging the trauma <eob> that black women hold in our bellies and bones, <eob> that has been embedded <eol> in our very DNA. <eob>
The best advice from hospitals and doctors, <eob> the best medications <eol> from pharmaceutical companies <eob> to treat the congestive heart failure <eol> of my grandmother didn't work <eob> because they didn't acknowledge <eol> the systemic racism <eob> that she had dealt with since birth. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A divestment in schools, <eol> discriminatory housing practices, <eob> predatory lending, <eol> a crack cocaine epidemic, <eob> mass incarceration putting <eol> more black bodies behind bars <eob> than were owned at the height <eol> of slavery. <eob>
But GirlTrek does. <eob> For black women whose bodies <eol> are buckling under the weight <eob> of systems never designed to support them, <eob> GirlTrek is a lifeline. <eob>
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball, <eol> a member of GirlTrek in Detroit, <eob> received the news that too many <eol> black mothers have received. <eob>
Her son Norman, 23 years old, <eol> a father of two, <eob> was gunned down while on an afternoon drive. <eob>
Imagine the grief <eob> that overcomes your body in that moment, <eob> the immobilizing fear. <eob>
Now, know this, that just days <eol> after laying her son to rest, <eob> Danita Kimball posted online, <eob> "I don't know what to do <eol> or how to move forward, <eob> but my sisters keep telling me <eol> I need to walk, so I will." <eob> And then just days after that, <eob> "I got my steps in today <eol> for my baby Norm. <eob>
It felt good to be out there, to walk." <eob>
TMD: Walking through pain is what <eol> we have always done. <eob>
My mom, she's in the middle right there, <eob> my mom desegregated her <eol> high school in 1955. <eob>
Her mom walked down the steps <eol> of an abandoned school bus <eob> where she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper. <eob>
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory <eob> fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South. <eob>
And her mom walked her <eol> man to the door <eob> as he went off to fight in the Kentucky <eol> Colored Regiment, <eob> the Civil War. <eob>
They were born slaves <eol> but they wouldn't die slaves. <eob>
Change-making, it's in my blood. <eob>
It's what I do, <eob> and this health crisis ain't nothing <eol> compared to the road we have traveled. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So it's like James Cleveland. <eob>
I don't feel no ways tired, <eol> so we got to work. <eob>
We started looking at models of change. <eob> We looked all over the world. <eob>
We needed something <eob> not only that was a part of our cultural <eol> inheritance like walking, <eob> but something that was scalable, <eol> something that was high-impact, <eob> something that we could replicate <eol> across this country. <eob>
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai, <eol> who won the Nobel Peace Prize <eob> for inspiring women to plant <eol> 50 million trees in Kenya. <eob> She brought Kenya back from the brink <eol> of environmental devastation. <eob>
We studied these systems of change, <eol> and we looked at walking scientifically. <eob>
And what we learned is that <eol> walking just 30 minutes a day <eob> can single-handedly decrease <eol> 50 percent of your risk of diabetes, <eob> heart disease, <eob> stroke, even Alzheimer's <eol> and dementia. <eob>
We know that walking <eol> is the single most powerful thing <eob> that a woman can do <eol> for her health, <eob> so we knew we were on to something, <eob> because from Harriet Tubman <eol> to the women in Montgomery, <eob> when black women walk, things change. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> VG: So how did we take <eol> this simple idea of walking <eob> and start a revolution <eol> that would catch a fire <eob> in neighborhoods across America? <eob>
We used the best practices <eol> of the Civil Rights Movement. <eob>
We huddled up in church basements. <eob>
We did grapevine information <eol> sharing through beauty salons. <eob>
We empowered and trained mothers <eol> to stand on the front lines. <eob>
We took our message <eol> directly to the streets, <eob> and women responded. <eob>
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga, <eob> Chrysantha in Detroit, <eob> Onika in New Orleans, <eob> women with difficult names <eol> and difficult stories <eob> join GirlTrek every day <eol> and commit to walking as a practice of self-care. <eob>
Once walking, those women <eol> get to organizing, <eob> first their families, then their communities, <eob> to walk and talk <eol> and solve problems together. <eob>
They walk and notice the abandoned building. <eob> They walk and notice <eol> the lack of sidewalks, <eob> the lack of green space, <eob> and they say, "No more." <eob> Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia, <eob> who after walking daily past <eol> an abandoned building in her neighborhood, <eob> decided, "I'm not waiting. <eob>
Let me rally my team. Let me <eol> grab some supplies. <eob> Let me do what no one else has done <eol> for me and my community." <eob>
TMD: We know one woman <eol> can make a difference, <eob> because one woman has already changed the world, <eob> and her name is Harriet Tubman. <eob>
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman. <eob>
I'm obsessed with her, <eol> and I used to be a history teacher. <eob>
I will not tell you the whole history. <eob>
I will tell you four things. <eob>
So I used to have an old Saab -- <eob> the kind of canvas top that drips <eol> on your head when it rains -- <eob> and I drove all the way down <eol> to the eastern shore of Maryland, <eob> and when I stepped on the dirt <eob> that Harriet Tubman made her first escape, <eob> I knew she was a woman just like we are <eob> and that we could do what she had done, <eob> and we learned four things from Harriet Tubman. <eob>
The first one: do not wait. <eob>
Walk right now in the direction <eol> of your healthiest, most fulfilled life, <eob> because self-care is a revolutionary act. <eob>
Number two: <eob> when you learn the way forward, <eol> come back and get a sister. <eob>
So in our case, start <eol> a team with your friends -- <eob> your friends, your family, <eol> your church. <eob>
Number three: <eob> rally your allies. <eob>
Every single person in this room <eob> is complicit in a Tubman-inspired takeover. <eob>
And number four: <eob> find joy. <eob>
The most underreported fact <eol> of Harriet Tubman <eob> is that she lived to be 93 years old, <eob> and she didn't live just an ordinary life; uh-uh. <eob>
She was standing up for the good guys. <eob>
She married a younger man. <eob>
She adopted a child. <eob>
I'm not kidding. She lived. <eob> And I drove up to her house <eol> of freedom in upstate New York, <eob> and she had planted apple trees, <eob> and when I was there on a Sunday, <eol> they were blooming. <eob>
Do you call it -- do they bloom? <eob>
The apples were in season, <eob> and I was thinking, she left fruit for us, <eob> the legacy of Harriet Tubman, <eol> every single year. <eob>
And we know that we are Harriet, <eob> and we know that there is a Harriet <eol> in every community in America. <eob>
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet in every community <eol> across the globe, <eob> and that they could learn <eol> from our Tubman Doctrine, <eob> as we call it, the four steps. <eob>
Imagine the possibilities <eob> beyond the neighborhoods <eol> of Oakland and Newark, <eob> to the women working rice fields <eol> in Vietnam, <eob> tea fields <eol> in Sri Lanka, <eob> the women on the mountainsides in Guatemala, <eob> the indigenous reservations throughout the vast plains <eol> of the Dakotas. <eob>
We believe that women walking <eob> and talking together to solve <eol> their problems <eob> is a global solution. <eob>
TMD: And I'll leave you with this, <eob> because we also believe it can become <eol> the center of social justice again. <eob>
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale. <eob>
We had an organizer training, <eob> and I was leaving and I got on the airplane, <eob> and I saw someone I knew, so I waved, <eob> and as I'm waiting in that long line <eol> that you guys know, <eob> waiting for people to put <eol> their stuff away, <eob> I looked back and I realized I didn't know the woman <eol> but I recognized her. <eob>
And so I blew her a kiss <eol> because it was Sybrina Fulton, <eob> Trayvon Martin's mom, <eob> and she whispered "thank you" <eol> back to me. <eob>
And I can't help <eol> but wonder what would happen <eob> if there were groups of women walking <eol> on Trayvon's block that day, <eob> or what would happen in the South <eol> Side of Chicago every day <eob> if there were groups <eol> of women and mothers and aunts and cousins <eob> walking, <eob> or along the polluted rivers of Flint, Michigan. <eob>
I believe that walking <eol> can transform our communities, <eob> because it's already starting to. <eob>
VG: We believe that the personal <eol> is political. <eob>
Our walking is for healing, <eol> for joy, for fresh air, <eob> quiet time, to connect <eol> and disconnect, to worship. <eob>
But it's also walking <eol> so we can be healthy enough <eob> to stand on the front lines <eol> for change in our communities, <eob> and it is our call to action <eol> to every black woman listening, <eob> every black woman in earshot <eol> of our voice, <eob> every black woman who you know. <eob>
Think about it: the woman working front <eol> desk reception at your job, <eob> the woman who delivers your mail, your neighbor -- <eob> our call to action to them, <eol> to join us on the front lines <eob> for change in your community. <eob>
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment <eob> and why it's so important for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I. <eob> It's because it's not always easy for us, <eob> and in fact, we have both seen really, really dark days, <eob> from the hate speech <eol> to the summer of police brutality and violence <eob> that we saw last year, <eob> to even losing one of our walkers, <eob> Sandy Bland, who died in police custody. <eob>
But the most courageous thing we do <eol> every day is we practice faith <eob> that goes beyond the facts, <eob> and we put feet to our prayers <eol> every single day, <eob> and when we get overwhelmed, <eob> we think of the words of people <eol> like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate, <eob> who says, "Morgan, where is your fire? <eob>
Where is the fire that burned <eol> holes through slave ships <eob> to make us breathe? <eob>
Where is the fire <eol> that turned guts into chitlins, <eob> that took rhythms <eol> and make jazz, <eob> that took sit-ins and marches <eol> and made us jump boundaries and barriers? <eob>
You've got to find it and pass it on." <eob>
So this is us finding our fire <eol> and passing it on to you. <eob>
So please, stand with us, <eob> walk with us as we rally a million women <eob> to reclaim the streets <eol> of the 50 highest need communities <eob> in this country. <eob>
We thank you so much for this opportunity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to share with you <eol> something my father taught me: <eob> no condition is permanent. <eob>
It's a lesson he shared with me <eol> again and again, <eob> and I learned it to be true the hard way. <eob>
Here I am in my fourth-grade class. <eob>
This is my yearbook picture <eol> taken in my class in school <eob> in Monrovia, Liberia. <eob>
My parents migrated from India <eol> to West Africa in the 1970s, <eob> and I had the privilege <eol> of growing up there. <eob>
I was nine years old, <eob> I loved kicking around a soccer ball, <eob> and I was a total math and science geek. <eob>
I was living the kind of life <eol> that, really, any child would dream of. <eob>
But <eob> no condition is permanent. <eob>
On Christmas Eve in 1989, <eob> civil war erupted in Liberia. <eob>
The war started in the rural countryside, <eob> and within months, rebel armies <eol> had marched towards our hometown. <eob>
My school shut down, <eob> and when the rebel armies captured <eol> the only international airport, <eob> people started panicking and fleeing. <eob>
My mom came knocking one morning <eol> and said, "Raj, pack your things -- <eob> we have to go." <eob> We were rushed to the center of town, <eob> and there on a tarmac, <eol> we were split into two lines. <eob>
I stood with my family in one line, <eob> and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch <eob> of a rescue plane. <eob>
And there on a bench, <eol> I was sitting with my heart racing. <eob>
As I looked out the open hatch, <eob> I saw hundreds of Liberians <eol> in another line, <eob> children strapped to their backs. <eob>
When they tried to jump in with us, <eob> I watched soldiers restrain them. <eob>
They were not allowed to flee. <eob>
We were the lucky ones. <eob> We lost what we had, <eob> but we resettled in America, <eob> and as immigrants, we benefitted <eol> from the community of supporters <eob> that rallied around us. <eob>
They took my family into their home, <eob> they mentored me. <eob>
And they helped my dad <eol> start a clothing shop. <eob>
I'd visit my father <eol> on weekends as a teenager <eob> to help him sell sneakers and jeans. <eob>
no condition is permanent. <eob> And every time business would get bad, <eob> he'd remind me of that mantra: <eob>
That mantra and my parents' persistence <eol> and that community of supporters <eob> made it possible for me <eol> to go through college <eob> and eventually to medical school. <eob>
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war, <eob> but because of them, <eob> I had a chance to pursue my dream <eol> to become a doctor. <eob>
My condition had changed. <eob>
It had been 15 years <eol> since I escaped that airfield, <eob> but the memory of those two lines <eol> had not escaped my mind. <eob>
I was a medical student in my mid-20s, <eob> and I wanted to go back <eob> to see if I could serve <eol> the people we'd left behind. <eob>
But when I got back, <eob> what I found was utter destruction. <eob>
The war had left us with just 51 doctors <eob> to serve a country of four million people. <eob>
It would be like the city of San Francisco <eol> having just 10 doctors. <eob>
So if you got sick in the city <eol> where those few doctors remain, <eob> you might stand a chance. <eob>
But if you got sick in the remote, <eol> rural rainforest communities, <eob> where you could be days <eol> from the nearest clinic -- <eob> I was seeing my patients die <eol> from conditions no one should die from, <eob> all because they were <eol> getting to me too late. <eob>
Imagine you have a two-year-old <eol> who wakes up one morning with a fever, <eob> and you realize she could have malaria, <eob> and you know the only way to get her <eol> the medicine she needs <eob> would be to take her to the riverbed, <eob> get in a canoe, paddle to the other side <eob> and then walk for up to two days <eol> through the forest <eob> just to reach the nearest clinic. <eob>
One billion people live <eol> in the world's most remote communities, <eob> and despite the advances we've made <eol> in modern medicine and technology, <eob> our innovations are not <eol> reaching the last mile. <eob>
These communities have been left behind, <eob> because they've been thought <eol> too hard to reach <eob> and too difficult to serve. <eob>
Illness is universal; <eob> access to care is not. <eob>
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul. <eob>
No one should die because they live <eol> too far from a doctor or clinic. <eob>
No condition should be permanent. <eob>
And help in this case <eol> didn't come from the outside, <eob> it actually came from within. <eob>
It came from the communities themselves. <eob>
Meet Musu. <eob> Way out in rural Liberia, <eob> where most girls have not had <eol> a chance to finish primary school, <eob> Musu had been persistent. <eob>
At the age of 18, <eol> she completed high school, <eob> and she came back to her community. <eob>
She saw that none of the children <eol> were getting treatment <eob> for the diseases <eol> they needed treatment for -- <eob> deadly diseases, like malaria <eol> and pneumonia. <eob>
So she signed up to be a volunteer. <eob>
There are millions of volunteers like Musu <eol> in rural parts around our world, <eob> and we got to thinking -- <eob> community members like Musu <eol> could actually help us solve a puzzle. <eob>
Our health care system <eol> is structured in such a way <eob> that the work of diagnosing disease <eol> and prescribing medicines <eob> is limited to a team of nurses <eol> and doctors like me. <eob>
But nurses and doctors <eol> are concentrated in cities, <eob> so rural communities like Musu's <eol> have been left behind. <eob>
So we started asking some questions: <eob> What if we could reorganize <eol> the medical care system? <eob>
What if we could have community <eol> members like Musu <eob> be a part or even be the center <eol> of our medical team? <eob>
What if Musu could help us bring <eol> health care from clinics in cities <eob> to the doorsteps of her neighbors? <eob>
Musu was 48 when I met her. <eob>
And despite her amazing talent and grit, <eob> she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years. <eob>
So what if technology could support her? <eob>
What if we could invest in her <eol> with real training, <eob> equip her with real medicines, <eob> and have her have a real job? <eob>
Well, in 2007, I was trying <eol> to answer these questions, <eob> and my wife and I were <eol> getting married that year. <eob> We asked our relatives to forgo <eol> the wedding registry gifts <eob> and instead donate some money <eob> so we could have some start-up money <eol> to launch a nonprofit. <eob>
I promise you, I'm a lot <eol> more romantic than that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We ended up raising $6,000, <eob> teamed up with some <eol> Liberians and Americans <eob> and launched a nonprofit <eol> called Last Mile Health. <eob>
Our goal is to bring a health worker <eol> within reach of everyone, everywhere. <eob>
We designed a three-step process -- <eob> train, equip and pay -- <eob> to invest more deeply <eol> in volunteers like Musu <eob> to become paraprofessionals, <eob> to become community health workers. <eob>
First we trained Musu to prevent, <eol> diagnose and treat <eob> the top 10 diseases afflicting <eol> families in her village. <eob>
A nurse supervisor visited her <eol> every month to coach her. <eob>
We equipped her with modern <eol> medical technology, <eob> like this $1 malaria rapid test, <eob> and put it in a backpack <eol> full of medicines like this <eob> to treat infections like pneumonia, <eob> and crucially, <eob> a smartphone, to help her track <eol> and report on epidemics. <eob>
Last, we recognized <eol> the dignity in Musu's work. <eob>
With the Liberian government, <eol> we created a contract, <eob> paid her <eob> and gave her the chance <eol> to have a real job. <eob> And she's amazing. <eob>
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills, <eob> from screening children for malnutrition, <eob> to assessing the cause <eol> of a child's cough with a smartphone, <eob> to supporting people with HIV <eob> and providing follow-up care <eol> to patients who've lost their limbs. <eob>
Working as part of our team, <eob> working as paraprofessionals, <eob> community health workers can help ensure <eob> that a lot of what <eol> your family doctor would do <eob> reaches the places that most <eol> family doctors could never go. <eob>
One of my favorite things to do <eol> is to care for patients <eob> with community health workers. <eob>
So last year I was visiting A.B., <eob> and like Musu, A.B. had had <eol> a chance to go to school. <eob>
He was in middle school, <eol> in the eighth grade, <eob> when his parents died. <eob>
He became an orphan and had to drop out. <eob>
Last year, we hired and trained <eol> A.B. as a community health worker. <eob>
And while he was making <eol> door to door house calls, <eob> he met this young boy named Prince, <eob> whose mother had had trouble <eol> breastfeeding him, <eob> and by the age of six months, <eol> Prince had started to waste away. <eob>
A.B. had just been taught how to use <eol> this color-coded measuring tape <eob> that wraps around the upper arm <eol> of a child to diagnose malnutrition. <eob>
A.B. noticed that Prince <eol> was in the red zone, <eob> which meant he had to be hospitalized. <eob>
So A.B. took Prince <eol> and his mother to the river, <eob> got in a canoe <eob> and paddled for four hours <eol> to get to the hospital. <eob>
Later, after Prince was discharged, <eob> A.B. taught mom how to feed baby <eol> a food supplement. <eob>
A few months ago, <eob> A.B. took me to visit Prince, <eol> and he's a chubby little guy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He's meeting his milestones, <eol> he's pulled himself up to a stand, <eob> and is even starting to say a few words. <eob>
I'm so inspired by these <eol> community health workers. <eob>
I often ask them why they do what they do, <eob> and when I asked A.B., <eob> he said, "Doc, since I dropped out <eol> of school, this is the first time <eob> I'm having a chance <eol> to hold a pen to write. <eob>
My brain is getting fresh." <eob>
The stories of A.B. and Musu <eol> have taught me something fundamental <eob> about being human. <eob>
Our will to serve others <eob> can actually help us <eol> transform our own conditions. <eob>
I was so moved by how powerful <eol> the will to serve our neighbors can be <eob> a few years ago, <eob> when we faced a global catastrophe. <eob>
In December 2013, <eob> something happened in the rainforests <eol> across the border from us in Guinea. <eob>
A toddler named Emile fell sick <eol> with vomiting, fever and diarrhea. <eob>
He lived in an area <eol> where the roads were sparse <eob> and there had been massive <eol> shortages of health workers. <eob>
Emile died, <eob> and a few weeks later his sister died, <eob> and a few weeks later his mother died. <eob>
And this disease would spread <eol> from one community to another. <eob>
And it wasn't until three months later <eob> that the world recognized this as Ebola. <eob>
When every minute counted, <eol> we had already lost months, <eob> and by then the virus had spread <eol> like wildfire all across West Africa, <eob> and eventually to other <eol> parts of the world. <eob>
Businesses shut down, <eol> airlines started canceling routes. <eob>
At the height of the crisis, <eob> when we were told that 1.4 million <eol> people could be infected, <eob> when we were told <eol> that most of them would die, <eob> when we had nearly lost all hope, <eob> I remember standing with a group <eol> of health workers <eob> in the rainforest where <eol> an outbreak had just happened. <eob>
We were helping train and equip <eol> them to put on the masks, <eob> the gloves and the gowns that they needed <eob> to keep themselves safe from the virus <eob> while they were serving their patients. <eob>
I remember the fear in their eyes. <eob>
And I remember staying up at night, <eol> terrified if I'd made the right call <eob> to keep them in the field. <eob>
When Ebola threatened to bring <eol> humanity to its knees, <eob> Liberia's community health workers <eol> didn't surrender to fear. <eob>
They did what they had always done: <eob> they answered the call <eol> to serve their neighbors. <eob>
Community members across Liberia <eol> learned the symptoms of Ebola, <eob> teamed up with nurses and doctors <eol> to go door-to-door to find the sick <eob> and get them into care. <eob>
They tracked thousands of people <eol> who had been exposed to the virus <eob> and helped break <eol> the chain of transmission. <eob>
Some ten thousand community <eol> health workers risked their own lives <eob> to help hunt down this virus <eol> and stop it in its tracks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today, Ebola has come <eol> under control in West Africa, <eob> and we've learned a few things. <eob>
We've learned that blind spots <eol> in rural health care <eob> can lead to hot spots of disease, <eob> and that places all of us at greater risk. <eob>
We've learned that the most efficient <eol> emergency system <eob> is actually an everyday system, <eob> and that system has to reach <eol> all communities, <eob> including rural communities like Emile's. <eob>
And most of all, <eob> we've learned from the courage <eol> of Liberia's community health workers <eob> that we as people are not defined <eol> by the conditions we face, <eob> no matter how hopeless they seem. <eob>
We're defined by how we respond to them. <eob>
For the past 15 years, <eob> I've seen the power of this idea <eob> to transform everyday citizens <eol> into community health workers -- <eob> into everyday heroes. <eob>
And I've seen it play out everywhere, <eob> from the forest communities <eol> of West Africa, <eob> to the rural fishing villages of Alaska. <eob>
It's true, <eob> these community health workers <eol> aren't doing neurosurgery, <eob> but they're making it possible <eob> to bring health care within reach <eol> of everyone everywhere. <eob>
So now what? <eob> Well, we know that there are still <eol> millions of people dying <eob> from preventable causes <eob> in rural communities around the world. <eob>
And we know that the great majority <eol> of these deaths are happening <eob> in these 75 blue-shaded countries. <eob>
What we also know <eob> is that if we trained an army <eol> of community health workers <eob> to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills, <eob> we could save the lives of nearly <eol> 30 million people by 2030. <eob>
Thirty services could save <eol> 30 million lives by 2030. <eob>
That's not just a blueprint -- <eob> we're proving this can be done. <eob>
In Liberia, <eob> the Liberian government is training <eol> thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu <eob> after Ebola, <eob> to bring health care to every <eol> child and family in the country. <eob>
And we've been honored to work with them, <eob> and are now teaming up <eol> with a number of organizations <eob> that are working across other countries <eob> to try to help them do the same thing. <eob>
If we could help these countries scale, <eob> we could save millions of lives, <eob> and at the same time, <eob> we could create millions of jobs. <eob>
We simply can't do that, though, <eol> without technology. <eob>
People are worried that technology <eol> is going to steal our jobs, <eob> but when it comes <eol> to community health workers, <eob> technology has actually <eol> been vital for creating jobs. <eob>
Without technology -- <eol> without this smartphone, <eob> without this rapid test -- <eob> it would have been impossible for us <eol> to be able to employ A.B. and Musu. <eob>
And I think it's time <eol> for technology to help us train, <eob> to help us train people faster <eol> and better than ever before. <eob>
As a doctor, <eob> I use technology to stay up-to-date <eol> and keep certified. <eob>
I use smartphones, I use apps, <eol> I use online courses. <eob>
But when A.B. wants to learn, <eob> he's got to jump back in that canoe <eob> and get to the training center. <eob>
And when Musu shows up for training, <eob> her instructors are stuck using <eol> flip charts and markers. <eob>
Why shouldn't they have the same <eol> access to learn as I do? <eob>
If we truly want community health workers <eol> to master those lifesaving skills <eob> and even more, <eob> we've got to change this old-school <eol> model of education. <eob>
Tech can truly be a game changer here. <eob>
I've been in awe of the digital <eol> education revolution <eob> that the likes of Khan Academy <eol> and edX have been leading. <eob>
And I've been thinking that it's time; <eob> it's time for a collision <eob> between the digital education revolution <eob> and the community health revolution. <eob>
And so, this brings me <eol> to my TED Prize wish. <eob>
I wish -- <eob> I wish that you would help us recruit <eob> the largest army of community health <eol> workers the world has ever known <eob> by creating the Community Health Academy, <eob> a global platform to train, <eol> connect and empower. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Here's the idea: <eob> we'll create and curate <eob> the best in digital education resources. <eob>
We will bring those to community <eol> health workers around the world, <eob> including A.B. and Musu. <eob>
They'll get video lessons <eol> on giving kids vaccines <eob> and have online courses <eol> on spotting the next outbreak, <eob> so they're not stuck using flip charts. <eob>
We'll help these countries <eol> accredit these workers, <eob> so that they're not stuck remaining <eol> an under-recognized, undervalued group, <eob> but become a renowned, <eol> empowered profession, <eob> just like nurses and doctors. <eob>
And we'll create a network <eol> of companies and entrepreneurs <eob> who've created innovations <eol> that can save lives <eob> and help them connect <eol> to workers like Musu, <eob> so she can help better <eol> serve her community. <eob>
And we'll work tirelessly <eol> to persuade governments <eob> to make community health workers <eol> a cornerstone of their health care plans. <eob>
We plan to test and prototype <eol> the academy in Liberia <eob> and a few other partner countries, <eob> and then we plan to take it global, <eob> including to rural North America. <eob>
With the power of this platform, <eob> we believe countries can be more persuaded <eob> that a health care revolution <eol> really is possible. <eob>
from the forest communities <eol> of West Africa, <eob> My dream is that this academy <eol> will contribute to the training <eob> of hundreds of thousands <eol> of community members <eob> to help bring health care <eol> to their neighbors -- <eob> the hundreds of millions of them <eob> that live in the world's most <eol> remote communities, <eob> to the fishing villages of rural Alaska; <eob> from the hilltops of Appalachia, <eol> to the mountains of Afghanistan. <eob>
If this vision is aligned with yours, <eob> head to communityhealthacademy.org, <eob> and join this revolution. <eob>
Let us know if you or your organization <eol> or someone you know could help us <eob> as we try to build this academy <eol> over the next year. <eob>
Now, as I look out into this room, <eob> I realize that our journeys <eol> are not self-made; <eob> they're shaped by others. <eob>
And there have been so many here <eol> that have been part of this cause. <eob>
We're so honored to be part <eol> of this community, <eob> and a community that's willing <eol> to take on a cause <eob> as audacious as this one, <eob> so I wanted to offer, as I end, <eob> a reflection. <eob>
I think a lot more about <eol> what my father taught me. <eob>
These days, I too have become a dad. <eob>
I have two sons, <eob> and my wife and I just learned <eol> that she's pregnant with our third child. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I was recently caring <eol> for a woman in Liberia <eob> who, like my wife, <eol> was in her third pregnancy. <eob>
But unlike my wife, <eob> had had no prenatal care <eol> with her first two babies. <eob>
She lived in an isolated community <eol> in the forest that had gone for 100 years <eob> without any health care <eob> until... <eob> until last year when a nurse <eol> trained her neighbors <eob> to become community health workers. <eob>
So here I was, <eob> seeing this patient <eol> who was in her second trimester, <eob> and I pulled out the ultrasound <eol> to check on the baby, <eob> and she started telling us stories <eol> about her first two kids, <eob> and I had the ultrasound <eol> probe on her belly, <eob> and she just stopped mid-sentence. <eob>
She turned to me and she said, <eob> "Doc, what's that sound?" <eob> It was the first time she'd ever heard <eol> her baby's heartbeat. <eob>
And her eyes lit up in the same way <eol> my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up <eob> when we heard our baby's heartbeat. <eob>
For all of human history, <eob> illness has been universal <eol> and access to care has not. <eob>
no condition is permanent. <eob> But as a wise man once told me: <eob> It's time. <eob> It's time for us to go as far as it takes <eob> to change this condition together. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Silicon Valley is obsessed <eol> with disruption, <eob> but these days, the biggest disruptor <eol> didn't come out of Silicon Valley. <eob>
It came out of steel towns in Ohio, <eob> rural communities in Pennsylvania, <eob> the Panhandle in Florida. <eob>
And this last US presidential election <eob> was the mother of all disruptions. <eob>
Once again, politics is personal. <eob>
Millions of Americans became activists overnight, <eob> pouring into the streets <eol> in record numbers <eob> in record time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The election has done <eol> to family holiday dinners <eob> what Uber has done <eol> to New York City's taxi system. <eob>
Couples have broken up <eol> and marriages disrupted. <eob>
And the election is doing <eol> to my private life <eob> what Amazon is doing <eol> to shopping malls. <eob>
These days, the ACLU is on the front lines <eol> 24 / 7, <eob> and even if I manage to sneak away <eol> for a couple of miles on the treadmill, <eob> any cardio benefit I get <eol> is instantly obliterated <eob> when I read another presidential tweet <eol> on the headline scroll. <eob>
Even my secret pleasure <eob> of studying the Italian painters <eob> have been infected by politics. <eob>
Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters. <eob>
This is my desk, <eob> with a postcard exhibition <eob> of some famous and obscure paintings <eob> mostly from the Italian Renaissance. <eob>
Now, art used to provide me <eol> with a necessary break <eob> from the hurly-burly of politics <eob> in my daily work at the ACLU, <eob> but not anymore. <eob>
I was at the Women's March in San Francisco <eob> the day after inauguration, <eob> and the crowd was chanting, <eol> "This is what democracy looks like." <eob> "This is what democracy looks like." <eob> And there I was holding my sign <eol> and my umbrella in the rain, <eob> and I flashed on an old painting <eob> that first captivated me many years ago. <eob>
I struggled to remember <eol> the different pieces <eob> of an actual painting <eob> of good and bad government. <eob>
It was almost like the old master <eol> was taunting me. <eob>
You want to know what democracy <eol> looks like? <eob>
Go back and look at my frescoes. <eob>
And so I did. <eob> In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti <eol> finished a monumental commission <eob> in the governing council chamber <eol> of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico. <eob>
It's a painting that speaks to us, <eol> even screams to us, today. <eob> "Art is a lie <eol> that makes us realize truth," <eob> Pablo Picasso once said. <eob>
And as we search <eol> for the truth about government, <eob> we should keep Ambrogio's work, <eob> not a lie but an allegory, <eol> in our collective mind's eye. <eob>
During Lorenzetti's time, <eob> the political legitimacy <eol> of Italian city-states <eob> was often on very shaky ground. <eob>
Siena was a republic, <eob> but there had been enormous unrest <eob> in the two decades leading up <eol> to the commission. <eob>
Siena's political leaders, <eol> who would literally govern <eob> under the eyes of these allegorical figures, <eob> were Lorenzetti's intended audience. <eob>
He was cataloging the obligations <eob> of the governing to the governed. <eob>
Now, you can spend years <eol> studying these frescoes. <eob> Some scholars have. <eob> I'm hardly an art historian, <eob> but I am passionate about art, <eob> and a work this massive <eol> can overwhelm me. <eob>
So first, I focus on the big stuff. <eob>
This is the allegory of good government. <eob>
The majestic figure here in the middle <eob> is dressed in Siena's colors <eob> and he personifies the republic itself. <eob>
Lorenzetti labels <eol> him "Commune," <eob> and he's basically telling the Sienese <eob> that they, and not a king or a tyrant, must rule themselves. <eob>
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors. <eob> Justice is enthroned. <eob> She's looking up at the figure of wisdom, <eob> who actually supports her scales <eol> of justice. <eob>
Concord, or Harmony, <eob> holds a string that comes off <eol> the scales of justice <eob> that binds her to the citizens, <eob> making them all compatriots in the republic. <eob>
And finally we see Peace. <eob>
She looks chilled out, <eob> like she's listening to Bob Marley. <eob>
When good government rules, <eob> Peace doesn't break a sweat. <eob>
Now, these are big images and big ideas, <eob> but I really love the small stuff. <eob>
Along another wall, <eob> Lorenzetti illustrates <eol> the effects of good government <eob> on the real and everyday lives <eol> of ordinary people <eob> with a series of delicious little details. <eob>
In the countryside, the hills <eol> are landscaped and farmed. <eob>
Crops are being sown, hoed, <eol> reaped, milled, plowed, <eob> all in one picture. <eob>
Crops and livestock <eol> are being brought to market. <eob>
In the city, builders raise a tower. <eob>
People attend a law lecture, <eol> a TED Talk of the 14th century. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Schoolchildren play. <eob> Tradesmen thrive. <eob> Dancers larger than life dance with joy. <eob>
And watching over the republic <eol> is the winged figure Security, <eob> whose banner reads, <eob> "Everyone shall go forth freely <eol> without fear." <eob>
Now, what's amazing about these images <eol> from 800 years ago <eob> is that they're familiar to us today. <eob>
We see what democracy looks like. <eob>
We experience the effects <eol> of good government in our lives, <eob> just as Lorenzetti did in his life. <eob>
But it is the allegory <eol> of bad government <eob> that has been haunting me since November 9. <eob>
It's badly damaged, <eob> but it reads like today's newspapers. <eob>
And ruling over bad government <eol> is not the Commune <eob> but the Tyrant. <eob>
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes, <eob> braided hair. <eob>
He obviously spends <eol> a lot of time on that hair. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Justice now lies helpless at his feet, <eob> shackled. <eob>
Her scales have been severed. <eob>
Justice is the key antagonist <eol> to the Tyrant, <eob> and she's been taken out. <eob>
Now, surrounding the Tyrant, <eob> Lorenzetti illustrates <eol> the vices that animate bad government. <eob>
Avarice is the old woman <eol> clutching the strongbox <eob> and a fisherman's hook <eob> to pull in her fortune. <eob>
Vainglory carries a mirror, <eob> and Lorenzetti warns us <eol> against narcissistic leaders <eob> who are guided by their own ego <eol> and vanity. <eob>
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty. <eob>
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion, <eob> lulls us into a false sense of security <eob> and then poisons a republic. <eob>
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat. <eob>
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division. <eob>
She's dressed in Siena's colors. <eob> "Si" and "No" are painted on her body. <eob>
She uses a carpenter's saw <eol> to chop her body in half. <eob>
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob, <eob> the stone and knife. <eob>
In the remainder of the fresco, <eol> Lorenzetti shows us <eob> the inevitable effects <eol> of bad government. <eob>
The civic ideals celebrated elsewhere <eol> in this room have failed us, <eob> and we see it. <eob>
The once beautiful city <eol> has fallen to pieces, <eob> the countryside barren, <eob> the farms abandoned. <eob>
Many are in flames. <eob>
And in the sky above is not <eol> the winged figure Security, <eob> but that of Fear, <eob> whose banner reads: <eob> "None shall pass along this road <eob> without fear of death." <eob>
Now, the final image, <eol> the most important one, really, <eob> is one that Lorenzetti did not paint. <eob>
It is of the viewer. <eob>
Today, the audience <eol> for Lorenzetti's frescoes <eob> is not the governing but the governed, <eob> the individual who stands in front <eol> of his allegories <eob> and walks away with insight, <eob> who heeds a call to action. <eob>
Lorenzetti warns us <eol> that we must recognize the shadows <eob> of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny <eob> when they float <eol> across our political landscape, <eob> especially when those shadows are cast <eob> by political leaders loudly claiming <eol> to be the voice of good government <eob> and promising to make America great again. <eob>
And we must act. <eob> Democracy must not be a spectator sport. <eob>
The right to protest, <eol> the right to assemble freely, <eob> the right to petition one's government, <eob> these are not just rights. <eob>
In the face of Avarice, <eol> Fraud and Division, <eob> these are obligations. <eob> We have to disrupt -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We have to disrupt our lives <eob> so that we can disrupt <eob> the amoral accretion of power <eob> by those who would betray our values. <eob>
We and we the people <eob> must raise justice up <eob> and must bring peace to our nation <eob> and must come together in concord, <eob> and we have a choice. <eob>
We could either paint ourselves <eob> into the worst nightmare <eol> of Lorenzetti's bad government, <eob> or we can stay in the streets, <eob> disruptive, messy, loud. <eob>
That is what democracy looks like. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: First of all, wow. <eob> Obviously, many people passionately -- <eob> you spoke to many people passionately here. <eob>
I'm sure there are other people here <eob> who'd say, look, Trump <eol> was elected by 63 million people. <eob>
He's far from perfect, <eob> but he's trying to do <eol> what he was elected to do. <eob> Shouldn't you give him a chance? <eob>
Anthony Romero: <eol> I think we have to recognize <eob> the legitimacy of him as president <eob> versus the legitimacy of his policies. <eob>
And when so many of the policies <eol> are contrary to fundamental values, <eob> that we're all equal under the law, <eob> that we're not judged by the color <eol> of our skin or the religion we worship, <eob> we have to contest those values <eob> even as we recognize and honor the fact <eob> that our democracy rendered us a president <eol> who is championing those values. <eob>
CA: And the ACLU isn't just this force <eol> on the left, right? <eob>
You're making other arguments as well. <eob>
AR: Well, you know, <eob> very often we piss everyone <eol> off at one point. <eob>
That's what we do. <eob>
And we recently were taking stands <eob> for why Ann Coulter needs <eol> to be able to speak at Berkeley, <eob> and why Milo has free speech rights. <eob>
And we even wrote a blog <eob> that almost burnt the house <eol> down among some of our members, <eob> unfortunately, when we talked about the fact <eob> that even Donald Trump <eol> has free speech rights as president, <eob> and an effort to hold him accountable <eob> for incitement of violence <eol> at his marches or his rallies <eob> is unconstitutional and un-American. <eob>
And when you put that statement out there <eob> to a very frothy base <eob> that always is very excited <eol> for you to fight Donald Trump, <eob> and then you have a new one saying, "Wait, these rights <eol> are for everybody, <eob> even the president <eol> that we don't like." <eob> And that's our job. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: Anthony, you spoke to so <eol> many of us so powerfully. <eob>
Thank you <eob> so much. Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Zika fever: <eob> our newest dread disease. <eob> What is it? Where'd it come from? <eob>
What do we do about it? <eob>
Well for most adults, it's <eol> a relatively mild disease -- <eob> a little fever, a little headache, <eol> joint pain, maybe a rash. <eob>
In fact, most people who get it <eol> don't even know they've had it. <eob>
But the more we find out <eol> about the Zika virus <eob> the more terrifying it becomes. <eob>
For example, doctors have noticed <eol> an uptick <eob> of something called Guillain-Barré syndrome <eol> in recent outbreaks. <eob>
In Guillain-Barré, your immune system attacks <eol> your nerve cells <eob> it can partially or even totally paralyze you. <eob>
Fortunately, that's quite rare, <eol> and most people recover. <eob>
But if you're pregnant <eol> when you're infected <eob> you're at risk of something terrible. <eob>
Indeed, a child with a deformed head. <eob>
Here's a normal baby. <eob>
Here's that infant with what's <eol> called microcephaly. <eob> a brain in a head <eol> that's too small. <eob>
And there's no known cure. <eob>
It was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil <eob> who first noticed, just a year ago, <eol> after a Zika outbreak, <eob> that there was a peak in the incidence <eol> of microcephaly. <eob>
It took medical doctors another year <eob> to be sure that it was caused <eol> by the Zika virus, <eob> but they're now sure. <eob>
And if you're a "bring on the evidence" type, <eob> check out this publication. <eob>
So where did it come from, <eol> and how did it get here? <eob>
And it is here. <eob>
Like many of our viruses, <eol> it came out of Africa, <eob> specifically the Zika forest in Uganda. <eob>
Researchers at the nearby Yellow <eol> Fever Research Institute <eob> identified an unknown virus in a monkey <eol> in the Zika forest <eob> which is how it got its name. <eob>
The first human cases of <eob> Zika fever <eob> surfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania. <eob>
The virus then spread <eol> through West Africa <eob> and east through equatorial Asia -- <eol> Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. <eob>
But it was still mostly in monkeys <eol> and, of course, mosquitoes. <eob>
In fact in the 60 years between the time <eol> it was first identified in 1947 and 2007 <eob> there were only 13 reported cases <eol> of human <eob> Zika fever. <eob>
And then something extraordinary happened <eol> on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands. <eob>
There was an outbreak that affected <eol> fully 75 percent of the population. <eob>
How did it get there? By air. <eob> Today we have two billion <eol> commercial airline passengers. <eob>
An infected passenger can board <eol> a plane, fly halfway around the world <eob> before developing symptoms -- if they develop <eol> symptoms at all. <eob>
Then when they land, the local mosquitoes begin to bite them <eol> and spread the fever. <eob>
Zika fever <eob> then next surfaced in 2013 <eol> in French Polynesia. <eob>
By December of that year, it was being transmitted <eol> locally by the mosquitoes. <eob>
That led to an explosive outbreak <eol> in which almost 30,000 people were affected. <eob>
From there it radiated around the Pacific. <eob>
There were outbreaks in the Cook Islands, <eol> in New Caledonia, <eob> in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands <eob> and almost all the way around to the coast <eol> of South America and Easter Island. <eob>
And then, in early 2015, <eob> there was an upsurge of cases <eol> of a dengue-like syndrome <eob> in the city of Natal <eol> in northeastern Brazil. <eob>
The virus wasn't dengue, <eol> it was Zika, and it spread rapidly -- <eob> Recife down the coast, <eol> a big metropolitan center, soon became the epicenter. <eob>
Well people have speculated that it <eol> was 2014 World Cup soccer fans <eob> that brought the virus into the country. <eob>
But others have speculated that perhaps <eol> it was Pacific Islanders <eob> participating in championship <eol> canoe races <eob> that were held in Rio that year <eol> that brought it in. <eob>
Well today, this is only a year later. <eob> The virus is being locally <eol> transmitted by mosquitoes <eob> virtually throughout South America, <eol> Central America, Mexico <eob> and the Caribbean Islands <eob> Until this year, the many thousands of cases <eob> that have been diagnosed in the US <eol> were contracted elsewhere. <eob>
But as of this summer, <eol> it's being transmitted locally in Miami. <eob> It's here. <eob>
So what do we do about it? <eob>
Well, preventing infection <eob> is either about protecting people or about eliminating <eol> the mosquitoes. <eob>
Let's focus on people first. <eob>
You can get vaccinated. <eob>
You can not travel to Zika areas. <eob>
Or you can cover up <eol> and apply insect repellent. <eob>
Getting vaccinated is not an option, <eol> because there isn't a vaccine yet <eob> and there probably won't be <eol> for a couple of years. <eob>
Staying home isn't a foolproof protection either <eob> because we now know that <eol> it can be sexually transmitted. <eob>
Covering up and applying insect <eol> repellent does work ... <eob>
until you forget. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So that leaves the mosquitoes, <eol> and here's how we control them now: <eob> spraying insecticides. <eob>
The protective gear is necessary <eol> because these are toxic chemicals <eob> that kill people <eol> as well as bugs. <eob>
Although it does take quite a lot more <eol> to kill a person than to kill a bug. <eob>
These are pictures from Brazil <eol> and Nicaragua. <eob>
But it looks the same in Miami, Florida. <eob>
And we of course can spray <eol> insecticides from planes. <eob>
Last summer, mosquito control <eol> officials in Dorchester County, South Carolina, <eob> authorized spraying of Naled, an insecticide, <eob> early one morning, as recommended <eol> by the manufacturer. <eob>
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters <eob> that her bee yard looked like it <eol> had been nuked. <eob> Oops. <eob> Bees are the good guys. <eob>
The citizens of Florida protested, <eol> but spraying continued. <eob>
Unfortunately, so did the increase <eol> in the number of <eob> Zika fever <eob> cases. <eob>
That's because insecticides <eol> aren't very effective. <eob>
So are there any approaches <eol> that are perhaps more effective than spraying <eob> but with less downsides <eol> than toxic chemicals? <eob>
I'm a huge fan <eol> of biological controls, <eob> and I share that view with Rachel Carson, <eol> author of "Silent Spring," <eob> the book that is credited with starting <eol> the environmental movement. <eob>
In this book she tells the story, <eol> as an example, <eob> of how a very nasty insect <eol> pest of livestock <eob> was eliminated in the last century. <eob>
No one knows <eol> that extraordinary story today. <eob>
So Jack Block and I, when we were writing <eol> an editorial <eob> about the mosquito problem today, <eol> retold that story. <eob>
And in capsule form, it's that pupae -- <eol> that's the immature form of the insect -- <eob> were irradiated until they were sterile, <eol> grown to adulthood <eob> and then released from planes <eol> all over the Southwest, <eob> the Southeast and down into Mexico <eol> and into Central America <eob> literally by the hundreds of millions <eol> from little airplanes, <eob> eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest <eob> for most of the Western Hemisphere. <eob>
Our real purpose in writing this editorial <eob> was to introduce readers <eol> to how we can do that today -- <eob> not with radiation but with our knowledge <eol> of genetics. <eob> Let me explain. <eob>
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti. <eob> It's the most common insect <eol> vector of diseases, <eob> not just Zika but dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus <eob> and that ancient plague, yellow fever. <eob>
It's an urban mosquito, <eob> and it's the female <eol> that does the dirty work. <eob>
She bites to get a blood meal <eol> to feed her offspring. <eob>
Males don't bite; they don't even have <eol> the mouth parts to bite. <eob>
A little British company called Oxitec genetically modified <eol> that mosquito <eob> so that when it mates with a wild female, <eol> its eggs don't develop to adulthood. <eob>
Let me show you. <eob>
This is the normal reproductive cycle. <eob>
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that when <eol> the male mates with the wild female <eob> the eggs don't develop. <eob> Sounds impossible? <eob> Well let me show you just diagrammatically <eol> how they do it. <eob>
Now this represents the nucleus <eol> of a mosquito cell, <eob> and that tangle in the middle <eol> represents its genome, <eob> the sum total of its genes. <eob>
Scientists added a single gene <eob> that codes for a protein <eol> represented by this orange ball <eob> that feeds back on itself <eol> to keep cranking out more of that protein. <eob>
The extra copies, however, go and gum up <eol> the mosquitoes' genes, <eob> killing the organism. <eob>
To keep it alive in the laboratory <eol> they use a compound called tetracycline. <eob>
Tetracycline shuts off that gene <eol> and allows normal development. <eob>
They added another little wrinkle so <eol> that they could study what happens. <eob>
And that is they added a gene <eol> that makes the insect glow under UV light <eob> so that when they released it <eol> they could follow exactly how far it went <eob> how long it lived and all of the kinds of data <eob> for a good scientific study. <eob>
Now this is the pupal stage, <eol> and at this stage <eob> the females are larger than the males. <eob>
That allows them to sort them <eol> into the males and the females <eob> and they allow only the males <eol> to grow to adulthood. <eob>
And let me remind you <eol> that males don't bite. <eob>
From there it's pretty simple. <eob>
They take beakers full <eol> of male mosquitoes, <eob> load them into milk cartons, <eol> and drive around the city, <eob> releasing them guided by GPS. <eob>
Here's the mayor of a city <eol> releasing the first batch <eob> of what they call the "friendly Aedes." <eob> Now I wish I could tell you this is an American city, <eol> but it's not. <eob>
It's Piracicaba, Brazil. <eob>
The amazing thing <eol> is that in just a year <eob> it brought down the cases <eol> of dengue by 91 percent. <eob>
That's better than any insecticide spraying can do. <eob>
So why aren't we using this remarkable <eol> biological control in the US? <eob>
That's because it's a GMO: <eol> a genetically modified organism. <eob>
Notice the subtitle here says <eol> if the FDA would let them <eob> they could do the same thing here, <eol> when Zika arrives. <eob>
And of course it has arrived. <eob>
So now I have to tell you the short form <eob> of the long, torturous story <eol> of GM regulation in the US <eob> In the US, there are three agencies <eol> that regulate genetically modified organisms: <eob> the FDA, the Food <eol> and Drug Administration, <eob> the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, <eob> and the USDA, US Department <eol> of Agriculture. <eob>
Took these folks two years to decide <eol> that it would be the FDA <eob> that would regulate <eol> the genetically modified mosquito. <eob>
And they would do it as a new animal drug, <eol> if that makes any sense. <eob>
Took them another five years going <eol> back and forth and back and forth <eob> to convince the FDA <eol> that this would not harm people, <eob> and it would not harm the environment. <eob>
They finally gave them, this summer, <eol> permission to run a little test <eob> in the Florida Keys, <eob> where they had been invited years earlier <eol> when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue. <eob>
Would that it were that easy. <eob>
When the local residents heard <eob> that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes <eol> tested in their community <eob> some of them began to organize protests. <eob>
They even organized a petition on the internet <eol> with this cuddly logo, <eob> which eventually accumulated <eol> some 160,000 signatures <eob> And they demanded a referendum <eob> which will be conducted <eol> in just a couple of weeks <eob> about whether the trials would be permitted at all. <eob>
Well it's Miami that really <eol> needs these better ways of controlling insects. <eob>
And there the attitudes are changing. <eob>
In fact, very recently a bipartisan group <eol> of more than 60 legislators <eob> wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell <eob> asking that she, at the Federal level, <eol> expedite access for Florida <eob> to this new technology. <eob>
So the bottom line is this: <eob> biological control of harmful insects <eob> can be both more effective <eol> and very much more environmentally friendly <eob> than using insecticides, <eol> which are toxic chemicals. <eob>
That was true in Rachel Carson's time; <eol> it's true today. <eob>
What's different is that <eol> we have enormously more information <eob> about genetics <eol> than we had then, <eob> and therefore more ability <eol> to use that information <eob> to affect these biological controls. <eob>
And I hope that what I've done <eol> is aroused your curiosity enough <eob> to start your own inquiry -- not into just GM mosquitoes <eob> but to the other genetically modified <eol> organisms that are so controversial today. <eob>
I think if you do that, and you dig down <eol> through all of the misinformation, <eob> and the marketing <eob> on the part of the organic food industry <eol> and the Greenpeaces <eob> and find the science, the accurate science, <eob> you'll be surprised and pleased. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
She wrote: <eob> "When I become famous, <eol> I will tell everyone <eob> that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson." <eob>
Heroes rarely look like me. <eob>
In fact, <eob> I'm what garbage looks like. <eob>
No, not the most appealing <eol> way to open a talk <eob> or start a conversation, <eob> and perhaps you have some questions <eol> going through your head about that. <eob>
Why would this man say <eol> such a thing about himself? <eob> What does he mean? <eob> How can someone view him as a hero <eol> when he sees himself as garbage? <eob>
I believe we learn more from questions <eol> than we do from answers. <eob>
Because when we're questioning something, <eob> we're invested in taking in <eol> some sort of new information, <eob> or grappling with some sort of ignorance <eol> that makes us feel uncomfortable. <eob>
And that's why I'm here: <eob> to push us to question, <eob> even when it makes us uncomfortable. <eob>
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago, <eob> the southernmost island in the Caribbean. <eob>
Trinidad is also home <eol> to the only acoustic instrument <eob> invented in the 20th century: <eob> the steel pan. <eob>
Deriving from the African drums <eob> and evolving from the genius <eol> of one of the ghettos in Trinidad, <eob> a city called Laventille, <eob> and the disregard <eol> of the American military ... <eob> Well, I should tell you, <eob> America, during WWII, had <eol> military bases set up in Trinidad, <eob> and when the war ended, <eob> they left the island littered <eol> with empty oil drums -- <eob> their trash. <eob>
the steel pan. <eob> So people from Laventille <eol> repurposed the old drums left behind <eob> into the full chromatic scale: <eob>
Playing music now from Beethoven <eol> to Bob Marley to 50 Cent, <eob> those people literally made <eol> music out of garbage. <eob>
Twelve days before my 20th birthday, <eob> I was arrested for my role <eol> in a violent robbery attempt <eob> in lower Manhattan. <eob>
While people were sitting <eol> in a coffee shop, <eob> four people were shot. <eob> Two were killed. <eob> Five of us were arrested. <eob>
We were all the products <eol> of Trinidad and Tobago. <eob>
We were the "bad immigrants," <eob> or the "anchor babies" that Trump <eol> and millions of Americans easily malign. <eob>
I was discarded, like waste material -- <eob> and justifiably so to many. <eob>
I eventually served 10 years, two months <eol> and seven days of a prison sentence. <eob>
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment <eol> in a correctional institution. <eob>
I was sentenced to irrelevance -- <eob> the opposite of humanity. <eob>
Interestingly, <eob> it was during those years in prison <eol> that a series of letters redeemed me, <eob> helped me move beyond <eol> the darkness and the guilt <eob> associated with the worst <eol> moment of my young life. <eob>
It gave me a sense that I was useful. <eob>
She was 13 years old. <eob>
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero. <eob>
I remember reading that, <eob> and I remember crying <eol> when I read those words. <eob>
She was one of over 50 students <eob> and 150 letters that I wrote during <eol> a mentoring correspondence program <eob> that I co-designed with a friend <eob> who was a teacher <eol> at a middle school in Brooklyn, <eob> my hometown. <eob>
We called it the Young Scholars Program. <eob>
Every time those young people <eol> shared their stories with me, <eob> their struggles, <eob> every time they drew a picture <eol> of their favorite cartoon character <eob> and sent it to me, <eob> every time they said they depended <eol> on my letters or my words of advice, <eob> it boosted my sense of worthiness. <eob>
It gave me a sense of what <eol> I could contribute to this planet. <eob>
It transformed my life. <eob>
Because of those letters <eol> and what they shared with me, <eob> their stories of teen life, <eob> they gave me the permission, <eob> they gave me the courage <eol> to admit to myself <eob> that there were reasons -- not excuses -- <eob> but that there were reasons <eol> for that fateful day in October of 1999; <eob> that the trauma associated <eol> with living in a community <eob> where guns are easier <eol> to get than sneakers; <eob> that the trauma associated with being <eol> raped at gunpoint at the age of 14; <eob> that those are reasons for me <eob> why making that decision, <eob> that fatal decision, <eob> was not an unlikely proposition. <eob>
Because those letters <eol> mattered so much to me, <eob> because writing and receiving <eob> and having that communication <eol> with those folks <eob> so hugely impacted my life, <eob> I decided to share the opportunity <eol> with some friends of mine <eob> who were also inside with me. <eob>
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks, <eob> all in prison for violent crimes also, <eob> shared their words of wisdom <eol> with the young people as well, <eob> and received the sense <eol> of relevancy in return. <eob>
We are now published writers <eol> and youth program innovators <eob> and trauma experts <eob> and gun violence prevention advocates, <eob> and TED talkers and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and good daddies. <eob> That's what I call a positive <eol> return of investment. <eob>
Above all else, <eob> what building that program <eol> taught me was that when we sow, <eob> when we invest in the humanity <eol> of people no matter where they're at, <eob> we can reap amazing rewards. <eob>
In this latest era <eol> of criminal justice reform, <eob> I often question and wonder why -- <eob> why is it that so many believe <eob> that only those who have been convicted <eol> of nonviolent drug offenses <eob> merit empathy and recognized humanity? <eob>
Criminal justice reform is human justice. <eob>
Am I not human? <eob>
When we invest in resources <eol> that amplify the relevancy of people <eob> in communities like Laventille <eob> or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you, <eob> we can literally create <eol> the communities that we want. <eob>
We can do better. <eob> We can do better than investing solely <eol> in law enforcement as a resource, <eob> because they don't give us <eol> a sense of relevancy <eob> that is at the core of why so many of us <eol> do so many harmful things <eob> in the pursuit of mattering. <eob>
See, gun violence is just a visible <eol> display of a lot of underlying traumas. <eob>
When we invest in the redemptive <eol> value of relevancy, <eob> we can render a return of both <eol> personal responsibility and healing. <eob>
That's the people work I care about, <eob> because people work. <eob>
Family, I'm asking you <eol> to do the hard work, <eob> the difficult work, <eob> the churning work of bestowing <eol> undeserved kindness <eob> upon those who we can relegate as garbage, <eob> who we can disregard and discard easily. <eob> I'm asking myself. <eob>
Over the past two months, <eob> I've lost two friends to gun violence, <eob> both innocent bystanders. <eob>
One was caught in a drive-by <eol> while walking home. <eob>
The other was sitting in a café <eol> while eating breakfast, <eob> while on vacation in Miami. <eob>
I'm asking myself <eob> to see the redemptive value <eol> of relevancy <eob> in the people that murdered them, <eob> because of the hard work <eol> of seeing the value in me. <eob>
I'm pushing us to challenge <eol> our own capacity <eob> to fully experience our humanity, <eob> by understanding the full biography <eob> of people who we can <eol> easily choose not to see, <eob> because heroes are waiting <eol> to be recognized, <eob> and music is waiting to be made. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, imagine that you had <eol> your smartphone miniaturized <eob> and hooked up directly to your brain. <eob>
If you had this sort of brain chip, <eob> you'd be able to upload <eol> and download to the internet <eob> at the speed of thought. <eob>
Accessing social media or Wikipedia <eol> would be a lot like -- <eob> well, from the inside at least -- <eob> like consulting your own memory. <eob>
It would be as easy <eol> and as intimate as thinking. <eob>
But would it make it easier <eol> for you to know what's true? <eob>
Just because a way <eol> of accessing information is faster <eob> it doesn't mean it's more <eol> reliable, of course, <eob> and it doesn't mean that we would all <eol> interpret it the same way. <eob>
And it doesn't mean that you would be <eol> any better at evaluating it. <eob>
In fact, you might even be worse, <eob> because, you know, more data, <eol> less time for evaluation. <eob>
Something like this is already <eol> happening to us right now. <eob>
We already carry a world of information <eol> around in our pockets, <eob> but it seems as if the more information <eol> we share and access online, <eob> the more difficult it can be for us <eol> to tell the difference <eob> between what's real and what's fake. <eob>
It's as if we know more <eol> but understand less. <eob>
Now, it's a feature <eol> of modern life, I suppose, <eob> that large swaths of the public <eol> live in isolated information bubbles. <eob>
We're polarized: not just over values, <eol> but over the facts. <eob>
One reason for that is, the data <eol> analytics that drive the internet <eob> get us not just more information, <eob> but more of the information that we want. <eob>
Our online life is personalized; <eob> everything from the ads we read <eob> to the news that comes down <eol> our Facebook feed <eob> is tailored to satisfy our preferences. <eob>
And so while we get more information, <eob> a lot of that information ends up <eol> reflecting ourselves <eob> as much as it does reality. <eob>
It ends up, I suppose, <eob> inflating our bubbles <eol> rather than bursting them. <eob>
And so maybe it's no surprise <eob> that we're in a situation, <eol> a paradoxical situation, <eob> of thinking that we know so much more, <eob> and yet not agreeing <eol> on what it is we know. <eob>
So how are we going to solve this problem <eol> of knowledge polarization? <eob>
One obvious tactic is to try <eol> to fix our technology, <eob> to redesign our digital platforms, <eob> so as to make them less <eol> susceptible to polarization. <eob>
And I'm happy to report <eob> that many smart people at Google <eol> and Facebook are working on just that. <eob>
And these projects are vital. <eob>
I think that fixing technology <eol> is obviously really important, <eob> but I don't think technology alone, <eol> fixing it, is going to solve the problem <eob> of knowledge polarization. <eob>
I don't think that because I don't think, <eol> at the end of the day, <eob> it is a technological problem. <eob>
I think it's a human problem, <eob> having to do with how we think <eol> and what we value. <eob>
In order to solve it, I think <eol> we're going to need help. <eob>
We're going to need help <eol> from psychology and political science. <eob>
But we're also going to need help, <eol> I think, from philosophy. <eob>
Because to solve the problem <eob> of knowledge polarization, <eob> we're going to need to reconnect <eob> with one fundamental, philosophical idea: <eob> that we live in a common reality. <eob>
The idea of a common reality <eol> is like, I suppose, <eob> a lot of philosophical concepts: <eob> easy to state <eob> but mysteriously difficult <eol> to put into practice. <eob>
To really accept it, <eob> I think we need to do three things, <eob> each of which is a challenge right now. <eob>
First, we need to believe in truth. <eob>
You might have noticed <eob> that our culture is having <eol> something of a troubled relationship <eob> with that concept right now. <eob>
It seems as if we disagree so much that, <eob> as one political commentator <eol> put it not long ago, <eob> it's as if there are no facts anymore. <eob>
But that thought is actually an expression <eob> of a sort of seductive line <eol> of argument that's in the air. <eob>
It goes like this: <eob> we just can't step outside <eol> of our own perspectives; <eob> we can't step outside of our biases. <eob>
Every time we try, <eob> we just get more information <eol> from our perspective. <eob>
So, this line of thought goes, <eob> we might as well admit <eol> that objective truth is an illusion, <eob> or it doesn't matter, <eob> because either we'll never <eol> know what it is, <eob> or it doesn't exist in the first place. <eob>
That's not a new philosophical thought -- <eob> skepticism about truth. <eob>
During the end of the last century, <eol> as some of you know, <eob> it was very popular in certain <eol> academic circles. <eob>
But it really goes back all the way <eol> to the Greek philosopher Protagoras, <eob> if not farther back. <eob>
Protagoras said that objective <eol> truth was an illusion <eob> because "man is the measure <eol> of all things." <eob> Man is the measure of all things. <eob>
That can seem like a bracing bit <eol> of realpolitik to people, <eob> or liberating, <eob> because it allows each of us <eol> to discover or make our own truth. <eob>
But actually, I think it's a bit <eol> of self-serving rationalization <eob> disguised as philosophy. <eob>
It confuses the difficulty <eol> of being certain <eob> with the impossibility of truth. <eob>
Look -- <eob> of course it's difficult <eol> to be certain about anything; <eob> we might all be living in "The Matrix." <eob> You might have a brain chip in your head <eob> feeding you all the wrong information. <eob>
But in practice, we do agree <eol> on all sorts of facts. <eob>
We agree that bullets can kill people. <eob>
We agree that you can't flap <eol> your arms and fly. <eob>
We agree -- or we should -- <eob> that there is an external reality <eob> and ignoring it can get you hurt. <eob>
Nonetheless, <eob> skepticism about truth <eob> can be tempting, <eob> because it allows us to rationalize <eol> away our own biases. <eob>
When we do that, we're sort of like <eol> the guy in the movie <eob> who knew he was living in "The Matrix" <eob> but decided he liked it there, anyway. <eob>
After all, getting what you <eol> want feels good. <eob>
Being right all the time feels good. <eob>
So, often it's easier for us <eob> to wrap ourselves in our cozy <eol> information bubbles, <eob> live in bad faith, <eob> and take those bubbles <eol> as the measure of reality. <eob>
An example, I think, of how <eol> this bad faith gets into our action <eob> is our reaction <eol> to the phenomenon of fake news. <eob>
The fake news that spread on the internet <eob> during the American <eol> presidential election of 2016 <eob> was designed to feed into our biases, <eob> designed to inflate our bubbles. <eob>
But what was really striking about it <eob> was not just that it fooled <eol> so many people. <eob>
What was really striking to me <eol> about fake news, <eob> the phenomenon, <eob> is how quickly it itself became the subject <eob> of knowledge polarization; <eob> so much so, that the very term — the very term — "fake news" <eob> now just means: "news story <eol> I don't like." <eob> That's an example of the bad faith <eol> towards the truth that I'm talking about. <eob>
Man is the measure of all things. <eob> But the really, I think, dangerous thing <eob> about skepticism with regard to truth <eob> is that it leads to despotism. <eob> inevitably becomes "The Man <eol> is the measure of all things." <eob> Just as "every man for himself" <eob> always seems to turn out to be <eol> "only the strong survive." <eob>
At the end of Orwell's "1984," <eob> the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing <eol> the protagonist Winston Smith <eob> into believing two plus two equals five. <eob>
What O'Brien says is the point, <eob> is that he wants to convince Smith <eol> that whatever the party says is the truth, <eob> and the truth is whatever the party says. <eob>
And what O'Brien knows <eol> is that once this thought is accepted, <eob> critical dissent is impossible. <eob>
You can't speak truth to power <eob> if the power speaks truth by definition. <eob>
I said that in order to accept <eol> that we really live in a common reality, <eob> we have to do three things. <eob>
The first thing is to believe in truth. <eob>
The second thing can be summed up <eob> by the Latin phrase that Kant took <eol> as the motto for the Enlightenment: <eob> "Sapere aude," <eob> or "dare to know." <eob> Or as Kant wants, <eol> "to dare to know for yourself." <eob>
I think in the early days of the internet, <eob> a lot of us thought <eob> that information technology <eol> was always going to make it easier <eob> for us to know for ourselves, <eob> and of course in many ways, it has. <eob>
But as the internet has become <eol> more and more a part of our lives, <eob> our reliance on it, our use of it, <eob> has become often more passive. <eob>
Much of what we know today we Google-know. <eob>
We download prepackaged sets of facts <eob> and sort of shuffle them along <eol> the assembly line of social media. <eob>
Now, Google-knowing is useful <eob> precisely because it involves <eol> a sort of intellectual outsourcing. <eob>
We offload our effort onto a network <eol> of others and algorithms. <eob>
And that allows us, of course, <eol> to not clutter our minds <eob> with all sorts of facts. <eob>
We can just download them <eol> when we need them. <eob> And that's awesome. <eob>
But there's a difference <eol> between downloading a set of facts <eob> and really understanding how or why <eol> those facts are as they are. <eob>
Understanding why <eol> a particular disease spreads, <eob> or how a mathematical proof works, <eob> or why your friend is depressed, <eob> involves more than just downloading. <eob>
It's going to require, most likely, <eob> doing some work for yourself: <eob> having a little creative insight; <eob> using your imagination; <eob> getting out into the field; <eob> doing the experiment; <eob> working through the proof; <eob> talking to someone. <eob>
Now, I'm not saying, of course, <eol> that we should stop Google-knowing. <eob> I'm just saying <eob> we shouldn't overvalue it, either. <eob>
We need to find ways of encouraging <eol> forms of knowing that are more active, <eob> and don't always involve passing off <eol> our effort into our bubble. <eob>
Because the thing about Google-knowing <eol> is that too often it ends up <eob> being bubble-knowing. <eob>
And bubble-knowing means <eol> always being right. <eob>
But daring to know, <eob> daring to understand, <eob> means risking the possibility <eol> that you could be wrong. <eob>
It means risking the possibility <eob> that what you want and what's true <eol> are different things. <eob>
Which brings me to the third thing <eol> that I think we need to do <eob> if we want to accept <eob> that we live in a common reality. <eob>
That third thing is: <eol> have a little humility. <eob>
By humility here, I mean <eol> epistemic humility, <eob> which means, in a sense, <eob> knowing that you don't know it all. <eob>
But it also means something <eol> more than that. <eob>
It means seeing your worldview <eol> as open to improvement <eob> by the evidence and experience of others. <eob>
by the evidence and experience of others. <eob> Seeing your worldview <eol> as open to improvement <eob>
That's more than just <eol> being open to change. <eob> It's more than just being open <eol> to self-improvement. <eob>
It means seeing your knowledge <eol> as capable of enhancing <eob> or being enriched <eol> by what others contribute. <eob>
That's part of what is involved <eob> in recognizing there's a common reality <eob> that you, too, are responsible to. <eob>
I don't think it's much <eol> of a stretch to say <eob> that our society is not particularly great <eol> at enhancing or encouraging <eob> that sort of humility. <eob>
That's partly because, <eob> well, we tend to confuse <eol> arrogance and confidence. <eob>
And it's partly because, well, you know, <eob> arrogance is just easier. <eob>
It's just easier to think of yourself <eol> as knowing it all. <eob>
It's just easier to think of yourself <eol> as having it all figured out. <eob>
But that's another example <eol> of the bad faith towards the truth <eob> that I've been talking about. <eob>
So the concept of a common reality, <eob> like <eob> a lot of philosophical concepts, <eob> can seem so obvious, <eob> that we can look right past it <eob> and forget why it's important. <eob>
Democracies can't function <eol> if their citizens don't strive, <eob> at least some of the time, <eob> to inhabit a common space, <eob> a space where they can pass <eol> ideas back and forth <eob> when -- and especially when -- <eob> they disagree. <eob>
But you can't strive to inhabit that space <eob> if you don't already accept <eol> that you live in the same reality. <eob>
To accept that, we've got <eol> to believe in truth, <eob> we've got to encourage <eol> more active ways of knowing. <eob>
And we've got to have the humility <eob> to realize that we're not <eol> the measure of all things. <eob>
We may yet one day realize the vision <eob> of having the internet in our brains. <eob>
But if we want that to be liberating <eol> and not terrifying, <eob> if we want it to expand our understanding <eob> and not just our passive knowing, <eob> we need to remember that our perspectives, <eob> as wondrous, as beautiful as they are, <eob> are just that -- <eob> perspectives on one reality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine that when you walked <eol> in here this evening, <eob> you discovered that everybody in the room <eol> looked almost exactly the same: <eob> ageless, raceless, <eob> generically good-looking. <eob>
That person sitting right next to you <eob> might have the most <eol> idiosyncratic inner life, <eob> but you don't have a clue <eob> because we're all wearing <eol> the same blank expression all the time. <eob>
That is the kind of creepy transformation <eol> that is taking over cities, <eob> only it applies to buildings, not people. <eob>
Cities are full of roughness and shadow, <eob> texture and color. <eob>
You can still find architectural surfaces <eol> of great individuality and character <eob> in apartment buildings in Riga <eob> and Yemen, <eob> social housing in Vienna, <eob> Hopi villages in Arizona, <eob> brownstones in New York, <eob> wooden houses in San Francisco. <eob>
These aren't palaces or cathedrals. <eob>
These are just ordinary residences <eob> expressing the ordinary <eol> splendor of cities. <eob>
And the reason they're like that <eol> is that the need for shelter <eob> is so bound up with <eol> the human desire for beauty. <eob>
Their rough surfaces <eol> give us a touchable city. <eob> Right? Streets that you can read <eob> by running your fingers <eol> over brick and stone. <eob>
But that's getting harder to do, <eob> because cities are becoming smooth. <eob>
New downtowns sprout towers <eob> that are almost always <eol> made of concrete and steel <eob> and covered in glass. <eob>
You can look at skylines <eol> all over the world -- <eob> Houston, <eob> Guangzhou, <eob> Frankfurt -- <eob> and you see the same army <eol> of high-gloss robots <eob> marching over the horizon. <eob>
Now, just think of everything we lose <eob> when architects stop using <eol> the full range of available materials. <eob>
When we reject granite and limestone <eol> and sandstone <eob> and wood and copper <eol> and terra-cotta and brick <eob> and wattle and plaster, <eob> we simplify architecture <eob> and we impoverish cities. <eob>
It's as if you reduced <eol> all of the world's cuisines <eob> down to airline food. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Chicken or pasta? <eob>
But worse still, <eob> assemblies of glass towers <eol> like this one in Moscow <eob> suggest a disdain for the civic <eol> and communal aspects of urban living. <eob> Right? Buildings like these are intended <eol> to enrich their owners and tenants, <eob> but not necessarily <eol> the lives of the rest of us, <eob> those of us who navigate <eol> the spaces between the buildings. <eob>
And we expect to do so for free. <eob>
Shiny towers are an invasive species <eob> and they are choking our cities <eol> and killing off public space. <eob>
We tend to think of a facade <eol> as being like makeup, <eob> a decorative layer applied at the end <eol> to a building that's effectively complete. <eob>
But just because a facade is superficial <eob> doesn't mean it's not also deep. <eob>
Let me give you an example <eob> of how a city's surfaces <eol> affect the way we live in it. <eob>
When I visited Salamanca in Spain, <eob> I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor <eob> at all hours of the day. <eob>
Early in the morning, <eol> sunlight rakes the facades, <eob> sharpening shadows, <eob> and at night, lamplight <eol> segments the buildings <eob> into hundreds of distinct areas, <eob> balconies and windows and arcades, <eob> each one a separate pocket <eol> of visual activity. <eob>
That detail and depth, that glamour <eob> gives the plaza a theatrical quality. <eob>
It becomes a stage <eol> where the generations can meet. <eob>
You have teenagers <eol> sprawling on the pavers, <eob> seniors monopolizing the benches, <eob> and real life starts to look <eol> like an opera set. <eob>
The curtain goes up on Salamanca. <eob>
So just because I'm talking <eol> about the exteriors of buildings, <eob> not form, not function, not structure, <eob> even so those surfaces <eol> give texture to our lives, <eob> because buildings <eol> create the spaces around them, <eob> and those spaces can draw people in <eob> or push them away. <eob>
And the difference often has to do <eol> with the quality of those exteriors. <eob>
So one contemporary equivalent <eol> of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca <eob> is the Place de la Défense in Paris, <eob> a windswept, glass-walled open space <eob> that office workers hurry through <eob> on the way from the metro <eol> to their cubicles <eob> but otherwise spend <eol> as little time in as possible. <eob>
In the early 1980s, <eol> the architect Philip Johnson <eob> tried to recreate a gracious <eol> European plaza in Pittsburgh. <eob>
This is PPG Place, <eob> a half acre of open space <eol> encircled by commercial buildings <eob> made of mirrored glass. <eob>
And he ornamented those buildings <eol> with metal trim and bays <eob> and Gothic turrets <eob> which really pop on the skyline. <eob>
But at ground level, <eob> the plaza feels like a black glass cage. <eob>
I mean, sure, in summertime <eob> kids are running back and forth <eol> through the fountain <eob> and there's ice-skating in the winter, <eob> but it lacks the informality <eol> of a leisurely hangout. <eob>
It's just not the sort of place <eol> you really want to just hang out and chat. <eob>
Public spaces thrive or fail <eol> for many different reasons. <eob>
Architecture is only one, <eob> but it's an important one. <eob>
Some recent plazas <eob> like Federation Square in Melbourne <eob> or Superkilen in Copenhagen <eob> succeed because they combine old and new, <eob> rough and smooth, <eob> neutral and bright colors, <eob> and because they don't rely <eol> excessively on glass. <eob>
Now, I'm not against glass. <eob>
It's an ancient and versatile material. <eob>
It's easy to manufacture and transport <eob> and install and replace <eob> and clean. <eob>
It comes in everything <eol> from enormous, ultraclear sheets <eob> to translucent bricks. <eob>
New coatings make it change mood <eob> in the shifting light. <eob>
In expensive cities like New York, <eol> it has the magical power <eob> of being able to multiply <eol> real estate values by allowing views, <eob> which is really the only commodity <eol> that developers have to offer <eob> to justify those surreal prices. <eob>
In the middle of the 19th century, <eob> with the construction <eol> of the Crystal Palace in London, <eob> glass leapt to the top of the list <eol> of quintessentially modern substances. <eob>
By the mid-20th century, <eob> it had come to dominate <eol> the downtowns of some American cities, <eob> largely through some <eol> really spectacular office buildings <eob> like Lever House in midtown Manhattan, <eol> designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. <eob>
Eventually, the technology <eol> advanced to the point <eob> where architects could design <eol> structures so transparent <eob> they practically disappear. <eob>
And along the way, <eob> glass became the default material <eol> of the high-rise city, <eob> and there's a very <eol> powerful reason for that. <eob>
Because as the world's populations <eol> converge on cities, <eob> the least fortunate pack <eol> into jerry-built shantytowns. <eob>
But hundreds of millions of people <eol> need apartments and places to work <eob> in ever-larger buildings, <eob> so it makes economic sense <eol> to put up towers <eob> and wrap them in cheap <eol> and practical curtain walls. <eob>
But glass has a limited ability <eob> to be expressive. <eob>
This is a section of wall framing a plaza <eob> in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla, <eol> in southern Mexico. <eob>
Those 2,000-year-old carvings <eob> make it clear that this was a place <eol> of high ritual significance. <eob>
Today we look at those and we can see <eol> a historical and textural continuity <eob> between those carvings, <eol> the mountains all around <eob> and that church which is built <eol> on top of the ruins <eob> using stone plundered from the site. <eob>
In nearby Oaxaca, <eol> even ordinary plaster buildings <eob> become canvasses for <eol> bright colors, political murals <eob> and sophisticated graphic arts. <eob>
It's an intricate, communicative language <eob> that an epidemic of glass <eol> would simply wipe out. <eob>
The good news is <eol> that architects and developers <eob> have begun to rediscover <eol> the joys of texture <eob> without backing away from modernity. <eob>
Some find innovative uses <eol> for old materials like brick <eob> and terra-cotta. <eob>
Others invent new products <eol> like the molded panels that Snøhetta used <eob> to give the San Francisco <eol> Museum of Modern Art <eob> that crinkly, sculptural quality. <eob>
The architect Stefano Boeri <eol> even created living facades. <eob>
This is his Vertical Forest, <eol> a pair of apartment towers in Milan, <eob> whose most visible feature is greenery. <eob>
And Boeri is designing a version of this <eol> for Nanjing in China. <eob>
And imagine if green facades <eol> were as ubiquitous as glass ones <eob> how much cleaner the air <eol> in Chinese cities would become. <eob>
But the truth is <eol> that these are mostly one-offs, <eob> boutique projects, <eob> not easily reproduced at a global scale. <eob>
And that is the point. <eob> When you use materials <eol> that have a local significance, <eob> you prevent cities <eol> from all looking the same. <eob>
Copper has a long history in New York — <eob> the Statue of Liberty, <eob> the crown of the Woolworth Building — <eob> but it fell out of fashion <eol> for a long time <eob> until SHoP Architects used it to cover <eol> the American Copper Building, <eob> a pair of twisting towers <eol> on the East River. <eob>
It's not even finished <eob> and you can see the way <eol> sunset lights up that metallic facade, <eob> which will weather to green as it ages. <eob>
Buildings can be like people. <eob>
Their faces broadcast their experience. <eob>
And that's an important point, <eob> because when glass ages, <eob> you just replace it, <eob> and the building looks <eol> pretty much the same way it did before <eob> until eventually it's demolished. <eob>
Almost all other materials <eol> have the ability <eob> to absorb infusions of history and memory, <eob> and project it into the present. <eob>
The firm Ennead <eob> clad the Utah Natural History Museum <eol> in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc, <eob> ores that have been mined <eol> in the area for 150 years <eob> and that also camouflage the building <eol> against the ochre hills <eob> so that you have a natural history museum <eob> that reflects the region's <eol> natural history. <eob>
And when the Chinese <eol> Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu <eob> was building a history museum in Ningbo, <eob> he didn't just create <eol> a wrapper for the past, <eob> he built memory right into the walls <eob> by using brick and stones and shingles <eob> salvaged from villages <eol> that had been demolished. <eob>
Now, architects can use glass <eob> in equally lyrical and inventive ways. <eob>
Here in New York, two buildings, <eob> one by Jean Nouvel <eol> and this one by Frank Gehry <eob> face off across West 19th Street, <eob> and the play of reflections <eol> that they toss back and forth <eob> is like a symphony in light. <eob>
But when a city defaults to glass <eob> as it grows, <eob> it becomes a hall of mirrors, <eob> disquieting and cold. <eob>
After all, cities are places <eol> of concentrated variety <eob> where the world's cultures <eol> and languages and lifestyles <eob> come together and mingle. <eob>
So rather than encase all that variety <eob> and diversity in buildings <eol> of crushing sameness, <eob> we should have an architecture that honors <eol> the full range of the urban experience. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Paying close attention to something: <eob> Not that easy, is it? <eob>
It's because our attention is pulled <eol> in so many different directions at a time, <eob> and it's in fact pretty impressive <eol> if you can stay focused. <eob>
Many people think that attention <eol> is all about what we are focusing on, <eob> but it's also about what information <eol> our brain is trying to filter out. <eob>
There are two ways <eol> you direct your attention. <eob>
First, there's overt attention. <eob>
In overt attention, <eol> you move your eyes towards something <eob> in order to pay attention to it. <eob>
Then there's covert attention. <eob>
In covert attention, <eol> you pay attention to something, <eob> but without moving your eyes. <eob>
Think of driving for a second. <eob>
Your overt attention, <eol> your direction of the eyes, <eob> are in front, <eob> but that's your covert attention <eob> which is constantly scanning <eol> the surrounding area, <eob> where you don't actually look at them. <eob>
I'm a computational neuroscientist, <eob> and I work on cognitive <eol> brain-machine interfaces, <eob> or bringing together <eol> the brain and the computer. <eob>
I love brain patterns. <eob>
Brain patterns are important for us <eob> because based on them <eol> we can build models for the computers, <eob> and based on these models <eob> computers can recognize <eol> how well our brain functions. <eob>
And if it doesn't function well, <eob> then these computers themselves <eol> can be used as assistive devices <eob> for therapies. <eob>
But that also means something, <eob> because choosing the wrong patterns <eob> will give us the wrong models <eob> and therefore the wrong therapies. <eob> Right? <eob> In case of attention, <eob> the fact that we can <eob> shift our attention not only by our eyes <eob> but also by thinking -- <eob> that makes covert attention <eol> an interesting model for computers. <eob>
So I wanted to know <eol> what are the brainwave patterns <eob> when you look overtly <eol> or when you look covertly. <eob>
I set up an experiment for that. <eob>
In this experiment <eol> there are two flickering squares, <eob> one of them flickering <eol> at a slower rate than the other one. <eob>
Depending on which of these flickers <eol> you are paying attention to, <eob> certain parts of your brain <eol> will start resonating in the same rate <eob> as that flickering rate. <eob>
So by analyzing your brain signals, <eob> we can track where exactly <eol> you are watching <eob> or you are paying attention to. <eob>
So to see what happens in your brain <eol> when you pay overt attention, <eob> I asked people to look directly <eol> in one of the squares <eob> and pay attention to it. <eob>
In this case, not surprisingly, <eol> we saw that these flickering squares <eob> appeared in their brain signals <eob> which was coming <eol> from the back of their head, <eob> which is responsible for the processing <eol> of your visual information. <eob>
But I was really interested <eob> to see what happens in your brain <eol> when you pay covert attention. <eob>
So this time I asked people <eol> to look in the middle of the screen <eob> and without moving their eyes, <eob> to pay attention <eol> to either of these squares. <eob>
When we did that, <eob> we saw that both of these flickering rates <eob> appeared in their brain signals, <eob> but interestingly, <eob> only one of them, which was paid attention to, <eob> had stronger signals, <eob> so there was something in the brain <eob> which was handling this information <eob> so that thing in the brain <eol> was basically the activation of the frontal area. <eob>
The front part of your brain <eol> is responsible <eob> for higher cognitive functions as a human. <eob>
The frontal part, <eol> it seems that it works as a filter <eob> trying to let information come in <eol> only from the right flicker <eob> that you are paying attention to <eob> and trying to inhibit the information <eol> coming from the ignored one. <eob>
The filtering ability of the brain <eol> is indeed a key for attention, <eob> which is missing in some people, <eob> for example in people with ADHD. <eob>
So a person with ADHD <eol> cannot inhibit these distractors, <eob> and that's why they can't focus <eol> for a long time on a single task. <eob>
But what if this person <eob> could play a specific computer game <eob> with his brain connected to the computer, <eob> and then train his own brain <eob> to inhibit these distractors? <eob>
Well, ADHD is just one example. <eob>
We can use these cognitive <eol> brain-machine interfaces <eob> for many other cognitive fields. <eob>
It was just a few years ago <eob> that my grandfather had a stroke, <eol> and he lost complete ability to speak. <eob>
He could understand everybody, <eol> but there was no way to respond, <eob> even not writing <eol> because he was illiterate. <eob>
So he passed away in silence. <eob>
I remember thinking at that time: <eob> What if we could have a computer <eob> which could speak for him? <eob> Now, after years that I am in this field, <eob> I can see that this might be possible. <eob>
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns <eob> when people think <eol> about images or even letters, <eob> like the letter A generates <eol> a different brainwave pattern <eob> than the letter B, and so on. <eob> Could a computer one day <eol> communicate for people who can't speak? <eob>
What if a computer <eob> can help us understand <eol> the thoughts of a person in a coma? <eob>
We are not there yet, <eob> but pay close attention. <eob>
We will be there soon. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, this happy pic of me <eol> was taken in 1999. <eob>
I was a senior in college, <eob> and it was right after a dance practice. <eob>
I was really, really happy. <eob>
And I remember exactly where I was <eol> about a week and a half later. <eob>
I was sitting in the back <eol> of my used minivan <eob> in a campus parking lot, <eob> when I decided <eob> I was going to commit suicide. <eob>
I went from deciding <eol> to full-blown planning very quickly. <eob>
And I came this close <eol> to the edge of the precipice. <eob>
It's the closest I've ever come. <eob>
And the only reason I took <eol> my finger off the trigger <eob> was thanks to a few lucky coincidences. <eob>
And after the fact, <eob> that's what scared me the most: <eol> the element of chance. <eob>
So I became very methodical <eol> about testing different ways <eob> that I could manage my ups and downs, <eob> which has proven to be <eol> a good investment. (Laughs) <eob> Many normal people might have, <eol> say, six to 10 major depressive episodes <eob> in their lives. <eob>
I have bipolar depression. <eob>
It runs in my family. <eob>
I've had 50-plus at this point, <eob> and I've learned a lot. <eob>
I've had a lot of at-bats, <eob> many rounds in the ring with darkness, <eob> taking good notes. <eob>
So I thought rather than get up <eol> and give any type of recipe for success <eob> or highlight reel, <eob> I would share my recipe <eol> for avoiding self-destruction, <eob> and certainly self-paralysis. <eob>
And the tool I've found which has proven <eol> to be the most reliable safety net <eob> for emotional free fall <eob> is actually the same tool <eob> that has helped me to make <eol> my best business decisions. <eob>
But that is secondary. <eob>
And it is ... stoicism. <eob> That sounds boring. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You might think of Spock, <eob> or it might conjure and image like this -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a cow standing in the rain. <eob>
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy. <eob>
It's just an impassive creature taking <eol> whatever life sends its way. <eob>
You might not think of the ultimate <eol> competitor, say, Bill Belichick, <eob> head coach of the New England Patriots, <eob> who has the all-time NFL record <eol> for Super Bowl titles. <eob>
And stoicism has spread like wildfire <eol> in the top of the NFL ranks <eob> as a means of mental toughness <eol> training in the last few years. <eob>
You might not think <eol> of the Founding Fathers -- <eob> Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, <eol> George Washington <eob> to name but three students of stoicism. <eob>
George Washington actually had <eol> a play about a Stoic -- <eob> this was "Cato, a Tragedy" -- <eob> performed for his troops at Valley Forge <eol> to keep them motivated. <eob>
So why would people of action <eol> focus so much on an ancient philosophy? <eob>
This seems very academic. <eob>
I would encourage you to think <eol> about stoicism a little bit differently, <eob> as an operating system for thriving <eol> in high-stress environments, <eob> for making better decisions. <eob>
And it all started here, <eob> kind of, <eob> on a porch. <eob>
So around 300 BC in Athens, <eob> someone named Zeno of Citium <eol> taught many lectures <eob> walking around a painted porch, a "stoa." <eob> That later became "stoicism." <eob> And in the Greco-Roman world, <eob> people used stoicism <eol> as a comprehensive system <eob> for doing many, many things. <eob>
But for our purposes, chief among them <eol> was training yourself <eob> to separate what you can control <eol> from what you cannot control, <eob> and then doing exercises <eol> to focus exclusively <eob> on the former. <eob>
This decreases emotional reactivity, <eob> which can be a superpower. <eob>
Conversely, let's say <eol> you're a quarterback. <eob>
You miss a pass. <eol> You get furious with yourself. <eob> That could cost you a game. <eob>
If you're a CEO, and you fly <eol> off the handle at a very valued employee <eob> because of a minor infraction, <eob> that could cost you the employee. <eob>
If you're a college student <eol> who, say, is in a downward spiral, <eob> and you feel helpless and hopeless, <eob> unabated, that could cost you your life. <eob>
So the stakes are very, very high. <eob>
And there are many tools <eol> in the toolkit to get you there. <eob>
I'm going to focus on one <eol> that completely changed my life in 2004. <eob>
It found me then because of two things: <eob> a very close friend, young guy, my age, <eol> died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly, <eob> and then my girlfriend, who I thought <eol> I was going to marry, walked out. <eob>
She'd had enough, and she didn't <eol> give me a Dear John letter, <eob> but she did give me this, <eob> a Dear John plaque. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm not making this up. I've kept it. <eob> "Business hours are over at five o'clock." <eob> She gave this to me <eol> to put on my desk for personal health, <eob> because at the time, I was working <eol> on my first real business. <eob>
I had no idea what I was doing. <eob>
I was working 14-plus hour days, <eob> seven days a week. <eob>
I was using stimulants to get going. <eob> I was using depressants <eol> to wind down and go to sleep. <eob>
It was a disaster. <eob>
I felt completely trapped. <eob>
I bought a book on simplicity <eol> to try to find answers. <eob>
And I did find a quote that made <eol> a big difference in my life, <eob> which was, "We suffer more often <eol> in imagination than in reality," <eob> by Seneca the Younger, <eob> who was a famous Stoic writer. <eob>
That took me to his letters, <eob> which took me to the exercise, <eob> "premeditatio malorum," <eob> which means the pre-meditation of evils. <eob>
In simple terms, <eob> this is visualizing the worst-case <eol> scenarios, in detail, that you fear, <eob> preventing you from taking action, <eob> so that you can take action <eol> to overcome that paralysis. <eob>
My problem was monkey mind -- <eol> super loud, very incessant. <eob>
Just thinking my way <eol> through problems doesn't work. <eob>
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper. <eob>
So I created a written exercise <eob> that I called "fear-setting," <eol> like goal-setting, <eob> for myself. <eob>
It consists of three pages. <eob> Super simple. <eob>
The first page is right here. <eob> "What if I ...?" <eob> This is whatever you fear, <eob> whatever is causing you anxiety, <eob> whatever you're putting off. <eob>
It could be asking someone out, <eob> ending a relationship, <eob> asking for a promotion, <eol> quitting a job, starting a company. <eob> It could be anything. <eob> For me, it was taking <eol> my first vacation in four years <eob> and stepping away from my business <eol> for a month to go to London, <eob> where I could stay <eol> in a friend's room for free, <eob> to either remove myself <eol> as a bottleneck in the business <eob> or shut it down. <eob>
In the first column, "Define," <eob> you're writing down all of the worst <eol> things you can imagine happening <eob> if you take that step. <eob>
You want 10 to 20. <eob>
I won't go through all of them, <eol> but I'll give you two examples. <eob>
One was, I'll go to London, <eol> it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed, <eob> the whole thing will be <eol> a huge waste of time. <eob>
Number two, I'll miss <eol> a letter from the IRS, <eob> and I'll get audited <eob> or raided or shut down or some such. <eob>
And then you go to the "Prevent" column. <eob>
In that column, you write <eol> down the answer to: <eob> What could I do to prevent <eol> each of these bullets from happening, <eob> or, at the very least, decrease <eol> the likelihood even a little bit? <eob>
So for getting depressed in London, <eob> I could take a portable blue light with me <eob> and use it for 15 minutes in the morning. <eob>
I knew that helped stave off <eol> depressive episodes. <eob>
For the IRS bit, I could change <eol> the mailing address on file with the IRS <eob> so the paperwork would go to my accountant <eob> instead of to my UPS address. <eob> Easy-peasy. <eob>
Then we go to "Repair." <eob> So if the worst-case scenarios happen, <eob> what could you do to repair <eol> the damage even a little bit, <eob> or who could you ask for help? <eob>
So in the first case, London, <eob> well, I could fork over some money, <eol> fly to Spain, get some sun -- <eob> undo the damage, if I got into a funk. <eob>
In the case of missing <eol> a letter from the IRS, <eob> I could call a friend who is a lawyer <eob> or ask, say, a professor of law <eob> what they would recommend, <eob> who I should talk to, <eol> how had people handled this in the past. <eob>
So one question to keep in mind <eol> as you're doing this first page is: <eob> Has anyone else in the history of time <eob> less intelligent or less driven <eob> figured this out? <eob>
Chances are, the answer is "Yes." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The second page is simple: <eob> What might be the benefits <eol> of an attempt or a partial success? <eob>
You can see we're playing up the fears <eob> and really taking a conservative <eol> look at the upside. <eob>
So if you attempted whatever <eol> you're considering, <eob> might you build confidence, <eol> develop skills, <eob> emotionally, financially, otherwise? <eob>
What might be the benefits <eol> of, say, a base hit? <eob>
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this. <eob>
Page three. <eob> This might be the most important, <eol> so don't skip it: <eob> "The Cost of Inaction." <eob> Humans are very good at considering <eol> what might go wrong <eob> if we try something new, <eol> say, ask for a raise. <eob>
What we don't often consider <eol> is the atrocious cost of the status quo -- <eob> not changing anything. <eob>
So you should ask yourself, <eob> if I avoid this action or decision <eob> and actions and decisions like it, <eob> what might my life look like in, <eol> say, six months, 12 months, three years? <eob>
Any further out, it starts <eol> to seem intangible. <eob>
And really get detailed -- <eol> again, emotionally, financially, <eob> physically, whatever. <eob>
And when I did this, it painted <eol> a terrifying picture. <eob>
I was self-medicating, <eob> my business was going to implode <eol> at any moment at all times, <eob> if I didn't step away. <eob>
My relationships were fraying or failing. <eob>
And I realized that inaction <eol> was no longer an option for me. <eob>
Those are the three pages. That's it. <eol> That's fear-setting. <eob> And after this, I realized <eol> that on a scale of one to 10, <eob> one being minimal impact, <eol> 10 being maximal impact, <eob> if I took the trip, I was risking <eob> a one to three of temporary <eol> and reversible pain <eob> for an eight to 10 of positive, <eol> life-changing impact <eob> that could be a semi-permanent. <eob>
So I took the trip. <eob>
None of the disasters came to pass. <eob>
There were some hiccups, sure. <eob>
I was able to extricate myself <eol> from the business. <eob>
I ended up extending that trip <eol> for a year and a half around the world, <eob> and that became the basis <eol> for my first book, <eob> that leads me here today. <eob>
And I can trace all of my biggest wins <eob> and all of my biggest disasters averted <eob> back to doing fear-setting <eob> at least once a quarter. <eob>
It's not a panacea. <eob>
You'll find that some of your fears <eol> are very well-founded. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But you shouldn't conclude that <eob> without first putting them <eol> under a microscope. <eob>
And it doesn't make all the hard times, <eol> the hard choices, easy, <eob> but it can make a lot of them easier. <eob>
I'd like to close with a profile <eol> of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics. <eob> This is Jerzy Gregorek. <eob> He is a four-time world champion <eol> in Olympic weightlifting, <eob> political refugee, <eob> published poet, <eob> 62 years old. <eob>
He can still kick my ass and probably <eol> most asses in this room. <eob> He's an impressive guy. <eob>
I spent a lot of time <eol> on his stoa, his porch, <eob> asking life and training advice. <eob>
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland, <eob> which was a nonviolent <eol> movement for social change <eob> that was violently suppressed <eol> by the government. <eob>
He lost his career as a firefighter. <eob>
Then his mentor, a priest, <eol> was kidnapped, tortured, killed <eob> and thrown into a river. <eob>
He was then threatened. <eob>
He and his wife had to flee Poland, <eol> bounce from country to country <eob> until they landed in the US <eol> with next to nothing, <eob> sleeping on floors. <eob>
He now lives in Woodside, California, <eol> in a very nice place, <eob> and of the 10,000-plus people <eol> I've met in my life, <eob> I would put him in the top 10, <eob> in terms of success and happiness. <eob>
And there's a punchline coming, <eol> so pay attention. <eob>
I sent him a text a few weeks ago, <eob> asking him: Had he ever read <eol> any Stoic philosophy? <eob>
And he replied with two pages of text. <eob>
This is very unlike him. <eol> He is a terse dude. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And not only was he familiar <eol> with stoicism, <eob> but he pointed out, for all <eol> of his most important decisions, <eob> his inflection points, <eob> when he stood up <eol> for his principles and ethics, <eob> how he had used stoicism <eol> and something akin to fear-setting, <eob> which blew my mind. <eob>
And he closed with two things. <eob>
Number one: he couldn't imagine <eol> any life more beautiful <eob> than that of a Stoic. <eob>
And the last was his mantra, <eol> which he applies to everything, <eob> and you can apply to everything: <eob>
"Easy choices, hard life. <eob>
Hard choices, easy life." <eob>
The hard choices -- <eob> what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- <eob> these are very often exactly <eol> what we most need to do. <eob>
And the biggest challenges <eol> and problems we face <eob> will never be solved <eol> with comfortable conversations, <eob> whether it's in your own head <eol> or with other people. <eob>
So I encourage you to ask yourselves: <eob> Where in your lives right now <eob> might defining your fears be more <eol> important than defining your goals? <eob>
Keeping in mind all the while, <eol> the words of Seneca: <eob> "We suffer more often <eol> in imagination than in reality." <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The best Christmas my children ever had <eob> was also the worst Christmas <eol> my husband and I ever had. <eob>
Elizabeth, age seven, <eob> and her brother, Ian, age five, <eob> couldn't imagine why they were getting <eol> everything they wanted for Christmas. <eob>
The reason Santa was so generous <eob> was because of something <eol> my husband Pat and I knew <eob> and the kids couldn't comprehend. <eob>
Something that we had just learned, <eol> and it terrified us. <eob>
This was 1994 <eob> and the story actually starts <eol> a few years earlier. <eob>
For a couple of years I had noticed <eol> a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck <eob> that looked like prickly heat. <eob>
For those same years, <eol> my father and brother both died of cancer, <eob> and I was probably <eol> overanxious about illness. <eob>
The doctors assured us <eol> there was nothing wrong <eob> and I shouldn't worry, <eob> but I wasn't so sure. <eob>
And so without a referral, <eol> and paying out-of-pocket, <eob> I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist. <eob>
She was probably <eol> just allergic to something, <eob> but why did it appear <eol> just on the sides of her neck, this rash? <eob>
So it's two days before Christmas, <eob> 1994, <eob> and the dermatologist <eol> takes a quick look at her neck and says, <eob> "She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum." <eob> And then he shuts off the lights <eol> and looks in her eyes. <eob>
It turns out, by chance, <eob> this dermatologist also trained <eol> in ophthalmology. <eob> Our lucky day. <eob> I am sick to my stomach. <eob> "Oma?" <eob> Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma — <eob> cancer. <eob> "Why are you looking in her eyes <eol> for a skin rash?" <eob> I scream and make no sound. <eob>
So there it is. <eob> Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum, <eob> PXE for short. <eob> Questions mix with fear <eob> and erupt like bile in my throat. <eob>
Why are you looking in her eyes? <eob>
What do you know about this? <eob>
How do you know for sure? <eob>
What is the prognosis? <eob>
My training in pastoral counseling <eol> did not prepare me for this. <eob>
Dr. Bercovitch tells us <eol> everything he knows about PXE. <eob>
It's a rare genetic disorder, <eob> it's systemic, <eob> it's a slowly progressing, <eol> premature aging disease. <eob>
It causes loose wrinkly skin <eol> in the flexor areas. <eob>
It causes legal blindness, <eob> like macular degeneration, <eob> and a host of cardiovascular problems. <eob>
Little is known about this disease, <eob> and some people die in their 30s, <eob> say some of the reports at the time. <eob>
He then just glances at our son and says, <eob> "He has it, too." <eob> We want to flee <eol> back to the land of normal. <eob>
Two days after Christmas, <eob> researchers come <eol> from a university in Boston, <eob> and they take blood <eol> from us and our children <eob> for a research project <eol> focused on finding the gene. <eob>
A few days later, <eob> researchers come <eol> from a medical center in New York <eob> and say they want blood, too. <eob> "These are children. <eob>
They're five and seven years old. <eob>
Don't make them face the needle twice. <eob>
Go and get your share <eol> from the other researchers. <eob> "They laugh, incredulous." <eob> Share? <eob> "It is then that we learn that there is little sharing <eol> in biomedical research. <eob>
This moment, more than any other, <eob> lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me. <eob>
Pat and I went to a medical school library <eob> and we copied every article <eol> we could find on PXE. <eob>
We didn't understand a thing. <eob>
We bought medical dictionaries <eol> and scientific textbooks <eob> and read everything <eol> we could get our hands on. <eob>
And though we still didn't understand, <eob> we could see patterns, <eob> and it became quickly <eol> apparent within a month <eob> that there was no systematic effort <eol> to understand PXE. <eob>
In addition, <eob> the lack of sharing <eol> that we experienced was pervasive. <eob>
Researchers competed with each other <eob> because the ecosystem <eol> was designed to reward competition <eob> rather than to alleviate suffering. <eob>
We realized that we would have to do <eol> work on this condition ourselves <eob> to find solutions <eol> for ourselves and others like us. <eob>
But we faced two major barriers. <eob>
The first one: <eob> Pat and I have no science background. <eob>
At the time, he's the manager <eol> of a construction company, <eob> and I'm a former college chaplain <eol> stay-at-home mom -- <eob> hardly the backgrounds <eol> to take the research world by storm. <eob>
The second barrier: <eob> researchers don't share. <eob>
People told us you can't herd cats. <eob>
Well, yes you can if you move their food. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
DNA and clinical data is the food. <eob>
So we would collect blood <eol> and medical histories, <eob> and require that all scientists <eol> using these resources <eob> would share results with each other <eol> and with the people who donated. <eob>
Well before the internet <eol> was in common use, <eob> Pat and I established PXE International, <eob> a nonprofit dedicated to initiating <eol> research and conducting it on PXE <eob> and also supporting <eol> individuals with the disease. <eob>
Using traditional media, <eob> we garnered around <eol> 100-150 people around the world <eob> who we asked, <eob> would you give us your blood, <eol> your tissue, your medical histories, <eob> your medical records? <eob>
And we brought all of that together. <eob>
We quickly learned that this shared <eol> resource was not going to be enough. <eob>
And so we decided we had <eol> to do hardcore bench science -- <eob> hardcore research. <eob>
So we borrowed bench space <eol> at a lab at Harvard. <eob>
A wonderful neighbor <eol> came a couple times a week <eob> and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am <eob> while Pat and I extracted DNA, <eob> ran and scored gels <eob> and searched for the gene. <eob>
Generous postdocs <eol> tutored us as we went along. <eob>
Within a few years, we found the gene. <eob>
We patented it so that <eol> it would be freely available. <eob>
We created a diagnostic test. <eob>
We put together a research consortium. <eob>
We held research meetings <eol> and opened a center of excellence. <eob>
We found more than 4,000 people <eol> around the world who had PXE, <eob> and held patient meetings <eob> and did clinical trials and studies. <eob>
Through all this, <eob> we lived with fear. <eob>
Fear of the disease <eol> breathing down our neck <eob> while the clock ticked. <eob>
Fear of researchers, <eob> so well credentialed and positioned <eol> in a world made for them. <eob>
Fear that we were making <eol> the wrong choices. <eob>
Fear that the naysayers were right <eob> and the cats would simply find a new food. <eob>
But greater than all these fears <eol> was our drive to make a difference <eob> for our kids and for all those <eol> we had met along the way. <eob>
And very quickly, <eob> we also realized what we were <eol> doing for one disease, <eob> we should do for all diseases. <eob>
We joined with, and I eventually led, <eob> Genetic Alliance -- <eob> a network of health advocacy, <eob> patient advocacy, <eob> research and health organizations. <eob>
We built scalable <eol> and extensible resources, <eob> like biobanks and registries <eol> and directories of support <eob> for all diseases. <eob>
And as I learned about all those diseases <eol> and all those disease communities, <eob> I realized that there were <eol> two secrets in health care <eob> that were impacting me greatly. <eob>
The first: <eob> there are no ready answers <eol> for people like my kids <eob> or all the people I was working with, <eob> whether common or rare conditions. <eob>
And the second secret: <eob> the answers lie in all of us together, <eob> donating our data, <eob> our biological samples <eob> and ultimately ourselves. <eob>
There is a small <eol> groundswell of individuals <eob> who are working to change this. <eob>
Citizen scientists, activists, hacks <eob> who are using crowdsourcing, <eol> do-it-yourself science <eob> are changing the game. <eob>
Even President Obama <eol> and Vice President Biden <eob> are evangelists for the idea <eob> that people should be <eol> partners in research. <eob>
This is a founding principle <eol> of our organization. <eob>
Sure, it's really hard <eob> to discover and develop <eol> interventions and therapies. <eob>
The science is hard, <eob> the regulatory regime is difficult. <eob>
There are a lot of stakeholders <eol> with lots of interests <eob> and misaligned incentives <eol> like publishing, promotion and tenure. <eob>
I don't fault scientists <eol> for following this path, <eob> but I challenge them and us <eol> to do this differently. <eob>
To recognize that people <eol> are at the center. <eob>
Genetic Alliance has experimented <eob> in what it will take to transform <eol> these crusty systems. <eob>
Our goal is to work without boundaries. <eob>
That sounds abstract, <eol> but for us it's quite practical. <eob>
When we're frustrated <eol> that entities won't share data -- <eob> data that comes from people who gave <eol> their energy, their time, their blood <eob> and even their tears -- <eob> we need to stop and ask, <eob> "How is it true that we <eol> could share, but we aren't?" <eob> We're part of this system, too. <eob>
How do we make it <eol> so that people can share ideas freely? <eob>
So that people can take risks <eol> and move closer to one another? <eob>
This leads to a dissolving <eol> of us versus them, <eob> not only for organizations <eol> but also for individuals. <eob>
If I'm going to ask <eol> organizations or individuals <eob> to strive for these standards, <eob> then I too need to explore <eol> my own being and my practices. <eob>
If I'm going to ask clinicians <eol> and researchers and administrators <eob> to take risks, <eob> then I, Sharon, <eol> need to take risks as well. <eob>
I need to face my personal fears. <eob>
My fear of not having enough impact. <eob>
My fear of not leading well. <eob>
My fear of not being enough. <eob>
Just before they entered their teens, <eol> our kids stopped us in our tracks <eob> and said, "You have to stop worrying <eol> about making a difference, <eob> making an impact, <eob> and instead, like us, <eol> learn to live with disease <eob> rather than fight it." <eob> I have to ask, <eob> where does all my fear come from? <eob>
The kids' declaration <eol> shines a spotlight on that fear. <eob>
It arises from a bedrock of love. <eob>
I love Elizabeth and Ian. <eob>
I love people with PXE. <eob>
I love people with any disease. <eob> I love people. <eob> Some of my colleagues have discovered <eol> that it is not death we fear, <eob> it is the enormity of our loving. <eob>
This expansive love opens me to great pain <eob> as I face loss. <eob>
As I discover my fear, <eob> I discover that I <eob> and all those around me <eob> have boundless capacity for love. <eob>
And I also discover <eob> as I move into this fear, <eob> that I can learn many new things <eob> and find paths <eob> to things like practical solutions <eob> as well as the core of healing and health. <eob>
I don't fear fear the way I used to. <eob>
In fact lately, with enormous support <eol> from all my fellow journeyers, <eob> I notice that it's not a warning <eol> the way it used to be. <eob>
I notice that instead, <eob> it's an invitation to go forward <eob> because in it lies love <eol> and the path to greater love. <eob>
If I turn with gentle curiosity <eol> toward that fear, <eob> I find enormous wealth <eol> within myself and others <eob> and the ability to step into challenges <eol> that I never thought I could. <eob>
My kids are ahead of me <eol> on that path still. <eob>
At ages 29 and 27, <eob> they declare they are happy and healthy <eob> despite having manifestations of PXE <eol> in their skin and eyes and arteries. <eob>
And so I invite you, us, we, <eob> to turn toward our fear; <eob> to embrace the things that scare us <eob> and find the love at the center. <eob>
We'll not only find ourselves there <eob> but we'll also be able <eol> to step into the shoes of those we fear <eob> and those who fear us. <eob>
If we breathe into that fear <eob> and are vulnerable with the systems <eol> and people who challenge us, <eob> our power as changemakers <eol> grows exponentially. <eob>
And when we realize <eob> that working on our inner life <eol> is working on our outer life <eob> and outer work is inner work, <eob> we get down to what is real <eob> and shit gets done. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is no limit <eol> to what we can accomplish together. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My seven-year-old grandson <eol> sleeps just down the hall from me, <eob> and he wakes up a lot of mornings <eob> and he says, <eob> "You know, this could be <eol> the best day ever." <eob> And other times, <eol> in the middle of the night, <eob> he calls out in a tremulous voice, <eob> "Nana, will you ever get sick and die?" <eob>
I think this pretty much says it for me <eol> and most of the people I know, <eob> that we're a mixed grill <eol> of happy anticipation <eob> and dread. <eob>
So I sat down a few days <eol> before my 61st birthday, <eob> and I decided to compile a list <eol> of everything I know for sure. <eob>
There's so little truth <eol> in the popular culture, <eob> and it's good to be sure of a few things. <eob>
For instance, I am no longer 47, <eob> although this is the age I feel, <eob> and the age I like to think <eol> of myself as being. <eob>
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s <eob> that he felt like a young man <eol> with something really wrong with him. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Our true person is outside <eol> of time and space, <eob> but looking at the paperwork, <eob> I can, in fact, see <eol> that I was born in 1954. <eob>
My inside self is outside <eol> of time and space. <eob>
It doesn't have an age. <eob>
I'm every age I've ever been, <eol> and so are you, <eob> although I can't help <eol> mentioning as an aside <eob> that it might have been helpful <eol> if I hadn't followed <eob> the skin care rules of the '60s, <eob> which involved getting <eol> as much sun as possible <eob> while slathered in baby oil <eob> and basking in the glow <eol> of a tinfoil reflector shield. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was so liberating, though, <eol> to face the truth <eob> that I was no longer <eol> in the last throes of middle age, <eob> that I decided to write down <eol> every single true thing I know. <eob>
People feel really doomed <eol> and overwhelmed these days, <eob> and they keep asking me what's true. <eob>
So I hope that my list of things <eol> I'm almost positive about <eob> might offer some basic <eol> operating instructions <eob> to anyone who is feeling <eol> really overwhelmed or beleaguered. <eob>
Number one: <eob> the first and truest thing <eol> is that all truth is a paradox. <eob>
Life is both a precious, <eol> unfathomably beautiful gift, <eob> and it's impossible here, <eol> on the incarnational side of things. <eob>
It's been a very bad match <eob> for those of us who were born <eol> extremely sensitive. <eob>
It's so hard and weird <eol> that we sometimes wonder <eob> if we're being punked. <eob>
It's filled simultaneously <eol> with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty, <eob> desperate poverty, <eob> floods and babies and acne and Mozart, <eob> all swirled together. <eob>
I don't think it's an ideal system. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Number two: almost <eol> everything will work again <eob> if you unplug it for a few minutes -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
including you. <eob>
Three: there is almost <eol> nothing outside of you <eob> that will help in any kind of lasting way, <eob> unless you're waiting for an organ. <eob>
You can't buy, achieve or date <eol> serenity and peace of mind. <eob>
This is the most horrible truth, <eol> and I so resent it. <eob>
But it's an inside job, <eob> and we can't arrange peace <eol> or lasting improvement <eob> for the people we love most in the world. <eob>
They have to find their own ways, <eob> their own answers. <eob>
You can't run alongside <eol> your grown children <eob> with sunscreen and ChapStick <eol> on their hero's journey. <eob>
You have to release them. <eob>
It's disrespectful not to. <eob>
And if it's someone else's problem, <eob> you probably don't have <eol> the answer, anyway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Our help is usually not very helpful. <eob>
Our help is often toxic. <eob>
And help is the sunny side of control. <eob>
Stop helping so much. <eob>
Don't get your help and goodness <eol> all over everybody. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This brings us to number four: <eob> everyone is screwed up, <eol> broken, clingy and scared, <eob> even the people who seem <eol> to have it most together. <eob>
They are much more like you <eol> than you would believe, <eob> so try not to compare your insides <eol> to other people's outsides. <eob>
It will only make you worse <eol> than you already are. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Also, you can't save, fix <eol> or rescue any of them <eob> or get anyone sober. <eob>
What helped me get clean <eol> and sober 30 years ago <eob> was the catastrophe <eol> of my behavior and thinking. <eob>
So I asked some sober friends for help, <eob> and I turned to a higher power. <eob>
One acronym for God <eol> is the "gift of desperation," <eob> G-O-D, <eob> or as a sober friend put it, <eob> by the end I was deteriorating faster <eol> than I could lower my standards. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So God might mean, in this case, <eob> "me running out of any more good ideas." <eob>
While fixing and saving <eol> and trying to rescue is futile, <eob> radical self-care is quantum, <eob> and it radiates out from you <eol> into the atmosphere <eob> like a little fresh air. <eob>
It's a huge gift to the world. <eob>
When people respond by saying, <eol> "Well, isn't she full of herself," <eob> just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa <eob> and make both of you a nice cup of tea. <eob>
Being full of affection <eol> for one's goofy, self-centered, <eob> cranky, annoying self <eob> is home. <eob>
It's where world peace begins. <eob>
Number five: <eob> chocolate with 75 percent cacao <eol> is not actually a food. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Its best use is as a bait in snake traps <eob> or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs. <eob>
It was never meant <eol> to be considered an edible. <eob>
Number six -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
writing. <eob> Every writer you know writes <eol> really terrible first drafts, <eob> but they keep their butt in the chair. <eob>
That's the secret of life. <eob>
That's probably the main difference <eol> between you and them. <eob> They just do it. <eob> They do it by prearrangement <eol> with themselves. <eob>
They do it as a debt of honor. <eob>
They tell stories that come through them <eob> one day at a time, little by little. <eob>
When my older brother was in fourth grade, <eob> he had a term paper on birds <eol> due the next day, <eob> and he hadn't started. <eob>
So my dad sat down with him <eol> with an Audubon book, <eob> paper, pencils and brads -- <eob> for those of you who have gotten <eol> a little less young and remember brads -- <eob> and he said to my brother, <eob> "Just take it bird by bird, buddy. <eob>
Just read about pelicans <eob> and then write about pelicans <eol> in your own voice. <eob>
And then find out about chickadees, <eob> and tell us about them in your own voice. <eob>
And then geese." <eob>
So the two most important things <eol> about writing are: bird by bird <eob> and really god-awful first drafts. <eob>
If you don't know where to start, <eob> remember that every single thing <eol> that happened to you is yours, <eob> and you get to tell it. <eob>
If people wanted you to write <eol> more warmly about them, <eob> they should've behaved better. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You're going to feel like hell <eol> if you wake up someday <eob> and you never wrote the stuff <eob> that is tugging on the sleeves <eol> of your heart: <eob> your stories, memories, <eol> visions and songs -- <eob> your truth, <eob> your version of things -- <eob> in your own voice. <eob>
That's really all you have to offer us, <eob> and that's also why you were born. <eob>
Seven: publication and temporary <eol> creative successes <eob> are something you have to recover from. <eob>
They kill as many people as not. <eob>
They will hurt, damage and change you <eob> in ways you cannot imagine. <eob>
The most degraded <eol> and evil people I've ever known <eob> are male writers who've had <eol> huge best sellers. <eob>
And yet, returning to number one, <eol> that all truth is paradox, <eob> it's also a miracle <eol> to get your work published, <eob> to get your stories read and heard. <eob>
Just try to bust yourself <eol> gently of the fantasy <eob> that publication will heal you, <eob> that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy <eol> holes inside of you. <eob> It can't. <eob> It won't. <eob> But writing can. <eob> So can singing in a choir <eol> or a bluegrass band. <eob>
So can painting community <eol> murals or birding <eob> or fostering old dogs <eol> that no one else will. <eob>
Number eight: families. <eob> Families are hard, hard, hard, <eob> no matter how cherished <eol> and astonishing they may also be. <eob>
Again, see number one. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At family gatherings where you suddenly <eol> feel homicidal or suicidal -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
remember that in all cases, <eob> it's a miracle that any of us, <eol> specifically, were conceived and born. <eob>
Earth is forgiveness school. <eob>
It begins with forgiving yourself, <eob> and then you might as well <eol> start at the dinner table. <eob>
That way, you can do this work <eol> in comfortable pants. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When William Blake said that we are here <eob> to learn to endure the beams of love, <eob> he knew that your family would be <eol> an intimate part of this, <eob> even as you want to run screaming <eol> for your cute little life. <eob>
But I promise you are up to it. <eob>
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it, <eob> and you will be amazed. <eob>
Nine: food. <eob> Try to do a little better. <eob>
I think you know what I mean. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Number 10 -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
grace. <eob> Grace is spiritual WD-40, <eob> or water wings. <eob>
The mystery of grace is that God loves <eol> Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin <eob> and me <eob> exactly as much as He or She <eol> loves your new grandchild. <eob> Go figure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The movement of grace <eol> is what changes us, heals us <eob> and heals our world. <eob>
To summon grace, say, "Help," <eol> and then buckle up. <eob>
Grace finds you exactly where you are, <eob> but it doesn't leave you <eol> where it found you. <eob>
And grace won't look <eol> like Casper the Friendly Ghost, <eob> regrettably. <eob>
But the phone will ring <eol> or the mail will come <eob> and then against all odds, <eob> you'll get your sense of humor <eol> about yourself back. <eob>
Laughter really is carbonated holiness. <eob>
It helps us breathe again and again <eob> and gives us back to ourselves, <eob> and this gives us faith <eol> in life and each other. <eob>
And remember -- grace always bats last. <eob>
Eleven: God just means goodness. <eob>
It's really not all that scary. <eob>
It means the divine or a loving, <eol> animating intelligence, <eob> or, as we learned <eol> from the great "Deteriorata," <eob> "the cosmic muffin." <eob> A good name for God is: "Not me." <eob> Emerson said that <eol> the happiest person on Earth <eob> is the one who learns from nature <eol> the lessons of worship. <eob>
So go outside a lot and look up. <eob>
My pastor said you can trap bees <eol> on the bottom of mason jars without lids <eob> because they don't look up, <eob> so they just walk around bitterly <eol> bumping into the glass walls. <eob> Go outside. Look up. <eob> Secret of life. <eob>
And finally: death. <eob> Number 12. <eob> Wow and yikes. <eob> It's so hard to bear when the few people <eol> you cannot live without die. <eob>
You'll never get over these losses, <eol> and no matter what the culture says, <eob> you're not supposed to. <eob>
We Christians like to think of death <eol> as a major change of address, <eob> but in any case, the person <eol> will live again fully in your heart <eob> if you don't seal it off. <eob>
Like Leonard Cohen said, <eol> "There are cracks in everything, <eob> and that's how the light gets in." <eob> And that's how we feel <eol> our people again fully alive. <eob>
Also, the people will make <eol> you laugh out loud <eob> at the most inconvenient times, <eob> and that's the great good news. <eob>
But their absence will also be a lifelong <eol> nightmare of homesickness for you. <eob>
Grief and friends, time and tears <eol> will heal you to some extent. <eob>
Tears will bathe and baptize <eol> and hydrate and moisturize you <eob> and the ground on which you walk. <eob>
Do you know the first thing <eol> that God says to Moses? <eob>
He says, "Take off your shoes." <eob> Because this is holy ground, <eol> all evidence to the contrary. <eob>
It's hard to believe, <eol> but it's the truest thing I know. <eob>
When you're a little bit older, <eol> like my tiny personal self, <eob> you realize that death <eol> is as sacred as birth. <eob>
And don't worry -- get on with your life. <eob>
Almost every single death <eol> is easy and gentle <eob> with the very best people surrounding you <eob> for as long as you need. <eob>
You won't be alone. <eob>
They'll help you cross over <eol> to whatever awaits us. <eob>
As Ram Dass said, <eob> "When all is said and done, <eob> we're really just all walking <eol> each other home." <eob>
I think that's it, <eob> but if I think of anything else, <eob> I'll let you know. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I was very surprised to be asked to come, <eob> because it is not my realm, <eob> technology or design or entertainment. <eob>
I mean, my realm is sort of <eol> faith and writing <eob> and kind of lurching along together. <eob>
And I was surprised, <eob> but they said I could give a talk, <eol> and I said I'd love to. <eob>
(Video) <eob> If you don't know where to start, <eob> remember that every single thing <eol> that happened to you is yours <eob> and you get to tell it. <eob>
Anne Lamott: People are very frightened <eol> and feel really doomed <eob> in America these days, <eob> and I just wanted to help people <eol> get their sense of humor about it <eob> and to realize how much isn't a problem. <eob>
If you take an action, <eob> take a really healthy or loving <eol> or friendly action, <eob> you'll have loving and friendly feelings. <eob>
I want you to imagine <eob> walking into a room, <eob> a control room with a bunch of people, <eob> a hundred people, hunched <eol> over a desk with little dials, <eob> and that that control room <eob> will shape the thoughts and feelings <eob> of a billion people. <eob>
This might sound like science fiction, <eob> but this actually exists <eob> right now, today. <eob>
I know because I used to be <eol> in one of those control rooms. <eob>
I was a design ethicist at Google, <eob> where I studied how do you <eol> ethically steer people's thoughts? <eob>
Because what we don't talk about <eol> is how the handful of people <eob> working at a handful <eol> of technology companies <eob> through their choices will steer what a billion people <eol> are thinking today. <eob>
Because when you pull out your phone <eob> and they design how this works <eol> or what's on the feed, <eob> it's scheduling little blocks <eol> of time in our minds. <eob>
If you see a notification, <eol> it schedules you to have thoughts <eob> that maybe you didn't intend to have. <eob>
If you swipe over that notification, <eob> it schedules you into spending <eol> a little bit of time <eob> getting sucked into something <eob> that maybe you didn't intend <eol> to get sucked into. <eob>
When we talk about technology, <eob> we tend to talk about it <eol> as this blue sky opportunity. <eob> It could go any direction. <eob>
And I want to get serious for a moment <eob> and tell you why it's going <eol> in a very specific direction. <eob>
Because it's not evolving randomly. <eob>
There's a hidden goal driving the direction <eob> of all of the technology we make, <eob> and that goal is the race for our attention. <eob>
Because every news site — <eob> TED, elections, politicians, <eob> games, even meditation apps — <eob> have to compete for one thing, <eob> which is our attention, <eob> and there's only so much of it. <eob>
And the best way to get people's attention <eob> is to know how someone's mind works. <eob>
And there's a whole bunch <eol> of persuasive techniques <eob> that I learned in college <eol> at a lab called the Persuasive Technology Lab <eob> to get people's attention. <eob>
A simple example is YouTube. <eob>
YouTube wants to maximize <eol> how much time you spend. <eob> And so what do they do? <eob> They autoplay the next video. <eob>
And let's say that works really well. <eob>
They're getting a little bit <eol> more of people's time. <eob>
Well, if you're Netflix, <eol> you look at that and say, <eob> well, that's shrinking my market share, <eob> so I'm going to autoplay <eol> the next episode. <eob>
But then if you're Facebook, <eob> you say, that's shrinking <eol> all of my market share, <eob> so now I have to autoplay <eol> all the videos in the newsfeed <eob> before waiting for you to click play. <eob>
So the internet is not evolving at random. <eob>
The reason it feels like <eol> it's sucking us in the way it is <eob> is because of this race for attention. <eob>
We know where this is going. <eob>
Technology is not neutral, <eob> and it becomes this race <eol> to the bottom of the brain stem <eob> of who can go lower to get it. <eob>
Let me give you an example of Snapchat. <eob>
If you didn't know, Snapchat <eol> is the number one way <eob> that teenagers in the United States <eol> communicate. <eob>
So if you're like me, and you use <eol> text messages to communicate, <eob> Snapchat is that for teenagers, <eob> and there's, like, a hundred million <eol> of them that use it. <eob>
And they invented a feature <eol> called Snapstreaks, <eob> which shows the number of days in a row <eob> that two people have <eol> communicated with each other. <eob>
In other words, what they just did <eob> is they gave two people <eol> something they don't want to lose. <eob>
Because if you're a teenager, <eol> and you have 150 days in a row, <eob> you don't want that to go away. <eob>
And so think of the little blocks of time <eol> that that schedules in kids' minds. <eob>
This isn't theoretical: <eol> when kids go on vacation, <eob> it's been shown they give <eol> their passwords to up to five other friends <eob> to keep their Snapstreaks <eol> going, <eob> even when they can't do it. <eob>
And they have, like, 30 of these things, <eob> and so they have to get through taking photos <eol> of just pictures or walls <eob> or ceilings just to get through their day. <eob>
So it's not even like <eol> they're having real conversations. <eob>
We have a temptation <eol> to think about this <eob> as, oh, they're just using Snapchat <eob> the way we used to gossip on the telephone. <eob>
It's probably OK. <eob>
Well, what this misses <eol> is that in the 1970s, <eob> when you were just gossiping on the telephone, <eob> there wasn't a hundred engineers <eol> on the other side of the screen <eob> who knew exactly <eol> how your psychology worked <eob> and orchestrated you into a double bind with each other. <eob>
Now, if this is making you feel <eol> a little bit of outrage, <eob> notice that that thought <eol> just comes over you. <eob>
Outrage is a really good way <eol> also of getting your attention, <eob> because we don't choose outrage. <eob> It happens to us. <eob> And if you're the Facebook newsfeed, <eob> whether you'd want to or not, <eob> you actually benefit when there's outrage. <eob>
Because outrage doesn't just <eol> schedule a reaction <eob> in emotional time, space, for you. <eob>
We want to share that outrage <eol> with other people. <eob>
So we want to hit share and say, <eob> "Can you believe the thing that they said?" <eob> And so outrage works really well <eol> at getting attention, <eob> such that if Facebook had a choice <eol> between showing you the outrage feed <eob> and a calm newsfeed, <eob> they would want to show you the outrage feed, <eob> not because someone consciously chose that, <eob> but because that worked better <eol> at getting your attention. <eob>
And the newsfeed control room <eol> is not accountable to us. <eob>
It's only accountable <eol> to maximizing attention. <eob>
It's also accountable, <eob> because of the business model <eol> of advertising, <eob> for anybody who can pay the most <eol> to actually walk into the control room <eob> and say, "That group over there, <eob> I want to schedule <eol> these thoughts into their minds." <eob> So you can target, <eob> you can precisely target a lie <eob> directly to the people who are most susceptible. <eob>
And because this is profitable, <eol> it's only going to get worse. <eob>
So I'm here today <eob> because the costs are so obvious. <eob>
I don't know a more urgent problem than this, <eob> because this problem is underneath <eol> all other problems. <eob>
It's not just taking away our agency <eob> to spend our attention and live <eol> the lives that we want, <eob> it's changing the way <eol> that we have our conversations, <eob> it's changing our democracy, <eob> and it's changing our ability <eol> to have the conversations <eob> and relationships we want with each other. <eob>
And it affects everyone, <eob> because a billion people have <eol> one of these in their pocket. <eob>
So how do we fix this? <eob> We need to make three radical changes <eob> to technology and to our society. <eob>
The first is we need to acknowledge <eol> that we are persuadable. <eob>
Once you start understanding <eob> that your mind <eol> can be scheduled into having little thoughts <eob> or little blocks of time <eol> that you didn't choose, <eob> wouldn't we want to use that understanding <eob> and protect against the way <eol> that that happens? <eob>
I think we need to see ourselves <eol> fundamentally in a new way. <eob>
It's almost like a new period of human history, <eob> like the Enlightenment, <eob> but almost a kind of self-aware Enlightenment, <eob> that we can be persuaded, <eob> and there might be something <eol> we want to protect. <eob>
The second is we need new models <eol> and accountability systems <eob> so that as the world gets better <eol> and more and more persuasive over time -- <eob> because it's only going <eol> to get more persuasive -- <eob> that the people in those control rooms <eob> are accountable and transparent <eol> to what we want. <eob>
The only form of ethical persuasion <eol> that exists <eob> is when the goals of the persuader <eob> are aligned with the goals <eol> of the persuadee. <eob>
And that involves questioning big things, <eol> like the business model of advertising. <eob>
Lastly, <eob> we need a design renaissance, <eob> because once you have <eol> this view of human nature, <eob> that you can steer the timelines <eol> of a billion people — <eob> just imagine, there's people who have some desire <eob> about what they want to do and what they want <eol> to be thinking <eob> and what they want to be feeling <eol> and how they want to be informed, <eob> and we're all just tugged <eol> into these other directions. <eob>
And you have a billion people just tugged <eol> into all these different directions. <eob>
Well, imagine an entire design renaissance <eob> that tried to orchestrate <eol> the exact and most empowering <eob> time-well-spent way <eol> for those timelines to happen. <eob>
And that would involve two things: <eob> one would be protecting <eol> against the timelines <eob> that we don't want to be experiencing, <eob> the thoughts that we wouldn't <eol> want to be happening, <eob> so that when that ding happens, <eol> not having the ding that sends us away; <eob> and the second would be empowering us <eol> to live out the timeline that we want. <eob>
You open up Facebook. <eob> And in that moment, <eob> the designers <eol> in the control room want to schedule exactly one thing, <eob> which is to maximize how much time <eol> you spend on the screen. <eob>
Now, instead, imagine if those designers <eol> created a different timeline <eob> that was the easiest way, <eol> using all of their data, <eob> to actually help you get out with the people <eol> that you care about? <eob>
Just think, alleviating <eol> all loneliness in society, <eob> if that was the timeline that Facebook wanted <eol> to make possible for people. <eob>
Or imagine a different conversation. <eob>
Let's say you wanted to post <eol> something supercontroversial on Facebook, <eob> which is a really important thing <eol> to be able to do, <eob> to talk about controversial topics. <eob>
And right now, when there's <eol> that big comment box, <eob> it's almost asking you, <eol> what key do you want to type? <eob>
In other words, it's scheduling <eol> a little timeline of things <eob> you're going to continue <eol> to do on the screen. <eob>
And imagine instead that there was another button there saying, <eob> what would be most time well spent for you? <eob> And you click "host a dinner." <eob> And right there underneath the item it said, <eob> "Who wants to RSVP for the dinner?" <eob> And so you'd still have <eol> a conversation about something controversial, <eob> but you'd be having it <eol> in the most empowering place on your timeline, <eob> which would be at home that night <eol> with a bunch of a friends over <eob> to talk about it. <eob>
So imagine we're running, like, <eol> a find and replace <eob> on all of the timelines <eol> that are currently steering us <eob> towards more and more screen <eol> time persuasively <eob> and replacing all of those timelines <eob> with what do we want in our lives. <eob>
It doesn't have to be this way. <eob>
Instead of handicapping our attention, <eob> imagine if we used all of this data <eol> and all of this power <eob> and this new view of human nature <eob> to give us a superhuman ability to focus <eob> and a superhuman ability <eol> to put our attention to what we cared about <eob> and a superhuman ability <eol> to have the conversations <eob> that we need to have for democracy. <eob>
The most complex challenges in the world <eob> require not just us to use <eol> our attention individually. <eob>
They require us to use our attention <eol> and coordinate it together. <eob>
Climate change is going to require <eol> that a lot of people <eob> are being able to coordinate <eol> their attention <eob> in the most empowering way together. <eob>
And imagine creating <eol> a superhuman ability to do that. <eob>
Sometimes the world's most pressing <eol> and important problems <eob> are not these hypothetical future things <eol> that we could create in the future. <eob>
Sometimes the most pressing problems <eob> are the ones that are right <eol> underneath our noses, <eob> the things that are already directing <eol> a billion people's thoughts. <eob>
And maybe instead of getting excited <eol> about the new augmented reality <eob> and virtual reality <eol> and these cool things that could happen, <eob> which are going to be susceptible <eol> to the same race for attention, <eob> if we could fix the race <eol> for attention <eob> on the thing that's already in a billion people's pockets. <eob>
Maybe instead of getting excited <eob> about the most exciting <eol> new cool fancy education apps, <eob> we could fix the way kids' minds <eol> are getting manipulated <eob> into sending empty messages <eol> back and forth. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Maybe instead of worrying <eob> about hypothetical future runaway <eol> artificial intelligences <eob> that are maximizing for one goal, <eob> we could solve the runaway <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> that already exists right now, <eob> which are these newsfeeds maximizing <eol> for one thing. <eob>
It's almost like instead of running away <eol> to colonize new planets, <eob> we could fix the one that we're already on. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Solving this problem <eob> is critical infrastructure <eol> for solving every other problem. <eob>
There's nothing in your life <eol> or in our collective problems <eob> that does not require our ability <eol> to put our attention where we care about. <eob>
At the end of our lives, <eob> all we have is our attention and our time. <eob>
What will be time well spent for ours? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
First of all, thank you. <eob>
I know we asked you to do <eol> this talk on pretty short notice, <eob> and you've had quite a stressful week <eob> getting this thing together, so thank you. <eob>
Some people listening might say, <eol> what you complain about is addiction, <eob> and all these people doing this stuff, <eol> for them it's actually interesting. <eob>
All these design decisions <eob> have built user content <eol> that is fantastically interesting. <eob>
The world's more interesting <eol> than it ever has been. <eob>
What's wrong with that? <eob>
Tristan Harris: I think <eol> it's really interesting. <eob>
One way to see this is if you're just <eol> YouTube, for example, <eob> you want to always show <eol> the more interesting next video. <eob>
You want to get better and better <eol> at suggesting that next video, <eob> but even if you could propose <eol> the perfect next video <eob> that everyone would want to watch, <eob> it would just be better and better at <eol> keeping you hooked on the screen. <eob>
So what's missing in that equation <eob> is figuring out what our boundaries <eol> would be. <eob>
You would want YouTube to know something <eol> about, say, falling asleep. <eob>
The CEO of Netflix recently said, <eob> "our biggest competitors <eol> are Facebook, YouTube and sleep." <eob> And so what we need to recognize <eol> is that the human architecture is limited <eob> and that we have certain boundaries <eol> or dimensions of our lives <eob> that we want to be honored and respected, <eob> and technology could help do that. <eob>
CA: I mean, could you make the case <eob> that part of the problem here <eol> is that we've got a naïve model of human nature? <eob>
So much of this is justified <eol> in terms of human preference, <eob> where we've got these algorithms <eol> that do an amazing job <eob> of optimizing for human preference, <eob> but which preference? <eob>
There's the preferences of things <eol> that we really care about <eob> when we think about them <eob> versus the preferences of what we just instinctively click on. <eob>
If we could implant that more nuanced <eol> view of human nature in every design, <eob> would that be a step forward? <eob>
TH: Absolutely. I mean, I think right now <eob> it's as if all of our technology <eol> is basically only asking our lizard brain <eob> what's the best way to just <eol> impulsively get you to do <eob> the next tiniest thing <eol> with your time, <eob> instead of asking you in your life <eob> what we would be most time well spent for you? <eob>
What would be the perfect timeline <eol> that might include something later, <eob> would be time well spent for you here <eol> at TED in your last day here? <eob>
CA: So if Facebook and Google <eol> and everyone said to us first up, <eob> "Hey, would you like us to optimize <eol> for your reflective brain <eob> or your lizard brain? You choose." <eob>
TH: Right. That would be one way. Yes. <eob>
CA: You said persuadability, <eol> that's an interesting word to me <eob> because to me there's two different <eol> types of persuadability. <eob>
There's the persuadability <eol> that we're trying right now <eob> of reason and thinking <eol> and making an argument, <eob> but I think you're almost talking <eol> about a different kind, <eob> a more visceral type <eol> of persuadability, <eob> of being persuaded <eol> without even knowing that you're thinking. <eob>
TH: Exactly. The reason <eol> I care about this problem so much is <eob> I studied at a lab called the Persuasive <eol> Technology Lab at Stanford <eob> that taught [students how to recognize] <eol> exactly these techniques. <eob>
There's conferences and workshops <eol> that teach people all these covert ways <eob> of getting people's attention and orchestrating people's lives. <eob>
And it's because most people <eol> don't know that that exists <eob> that this conversation is so important. <eob>
CA: Tristan, you and I, we both know <eol> so many people from all these companies. <eob>
There are actually many here in the room, <eob> and I don't know about you, <eol> but my experience of them <eob> is that there is no shortage <eol> of good intent. <eob>
People want a better world. <eob>
They are actually -- they really want it. <eob>
And I don't think anything you're saying <eol> is that these are evil people. <eob>
It's a system where there's these <eol> unintended consequences <eob> that have really got out of control -- <eob>
TH: Of this race for attention. <eob>
It's the classic race to the bottom <eol> when you have to get attention, <eob> and it's so tense. <eob>
The only way to get more <eol> is to go lower on the brain stem, <eob> to go lower into outrage, <eol> to go lower into emotion, <eob> to go lower into the lizard brain. <eob>
CA: Well, thank you so much for helping us <eol> all get a little bit wiser about this. <eob>
Tristan Harris, thank you. TH: <eob> Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
I am from the South Side of Chicago, <eob> and in seventh grade, <eol> I had a best friend named Jenny <eob> who lived on the Southwest <eol> Side of Chicago. <eob>
Jenny was white, <eob> and if you know anything about <eol> the segregated demographics of Chicago, <eob> you know that there are <eol> not too many black people <eob> who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago. <eob>
But Jenny was my girl <eob> and so we would hang out every so often <eol> after school and on the weekends. <eob>
And so one day we were <eol> hanging out in her living room, <eob> talking about 13-year-old things, <eob> and Jenny's little sister Rosie <eol> was in the room with us, <eob> and she was sitting behind me <eol> just kind of playing in my hair, <eob> and I wasn't thinking too much <eol> about what she was doing. <eob>
But at a pause in the conversation, <eob> Rosie tapped me on the shoulder. <eob>
She said, "Can I ask you a question?" <eob>
I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure." <eob>
"Are you black?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The room froze. <eob> Silence. <eob> Jenny and Rosie's mom <eol> was not too far away. <eob>
She was in the kitchen <eol> and she overheard the conversation, <eob> and she was mortified. <eob>
She said, "Rosie! <eob>
You can't ask people questions like that. <eob> "And Jenny was my friend, <eol> and I know she was really embarrassed. <eob>
I felt kind of bad for her, <eol> but actually I was not offended. <eob>
I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault <eol> that in her 10 short years on this earth, <eob> living on the Southwest Side of Chicago, <eob> she wasn't 100 percent sure <eol> what a black person looked like. <eob> That's fair. <eob> But what was more surprising to me was, <eob> in all of this time I had spent <eol> with Jenny and Rosie's family -- <eob> hanging out with them, <eob> playing with them, <eob> even physically interacting with them -- <eob> it was not until Rosie <eol> put her hands in my hair <eob> that she thought to ask me if I was black. <eob>
That was the first time I would realize <eob> how big of a role the texture of my hair <eol> played in confirming my ethnicity, <eob> but also that it would play a key role <eol> in how I'm viewed by others in society. <eob>
Garrett A. Morgan <eol> and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers <eob> of the black hair-care and beauty <eol> industry in the early 1900s. <eob>
They're best known as the inventors <eol> of chemically-based hair creams <eob> and heat straightening tools <eob> designed to permanently, <eol> or semipermanently, <eob> alter the texture of black hair. <eob>
Oftentimes when we think <eol> about the history of blacks in America, <eob> we think about the heinous acts <eob> and numerous injustices <eol> that we experienced as people of color <eob> because of the color of our skin, <eob> when in fact, in post-Civil War America, <eob> it was the hair of an <eol> African-American male or female <eob> that was known as the most <eol> "telling feature" of Negro status, <eob> more so than the color of the skin. <eob>
And so before they were staples <eob> of the multibillion-dollar <eol> hair-care industry, <eob> our dependency on tools and products, <eob> like the hair relaxer <eol> and the pressing comb, <eob> were more about our survival <eol> and advancement as a race <eob> in postslavery America. <eob>
Over the years, <eol> we grew accustomed to this idea <eob> that straighter and longer <eol> hair meant better and more beautiful. <eob>
We became culturally obsessed <eob> with this idea of having <eol> what we like to call ... <eob> "good hair." <eob> This essentially means: <eob> the looser the curl pattern, <eol> the better the hair. <eob>
And we let these institutionalized ideas <eol> form a false sense of hierarchy <eob> that would determine <eol> what was considered a good grade of hair <eob> and what was not. <eob>
What's worse is that <eol> we let these false ideologies <eob> invade our perception of ourselves, <eob> and they still continue <eol> to infect our cultural identity <eob> as African-American women today. <eob>
So what did we do? <eob>
We went to the hair salon <eol> every six to eight weeks, <eob> without fail, <eob> to subject our scalps <eol> to harsh straightening chemicals <eob> beginning at a very young age -- <eob> sometimes eight, 10 -- <eob> that would result in hair loss, <eob> bald spots, <eob> sometimes even burns on the scalp. <eob>
We fry our hair at temperatures <eol> of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher <eob> almost daily, <eob> to maintain the straight look. <eob>
Or we simply cover our hair up <eol> with wigs and weaves, <eob> only to let our roots breathe in private <eob> where no one knows <eol> what's really going on under there. <eob>
We adopted these practices <eol> in our own communities, <eob> and so it's no wonder <eol> why today the typical ideal vision <eob> of a professional black woman, <eob> especially in corporate America, <eob> tends to look like this, <eob> rather than like this. <eob>
And she certainly doesn't look like this. <eob>
In September of this year, <eob> a federal court ruled it lawful <eob> for a company to discriminate <eol> against hiring an employee <eob> based on if she or he wears dreadlocks. <eob>
In the case, <eob> the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama <eob> is on record as saying, <eob> "I'm not saying yours are messy, <eob> but... <eob> you know what I'm talking about." <eob> Well, what was she talking about? <eob>
Did she think that they were ugly? <eob>
Or maybe they were <eol> just a little too Afrocentric <eob> and pro-black-looking for her taste. <eob>
Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity, <eob> and it's more just about <eol> it being a little too "urban" <eob> for the professional setting. <eob>
Perhaps she had a genuine concern <eol> in that they looked "scary" <eob> and that they would intimidate <eol> the clients and their customer base. <eob>
All of these words are ones <eol> that are too often associated <eob> with the stigma <eol> attached to natural hairstyles. <eob>
And this ... <eob> this has got to change. <eob>
In 2013, <eob> a white paper published by the Deloitte <eol> Leadership Center for Inclusion, <eob> studied 3,000 individuals <eol> in executive leadership roles <eob> on the concept <eol> of covering in the workplace <eob> based on appearance, <eol> advocacy, affiliation and association. <eob>
When thinking about <eol> appearance-based covering, <eob> the study showed <eob> that 67 percent of women <eol> of color cover in the workplace <eob> based on their appearance. <eob>
Of the total respondents who <eol> admitted to appearance-based covering, <eob> 82 percent said that it was <eol> somewhat to extremely important <eob> for them to do so <eol> for their professional advancement. <eob>
Now, this is Ursula Burns. <eob> She is the first African-American <eol> female CEO of a Fortune 500 company — <eob> of Xerox. <eob>
She's known by her signature look, <eob> the one that you see here. <eob>
A short, nicely trimmed, <eol> well-manicured Afro. <eob>
Ms. Burns is what <eol> we like to call a "natural girl." <eob> And she is paving the way <eol> and showing what's possible <eob> for African-American women <eol> seeking to climb the corporate ladder, <eob> but still wishing <eol> to wear natural hairstyles. <eob>
But today the majority <eol> of African-American women <eob> who we still look to as leaders, <eol> icons and role models, <eob> still opt for a straight-hair look. <eob>
Now, <eob> maybe it's because they want to — <eob> this is authentically how they feel best — <eob> but maybe — <eob> and I bet — <eob> a part of them felt like they had to <eob> in order to reach the level <eol> of success that they have attained today. <eob>
There is a natural hair movement <eol> that is sweeping the country <eob> and also in some places in Europe. <eob>
Millions of women are exploring what <eol> it means to transition to natural hair, <eob> and they're cutting off <eol> years and years of dry, damaged ends <eob> in order to restore <eol> their natural curl pattern. <eob>
I know because I have been an advocate <eol> and an ambassador for this movement <eob> for roughly the last three years. <eob>
After 27 years of excessive heat <eol> and harsh chemicals, <eob> my hair was beginning to show <eol> extreme signs of wear and tear. <eob>
It was breaking off, <eob> it was thinning, <eob> looking just extremely dry and brittle. <eob>
All those years of chasing <eol> that conventional image of beauty <eob> that we saw earlier <eob> was finally beginning to take its toll. <eob>
I wanted to do something about it, <eob> and so I started what I called <eol> the "No Heat Challenge," <eob> where I would refrain <eol> from using heat styling tools on my hair <eob> for six months. <eob>
And like a good millennial, <eob> I documented it on social media. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I documented as I reluctantly cut off <eob> three to four inches of my beloved hair. <eob>
I documented as I struggled <eol> to master these natural hairstyles, <eob> and also as I struggled to embrace them <eob> and think that they actually looked good. <eob>
And I documented as my hair texture <eol> slowly began to change. <eob>
By sharing this journey openly, <eob> I learned that I was not <eol> the only woman going through this <eob> and that in fact there were thousands <eol> and thousands of other women <eob> who were longing to do the same. <eob>
So they would reach out to me <eol> and they would say, <eob> "Cheyenne, how did you do <eol> that natural hairstyle <eob> that I saw you with the other day? <eob>
What new products have you started using <eob> that might be a little better <eol> for my hair texture <eob> as it begins to change?" <eob> Or, "What are some <eol> of the natural hair routines <eob> that I should begin to adopt <eol> to slowly restore the health of my hair?" <eob> But I also found that there were <eol> a large number of women <eob> who were extremely hesitant <eol> to take that first step <eob> because they were paralyzed by fear. <eob>
Fear of the unknown -- <eob> what would they now look like? <eob>
How would they feel about themselves <eol> with these natural hairstyles? <eob>
And most importantly to them, <eob> how would others view them? <eob>
Over the last three years <eob> of having numerous conversations <eol> with friends of mine <eob> and also complete strangers <eol> from around the world, <eob> I learned some really important things <eob> about how African-American women <eol> identify with their hair. <eob>
And so when I think back <eob> to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama, <eob> I'd say, "Actually, no. <eob>
We don't know what you're talking about." <eob> But here are some things that we do know. <eob>
We know that when black women <eol> embrace their love for their natural hair, <eob> it helps to undo generations of teaching <eob> that black in its natural state <eol> is not beautiful, <eob> or something to be hidden or covered up. <eob>
We know that black women <eol> express their individuality <eob> and experience feelings of empowerment <eob> by experimenting with different <eol> hairstyles regularly. <eob>
And we also know <eob> that when we're invited <eol> to wear our natural hair in the workplace, <eob> it reinforces that we are uniquely valued <eob> and thus helps us to flourish <eol> and advance professionally. <eob>
I leave you with this. <eob>
In a time of racial and social tension, <eob> embracing this movement <eob> and others like this <eob> help us to rise above <eol> the confines of the status quo. <eob>
So when you see a woman with braids <eol> or locks draping down her back, <eob> or you notice your colleague <eob> who has stopped <eol> straightening her hair to work, <eob> do not simply approach her <eol> and admire <eob> and ask her if you can touch it — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Really appreciate her. <eob> Applaud her. <eob> Heck, even high-five her <eol> if that's what you feel so inclined to do. <eob>
Because this -- <eob> this is more than about a hairstyle. <eob>
It's about self-love and self-worth. <eob>
It's about being brave enough <eob> not to fold under the pressure <eol> of others' expectations. <eob>
And about knowing that making the decision <eol> to stray from the norm <eob> does not define who we are, <eob> but it simply reveals who we are. <eob>
And finally, <eob> being brave is easier <eob> when we can count <eol> on the compassion of others. <eob>
So after today, <eob> I certainly hope that we can count on you. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Michael Browning: engineer, <eob> innovator -- <eob> inventor, really -- <eob> and inspiring father. <eob>
He had a passion for flight, <eol> as you can kind of sense <eob> from that rather dubious <eol> 1970s office-leaving present. <eob>
And some 40 years after that was created, <eob> a small group of us got together <eob> to have a go, <eob> a run at the whole challenge of flight <eol> that inspired people for years, <eob> and do it in a very different kind of way. <eob>
And that's the journey I'd like <eol> to share with you now. <eob>
The starting hypothesis was one <eol> of the human mind and body, <eob> which, as you've seen <eol> for the last few days here, <eob> is an amazing construct. <eob>
What if you augmented <eol> that wonderful machine <eob> with just the right technology? <eob>
If you approach flight <eol> in that kind of real way, <eob> where could you get to? <eob>
So my training partner here <eol> back in London, Denton, <eob> is doing a much better job <eol> of that kind of stuff than me. <eob> Guess what? It's London. <eob> The idea was that you augment that. <eob>
And so, how do you augment that? <eob>
Well, we bought one of these. <eob>
This is a micro gas turbine. <eob>
This was ground zero, <eob> so that little piece of kit <eol> proved really quite impressive, <eob> so we got two in a field. <eob>
The real hero here, by the way, <eol> is, right in the background, <eob> there's a lady tending some vegetables, <eob> who does a brilliant job <eol> of trying to ignore us for a while -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I think the only thing less happy <eol> is the grass, <eob> that we did probably damage <eol> quite badly. <eob>
You get an idea of the thrust here, <eob> when I try to hold them horizontally <eol> and somewhat fail. <eob>
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there. <eob>
We were quite impressed with that. <eob>
We thought we were getting somewhere. <eob>
So there's only one sensible way <eol> to go from there: <eob> you get four. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I have to say, I still like <eol> watching these back. <eob>
So then we thought well, let's try <eol> and spread the load a bit. <eob>
The legs are designed to take the load, <eob> so why don't we spread it out a bit? <eob>
That bit was good. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> The harness -- <eob> a nice idea but it didn't really work, <eob> as you'll see now. <eob> This whole journey was very much <eol> about trying things -- <eob>
Yeah, it really didn't work, did it? <eob>
Trying things and learning <eol> by failing at them most of the time. <eob>
And that included failing by falling over. <eob>
If you notice, we've got <eol> five engines here -- <eob> not to be put off by the fact <eol> one was in maintenance, <eob> still had a go. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I pinched a fuel line. <eob>
So again, good learning. <eob>
We learned not to do that again. <eob>
This was a blind alley. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This was three on each arm -- <eob> that was ridiculous. <eob>
That was 70 kilos on each arm. <eob>
Again, struck that one off. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we were starting to make <eol> some really quite convincing progress, <eob> just enough to make you <eol> believe that maybe -- <eob> maybe we could get there. <eob>
You can see, look -- tantalizing. <eob>
The model of one on each leg <eol> and two on each arm, <eob> on paper, that was enough thrust. <eob>
And then we did what <eol> I'm about to show you now, <eob> and I still love watching this one. <eob>
This was our first six-second, <eol> reasonably coherent flight. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
That was the point where <eol> this endeavor went from: <eob> "I'm really not sure <eol> this is going to work," <eob> to: "Oh my god, it does work!" <eob> From there on we then refined it, <eob> but we carried on falling over a lot. <eob>
Falling over, like I say, is definitely <eol> the best way to learn. <eob>
After a while, we starting <eol> really refining the layout of all of this. <eob>
And you'll see, <eol> that's stability and control -- <eob> there's no wires there or anything -- <eob> that's a combination of us <eol> refining the technology, <eob> including with a Tupperware box <eol> on the back for the electronics <eob> and actually learning <eol> the balance and control. <eob>
I'm now going to save your ears <eol> for the next short piece <eob> and talk over it. <eob>
After a while, the jet engine <eol> noise is a bit annoying. <eob>
This is only a few weeks ago. <eob>
You can see the stability and control <eol> is really quite nice, <eob> and I'd like to think this somewhat <eol> validates that starting hypothesis, <eob> that the human mind and body, <eol> if properly augmented in that way, <eob> can achieve some pretty cool stuff. <eob>
I mean, like I said: <eob> I'm not thinking about where <eol> I'm moving my arms at that stage. <eob>
I'm looking at the objective <eol> of where I want to get to, <eob> and a bit like riding a bike, <eob> my arms are just doing their thing. <eob>
It's a very strange experience. <eob>
So where is all this headed? <eob>
I'll talk over this landing — <eob> I think I land in this one. <eob>
Well, I don't think anybody's going <eol> to go down to Walmart <eob> or take the kids to school <eol> in any of this stuff for a while, <eob> but the team at Gravity are building <eol> some awesome technology <eob> that's going to make <eol> this look like child's play. <eob>
We're working on some things <eob> that will seek to bring <eol> this unusual experience of flight <eob> to a wider audience, beyond the events <eol> and displays we're doing. <eob>
We're even starting to look <eol> for pilots two and three, <eob> if there's any volunteers. <eob>
I've got this vision. <eob>
It sounds audacious, <eol> but let's just stick it out there, <eob> that one day maybe we can <eol> rise up above a beach, <eob> fly up and down the coastline <eol> of it, rise up a bit higher, <eob> with some of the safety kit <eol> we're working on to make this achievable. <eob>
Then over the horizon comes <eol> a Hercules with the ramp down. <eob>
As it comes past, <eol> you start picking up speed <eob> and see if we can intercept -- <eob> from the rear, not the front, <eol> that would be a mistake -- <eob> and then try and land in the back. <eob>
And as I say, that's a little <eol> way off at the moment. <eob>
But this is also, if I take <eol> a big step back from this, <eob> this is also a very <eol> personal journey for me. <eob>
Back to that lovely photo, <eob> or photo in a picture. <eob>
Sadly, my father took <eol> his own life when I was 15, <eob> and left an awful lot <eol> of unfulfilled ambition. <eob>
He was a wonderful inventor, <eob> a maverick creator. <eob>
And I'd just like to think, <eol> if it was possible, <eob> if he was looking down, <eob> he would be -- <eob> he'd certainly be smiling at some <eol> of the things we've done here, <eob> I think. <eob>
So, it's a tribute to him. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Voice-over) Richard Browning: <eol> I'm probably more nervous <eob> about doing the demo after this. <eob>
I've got a lot of things <eol> to get done today. <eob>
Worst-case scenario, <eol> we don't get a clean start. <eob>
Or we get an unplanned failure <eol> while I'm actually flying around. <eob>
This is why we keep it very low, <eob> so the worst is I just look like an idiot <eol> and fall on my rear, as I said. <eob>
So you can all enjoy that if that happens. <eob>
(Music) <eob> (Jet engine accelerates) <eob>
I'm going to speak to you <eol> about the global refugee crisis <eob> and my aim is to show you that this crisis <eob> is manageable, not unsolvable, <eob> but also show you that this is as much about us <eol> and who we are <eob> as it is a trial <eol> of the refugees on the front line. <eob>
For me, this is not <eol> just a professional obligation, <eob> because I run an NGO supporting refugees <eol> and displaced people around the world. <eob> It's personal. <eob>
I love this picture. <eob> That really handsome guy on the right, <eob> that's not me. <eob>
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940 <eob> with his father Samuel. <eob>
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium. <eob>
They fled the day the Nazis invaded. <eob>
And <eob> I love this picture, <eob> too. <eob>
It's a group of refugee children <eob> arriving in England in 1946 from Poland. <eob>
And in the middle is my mother, Marion. <eob>
She was sent to start a new life <eob> in a new country <eob> on her own <eob> at the age of 12. <eob>
I know this: <eob> if Britain had not admitted refugees <eob> in the 1940s, <eob> I certainly would not be here today. <eob>
Yet 70 years on, <eol> the wheel has come full circle. <eob>
The sound is of walls being built, <eob> vengeful political rhetoric, <eob> humanitarian values and principles on fire <eob> in the very countries <eol> that 70 years ago said never again <eob> to statelessness and hopelessness <eol> for the victims of war. <eob>
Last year, every minute, <eob> 24 more people were displaced <eol> from their homes <eob> by conflict, violence and persecution: <eob> another chemical weapon attack in Syria, <eob> the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan, <eob> girls driven from their school <eol> in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram. <eob>
These are not people <eol> moving to another country <eob> to get a better life. <eob>
They're fleeing for their lives. <eob>
It's a real tragedy <eob> that the world's most famous refugee <eol> can't come to speak to you here today. <eob>
Many of you will know this picture. <eob>
It shows the lifeless body <eob> of five-year-old Alan Kurdi, <eob> a Syrian refugee who died <eol> in the Mediterranean in 2015. <eob> He died alongside 3,700 others <eol> trying to get to Europe. <eob>
The next year, 2016, <eob> 5,000 people died. <eob>
It's too late for them, <eob> but it's not too late <eol> for millions of others. <eob>
It's not too late <eol> for people like Frederick. <eob>
I met him in the Nyarugusu <eol> refugee camp in Tanzania. <eob>
He's from Burundi. <eob>
He wanted to know <eol> where could he complete his studies. <eob>
He'd done 11 years of schooling. <eol> He wanted a 12th year. <eob>
He said to me, "I pray <eol> that my days do not end here <eob> in this refugee camp." <eob>
And it's not too late for Halud. <eob>
Her parents were Palestinian refugees <eob> living in the Yarmouk refugee camp <eol> outside Damascus. <eob>
She was born to refugee parents, <eob> and now she's a refugee <eol> herself in Lebanon. <eob>
She's working for the International <eol> Rescue Committee to help other refugees, <eob> but she has no certainty at all <eob> about her future, <eob> where it is or what it holds. <eob>
This talk is about Frederick, about Halud <eob> and about millions like them: <eob> why they're displaced, <eob> how they survive, what help they need <eol> and what our responsibilities are. <eob>
I truly believe this, <eob> that the biggest question <eol> in the 21st century <eob> concerns our duty to strangers. <eob>
The future "you" is about your duties <eob> to strangers. <eob>
You know better than anyone, <eob> the world is more connected <eol> than ever before, <eob> yet the great danger <eob> is that we're consumed by our divisions. <eob>
And there is no better test of that <eob> than how we treat refugees. <eob>
Here are the facts: 65 million people <eob> displaced from their homes <eol> by violence and persecution last year. <eob>
If it was a country, <eob> that would be the 21st <eol> largest country in the world. <eob>
Most of those people, about 40 million, <eol> stay within their own home country, <eob> but 25 million are refugees. <eob>
That means they cross a border <eol> into a neighboring state. <eob>
Most of them are living in poor countries, <eob> relatively poor or lower-middle-income <eol> countries, like Lebanon, <eob> where Halud is living. <eob>
In Lebanon, one <eol> in four people is a refugee, <eob> a quarter of the whole population. <eob>
And refugees stay for a long time. <eob>
The average length of displacement <eob> is 10 years. <eob>
I went to what was the world's <eol> largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya. <eob>
It's called Dadaab. <eob>
It was built in 1991-92 <eob> as a "temporary camp" <eol> for Somalis fleeing the civil war. <eob> I met Silo. <eob> And naïvely I said to Silo, <eob> "Do you think you'll ever <eol> go home to Somalia?" <eob> And she said, "What do you mean, go home? <eob>
I was born here." <eob> And then when I asked the camp management <eob> how many of the 330,000 people <eol> in that camp were born there, <eob> they gave me the answer: <eob> 100,000. <eob>
That's what long-term displacement means. <eob>
Now, the causes of this are deep: <eob> weak states that can't <eol> support their own people, <eob> an international political system <eob> weaker than at any time since 1945 <eob> and differences over theology, governance, <eol> engagement with the outside world <eob> in significant parts of the Muslim world. <eob>
Now, those are long-term, <eol> generational challenges. <eob>
That's why I say that this refugee crisis <eol> is a trend and not a blip. <eob>
And it's complex, and when you have <eol> big, large, long-term, complex problems, <eob> people think nothing can be done. <eob>
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa, <eob> off the coast of Italy, in 2014, <eob> he accused all of us <eol> and the global population <eob> of what he called <eol> "the globalization of indifference." <eob> It's a haunting phrase. <eob>
It means that our hearts <eol> have turned to stone. <eob>
Now, I don't know, you tell me. <eob> Are you allowed to argue with the Pope, <eol> even at a TED conference? <eob>
But I think it's not right. <eob>
I think people do want <eol> to make a difference, <eob> but they just don't know whether <eol> there are any solutions to this crisis. <eob>
And what I want to tell you today <eob> is that though the problems are real, <eol> the solutions are real, too. <eob>
Solution one: <eob> these refugees need to get into work <eol> in the countries where they're living, <eob> and the countries where they're living <eol> need massive economic support. <eob>
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study: <eob> 80 percent of refugees <eol> in the capital city Kampala <eob> needed no humanitarian aid <eol> because they were working. <eob>
They were supported into work. <eob>
Solution number two: <eob> education for kids <eol> is a lifeline, not a luxury, <eob> when you're displaced for so long. <eob>
Kids can bounce back when they're given <eol> the proper social, emotional support <eob> alongside literacy and numeracy. <eob>
I've seen it for myself. <eob>
But half of the world's refugee <eol> children of primary school age <eob> get no education at all, <eob> and three-quarters of secondary school <eol> age get no education at all. <eob> That's crazy. <eob>
Solution number three: <eob> most refugees are in urban areas, <eol> in cities, not in camps. <eob>
What would you or I want <eol> if we were a refugee in a city? <eob>
We would want money <eol> to pay rent or buy clothes. <eob>
That is the future <eol> of the humanitarian system, <eob> or a significant part of it: <eob> give people cash so that <eol> you boost the power of refugees <eob> and you'll help the local economy. <eob>
And there's a fourth solution, too, <eob> that's controversial <eol> but needs to be talked about. <eob>
The most vulnerable refugees <eol> need to be given a new start <eob> and a new life <eob> in a new country, <eob> including in the West. <eob>
The numbers are relatively small, <eol> hundreds of thousands, not millions, <eob> but the symbolism is huge. <eob>
Now is not the time <eol> to be banning refugees, <eob> as the Trump administration proposes. <eob>
It's a time to be embracing people <eol> who are victims of terror. <eob> And remember -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Remember, anyone who asks you, <eol> "Are they properly vetted?" <eob> that's a really sensible <eol> and good question to ask. <eob>
The truth is, refugees <eol> arriving for resettlement <eob> are more vetted than any other population <eol> arriving in our countries. <eob>
So while it's reasonable <eol> to ask the question, <eob> it's not reasonable to say that refugee <eol> is another word for terrorist. <eob>
Now, what happens -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What happens when refugees can't get work, <eob> they can't get their kids into school, <eob> they can't get cash, <eol> they can't get a legal route to hope? <eob>
What happens is they take risky journeys. <eob>
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful <eol> Greek island, two years ago. <eob>
It's a home to 90,000 people. <eob>
In one year, 500,000 refugees <eol> went across the island. <eob>
And I want to show you what I saw <eob> when I drove across <eol> to the north of the island: <eob> a pile of life jackets <eol> of those who had made it to shore. <eob>
And when I looked closer, <eob> there were small <eol> life jackets for children, <eob> yellow ones. <eob>
And I took this picture. <eob>
You probably can't see the writing, <eol> but I want to read it for you. <eob> "Warning: will not <eol> protect against drowning." <eob> So in the 21st century, <eob> children are being given life jackets <eob> to reach safety in Europe <eob> even though those jackets <eol> will not save their lives <eob> if they fall out of the boat <eol> that is taking them there. <eob>
This is not just a crisis, it's a test. <eob>
It's a test that civilizations <eol> have faced down the ages. <eob>
It's a test of our humanity. <eob>
It's a test of us in the Western world <eob> of who we are and what we stand for. <eob>
It's a test of our character, <eol> not just our policies. <eob>
And refugees are a hard case. <eob>
They do come from faraway <eol> parts of the world. <eob>
They have been through trauma. <eob>
They're often of a different religion. <eob>
Those are precisely the reasons <eol> we should be helping refugees, <eob> not a reason not to help them. <eob>
And it's a reason to help them <eol> because of what it says about us. <eob>
It's revealing of our values. <eob>
Empathy and altruism are two <eol> of the foundations of civilization. <eob>
Turn that empathy and altruism into action <eob> and we live out a basic moral credo. <eob>
And in the modern world, <eol> we have no excuse. <eob>
We can't say we don't know <eol> what's happening in Juba, South Sudan, <eob> or Aleppo, Syria. <eob>
It's there, in our smartphone <eob> in our hand. <eob>
Ignorance is no excuse at all. <eob>
Fail to help, and we show <eol> we have no moral compass at all. <eob>
It's also revealing about <eol> whether we know our own history. <eob>
The reason that refugees <eol> have rights around the world <eob> is because of extraordinary <eol> Western leadership <eob> by statesmen and women <eol> after the Second World War <eob> that became universal rights. <eob>
Trash the protections of refugees, <eol> and we trash our own history. <eob> This is -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is also revealing <eol> about the power of democracy <eob> as a refuge from dictatorship. <eob>
How many politicians have you heard say, <eob> "We believe in the power of our example, <eol> not the example of our power." <eob> What they mean is what we stand for <eol> is more important than the bombs we drop. <eob>
Refugees seeking sanctuary <eob> have seen the West as a source <eol> of hope and a place of haven. <eob>
Russians, Iranians, <eob> Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans, <eob> they've come to the West for safety. <eob>
We throw that away at our peril. <eob>
And there's one other thing <eol> it reveals about us: <eob> whether we have any humility <eol> for our own mistakes. <eob>
I'm not one of these people <eob> who believes that all the problems <eol> in the world are caused by the West. <eob> They're not. <eob> But when we make mistakes, <eol> we should recognize it. <eob>
It's not an accident <eol> that the country which has taken <eob> more refugees than any other, <eol> the United States, <eob> has taken more refugees from Vietnam <eol> than any other country. <eob>
It speaks to the history. <eob>
But there's more recent history, <eol> in Iraq and Afghanistan. <eob>
You can't make up <eol> for foreign policy errors <eob> by humanitarian action, <eob> but when you break something, <eol> you have a duty to try to help repair it, <eob> and that's our duty now. <eob>
Do you remember <eol> at the beginning of the talk, <eob> I said I wanted to explain <eol> that the refugee crisis <eob> was manageable, not insoluble? <eob> That's true. I want you <eol> to think in a new way, <eob> but I also want you to do things. <eob>
If you're an employer, <eob> hire refugees. <eob>
If you're persuaded by the arguments, <eob> take on the myths <eob> when family or friends <eol> or workmates repeat them. <eob>
If you've got money, give it to charities <eob> that make a difference <eol> for refugees around the world. <eob>
If you're a citizen, <eob> vote for politicians <eob> who will put into practice <eol> the solutions that I've talked about. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The duty to strangers <eob> shows itself <eob> in small ways and big, <eob> prosaic and heroic. <eob>
In 1942, <eob> my aunt and my grandmother <eol> were living in Brussels <eob> under German occupation. <eob>
They received a summons <eob> from the Nazi authorities <eol> to go to Brussels Railway Station. <eob>
My grandmother immediately thought <eol> something was amiss. <eob>
She pleaded with her relatives <eob> not to go to Brussels Railway Station. <eob>
Her relatives said to her, <eob> "If we don't go, <eol> if we don't do what we're told, <eob> then we're going to be in trouble." <eob> You can guess what happened <eob> to the relatives who went <eol> to Brussels Railway Station. <eob>
They were never seen again. <eob>
But my grandmother and my aunt, <eob> they went to a small village <eob> south of Brussels <eob> where they'd been on holiday <eol> in the decade before, <eob> and they presented themselves <eol> at the house of the local farmer, <eob> a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice, <eob> and they asked him to take them in. <eob>
And he did, <eob> and by the end of the war, <eob> 17 Jews, I was told, <eol> were living in that village. <eob>
And when I was teenager, <eol> I asked my aunt, <eob> "Can you take me to meet <eol> Monsieur Maurice?" <eob> And she said, "Yeah, I can. <eob>
He's still alive. <eob>
Let's go and see him. <eob> "And so, it must have been '83,' 84, <eob> we went to see him. <eob>
And I suppose, like only a teenager could, <eob> when I met him, <eob> he was this white-haired gentleman, <eob> I said to him, <eob> "Why did you do it? <eob>
Why did you take that risk? <eob> "And he looked at me and he shrugged, <eob> and he said, in French," <eob> On doit. "" One must. <eob> "It was innate in him. <eob> It was natural. <eob> And my point to you is it should be <eol> natural and innate in us, too. <eob>
Tell yourself, <eob> this refugee crisis <eob> is manageable, not unsolvable, <eob> and each one of us <eob> has a personal responsibility <eol> to help make it so. <eob>
Because this is about the rescue <eol> of us and our values <eob> as well as the rescue <eol> of refugees and their lives. <eob>
Thank you very much indeed. <eob>
Bruno Giussani: David, thank you. <eob>
David Miliband: Thank you. <eob>
BG: Those are strong suggestions <eob> and your call for individual <eol> responsibility is very strong as well, <eob> but I'm troubled <eol> by one thought, and it's this: <eob> you mentioned, and these are your words, <eol> "extraordinary Western leadership" <eob> which led 60-something years ago <eob> to the whole discussion <eol> about human rights, <eob> to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc. <eob> That leadership <eol> happened after a big trauma <eob> and happened in <eol> a consensual political space, <eob> and now we are <eol> in a divisive political space. <eob>
Actually, refugees have become <eol> one of the divisive issues. <eob>
So where will leadership come from today? <eob>
DM: Well, I think that you're right to say <eob> that the leadership forged in war <eob> has a different temper <eol> and a different tempo <eob> and a different outlook <eob> than leadership forged in peace. <eob>
And so my answer would be <eol> the leadership has got to come from below, <eob> not from above. <eob>
I mean, a recurring theme <eol> of the conference this week <eob> has been about <eol> the democratization of power. <eob>
And we've got to preserve <eol> our own democracies, <eob> but we've got to also activate <eol> our own democracies. <eob>
And when people say to me, <eob> "There's a backlash against refugees," <eob> what I say to them is, <eob> "No, there's a polarization, <eob> and at the moment, <eob> those who are fearful <eol> are making more noise <eob> than those who are proud." <eob> And so my answer to your question <eol> is that we will sponsor and encourage <eob> and give confidence to leadership <eob> when we mobilize ourselves. <eob>
And I think that when you are <eol> in a position of looking for leadership, <eob> you have to look inside <eob> and mobilize in your own community <eob> to try to create conditions <eol> for a different kind of settlement. <eob>
BG: Thank you, David. <eob>
Thanks for coming to TED. <eob>
I just want to share with you <eob> what I have been experiencing <eol> over the last five years <eob> in having the great privilege <eol> of traveling <eob> to many of the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
This scene is one I see <eol> all the time everywhere, <eob> and these young children <eol> are looking at a smartphone, <eob> and the smartphone is having a huge impact <eol> in even the poorest countries. <eob>
I said to my team, you know, <eob> what I see is a rise in aspirations <eol> all over the world. <eob>
In fact, it seems to me <eol> that there's a convergence of aspirations. <eob>
And I asked a team of economists <eol> to actually look into this. <eob> Is this true? <eob> Are aspirations converging <eol> all around the world? <eob>
So they looked at things like Gallup polls <eol> about satisfaction in life <eob> and what they learned was <eol> that if you have access to the internet, <eob> your satisfaction goes up. <eob>
But another thing happens <eol> that's very important: <eob> your reference income, <eob> the income to which you compare your own, <eob> also goes up. <eob>
Now, if the reference income <eol> of a nation, for example, <eob> goes up 10 percent <eob> by comparing themselves to the outside, <eob> then on average, <eob> people's own incomes <eol> have to go up at least five percent <eob> to maintain the same <eol> level of satisfaction. <eob>
But when you get down <eol> into the lower percentiles of income, <eob> your income has to go up much more <eob> if the reference income <eob> goes up 10 percent, <eob> something like 20 percent. <eob>
And so with this rise of aspirations, <eob> the fundamental question is: <eob> Are we going to have a situation <eob> where aspirations <eol> are linked to opportunity <eob> and you get dynamism and economic growth, <eob> like that which happened <eol> in the country I was born in, in Korea? <eob>
Or are aspirations <eol> going to meet frustration? <eob>
This is a real concern, <eol> because between 2012 and 2015, <eob> terrorism incidents <eol> increased by 74 percent. <eob>
The number of deaths from terrorism <eol> went up 150 percent. <eob>
Right now, two billion people <eob> live in conditions <eol> of fragility, conflict, violence, <eob> and by 2030, more than 60 percent <eol> of the world's poor <eob> will live in these situations <eol> of fragility, conflict and violence. <eob>
And so what do we do <eol> about meeting these aspirations? <eob>
Are there new ways of thinking <eob> about how we can rise <eol> to meet these aspirations? <eob>
Because if we don't, <eol> I'm extremely worried. <eob>
Aspirations are rising as never before <eol> because of access to the internet. <eob>
Everyone knows how everyone else lives. <eob>
Has our ability to meet those aspirations <eob> risen as well? <eob>
And just to get at the details of this, <eob> I want to share with you <eol> my own personal story. <eob>
This is not my mother, <eob> but during the Korean War, <eob> my mother literally took her own sister, <eob> her younger sister, on her back, <eob> and walked at least part of the way <eob> to escape Seoul during the Korean War. <eob>
Now, through a series of miracles, <eob> my mother and father both got <eol> scholarships to go to New York City. <eob>
They actually met in New York City <eol> and got married in New York City. <eob>
My father, too, was a refugee. <eob>
At the age of 19, he left his family <eol> in the northern part of the country, <eob> escaped through the border <eob> and never saw his family again. <eob>
Now, when they were married <eol> and living in New York, <eob> my father was a waiter <eol> at Patricia Murphy's restaurant. <eob>
Their aspirations went up. <eob>
They understood what it was like <eol> to live in a place like New York City <eob> in the 1950s. <eob>
Well, my brother was born <eol> and they came back to Korea, <eob> and we had what I remember <eol> as kind of an idyllic life, <eob> but what was happening <eol> in Korea at that time <eob> was the country was one <eol> of the poorest in the world <eob> and there was political upheaval. <eob>
There were demonstrations just down <eol> the street from our house all the time, <eob> students protesting <eol> against the military government. <eob>
And at the time, <eob> the aspirations of the World Bank Group, <eol> the organization I lead now, <eob> were extremely low for Korea. <eob>
Their idea was that Korea would <eol> find it difficult without foreign aid <eob> to provide its people with more <eol> than the bare necessities of life. <eob>
So the situation is <eol> Korea is in a tough position, <eob> my parents have seen <eol> what life is like in the United States. <eob>
They got married there. <eob>
My brother was born there. <eob>
And they felt that in order <eol> to give us an opportunity <eob> to reach their aspirations for us, <eob> we had to go and come back <eol> to the United States. <eob>
Now, we came back. <eob> First we went to Dallas. <eob>
My father did his dental degree <eol> all over again. <eob>
And then we ended up <eol> moving to Iowa, of all places. <eob>
We grew up in Iowa. <eob>
And in Iowa, we went <eol> through the whole course. <eob>
I went to high school, I went to college. <eob>
And then one day, <eol> something that I'll never forget, <eob> my father picked me up <eol> after my sophomore year in college, <eob> and he was driving me home, <eob> and he said, "Jim, <eol> what are your aspirations? <eob> What do you want to study? <eol> What do you want to do?" <eob> And I said, "Dad," -- <eob> My mother actually was a philosopher, <eol> and had filled us with ideas <eob> about protest and social justice, <eob> and I said, "Dad, I'm going to study <eol> political science and philosophy, <eob> and I'm going to become <eol> part of a political movement." <eob> My father, the Korean dentist, <eob> slowly pulled the car <eol> over to the side of the road -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He looked back at me, and he said, <eob> "Jim, you finish your medical residency, <eol> you can study anything you want." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I've told this story <eol> to a mostly Asian audience before. <eob> Nobody laughs. They just shake their head. <eob> Of course. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, tragically, my father <eol> died at a young age, <eob> 30 years ago at the age of 57, <eob> what happens to be <eol> how old I am right now, <eob> and when he died in the middle <eol> of my medical and graduate studies — <eob> You see, I actually got around it <eol> by doing medicine and anthropology. <eob>
I studied both of them in graduate school. <eob>
But then right about that time, <eol> I met these two people, <eob> Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer. <eob>
And Paul and I were in the same program. <eob>
We were studying medicine <eob> and at the same time <eol> getting our PhD's in anthropology. <eob>
And we began to ask <eol> some pretty fundamental questions. <eob>
For people who have the great privilege <eol> of studying medicine and anthropology -- <eob> I had come from parents who were refugees. <eob>
Paul grew up literally <eol> in a bus in a swamp in Florida. <eob>
He liked to call himself "white trash." <eob> And so we had this opportunity <eob> and we said, <eob> what is it that we need to do? <eob>
Given our ridiculously <eol> elaborate educations, <eob> what is the nature <eol> of our responsibility to the world? <eob>
And we decided that we needed <eol> to start an organization. <eob>
It's called Partners in Health. <eob>
And by the way, <eol> there's a movie made about that. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's a movie <eol> that was just a brilliant movie <eob> they made about it <eol> called "Bending the Arc." <eob> It launched at Sundance this past January. <eob>
Jeff Skoll is here. <eob>
Jeff is one of the ones <eol> who made it happen. <eob>
And we began to think <eol> about what it would take for us <eob> to actually have our aspirations <eol> reach the level <eob> of some of the poorest <eol> communities in the world. <eob>
This is my very first visit <eol> to Haiti in 1988, <eob> and in 1988, we elaborated <eol> a sort of mission statement, <eob> which is we are going to make <eol> a preferential option for the poor <eob> in health. <eob>
Now, it took us a long time, and we <eol> were graduate students in anthropology. <eob>
We were reading up one side of Marx <eol> and down the other. <eob> Habermas. Fernand Braudel. <eob> We were reading everything <eob> and we had to come to a conclusion <eol> of how are we going to structure our work? <eob>
So "O for the P," we called it, <eob> a preferential option for the poor. <eob>
The most important thing about <eob> a preferential option for the poor <eob> is what it's not. <eob>
It's not a preferential option <eol> for your own sense of heroism. <eob> It's not a preferential option <eob> for your own idea about <eol> how to lift the poor out of poverty. <eob> It's not a preferential option <eol> for your own organization. <eob>
And the hardest of all, <eob> it's not a preferential option <eol> for your poor. <eob>
It's <eob> a preferential option for the poor. <eob>
So what do you do? <eob> Well, Haiti, we started building -- <eob> Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing <eob> is just focus on vaccination <eol> and maybe a feeding program. <eob>
But what the Haitians wanted <eol> was a hospital. <eob> They wanted schools. <eob> They wanted to provide their children <eol> with the opportunities <eob> that they'd been hearing about <eol> from others, relatives, for example, <eob> who had gone to the United States. <eob>
They wanted the same kinds <eol> of opportunities as my parents did. <eob> I recognized them. <eob> And so that's what we did. <eol> We built hospitals. <eob> We provided education. <eob> And we did everything we could <eol> to try to give them opportunities. <eob>
Now, my experience really became intense <eob> at Partners in Health <eol> in this community, Carabayllo, <eob> in the northern slums of Lima, Peru. <eob>
And in this community, <eob> we started out by really just going <eol> to people's homes and talking to people, <eob> and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic <eol> of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. <eob> This is Melquiades. <eob> Melquiades was a patient at that time, <eol> he was about 18 years old, <eob> and he had a very difficult form <eol> of drug-resistant tuberculosis. <eob>
All of the gurus in the world, <eol> the global health gurus, <eob> said it is not cost-effective <eol> to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. <eob>
It's too complicated. <eob>
It's too expensive. <eob>
You just can't do it. It can't be done. <eob> And in addition, <eol> they were getting angry at us, <eob> because the implication was <eob> if it could be done, <eol> we would have done it. <eob>
Who do you think you are? <eob>
And the people that we fought with <eol> were the World Health Organization <eob> and probably the organization <eol> we fought with most <eob> was the World Bank Group. <eob>
Now, we did everything we could <eob> to convince Melquiades <eol> to take his medicines, <eob> because it's really hard, <eob> and not once during the time of treatment <eol> did Melquiades's family ever say, <eob> "Hey, you know, Melquiades <eol> is just not cost-effective. <eob>
Why don't you go on <eol> and treat somebody else?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I hadn't seen Melquiades <eol> for about 10 years <eob> and when we had <eol> our annual meetings in Lima, Peru <eob> a couple of years ago, <eob> the filmmakers found him <eob> and here is us getting together. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
He has become a bit of a media star <eol> because he goes to the film openings, <eob> and he knows how to work an audience now. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But as soon as we won -- <eob> We did win. We won the argument. <eob>
You should treat <eol> multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -- <eob> we heard the same arguments <eol> in the early 2000s about HIV. <eob>
All of the leading global health <eol> people in the world said <eob> it is impossible <eol> to treat HIV in poor countries. <eob>
Too expensive, too complicated, <eol> you can't do it. <eob>
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment, <eob> it's actually easier. <eob>
And we were seeing patients like this. <eob> Joseph Jeune. <eob> Joseph Jeune also never mentioned <eol> that he was not cost-effective. <eob>
A few months of medicines, <eol> and this is what he looked like. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We call that the Lazarus Effect <eol> of HIV treatment. <eob>
Joseline came to us looking like this. <eob>
This is what she looked like <eol> a few months later. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, our argument, our battle, we thought, <eob> was with the organizations <eol> that kept saying it's not cost-effective. <eob>
We were saying, no, <eob> preferential option for the poor <eol> requires us to raise our aspirations <eob> to meet those of the poor for themselves. <eob>
And they said, well, that's a nice thought <eol> but it's just not cost-effective. <eob>
So in the nerdy way <eol> that we have operated Partners in Health, <eob> we wrote a book against, <eol> basically, the World Bank. <eob>
It says that because the World Bank <eob> has focused so much <eol> on just economic growth <eob> and said that governments <eol> have to shrink their budgets <eob> and reduce expenditures <eol> in health, education and social welfare -- <eob> we thought that was fundamentally wrong. <eob>
And we argued with the World Bank. <eob>
And then a crazy thing happened. <eob>
President Obama nominated me <eol> to be President of the World Bank. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, when I went to do the vetting process <eol> with President Obama's team, <eob> they had a copy of "Dying For Growth," <eol> and they had read every page. <eob>
And I said, "OK, that's it, right? <eob>
You guys are going to drop me?" <eob> He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK." <eob> And I was nominated, <eob> and I walked through the door <eol> of the World Bank Group in July of 2012, <eob> and that statement on the wall, <eol> "Our dream is a world free of poverty." <eob> A few months after that, <eol> we actually turned it into a goal: <eob> end extreme poverty by 2030, <eob> boost shared prosperity. <eob>
That's what we do now <eol> at the World Bank Group. <eob>
I feel like I have brought <eol> the preferential option for the poor <eob> to the World Bank Group. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But this is TED, <eob> and so I want to share <eol> with you some concerns, <eob> and then make a proposal. <eob>
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, <eob> now, you guys know <eol> so much better than I do, <eob> but here's the thing that concerns me. <eob>
What we hear about is job loss. <eol> You've all heard that. <eob>
Our own data suggest to us <eol> that two thirds of all jobs, <eob> currently existing jobs <eol> in developing countries, <eob> will be lost because of automation. <eob>
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs. <eob>
Now, one of the ways <eol> to make up for those jobs <eob> is to turn community health workers <eol> into a formal labor force. <eob>
That's what we want to do. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We think the numbers will work out, <eob> that as health outcomes get better <eol> and as people have formal work, <eob> we're going to be able to train them <eob> with the soft-skills training <eol> that you add to it <eob> to become workers <eol> that will have a huge impact, <eob> and that may be the one area <eol> that grows the most. <eob>
But here's the other thing <eol> that bothers me: <eob> right now it seems pretty clear to me <eol> that the jobs of the future <eob> will be more digitally demanding, <eob> and there is a crisis <eol> in childhood stunting. <eob>
So these are photos from Charles Nelson, <eol> who shared these with us <eob> from Harvard Medical School. <eob>
And what these photos show <eol> on the one side, on the left side, <eob> is a three-month-old who has been stunted: <eob> not adequate nutrition, <eol> not adequate stimulation. <eob>
And on the other side, <eol> of course, is a normal child, <eob> and the normal child <eol> has all of these neuronal connections. <eob>
Now, the neuronal connections <eol> are important, <eob> because that is <eol> the definition of human capital. <eob>
Now, we know that we <eol> can reduce these rates. <eob>
We can reduce these rates <eol> of childhood stunting quickly, <eob> but if we don't, India, for example, <eol> with 38 percent childhood stunting, <eob> how are they going to compete <eol> in the economy of the future <eob> if 40 percent of their future workers <eol> cannot achieve educationally <eob> and certainly we worry <eol> about achieving economically <eob> in a way that will help <eol> the country as a whole grow. <eob> Now, what are we going to do? <eob>
78 trillion dollars <eol> is the size of the global economy. <eob>
8.55 trillion dollars are sitting <eol> in negative interest rate bonds. <eob>
That means that you give <eol> the German central bank your money <eob> and then you pay them to keep your money. <eob>
That's a negative interest rate bond. <eob>
24.4 trillion dollars <eol> in very low-earning government bonds. <eob>
And 8 trillion literally sitting <eol> in the hands of rich people <eob> under their very large mattresses. <eob>
What we are trying to do <eol> is now use our own tools -- <eob> and just to get nerdy for a second, <eob> we're talking about <eol> first-loss risk debt instruments, <eob> we're talking about derisking, <eol> blended finance, <eob> we're talking about <eol> political risk insurance, <eob> credit enhancement -- <eob> all these things that I've now learned <eol> at the World Bank Group <eob> that rich people use every single day <eol> to make themselves richer, <eob> but we haven't used aggressively enough <eol> on behalf of the poor <eob> to bring this capital in. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So does this work? <eob> Can you actually bring <eol> private-sector players into a country <eob> and really make things work? <eob>
Well, we've done it a couple of times. <eob>
This is Zambia, Scaling Solar. <eob>
It's a box-set solution <eol> from the World Bank <eob> where we come in <eol> and we do all the things you need <eob> to attract private-sector investors. <eob>
And in this case, Zambia went <eol> from having a cost of electricity <eob> at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour, <eob> and by just doing simple things, <eol> doing the auction, <eob> changing some policies, <eob> we were able to bring the cost down. <eob>
Lowest bid, <eob> 25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia? <eob>
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents <eol> a kilowatt-hour. It's possible. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But here's my proposal for you. <eob> This is from a group called Zipline, <eob> a cool company, and they <eol> literally are rocket scientists. <eob>
They figured out <eol> how to use drones in Rwanda. <eob>
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda <eob> that delivers blood <eol> anywhere in the country <eob> in less than an hour. <eob>
So we save lives, <eob> this program saved lives -- <eob>
This program made money for Zipline <eob> and this program saved <eol> huge amounts of money for Rwanda. <eob>
That's what we need, <eol> and we need that from all of you. <eob>
I'm asking you, carve out <eol> a little bit of time in your brains <eob> to think about the technology <eol> that you work on, <eob> the companies that you start, <eol> the design that you do. <eob>
Think a little bit and work with us <eob> to see if we can come up with these kinds <eol> of extraordinary win-win solutions. <eob>
I'm going to leave you <eol> with one final story. <eob>
I was in Tanzania, <eol> and I was in a classroom. <eob>
This is me with a classroom <eol> of 11-year-olds. <eob>
And I asked them, as I always do, <eob> "What do you want to be when you grow up?" <eob> Two raised their hands and said, <eob> "I want to be President <eol> of the World Bank." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And just like you, my own team <eol> and their teachers laughed. <eob>
But then I stopped them. <eob>
I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story. <eob>
When I was born in South Korea, <eol> this is what it looked like. <eob>
This is where I came from. <eob>
And when I was three years old, <eob> in preschool, <eob> I don't think that George David Woods, <eol> the President of the World Bank, <eob> if he had visited Korea on that day <eol> and come to my classroom, <eob> that he would have thought <eob> that the future President <eol> of the World Bank <eob> was sitting in that classroom. <eob>
Don't let anyone ever tell you <eob> that you cannot be <eol> President of the World Bank. <eob>
Now -- thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Let me leave you with one thought. <eob> I came from a country <eol> that was the poorest in the world. <eob>
I'm President of the World Bank. <eob>
I cannot and I will not <eol> pull up the ladder behind me. <eob> This is urgent. <eob> Aspirations are going up. <eob> Everywhere aspirations are going up. <eob>
You folks in this room, work with us. <eob>
We know that we can find <eol> those Zipline-type solutions <eob> and help the poor <eol> leapfrog into a better world, <eob> but it won't happen <eol> until we work together. <eob>
The future "you" -- <eol> and especially for your children -- <eob> the future you <eob> will depend on how much care <eol> and compassion we bring <eob> to ensuring that the future "us" <eol> provides equality of opportunity <eob> for every child in the world. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: You'd almost think <eob> people are surprised <eol> to hear a talk like this <eob> from the President of the World Bank. <eob>
It's kind of cool. <eob>
I'd encourage you to even be <eol> a little more specific on your proposal. <eob>
There's many investors, <eol> entrepreneurs in this room. <eob> How will you partner with them? <eol> What's your proposal? <eob>
Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy <eol> for just a second. <eob>
CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely. <eol> JYK: So here's what we did. <eob>
Insurance companies never invest <eol> in developing country infrastructure, <eob> for example, because <eol> they can't take the risk. <eob>
They're holding money <eol> for people who pay for insurance. <eob>
So what we did was a Swedish <eol> International Development Association <eob> gave us a little bit of money, <eob> we went out and raised a little bit <eol> more money, a hundred million, <eob> and we took first loss, <eol> meaning if this thing goes bad, <eob> 10 percent of the loss we'll just eat, <eob> and the rest of you will be safe. <eob>
And that created <eol> a 90-percent chunk, tranche <eob> that was triple B, investment-grade, <eol> so the insurance companies invested. <eob>
So for us, what we're doing <eol> is taking our public money <eob> and using it to derisk <eol> specific instruments <eob> to bring people in from the outside. <eob>
So all of you who are sitting <eol> on trillions of dollars of cash, <eob> come to us. Right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
CA: And what you're specifically <eol> looking for are investment proposals <eob> that create employment <eol> in the developing world. <eob>
JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely. <eob> So these will be, for example, <eol> in infrastructure that brings energy, <eob> builds roads, bridges, ports. <eob>
These kinds of things <eol> are necessary to create jobs, <eob> but also what we're saying is <eob> you may think that the technology <eol> you're working on <eob> or the business that you're working on <eob> may not have applications <eol> in the developing world, <eob> but look at Zipline. <eob>
And that Zipline thing didn't happen <eob> just because of the quality <eol> of the technology. <eob>
It was because they engaged <eol> with the Rwandans early <eob> and used artificial intelligence -- <eob> one thing, Rwanda has great broadband -- <eob> but these things fly <eol> completely on their own. <eob>
So we will help you do that. <eob>
We will make the introductions. <eob>
We will even provide financing. <eol> We will help you do that. <eob>
CA: How much capital <eol> is the World Bank willing to deploy <eob> to back those kinds of efforts? <eob>
JYK: Chris, you're always getting me <eol> to try to do something like this. <eob>
CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble. <eob>
JYK: So here's what we're going to do. <eob>
We have 25 billion a year <eol> that we're investing in poor countries, <eob> the poorest countries. <eob>
And as we invest <eol> over the next three years, <eob> 25 billion a year, <eob> we have got to think with you <eob> about how to use that money <eol> more effectively. <eob>
So I can't give you a specific number. <eob>
It depends on the quality of the ideas. <eob>
So bring us your ideas, <eob> and I don't think that financing <eol> is going to be the problem. <eob>
CA: All right, you heard it <eol> from the man himself. <eob>
Jim, thanks so much. <eol> JYK: Thank you. Thank you. <eob>
I visit the future for a living. <eob> Not just one future, <eob> but many possible futures, <eob> bringing back evidences from those futures <eol> for you to experience today. <eob> Like an archaeologist of the future. <eob>
Over the years, my many journeys <eol> have brought back things <eob> like a new species <eol> of synthetically engineered bees; <eob> a book named, "Pets as Protein;" <eob> a machine that makes you rich <eol> by trading your genetic data; <eob> a lamp powered by sugar; <eob> a computer for growing food. <eob>
OK, so I don't actually travel <eol> to different futures -- yet. <eob>
But my husband Jon and I spend <eol> a lot of time thinking <eob> and creating visions <eol> of different futures in our studio. <eob>
We are constantly looking out <eol> for weak signals, <eob> those murmurs of future potential. <eob>
Then we trace those threads of potential <eol> out into the future, asking: <eob> What might it feel like <eol> to live in this future? <eob>
What might we see, hear and even breathe? <eob>
Then we run experiments, <eol> build prototypes, make objects, <eob> bringing aspects of these futures to life, <eob> making them concrete and tangible <eob> so you can really feel the impact <eol> of those future possibilities <eob> here and now. <eob>
But this work is not about predictions. <eob> It's about creating tools -- <eob> tools that can help connect <eol> our present and our future selves <eob> so we become active participants <eol> in creating a future we want -- <eob> a future that works for all. <eob>
So how do we go about doing this? <eob> For a recent project called Drone Aviary, <eob> we were interested in exploring <eob> what it would mean to live <eol> with drones in our cities. <eob> Drones that have the power <eol> to see things we can't, <eob> to go places we can't <eob> and to do so with increasing autonomy. <eob>
But to understand the technology, <eob> getting our hands dirty was crucial. <eob>
So we built several different <eol> drones in our studio. <eob>
We gave them names, functions <eol> and then flew them -- <eob> but not without difficulty. <eob>
Things came loose, <eob> GPS signals glitched <eob> and drones crashed. <eob>
But it was through such experimentation <eob> that we could construct a very <eol> concrete and very experiential slice <eob> of one possible future. <eob>
So now, let's go to that future. <eob>
Let's imagine we are living in a city <eol> with drones like this one. <eob>
We call it The Nightwatchman. <eob>
It patrols the streets, often spotted <eol> in the evenings and at night. <eob>
Initially, many of us were annoyed <eol> by its low, dull hum. <eob>
But then, like everything else, <eol> we got used to it. <eob>
Now, what if you could see <eol> the world through its eyes? <eob>
See how it constantly logs <eol> every resident of our neighborhood; <eob> logging the kids who play football <eol> in the no-ballgame area <eob> and marking them as statutory nuisances. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then see how it disperses <eol> this other group, who are teenagers, <eob> with the threat of an autonomously <eol> issued injunction. <eob>
And then there's this giant <eol> floating disc called Madison. <eob>
Its glaring presence is so overpowering, <eob> I can't help but stare at it. <eob>
But if feels like each time I look at it, <eob> it knows a little more about me -- <eob> like it keeps flashing all these <eol> Brianair adverts at me, <eob> as if it knows about <eol> the holiday I'm planning. <eob>
I'm not sure if I find this <eol> mildly entertaining <eob> or just entirely invasive. <eob>
Back to the present. <eob> In creating this future, we learned a lot. <eob> Not just about how these machines work, <eob> but what it would feel like <eol> to live alongside them. <eob>
Whilst drones like Madison <eol> and Nightwatchman, <eob> in these particular forms, <eob> are not real yet, <eob> most elements of a drone future <eol> are in fact very real today. <eob>
For instance, <eob> facial recognition systems <eol> are everywhere -- <eob> in our phones, even in our thermostats <eob> and in cameras around our cities -- <eob> keeping a record of everything we do, <eob> whether it's an advertisement <eol> we glanced at or a protest we attended. <eob>
These things are here, <eob> and we often don't understand <eol> how they work, <eob> and what their consequences could be. <eob>
And we see this all around us. <eob>
This difficulty in even imagining <eob> how the consequences of our actions <eol> today will affect our future. <eob>
Last year, where I live, in the UK, <eol> there was a referendum <eob> where the people could vote <eol> for the UK to leave the EU <eob> or stay in the EU, <eob> popularly known as "Brexit." <eob> And soon after the results came out, <eob> a word began to surface <eol> called "Bregret" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
describing people who chose to vote <eol> for Brexit as a protest, <eob> but without thinking through <eol> its potential consequences. <eob>
And this disconnect is evident <eol> in some of the simplest things. <eob>
Say you go out for a quick drink. <eob>
Then you decide <eol> you wouldn't mind a few more. <eob>
You know you'll wake up <eol> in the morning feeling awful, <eob> but you justify it by saying, <eob> "The other me in the future <eol> will deal with that." <eob> But as we find out in the morning, <eob> that future "you" is you. <eob>
When I was growing up in India <eol> in the late '70s and early '80s, <eob> there was a feeling <eob> that the future both needed to <eol> and could actually be planned. <eob>
I remember my parents had to plan <eol> for some of the simplest things. <eob>
When they wanted a telephone in our house, <eob> they needed to order it and then wait -- <eob> wait for nearly five years before <eol> it got installed in our house. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then if they wanted to call <eol> my grandparents who lived in another city, <eob> they needed to book <eol> something called a "trunk call," <eob> and then wait again, <eol> for hours or even days. <eob>
And then abruptly, the phone <eol> would ring at two in the morning, <eob> and all of us would jump out of our beds <eol> and gather round the phone, <eob> shrieking into it, <eol> discussing general well-being <eob> at two in the morning. <eob>
Today it can feel like things <eol> are happening too fast -- <eob> so fast, that it can <eol> become really difficult <eob> for us to form an understanding <eol> of our place in history. <eob>
It creates an overwhelming sense <eol> of uncertainty and anxiety, <eob> and so, we let the future <eol> just happen to us. <eob>
We don't connect with that future "us." <eob> We treat our future selves as a stranger, <eob> and the future as a foreign land. <eob>
It's not a foreign land; <eob> it's unfolding right in front of us, <eob> continually being shaped <eol> by our actions today. <eob>
We are that future, <eob> and so I believe fighting <eol> for a future we want <eob> is more urgent and necessary <eol> than ever before. <eob>
We have learned in our work <eob> that one of the most powerful means <eol> of effecting change <eob> is when people can directly, tangibly <eol> and emotionally experience <eob> some of the future consequences <eol> of their actions today. <eob>
Earlier this year, the government <eol> of the United Arab Emirates invited us <eob> to help them shape <eol> their country's energy strategy <eob> all the way up to 2050. <eob>
Based on the government's econometric <eol> data, we created this large city model, <eob> and visualized many <eol> possible futures on it. <eob>
As I was excitably taking a group <eol> of government officials <eob> and members of energy companies <eob> through one sustainable <eol> future on our model, <eob> one of the participants told me, <eob> "I cannot imagine that in the future <eol> people will stop driving cars <eob> and start using public transport." <eob> And then he said, <eob> "There's no way I can tell my own son <eol> to stop driving his car." <eob>
But we were prepared for this reaction. <eob>
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab <eol> in my home city in India, <eob> we had created approximate samples <eob> of what the air would be like in 2030 <eol> if our behavior stays the same. <eob>
And so, I walked the group <eol> over to this object <eob> that emits vapor from those air samples. <eob>
Just one whiff of the noxious <eol> polluted air from 2030 <eob> brought home the point <eol> that no amount of data can. <eob>
This is not the future you would want <eol> your children to inherit. <eob>
The next day, the government <eol> made a big announcement. <eob> They would be investing billions <eol> of dollars in renewables. <eob>
We don't know what part our future <eol> experiences played in this decision, <eob> but we know that they've changed <eol> their energy policy <eob> to mitigate such a scenario. <eob>
While something like air from the future <eol> is very effective and tangible, <eob> the trajectory from our present <eol> to a future consequence <eob> is not always so linear. <eob>
Even when a technology <eol> is developed with utopian ideals, <eob> the moment it leaves the laboratory <eol> and enters the world, <eob> it is subject to forces outside <eol> of the creators' control. <eob>
For one particular project, <eol> we investigated medical genomics: <eob> the technology of gathering <eol> and using people's genetic data <eob> to create personalized medicine. <eob>
We were asking: <eob> What are some of the unintended <eol> consequences of linking our genetics <eob> to health care? <eob>
To explore this question further, <eob> we created a fictional lawsuit, <eob> and brought it to life through 31 pieces <eol> of carefully crafted evidence. <eob>
So we built an illegal genetic clinic, <eob> a DIY carbon dioxide incubator, <eob> and even bought frozen mice on eBay. <eob>
So now let's go to that future <eob> where this lawsuit is unfolding, <eob> and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann. <eob>
Arnold is being prosecuted <eol> by this global giant biotech company <eob> called Dynamic Genetics, <eob> because they have evidence <eob> that Arnold has illegally inserted <eol> the company's patented genetic material <eob> into his body. <eob>
How on earth did Arnold manage to do that? <eob>
Well, it all started <eob> when Arnold was asked to submit <eol> a saliva sample in this spit kit <eob> to the NHI -- <eob> the UK's National Health <eol> Insurance service. <eob>
When Arnold received <eol> his health insurance bill, <eob> he was shocked and scared <eob> to see that his premiums <eol> had gone through the roof, <eob> beyond anything he or his family <eol> could ever afford. <eob>
The state's algorithm had scanned <eol> his genetic data <eob> and found the risk of a chronic health <eol> condition lurking in his DNA. <eob> And so Arnold had to start paying <eol> toward the potential costs <eob> of that future disease -- <eob> potential future disease from today. <eob>
In that moment of fear and panic, <eob> Arnold slipped through the city <eob> into the dark shadows <eol> of this illegal clinic for treatment -- <eob> a treatment that would modify his DNA <eob> so that the state's algorithm <eol> would no longer see him as a risk, <eob> and his insurance premiums <eol> would become affordable again. <eob>
But Arnold was caught. <eob> And the legal proceedings in the case <eol> Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began. <eob>
In bringing such a future to life, <eob> what was important to us <eol> was that people could actually touch, <eob> see and feel its potential, <eob> because such an immediate and close <eol> encounter provokes people <eob> to ask the right questions, <eob> questions like: <eob> What are the implications <eol> of living in a world <eob> where I'm judged on my genetics? <eob>
Or: Who might claim ownership <eol> to my genetic data, <eob> and what might they do with it? <eob>
If this feels even slightly <eol> out-there or farfetched, <eob> today there's a little-known bill <eol> being passed through the American congress <eob> known as HR 1313, Preserving <eol> Employee Wellness Programs Act. <eob>
This bill proposes to amend the Genetic <eol> Information Nondiscrimination Act, <eob> popularly known as GINA, <eob> and would allow employers to ask <eol> about family medical history <eob> and genetic data <eob> to all employees for the first time. <eob>
Those who refuse <eol> would face large penalties. <eob>
In the work I've shown so far, <eob> whether it was drones or genetic crimes, <eob> these stories describe troubling futures <eob> with the intention of helping us <eol> avoid those futures. <eob>
But what about what we can't avoid? <eob>
Today, especially with climate change, <eob> it looks like we are heading for trouble. <eob>
And so what we want to do now <eol> is to prepare for that future <eob> by developing tools and attitudes <eol> that can help us find hope -- <eob> hope that can inspire action. <eob>
Currently, we are running <eol> an experiment in our studio. <eob>
It's a work in progress. <eob>
Based on climate data projections, <eob> we are exploring a future <eob> where the Western world has moved <eol> from abundance to scarcity. <eob>
We imagine living in a future city <eol> with repeated flooding, <eob> periods with almost <eol> no food in supermarkets, <eob> economic instabilities, <eob> broken supply chains. <eob>
What can we do to not just survive, <eol> but prosper in such a world? <eob> What food can we eat? <eob>
To really step inside these questions, <eob> we are building this room in a flat <eol> in London from 2050. <eob> It's like a little time capsule <eol> that we reclaimed from the future. <eob>
We stripped it down to the bare minimum. <eob>
Everything we lovingly put in our homes, <eob> like flat-panel TVs, <eob> internet-connected fridges <eob> and artisanal furnishings <eob> all had to go. <eob>
And in its place, <eol> we're building food computers <eob> from abandoned, salvaged <eol> and repurposed materials, <eob> turning today's waste <eol> into tomorrow's dinner. <eob>
For instance, <eob> we've just finished building our first <eol> fully automated fogponics machine. <eob>
It uses the technique of fogponics -- <eol> so just fog as a nutrient, <eob> not even water or soil -- <eob> to grow things quickly. <eob>
At the moment, <eob> we have successfully grown tomatoes. <eob>
But we'll need more food than what <eol> we can grow in this small room. <eob>
So what else could we forage <eol> from the city? <eob> Insects? Pigeons? Foxes? <eob>
Earlier, we brought back <eol> air from the future. <eob>
This time we are bringing <eol> an entire room from the future, <eob> a room full of hope, tools and tactics <eob> to create positive action <eol> in hostile conditions. <eob>
Spending time in this room, <eob> a room that could be our own future home, <eob> makes the consequences <eol> of climate change and food insecurity <eob> much more immediate and tangible. <eob>
What we're learning through such <eol> experiments and our practice <eob> and the people we engage with <eob> is that creating concrete experiences <eob> can bridge the disconnect <eol> between today and tomorrow. <eob>
By putting ourselves <eol> into different possible futures, <eob> by becoming open and willing <eob> to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort <eol> that such an act can bring, <eob> we have the opportunity <eol> to imagine new possibilities. <eob>
We can find optimistic futures; <eob> we can find paths forward; <eob> we can move beyond hope into action. <eob>
It means we have the chance <eol> to change direction, <eob> a chance to have our voices heard, <eob> a chance to write ourselves <eol> into a future we want. <eob>
Other worlds are possible. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My name is Katrina Spade, <eol> and I grew up in a medical family <eob> where it was fairly normal to talk <eol> about death and dying at the dinner table. <eob>
But I didn't go into medicine <eol> like so many of my family members. <eob>
Instead, I went to architecture school <eol> to learn how to design. <eob>
And while I was there, <eol> I began to be curious <eob> about what would happen <eol> to my physical body after I died. <eob>
What would my nearest <eol> and dearest do with me? <eob>
So if the existence <eol> and the fact of your own mortality <eob> doesn't get you down, <eob> the state of our current <eol> funerary practices will. <eob>
Today, almost 50 percent of Americans <eol> choose conventional burial. <eob>
Conventional burial begins with embalming, <eob> where funeral staff drain bodily fluid <eob> and replace it with a mixture <eol> designed to preserve the corpse <eob> and give it a lifelike glow. <eob>
Then, as you know, <eol> bodies are buried in a casket <eob> in a concrete-lined grave <eob> in a cemetery. <eob>
All told, in US cemeteries, <eob> we bury enough metal <eol> to build a Golden Gate Bridge, <eob> enough wood to build <eol> 1,800 single family homes, <eob> and enough formaldehyde-laden <eol> embalming fluid <eob> to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools. <eob>
In addition, cemeteries all over the world <eol> are reaching capacity. <eob>
Turns out, it doesn't really <eol> make good business sense <eob> to sell someone <eol> a piece of land for eternity. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Whose idea was that? <eob>
In some places, you can't buy a plot <eol> no matter how much money you have. <eob>
As a result, cremation rates <eol> have risen fast. <eob>
In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother <eol> be incinerated after she died, <eob> you'd probably be kicked <eol> from the family deathbed. <eob>
But today, almost half <eol> of Americans choose cremation, <eob> citing simpler, <eob> cheaper <eob> and more ecological as reasons. <eob>
I used to think that cremation <eol> was a sustainable form of disposition, <eob> but just think about it for a second. <eob>
Cremation destroys the potential we have <eob> to give back to the earth <eol> after we've died. <eob>
It uses an energy-intensive process <eol> to turn bodies into ash, <eob> polluting the air <eol> and contributing to climate change. <eob>
All told, cremations in the US <eob> emit a staggering 600 million <eol> pounds of carbon dioxide <eob> into the atmosphere annually. <eob>
The truly awful truth <eob> is that the very last thing <eol> that most of us will do on this earth <eob> is poison it. <eob>
It's like we've created, accepted <eol> and death-denied our way into a status quo <eob> that puts as much distance <eol> between ourselves and nature <eob> as is humanly possible. <eob>
Our modern funerary practices <eol> are designed to stave off <eob> the natural processes <eol> that happen to a body after death. <eob>
In other words, they're meant <eol> to prevent us from decomposing. <eob>
But the truth <eob> is that nature is really, <eol> really good at death. <eob>
We've all seen it. <eob>
When organic material dies in nature, <eob> microbes and bacteria <eol> break it down into nutrient-rich soil, <eob> completing the life cycle. <eob>
In nature, death creates life. <eob>
Back in architecture school, <eol> I was thinking about all this, <eob> and I set out on a plan <eol> to redesign death care. <eob>
Could I create a system <eob> that was beneficial to the earth <eob> and that used nature as a guide <eol> rather than something to be feared? <eob>
Something that was gentle to the planet? <eob>
That planet, after all, <eol> supports our living bodies <eob> our whole lives. <eob>
And while I was mulling this all over <eob> over the drawing board, <eob> the phone rang. <eob>
It was my friend Kate. <eob>
She was like, "Hey, <eol> have you heard about the farmers <eob> who are composting whole cows?" <eob> And I was like, "Mmmm." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Turns out that farmers <eol> in agricultural institutions <eob> have been practicing something <eol> called livestock mortality composting <eob> for decades. <eob>
Mortality composting is where <eol> you take an animal high in nitrogen <eob> and cover it with co-composting materials <eol> that are high in carbon. <eob>
It's an aerobic process, <eol> so it requires oxygen, <eob> and it requires <eol> plenty of moisture as well. <eob>
In the most basic setup, a cow <eol> is covered with a few feet of wood chips, <eob> which are high in carbon, <eob> and left outside for nature, <eol> for breezes to provide oxygen <eob> and rain to provide moisture. <eob>
In about nine months, <eob> all that remains <eol> is a nutrient-rich compost. <eob>
The flesh has been decomposed entirely, <eob> as have the bones. <eob> I know. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So I would definitely <eol> call myself a decomposition nerd, <eob> but I am far, far from a scientist, <eob> and one way you can tell this is true <eob> is that I have often called <eol> the process of composting "magic." <eob>
So basically, all we humans need to do <eob> is create the right environment <eol> for nature to do its job. <eob>
It's like the opposite <eol> of antibacterial soap. <eob>
Instead of fighting them, <eob> we welcome microbes and bacteria <eol> in with open arms. <eob>
These tiny, amazing creatures <eob> break down molecules <eol> into smaller molecules and atoms, <eob> which are then incorporated <eol> into new molecules. <eob>
In other words, that cow is transformed. <eob>
It's no longer a cow. <eob>
It's been cycled back into nature. <eob> See? Magic. <eob>
You can probably imagine <eol> the light bulb that went off in my head <eob> after I received that phone call. <eob>
I began designing a system <eob> based on the principles <eol> of livestock mortality composting <eob> that would take human beings <eol> and transform them into soil. <eob>
Fast-forward five years <eob> and the project has grown in ways <eol> I truly never could have imagined. <eob>
We've created a scalable, <eol> replicable non-profit urban model <eob> based on the science <eol> of livestock mortality composting <eob> that turns human beings into soil. <eob>
We've partnered and collaborated <eol> with experts in soil science, <eob> decomposition, alternative death care, <eob> law and architecture. <eob>
We've raised funds <eol> from foundations and individuals <eob> in order to design <eol> a prototype of this system, <eob> and we've heard from tens of thousands of people <eol> all over the world <eob> who want this option <eol> to be available. <eob> OK. <eob> In the next few years, <eob> it's our goal to build <eol> the first full-scale human composting facility <eob> right in the city of Seattle. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine it, <eob> part public park, <eob> part funeral home, <eob> part memorial to the people we love, <eob> a place where we can reconnect <eol> with the cycles of nature <eob> and treat bodies <eol> with gentleness and respect. <eob>
The infrastructure is simple. <eob> Inside a vertical core, <eob> bodies and wood chips undergo <eol> accelerated natural decomposition, <eob> or composting, <eob> and are transformed into soil. <eob>
When someone dies, their body <eol> is taken to a human composting facility. <eob>
After wrapping the deceased <eol> in a simple shroud, <eob> friends and family carry the body <eol> to the top of the core, <eob> which contains the natural <eol> decomposition system. <eob>
During a laying in ceremony, <eob> they gently place the body into the core <eob> and cover it with wood chips. <eob>
This begins the gentle transformation <eol> from human to soil. <eob>
Over the next few weeks, <eol> the body decomposes naturally. <eob>
Microbes and bacteria <eol> break down carbon, then protein, <eob> to create a new substance, <eob> a rich, earthy soil. <eob>
This soil can then be used <eol> to grow new life. <eob>
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yeah, thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Who's thinking about <eol> lemon meringue pie right now? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A lemon drop? <eob> Something stronger? <eob>
So in addition to housing the core, <eob> these buildings will function <eol> to support the grieving <eob> by providing space for memorial services <eol> and end-of-life planning. <eob>
The potential for repurposing is huge. <eob>
Old churches and industrial warehouses <eol> can be converted into places <eob> where we create soil and honor life. <eob>
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual <eob> that's been diluted <eol> over the past hundred years <eob> as cremation rates have risen <eob> and religious affiliation has declined. <eob>
Our Seattle facility will function <eol> as a model for these places <eob> all over the world. <eob>
We've heard from communities <eol> in South Africa, Australia, <eob> the UK, Canada and beyond. <eob>
We're creating a design toolkit <eob> that will help others <eol> design and build facilities <eob> that will contain technical specifications <eob> and regulatory best practices. <eob>
We want to help individuals, <eol> organizations, <eob> and down the road, municipalities <eob> design and build facilities <eol> in their own cities. <eob>
The idea is that every one of these places <eol> should look and feel completely different <eob> with the same system inside. <eob>
They're really meant to be designed <eol> for the neighborhood in which they reside <eob> and the community which they serve. <eob>
The other idea is <eol> for supportive staff to be on hand <eob> to help families with the care <eol> and preparation of loved ones' bodies. <eob>
We're banishing practices <eol> that bewilder and disempower <eob> and creating a system <eol> that is beautiful and meaningful <eob> and transparent. <eob> We believe that access <eol> to ecological death care <eob> is a human right. <eob>
OK, so you know the old saying, <eob> if you can compost a cow, <eol> you can compost a human? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Turns out, it's true. <eob>
Since 2014, we've been <eol> running a pilot project <eob> in the hills of North Carolina <eob> with the Forensic Anthropology Department <eol> at Western Carolina University. <eob>
Six donor bodies <eol> have been covered in wood chips, <eob> oxygen provided by breezes, <eob> microbes and bacteria doing their jobs. <eob>
This pilot program has allowed us <eol> to demonstrate that it's possible <eob> to harness the incredible power <eol> of natural decomposition <eob> to turn human bodies into soil, <eob> and we're working <eol> with other universities as well. <eob>
Soil scientists <eol> at Washington State University, <eob> the grad students, anyway, <eob> are working to compost <eol> teeth with amalgam fillings <eob> so that we can understand <eol> what happens to the mercury therein. <eob>
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments <eob> to determine what happens <eol> to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals <eob> during the composting process, <eob> and whether additional <eol> remediation will be needed. <eob>
By the way, <eob> composting creates a great deal of heat, <eob> especially this particular <eol> type of composting. <eob>
One week after we began <eol> composting our fifth donor body, <eob> the temperature inside <eol> that mound of wood chips <eob> reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit. <eob>
Imagine harnessing that heat <eol> to create energy <eob> or comfort the grieving on a cold day. <eob>
The death care revolution has begun. <eob>
It's an exciting time to be alive. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
I remember when I first found out <eob> I was going to speak at a TED conference. <eob>
I ran across the hall <eol> to one of my classrooms <eob> to inform my students. <eob>
"Guess what, guys? <eob> I've been asked to give a TED Talk." <eob>
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected. <eob>
The whole room went silent. <eob>
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one <eol> you made us watch on grit? <eob>
Or the one with the scientist that did <eol> this really awesome thing with robots?" <eob> Muhammad asked. <eob>
"Yes, just like that." <eob>
"But Coach, those people <eol> are really important and smart." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"I know that." <eob>
"But Coach, why are you speaking? <eob>
You hate public speaking. " <eob>
"I do," I admitted, <eob> "But it's important that I speak about us, <eol> that I speak about your journeys, <eob> about my journey. <eob>
People need to know." <eob>
The students at the all-refugee <eol> school that I founded <eob> decided to end with some <eol> words of encouragement. <eob>
"Cool! It better be good, Coach." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There are 65.3 million people <eol> who have been forcibly displaced <eob> from their homes because of war <eol> or persecution. <eob>
The largest number, <eol> 11 million, are from Syria. <eob>
33,952 people flee their homes daily. <eob>
The vast majority remain in refugee camps, <eob> whose conditions cannot be defined <eol> as humane under anyone's definition. <eob>
We are participating <eol> in the degradation of humans. <eob>
Never have we had numbers this high. <eob>
This is the highest number <eol> of refugees since World War II. <eob> Now, let me tell you why this issue <eol> is so important to me. <eob>
I am a Muslim. <eob> I've also spent the last 12 years <eol> of my life working with refugees. <eob>
Oh -- and I'm also gay. <eob>
It makes me really popular these days. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I am the daughter of a refugee. <eob>
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964 <eol> during the first Assad regime. <eob>
She was three months pregnant <eol> when she packed up a suitcase, <eob> piled in her five children <eol> and drove to neighboring Jordan, <eob> not knowing what the future held <eol> for her and her family. <eob>
My grandfather decided to stay, <eol> not believing it was that bad. <eob>
He followed her a month later, <eol> after his brothers were tortured <eob> and his factory was taken over <eol> by the government. <eob>
They rebuilt their lives <eol> starting from scratch <eob> and eventually became independently <eol> wealthy Jordanian citizens. <eob>
I was born in Jordan 11 years later. <eob>
It was really important to my grandmother <eol> for us to know our history <eob> and our journey. <eob>
I was eight years old when she took me <eol> to visit my first refugee camp. <eob>
I didn't understand why. <eob>
I didn't know why <eol> it was so important to her <eob> for us to go. <eob>
I remember walking into the camp <eol> holding her hand, <eob> and her saying, "Go play with the kids," <eob> while she visited <eol> with the women in the camp. <eob>
I didn't want to. <eob>
These kids weren't like me. <eob> They were poor. They lived in a camp. <eob> I refused. <eob> She knelt down beside me <eol> and firmly said, "Go. <eob>
And don't come back until you've played. <eob>
Don't ever think people are beneath you <eob> or that you have nothing <eol> to learn from others." <eob>
I reluctantly went. <eob> I never wanted to disappoint <eol> my grandmother. <eob>
I returned a few hours later, <eob> having spent some time playing soccer <eol> with the kids in the camp. <eob>
We walked out of the camp, <eob> and I was excitedly telling her <eol> what a great time I had <eob> and how fantastic the kids were. <eob>
"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them." <eob>
"Haram on us," she said, <eol> using the word's different meaning, <eob> that we were sinning. <eob> "Don't feel sorry for them; <eol> believe in them." <eob>
It wasn't until I left my country <eol> of origin for the United States <eob> that I realized the impact of her words. <eob>
After my college graduation, I applied for <eol> and was granted political asylum, <eob> based on being a member of a social group. <eob>
Some people may not realize this, <eob> but you can still get the death penalty <eol> in some countries for being gay. <eob>
I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship. <eob>
That was the hardest decision <eol> I've ever had to make, <eob> but I had no other choice. <eob>
The point is, <eob> when you find yourself choosing <eol> between home and survival, <eob> the question "Where are you from?" <eol> becomes very loaded. <eob>
A Syrian woman who I recently met <eol> at a refugee camp in Greece <eob> articulated it best, <eob> when she recalled the exact moment <eol> she realized she had to flee Aleppo. <eob>
"I looked out the window <eol> and there was nothing. <eob>
It was all rubble. <eob>
There were no stores, no streets, <eol> no schools. Everything was gone. <eob> I had been in my apartment for months, <eob> listening to bombs drop <eol> and watching people die. <eob>
But I always thought it would get better, <eob> that no one could force me to leave, <eob> no one could take my home away from me. <eob>
And I don't know why it was that morning, <eol> but when I looked outside, <eob> I realized if I didn't leave, <eol> my three young children would die. <eob>
And so we left. <eob>
We left because we had to, <eol> not because we wanted to. <eob>
There was no choice," she said. <eob>
It's kind of hard to believe <eol> that you belong <eob> when you don't have a home, <eob> when your country of origin rejects you <eol> because of fear or persecution, <eob> or the city that you grew up in <eol> is completely destroyed. <eob>
I didn't feel like I had a home. <eob>
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen, <eob> but I wasn't American, either. <eob>
I felt a kind of loneliness <eob> that is still hard <eol> to put into words today. <eob>
After college, I desperately needed <eol> to find a place to call home. <eob>
I bounced around from state to state <eob> and eventually ended up in North Carolina. <eob>
Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me <eob> offered to pay rent <eob> or buy me a meal or a suit <eol> for my new interview. <eob>
It just made me feel <eol> more isolated and incapable. <eob>
It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah, <eob> a Southern Baptist who took me in <eol> at my lowest and gave me a job, <eob> that I started to believe in myself. <eob>
Miss Sarah owned a diner <eol> in the mountains of North Carolina. <eob>
I assumed, because <eol> of my privileged upbringing <eob> and my Seven Sister education, <eob> that she would ask me <eol> to manage the restaurant. <eob> I was wrong. <eob> I started off washing dishes, <eob> cleaning toilets and working the grill. <eob>
I was humbled; I was shown <eol> the value of hard work. <eob>
But most importantly, <eol> I felt valued and embraced. <eob>
I celebrated Christmas with her family, <eob> and she attempted to observe <eol> Ramadan with me. <eob>
I remember being very nervous <eol> about coming out to her -- <eob> after all, she was a Southern Baptist. <eob>
I sat on the couch next to her <eob> and I said, "Miss Sarah, <eol> you know that I'm gay." <eob> Her response is one <eol> that I will never forget. <eob>
"That's fine, honey. <eob>
Just don't be a slut. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I eventually moved to Atlanta, <eol> still trying to find my home. <eob>
My journey took a strange turn <eol> three years later, <eob> after I met a group of refugee kids <eol> playing soccer outside. <eob>
I'd made a wrong turn <eol> into this apartment complex, <eob> and I saw these kids <eol> outside playing soccer. <eob>
They were playing barefoot <eol> with a raggedy soccer ball <eob> and rocks set up as goals. <eob>
I watched them for about an hour, <eob> and after that I was smiling. <eob>
The boys reminded me of home. <eob> They reminded me of the way <eol> I grew up playing soccer <eob> in the streets of Jordan, <eol> with my brothers and cousins. <eob>
I eventually joined their game. <eob>
They were a little skeptical <eol> about letting me join it, <eob> because according to them, <eol> girls don't know how to play. <eob>
But obviously I did. <eob>
I asked them if they had <eol> ever played on a team. <eob>
They said they hadn't, <eol> but that they would love to. <eob>
I gradually won them over, <eol> and we formed our first team. <eob>
This group of kids would give me <eol> a crash course in refugees, poverty <eob> and humanity. <eob>
Three brothers from Afghanistan -- <eol> Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah -- <eob> played a major role in that. <eob>
I showed up late to practice one day <eol> to find the field completely deserted. <eob> I was really worried. <eob>
My team loved to practice. <eob>
It wasn't like them to miss practice. <eob>
I got out of my car, and two kids <eol> ran out from behind a dumpster, <eob> waving their hands frantically. <eob>
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped. <eob> There was blood everywhere." <eob>
"What do you mean? <eob>
What do you mean he got beat up? " <eob>
"These bad kids came <eol> and beat him up, Coach. <eob> Everybody left. They were all scared." <eob>
We hopped into my car <eol> and drove over to Rooh's apartment. <eob>
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it. <eob> "Where's Rooh? <eob>
I need to talk to him, <eol> see if he's OK. "" He's in his room, Coach. <eob>
He's refusing to come out. <eob> "I knocked on the door. <eob>
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you. <eob>
I need to see if you're OK <eol> or if we need to go to the hospital." <eob>
He came out. <eob> He had a big gash on his head, <eol> a split lip, <eob> and he was physically shaken. <eob>
I was looking at him, <eob> and I asked the boys <eol> to call for their mom, <eob> because I needed to go <eol> to the hospital with him. <eob>
They called for their mom. <eob> She came out. <eob> I had my back turned to her, <eol> and she started screaming in Farsi. <eob>
The boys fell to the ground laughing. <eob>
I was very confused, <eob> because there was nothing <eol> funny about this. <eob>
They explained to me that she said, <eob>
"You told me your coach <eol> was a Muslim and a woman." <eob> From behind, I didn't appear <eol> to be either to her. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her. <eob> "Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A) llāh," <eob> reciting the Muslim declaration of faith. <eob>
Confused, <eob> and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured, <eob> she realized that yes, <eob> I, this American-acting, <eol> shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman, <eob> was indeed a Muslim. <eob>
Their family had fled the Taliban. <eob>
Hundreds of people in their village <eob> were murdered. <eob>
Their father was taken in by the Taliban, <eob> only to return a few months later, <eol> a shell of the man he once was. <eob>
The family escaped to Pakistan, <eob> and the two older boys, <eol> age eight and 10 at the time, <eob> wove rugs for 10 hours a day <eol> to provide for their family. <eob>
They were so excited when they found out <eol> that they had been approved <eob> to resettle in the United States, <eob> making them the lucky 0.1 percent <eol> who get to do that. <eob>
They had hit the jackpot. <eob>
Their story is not unique. <eob>
Every refugee family I have worked with <eol> has had some version of this. <eob>
I work with kids <eob> who have seen their mothers raped, <eol> their fathers' fingers sliced off. <eob>
One kid saw a bullet <eol> put in his grandmother's head, <eob> because she refused to let the rebels <eol> take him to be a child soldier. <eob>
Their journeys are haunting. <eob>
But what I get to see every day <eol> is hope, resilience, determination, <eob> a love of life <eob> and appreciation for being able <eol> to rebuild their lives. <eob>
I was at the boys' apartment one night, <eob> when the mom came home <eol> after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day. <eob>
She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet, <eob> saying that he was going to take care <eol> of her once he graduated. <eob>
She smiled from exhaustion. <eob> "God is good. Life is good. <eol> We are lucky to be here." <eob>
In the last two years, we have seen <eol> an escalating anti-refugee sentiment. <eob> It's global. <eob> The numbers continue to grow <eol> because we do nothing to prevent it <eob> and nothing to stop it. <eob>
The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees <eol> from coming into our countries. <eob>
The issue should be <eol> not forcing them to leave their own. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Sorry. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How much more suffering, <eob> how much more suffering must we take? <eob>
How many more people need to be <eol> forced out of their homes <eob> before we say, "Enough!"? <eob> A hundred million? <eob> Not only do we shame, <eol> blame and reject them <eob> for atrocities that they had <eol> absolutely nothing to do with, <eob> we re-traumatize them, <eob> when we're supposed to be welcoming <eol> them into our countries. <eob>
We strip them of their dignity <eol> and treat them like criminals. <eob>
I had a student in my office <eol> a couple of weeks ago. <eob>
She's originally from Iraq. <eob>
She broke down crying. <eob>
"Why do they hate us?" <eob>
"Who hates you?" <eob>
"Everyone; everyone hates us <eol> because we are refugees, <eob> because we are Muslim." <eob>
In the past, I was able <eol> to reassure my students <eob> that the majority of the world <eol> does not hate refugees. <eob>
But this time I couldn't. <eob>
I couldn't explain to her why someone <eol> tried to rip off her mother's hijab <eob> when they were grocery shopping, <eob> or why a player on an opposing <eol> team called her a terrorist <eob> and told her to go back <eol> where she came from. <eob>
I couldn't reassure her <eob> that her father's ultimate life sacrifice <eob> by serving in the United States <eol> military as an interpreter <eob> would make her more valued <eol> as an American citizen. <eob>
We take in so few refugees worldwide. <eob>
We resettle less than 0.1 percent. <eob>
That 0.1 percent benefits us <eol> more than them. <eob>
It dumbfounds me how the word "refugee" <eol> is considered something to be dirty, <eob> something to be ashamed of. <eob>
They have nothing to be ashamed of. <eob>
We have seen advances <eol> in every aspect of our lives -- <eob> except our humanity. <eob>
There are 65.3 million people <eol> who have been forced out of their homes <eob> because of war -- <eob> the largest number in history. <eob>
We are the ones who should be ashamed. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to give you a new perspective. <eob>
That sounds grandiose, and it is. <eob>
I left Ireland yesterday morning. <eob>
I traveled from Dublin to New York <eob> independently. <eob>
But the design of an airport, <eob> plane and terminal <eob> offers little independence when <eol> you're 105 and a half centimeters tall. <eob>
For Americans, that's 3' 5". <eob>
I was whisked through the airport <eol> by airline assistants in a wheelchair. <eob>
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair, <eob> but the design of an airport <eob> and its lack of accessibility <eob> means that it's my only way <eol> to get through. <eob>
With my carry-on bag between my feet, <eob> I was wheeled through <eol> security, preclearance <eob> and I arrived at my boarding gate. <eob>
I use the accessibility <eol> services in the airport <eob> because most of the terminal <eol> is just not designed with me in mind. <eob>
Take security, for example. <eob>
I'm not strong enough <eol> to lift my carry-on bag <eob> from the ground to the carousel. <eob>
I stand at eye level with it. <eob>
And those who work in that space <eol> for safety purposes cannot help me <eob> and cannot do it for me. <eob>
Design inhibits my autonomy <eol> and my independence. <eob>
But traveling at this size, <eol> it isn't all bad. <eob>
The leg room in economy <eol> is like business class. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I often forget that I'm a little person. <eob>
It's the physical environment <eol> and society that remind me. <eob>
Using a public bathroom <eol> is an excruciating experience. <eob>
I walk into the cubicle <eob> but I can't reach the lock on the door. <eob>
I'm creative and resilient. <eob>
I look around and see if there's <eol> a bin that I can turn upside down. <eob> Is it safe? <eob> Not really. <eob> Is it hygienic and sanitary? <eob> Definitely not. <eob> But the alternative is much worse. <eob>
If that doesn't work, I use my phone. <eob>
It gives me an additional <eol> four- to six-inch reach, <eob> and I try to jam the lock closed <eol> with my iPhone. <eob>
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive <eol> had in mind when he designed the iPhone, <eob> but it works. <eob>
The alternative <eol> is that I approach a stranger. <eob>
I apologize profusely <eob> and I ask them to stand guard <eol> outside my cubicle door. <eob>
They do <eob> and I emerge grateful <eob> but absolutely mortified, <eob> and hope that they didn't notice <eob> that I left the bathroom <eol> without washing my hands. <eob>
I carry hand sanitizer with me <eol> every single day <eob> because the sink, soap dispenser, <eol> hand dryer and mirror <eob> are all out of my reach. <eob>
Now, the accessible bathroom <eol> is somewhat of an option. <eob>
In this space, I can reach <eol> the lock on the door, <eob> the sink, the soap dispenser, <eol> the hand dryer and the mirror. <eob>
Yet, I cannot use the toilet. <eob>
It is deliberately designed higher <eob> so that wheelchair users <eol> can transfer across with ease. <eob>
This is a wonderful <eol> and necessary innovation, <eob> but in the design world, when we describe <eol> a new project or idea as accessible, <eob> what does that mean? <eob>
Who is it accessible to? <eob>
And whose needs <eol> are not being accommodated for? <eob>
Now, the bathroom is an example <eob> of where design impinges upon my dignity, <eob> but the physical environment impacts <eol> upon me in much more casual ways too, <eob> something as simple <eol> as ordering a cup of coffee. <eob>
Now, I'll admit it. <eob> I drink far too much coffee. <eob>
My order is a skinny vanilla latte, <eob> but I'm trying <eol> to wean myself off the syrup. <eob>
But the coffee shop, <eol> it's not designed well, <eob> at least not for me. <eob>
Queuing, I'm standing <eol> beside the pastry cabinet <eob> and the barista calls for the next order. <eob> "Next, please!" they shout. <eob>
They can't see me. <eob>
The person next to me in the queue <eol> points to my existence <eob> and everyone is embarrassed. <eob>
I order as quick as I can <eol> and I move along to collect my coffee. <eob> Now, think just for a second. <eob> Where do they put it? <eob> Up high and without a lid. <eob>
Reaching up to collect a coffee <eol> that I have paid for <eob> is an incredibly dangerous experience. <eob>
But design also impinges <eol> on the clothes that I want to wear. <eob>
I want garments <eol> that reflect my personality. <eob>
It's difficult to find <eol> in the childrenswear department. <eob>
And often womenswear <eol> requires far too many alterations. <eob>
I want shoes that affect my maturity, <eol> professionalism and sophistication. <eob>
Instead, I'm offered sneakers <eol> with Velcro straps and light-up shoes. <eob>
Now, I'm not totally opposed <eol> to light-up shoes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But design also impacts <eol> on such simple things, <eob> like sitting on a chair. <eob>
I cannot go from a standing <eol> to a seating position with grace. <eob>
Due to the standards <eol> of design heights of chairs, <eob> I have to crawl on my hands and knees <eob> just to get on top of it, <eob> whilst also being conscious <eol> that it might tip over at any stage. <eob>
But whilst design impacts on me <eob> whether it's a chair, <eol> a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes, <eob> I rely on and benefit <eob> from the kindness of strangers. <eob>
But not everybody is so nice. <eob>
I'm reminded that I'm a little person <eob> when a stranger points, <eob> stares, <eob> laughs, <eob> calls me a name, <eob> or takes a photograph of me. <eob>
This happens almost every day. <eob>
With the rise of social media, <eol> it has given me an opportunity <eob> and a platform to have a voice <eol> as a blogger and as an activist, <eob> but it has also made me nervous <eob> that I might become a meme <eob> or a viral sensation, <eob> all without my consent. <eob>
So let's take a moment right now <eob> to make something very clear. <eob>
The word "midget" is a slur. <eob>
It evolved from PT Barnum's era <eol> of circuses and freak shows. <eob> Society has evolved. <eob> So should our vocabulary. <eob>
Language is a powerful tool. <eob>
It does not just name our society. <eob> It shapes it. <eob>
I am incredibly proud <eol> to be a little person, <eob> to have inherited <eol> the condition of achondroplasia. <eob>
But I am most proud to be Sinead. <eob>
Achondroplasia is <eol> the most common form of dwarfism. <eob>
Achondroplasia translates <eol> as "without cartilage formation." <eob> I have short limbs <eol> and achondroplastic facial features, <eob> my forehead and my nose. <eob>
My arms do not straighten fully, <eob> but I can lick my elbow. <eob>
I'm not showing you that one. <eob>
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately <eol> one in every 20,000 births. <eob>
80 percent of little people <eol> are born to two average-height parents. <eob>
That means that anybody in this room <eol> could have a child with achondroplasia. <eob>
Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad. <eob>
I'd like to show you a photo of my family. <eob>
My mother is average height, <eob> my father is a little person <eob> and I am the eldest of five children. <eob>
I have three sisters and one brother. <eob>
They are all average height. <eob>
I am incredibly fortunate <eol> to have been born into a family <eob> that cultivated <eol> my curiosity and my tenacity, <eob> that protected me from the unkindness <eol> and ignorance of strangers <eob> and that armed me with the resilience, <eol> creativity and confidence <eob> that I needed to survive and manipulate <eol> the physical environment and society. <eob>
If I was to pinpoint any reason <eol> why I am successful, <eob> it is because I was <eol> and I am a loved child, <eob> now, a loved child <eol> with a lot of sass and sarcasm, <eob> but a loved child nonetheless. <eob>
In giving you an insight <eol> into who I am today <eob> I wanted to offer you a new perspective. <eob>
I wanted to challenge the idea <eob> that design is but a tool <eol> to create function and beauty. <eob>
Design greatly impacts <eol> upon people's lives, <eob> all lives. <eob>
Design is a way in which <eol> we can feel included in the world, <eob> but it is also a way in which <eol> we can uphold a person's dignity <eob> and their human rights. <eob>
Design can also inflict vulnerability <eob> on a group whose needs aren't considered. <eob>
So today, I want <eol> your perceptions challenged. <eob> Who are we not designing for? <eob> How can we amplify their voices <eob> and their experiences? <eob>
What is the next step? <eob>
Design is an enormous privilege, <eob> but it is a bigger responsibility. <eob>
I want you to open your eyes. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"These are the times," <eob> said Thomas Paine, <eob> "that try men's souls." <eob> And they're trying ours now. <eob>
This is a fateful moment <eol> in the history of the West. <eob>
We've seen divisive elections <eol> and divided societies. <eob>
We've seen a growth of extremism <eob> in politics and religion, <eob> all of it fueled <eol> by anxiety, uncertainty and fear, <eob> of a world that's changing almost faster <eol> than we can bear, <eob> and the sure knowledge <eol> that it's going to change faster still. <eob>
I have a friend in Washington. <eob>
I asked him, what was it <eol> like being in America <eob> during the recent presidential election? <eob> He said to me, "Well, <eob> it was like the man <eob> sitting on the deck of the Titanic <eob> with a glass of whiskey in his hand <eob> and he's saying, 'I know I asked for ice -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but this is ridiculous.'" <eob>
So is there something we can do, <eob> each of us, <eob> to be able to face the future <eol> without fear? <eob>
I think there is. <eob>
And one way into it is to see <eob> that perhaps the most simple way <eol> into a culture and into an age <eob> is to ask: What do people worship? <eob> People have worshipped so many different things -- <eob> the sun, the stars, the storm. <eob>
Some people worship many gods, <eol> some one, some none. <eob>
In the 19th and 20th centuries, <eob> people worshipped the nation, <eob> the Aryan race, the communist state. <eob> What do we worship? <eob> I think future anthropologists <eob> will take a look at the books we read <eob> on self-help, self-realization, <eob> self-esteem. <eob>
They'll look at the way <eol> we talk about morality <eob> as being true to oneself, <eob> the way we talk about politics <eob> as a matter of individual rights, <eob> and they'll look at this wonderful <eol> new religious ritual we have created. <eob> You know the one? <eob>
Called the "selfie." <eob> And I think they'll conclude <eol> that what we worship in our time <eob> is the self, the me, the I. <eob>
And this is great. <eob> It's liberating. It's empowering. <eol> It's wonderful. <eob> But don't forget that biologically, <eol> we're social animals. <eob>
We've spent most of our evolutionary history <eob> in small groups. <eob>
We need those face-to-face interactions <eob> where we learn the choreography <eol> of altruism <eob> and where we create <eol> those spiritual goods <eob> like friendship and trust <eol> and loyalty and love <eob> that redeem our solitude. <eob>
When we have too much of the "I" <eol> and too little of the "we," <eob> we can find ourselves vulnerable, <eob> fearful and alone. <eob>
It was no accident <eol> that Sherry Turkle of MIT <eob> called the book she wrote <eol> on the impact of social media <eob> "Alone Together." <eob>
So I think the simplest way <eol> of safeguarding the future "you" <eob> is to strengthen the future "us" <eob> in three dimensions: <eob> the us of relationship, <eob> the us of identity <eob> and the us of responsibility. <eob>
So let me first take <eob> the us of relationship. <eob>
And here, forgive me if I get personal. <eob>
Once upon a time, <eob> a very long time ago, <eob> I was a 20-year-old undergraduate <eob> studying philosophy. <eob>
I was into Nietzsche <eol> and Schopenhauer and Sartre and Camus. <eob>
I was full of ontological uncertainty <eob> and existential angst. <eob> It was terrific. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was self-obsessed <eol> and thoroughly unpleasant to know, <eob> until one day I saw <eob> across the courtyard <eob> a girl <eob> who was everything that I wasn't. <eob> She radiated sunshine. <eob> She emanated joy. <eob> I found out her name was Elaine. <eob> We met. We talked. <eob> We married. <eob> And 47 years, three children <eol> and eight grandchildren later, <eob> I can safely say <eob> it was the best decision <eol> I ever took in my life, <eob> because it's the people not like us <eob> that make us grow. <eob>
And that is why I think <eob> we have to do just that. <eob>
The trouble with Google filters, <eob> Facebook friends <eob> and reading the news by narrowcasting <eol> rather than broadcasting <eob> means that we're surrounded <eol> almost entirely by people like us <eob> whose views, whose opinions, whose prejudices, even, <eob> are just like ours. <eob>
And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown <eob> that if we surround ourselves with people <eol> with the same views as us, <eob> we get more extreme. <eob>
I think we need to renew <eol> those face-to-face encounters <eob> with the people not like us. <eob>
I think we need to do that <eob> in order to realize that <eol> we can disagree strongly <eob> and yet still stay friends. <eob>
It's in those face-to-face encounters <eob> that we discover <eol> that the people not like us <eob> are just people, like us. <eob>
And actually, every time <eob> we hold out the hand <eol> of friendship <eob> to somebody not like us, <eob> whose class or creed <eol> or color are different from ours, <eob> we heal <eob> one of the fractures <eob> of our wounded world. <eob>
That is <eob> the us of relationship. <eob>
Second is <eob> the us of identity. <eob>
Let me give you a thought experiment. <eob>
Have you been to Washington? <eob>
Have you seen the memorials? <eob> Absolutely fascinating. <eob> There's the Lincoln Memorial: <eob> Gettysburg Address on one side, Second Inaugural on the other. <eob>
You go to the Jefferson Memorial, <eob> screeds of text. <eob>
Martin Luther King Memorial, <eob> more than a dozen quotes <eol> from his speeches. <eob>
I didn't realize, in America <eol> you read memorials. <eob>
Now go to the equivalent <eol> in London in Parliament Square <eob> and you will see that the monument <eol> to David Lloyd George <eob> contains three words: <eob> David Lloyd George. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nelson Mandela gets two. <eob> Churchill gets just one: <eob> Churchill. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Why the difference? I'll tell you <eol> why the difference. <eob>
Because America was from the outset <eol> a nation of wave after wave of immigrants, <eob> so it had to create an identity <eob> which it did by telling a story <eob> which you learned at school, you read <eol> on memorials <eob> and you heard repeated in presidential <eol> inaugural addresses. <eob>
Britain until recently wasn't a nation of immigrants, <eob> so it could take identity for granted. <eob>
The trouble is now <eob> that two things have happened <eol> which shouldn't have happened together. <eob>
The first thing is in the West <eol> we've stopped telling this story <eob> of who we are and why, <eob> even in America. <eob>
And at the same time, <eob> immigration is higher than it's <eol> ever been before. <eob>
So when you tell a story <eol> and your identity is strong, <eob> you can welcome the stranger, <eob> but when you stop telling the story, <eob> your identity gets weak <eob> and you feel threatened by the stranger. <eob>
And that's bad. <eob>
I tell you, Jews <eob> have been scattered and dispersed <eol> and exiled for 2,000 years. <eob> We never lost our identity. <eob> Why? Because at least once a year, <eob> on the festival of Passover, <eob> we told our story and we taught it <eol> to our children <eob> and we ate the unleavened bread <eol> of affliction <eob> and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery. <eob>
So we never lost our identity. <eob>
I think collectively <eob> we've got to get back <eol> to telling our story, <eob> who we are, where we came from, <eob> what ideals by which we live. <eob>
And if that happens, <eob> we will become strong enough <eob> to welcome the stranger and say, <eob> "Come and share our lives, <eob> share our stories, <eob> share our aspirations and dreams." <eob> That is <eob> the us of identity. <eob>
And finally, the us of responsibility. <eob> Do you know something? <eob> My favorite phrase in all of politics, <eob> very American phrase, <eob> is: "We the people." <eob> Why "we the people?" <eob> Because it says that <eol> we all share collective responsibility <eob> for our collective future. <eob>
And that's how things really <eol> are and should be. <eob>
Have you noticed how magical thinking <eob> has taken over our politics? <eob>
So we say, all you've got to do <eol> is elect this strong leader <eob> and he or she will solve <eol> all our problems for us. <eob>
Believe me, that is magical thinking. <eob>
And then we get the extremes: <eob> the far right, the far left, <eob> the extreme religious and the extreme anti-religious, <eob> the far right dreaming <eol> of a golden age that never was, <eob> the far left dreaming <eol> of a utopia that never will be <eob> and the religious and anti-religious equally convinced <eob> that all it takes is God or the absence of God <eob> to save us from ourselves. <eob>
That, too, is magical thinking, <eob> because the only people <eol> who will save us from ourselves <eob> is we the people, <eob> all of us together. <eob>
And when we do that, <eob> and when we move <eol> from the politics of me <eob> to the politics of <eob> all of us together, <eob> we rediscover those beautiful, <eol> counterintuitive truths: <eob> that a nation is strong <eob> when it cares for the weak, <eob> that it becomes rich <eob> when it cares for the poor, <eob> it becomes invulnerable when it cares about the vulnerable. <eob>
That is what makes great nations. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So here is my simple suggestion. <eob> It might just change your life, <eob> and it might just help <eol> to begin to change the world. <eob>
Do a search and replace operation <eob> on the text of your mind, <eob> and wherever you encounter the word "self," <eob> substitute the word "other." <eob> So instead of self-help, other-help; <eob> instead of self-esteem, <eol> other-esteem. <eob>
And if you do that, <eob> you will begin to feel the power <eob> of what for me is one <eol> of the most moving sentences <eob> in all of religious literature. <eob> "Though I walk through the valley <eol> of the shadow of death, <eob> I will fear no evil, <eob> for you are with me." <eob> We can face any future <eol> without fear <eob> so long as we know <eob> we will not face it alone. <eob>
So for the sake of the future "you," <eob> together let us strengthen <eob> the future "us." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
All right, let's get up <eol> our picture of the earth. <eob>
The earth is pretty awesome. <eob>
I'm a geologist, so I get <eol> pretty psyched about this, <eob> but the earth is great. <eob> It's powerful, it's dynamic, <eol> it's constantly changing. <eob>
It's a pretty exciting place to live. <eob>
But I want to share with you guys <eol> today my perspective as a geologist <eob> in how understanding earth's past <eob> can help inform and guide decisions <eol> that we make today <eob> about how to sustainably live on earth's surface. <eob>
So there's a lot of exciting things <eol> that go on on the surface of the earth. <eob>
If we zoom in here a little bit, <eob> I want to talk to you guys a little bit <eol> about one of the things that happens. <eob>
Material get shuffled around <eol> earth's surface all the time, <eob> and one of the big thing <eol> that happens is material from high mountains <eob> gets eroded and transported <eol> and deposited in the sea. <eob>
And this process is ongoing all the time, <eob> and it has huge effects <eol> on how the landscape works. <eob> So this example here in south India -- <eob> we have some of the biggest mountains <eol> in the world, <eob> and you can see in this satellite photo <eob> rivers transporting material <eol> from those mountains out to the sea. <eob>
You can think of these rivers <eol> like bulldozers. <eob>
They're basically taking these mountains <eol> and pushing them down towards the sea. <eob>
We'll give you guys an example here. <eob>
So we zoom in a little bit. <eob>
I want to talk to you guys <eol> specifically about a river. <eob>
We can see these beautiful <eol> patterns that the rivers make <eob> as they're pushing material down to the sea, <eob> but these patterns aren't static. <eob>
These rivers are wiggling <eol> and jumping around quite a bit, <eob> and it can have big impacts <eol> on our lives. <eob>
So an example of this is <eol> this is the Kosi River. <eob>
So the Kosi River has this nice c-shaped pathway, <eob> and it exits the big mountains of Nepal <eob> carrying with it a ton of material, <eob> a lot of sediments <eol> that's being eroded from the high mountains, <eob> and it spreads out across India <eob> and moves this material. <eob>
So we're going to zoom in to this area <eob> and I'm going to tell you a little bit <eol> about what happened with the Kosi. <eob>
It's an example of how dynamic <eol> these systems can be. <eob>
So this is a satellite image <eol> from August of 2008, <eob> and this satellite image is colored <eob> so that vegetations <eol> or plants show up as green <eob> and water shows up as blue. <eob>
So here again you can see <eol> that c-shaped pathway <eob> that this river takes as it exits Nepal. <eob>
And now this is monsoon season. <eob>
August is monsoon season <eol> in this region of the world, <eob> and anyone that lives near a river <eol> is no stranger to flooding <eob> and the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that. <eob>
But something interesting happened in 2008, <eob> and this river moved in a way <eol> that's very different. <eob>
It flooded in a way that's very different <eol> than it normally does. <eob>
So the Kosi River is flowing down here, <eob> but sometimes as these rivers <eol> are bulldozing sediment, <eob> they kind of get clogged, <eob> and these clogs can actually <eol> cause the rivers <eob> to shift their course dramatically. <eob>
So this satellite image <eol> is from just two weeks later. <eob>
Here's the previous pathway, <eob> that c-shaped pathway, <eob> and you notice it's not blue anymore. <eob>
But now what we have is this blue pathway <eob> that cuts down the middle <eol> of the field of view here. <eob>
What happened is the Kosi <eol> River jumped its banks, <eob> and for reference, the scale bar here <eol> is 40 miles. <eob>
This river moved over 30 miles <eol> very abruptly. <eob>
So this river got clogged <eol> and it jumped its banks. <eob>
Here's an image from about a week later, <eob> and you can see these are the previous pathways, <eob> and you can see this process <eol> of river-jumping continues <eob> as this river moves farther away <eol> from its major course. <eob>
So you can imagine <eol> in landscapes like this, <eob> where rivers move around frequently, <eob> it's really important to understand when, <eol> where and how they're going to jump. <eob>
But these kinds of processes also happen <eol> a lot closer to home as well. <eob>
So in the United States, <eob> we have the Mississippi River <eol> that drains most of the continental US. <eob>
It pushes material <eol> from the Rocky Mountains <eob> and from the Great Plains. <eob> It drains it and moves <eol> it all the way across America <eob> and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico. <eob>
So this is the course of the Mississippi <eol> that we're familiar with today, <eob> but it didn't always flow <eol> in this direction. <eob>
If we use the geologic record, <eob> we can reconstruct <eol> where it went in the past. <eob>
So for example, this red area here <eob> is where we know the Mississippi River flowed <eol> and deposited material <eob> about 4,600 years ago. <eob>
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved <eob> to follow the course outlined <eol> here in orange. <eob>
And it kept moving and it keeps moving. <eob>
So here's about 2,000 years ago, <eob> a thousand years ago, <eob> 700 years ago. <eob> And it was only as recently <eol> as 500 years ago <eob> that it occupied the pathway <eol> that we're familiar with today. <eob>
So these processes are really important, <eob> and especially here, this delta area, <eob> where these river-jumping events <eol> in the Mississippi <eob> are building land at the interface <eol> of the land and the sea. <eob> This is really valuable real estate, <eob> and deltas like this are some of the most densely <eol> populated areas on our planet. <eob> So understanding the dynamics of these landscapes, <eob> how they formed and how they will continue <eol> to change in the future <eob> is really important <eol> for the people that live there. <eob>
So rivers also wiggle. <eob> These are sort of bigger jumps <eol> that we've been talking about. <eob>
I want to show you guys <eol> some river wiggles here. <eob>
So we're going to fly <eol> down to the Amazon River basin, <eob> and here again we have <eol> a big river system <eob> that is draining and moving and plowing material <eol> from the Andean Mountains, <eob> transporting it across South America <eob> and dumping it out into the Atlantic Ocean. <eob>
So if we zoom in here, you guys can see <eol> these nice, curvy river pathways. <eob>
Again, they're really beautiful, <eol> but again, they're not static. <eob> These rivers wiggle around. <eob> We can use satellite imagery over the last 30 or so years <eob> to actually monitor how these change. <eob>
So take a minute and just watch any bend <eol> or curve in this river, <eob> and you'll see it doesn't stay <eol> in the same place for very long. <eob>
It changes and evolves <eol> and warps its pattern. <eob>
If you look in this area in particular, <eob> I want you guys to notice <eol> there's a sort of a loop in the river <eob> that gets completely cut off. <eob>
It's almost like a whip cracking <eob> and snaps off the pathway <eol> of the river at a certain spot. <eob>
So just for reference, again, <eob> in this location, that river changed <eol> its course over four miles <eob> over the course of a season or two. <eob>
So the landscapes that we live in on earth, <eob> as this material is being eroded <eol> from the mountains <eob> and transported to the sea, <eob> are wiggling around all the time. <eob> They're changing all the time, <eob> and we need to be able <eol> to understand these processes <eob> so we can manage and live sustainably <eol> on these landscapes. <eob>
But it's hard to do <eol> if the only information we have <eob> is what's going on today <eol> at earth's surface. <eob> Right? We don't have a lot <eol> of observations. <eob>
We only have 30 years' worth <eol> of satellite photos, for example. <eob>
We need more observations <eol> to understand these processes more. <eob>
And additionally, we need to know <eob> how these landscapes are going <eol> to respond to changing climate <eob> and to changing land use <eob> as we continue to occupy <eol> and modify earth's surface. <eob>
So this is where the rocks come in. <eob>
So as rivers flow, <eob> as they're bulldozing material <eol> from the mountains to the sea, <eob> sometimes bits of sand and clay <eol> and rock get stuck in the ground. <eob>
And that stuff that gets stuck <eol> in the ground gets buried, <eob> and through time, we get big, thick <eol> accumulations of sediments <eob> that eventually turn into rocks. <eob>
What this means is that <eol> we can go to places like this, <eob> where we see big, thick stacks <eol> of sedimentary rocks, <eob> and go back in time <eob> and see what the landscapes <eol> looked like in the past. <eob>
We can do this to help reconstruct <eob> and understand how earth <eol> landscapes evolve. <eob>
This is pretty convenient, too, <eob> because the earth has had sort <eol> of an epic history. Right? <eob> So this video here is a reconstruction <eol> of paleogeography <eob> for just the first 600 million <eol> years of earth's history. <eob>
So just a little bit of time here. <eob>
So as the plates move around, <eob> we know climate has changed, sea level <eol> has changed, <eob> we have a lot of different types <eol> of landscapes <eob> and different types of environments <eol> that we can go back -- <eob> if we have a time machine -- <eob> we can go back and look at, <eob> and we do indeed have a time machine <eob> because we can look at the rocks <eol> that were deposited at these times. <eob>
So I'm going to give you <eol> an example of this <eob> and take you to a special time <eol> in earth's past. <eob>
About 55 million years ago, <eol> there was a really abrupt warming event, <eob> and what happened was a whole <eol> bunch of carbon dioxide <eob> was released into earth's atmosphere, <eob> and it caused a rapid <eol> and pretty extreme global warming event. <eob>
And when I say warm, <eol> I mean pretty warm, <eob> that there were things like crocodiles <eol> and palm trees <eob> as far north as Canada <eol> and as far south as Patagonia. <eob>
So this was a pretty warm time <eol> and it happened really abruptly. <eob>
So what we can do <eob> is we can go back and find rocks <eol> that were deposited at this time <eob> and reconstruct how the landscape <eol> changed in response to this warming event. <eob>
So here, yay, rocks. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's a pile of rocks. <eob> This yellow blob here, <eob> this is actually a fossil river, <eob> so just like this cartoon I showed, <eob> these are deposits that were laid down <eol> 55 million years ago. <eob>
As geologists, we can go <eol> and look at these up close <eob> and reconstruct the landscape. <eob>
So here's another example. <eob>
The yellow blob here is a fossil river. <eob>
Here's another one above it. <eob>
We can go and look in detail <eol> and make measurements and observations, <eob> and we can measure features. <eob>
For example, the features <eol> I just highlighted there <eob> tell us that this particular river <eol> was probably about three feet deep. <eob>
You could wade <eol> across this cute little stream <eob> if you were walking around 55 million years ago. <eob>
The reddish stuff that's above <eol> and below those channels, <eob> those are ancient soil deposits. <eob>
So we can look at those to tell us <eol> what lived and grew on the landscape <eob> and to understand how these rivers <eol> were interacting with their floodplains. <eob>
So we can look in detail <eol> and reconstruct with some specificity <eob> how these rivers flowed <eol> and what the landscapes looked like. <eob>
So when we do this <eol> for this particular place <eob> at this time, <eob> if we look what happened <eol> before this abrupt warming event, <eob> the rivers kind of carved their way <eol> down from the mountains to the sea, <eob> and they looked maybe similar <eol> to what I showed you in the Amazon River basin. <eob>
But right at the onset <eol> of this climate change event, <eob> the rivers change dramatically. <eob>
All of a sudden they got much broader, <eob> and they started to slide back <eol> and forth across the landscape more readily. <eob>
Eventually, the rivers reverted back <eol> to a state that was more similar <eob> to what they would have looked like <eol> before this climate event, <eob> but it took a long, long time. <eob>
So we can go back in earth's time <eol> and do these kinds of reconstructions <eob> and understand how earth's landscape has changed <eob> in response to a climate event <eol> like this or a land use event. <eob>
So some of the ways that rivers change <eob> or the reasons that rivers <eol> change their pattern and their movements <eob> is because of things like with extra water <eol> falling on the land's surface <eob> when climate is hotter, <eob> we can move more sediment <eol> and erode more sediment, <eob> and that changes how rivers behave. <eob>
So ultimately, <eob> as long as earth's surface is our home, <eob> we need to carefully manage <eol> the resources and risks <eob> associated with living <eol> in dynamic environments. <eob>
And I think the only way <eol> we can really do that sustainably <eob> is if we include information <eob> about how landscapes <eol> evolved and behaved in earth's past. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, a few years ago <eol> I heard an interesting rumor. <eob>
Apparently, the head <eol> of a large pet food company <eob> would go into the annual <eol> shareholder's meeting <eob> with can of dog food. <eob>
And he would eat the can of dog food. <eob>
And this was his way of convincing them <eol> that if it was good enough for him, <eob> it was good enough for their pets. <eob>
This strategy is now known as "dogfooding," <eob> and it's a common strategy <eol> in the business world. <eob>
It doesn't mean everyone <eol> goes in and eats dog food, <eob> but businesspeople will use <eol> their own products <eob> to demonstrate that they feel -- <eob> that they're confident in them. <eob>
Now, this is a widespread practice, <eob> but I think what's really interesting <eol> is when you find exceptions <eob> to this rule, <eob> when you find cases of businesses <eol> or people in businesses <eob> who don't use their own products. <eob>
Turns out there's one industry <eol> where this happens in a common way, <eob> in a pretty regular way, <eob> and that is the screen-based tech industry. <eob>
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs, <eol> when he was releasing the iPad, <eob> described the iPad as a device <eol> that was "extraordinary." <eob> "The best browsing experience <eol> you've ever had; <eob> way better than a laptop, way better <eol> than a smartphone. <eob>
It's an incredible experience." <eob> A couple of months later, <eol> he was approached by a journalist <eob> from the New York Times, <eob> and they had a long phone call. <eob>
At the end of the call, <eob> the journalist threw in a question <eol> that seemed like a sort of softball. <eob>
He said to him, "Your kids must love <eol> the iPad." <eob> There's an obvious answer to this, <eob> but what Jobs said really <eol> staggered the journalist. <eob>
He was very surprised, <eob> because he said, "They haven't used it. <eob>
We limit how much technology <eol> our kids use at home." <eob>
This is a very common thing <eol> in the tech world. <eob>
In fact, there's a school <eol> quite near Silicon Valley <eob> called the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, <eob> and they don't introduce screens <eol> until the eighth grade. <eob>
What's really interesting about the school <eob> is that 75 percent of the kids <eol> who go there <eob> have parents who are <eol> high-level Silicon Valley tech execs. <eob>
So when I heard about this, <eol> I thought it was interesting and surprising, <eob> and it pushed me to consider <eol> what screens were doing to me <eob> and to my family and the people I loved, <eob> and to people at large. <eob>
So for the last five years, <eob> as a professor of business and psychology, <eob> I've been studying the effect <eol> of screens on our lives. <eob>
And I want to start by just focusing <eol> on how much time they take from us, <eob> and then we can talk about <eol> what that time looks like. <eob>
What I'm showing you here <eol> is the average 24-hour workday <eob> at three different points in history: <eob> 2007 -- 10 years ago -- <eob> 2015 <eob> and then data that I collected, <eol> actually, only last week. <eob>
And a lot of things haven't changed <eob> all that much. <eob>
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half <eol> to eight hours a day; <eob> some people say that's declined slightly, <eol> but it hasn't changed much. <eob>
We work eight-and-a-half <eol> to nine hours a day. <eob>
We engage in survival activities -- <eob> these are things like eating <eol> and bathing and looking after kids -- <eob> about three hours a day. <eob>
That leaves this white space. <eob>
That's our personal time. <eob>
That space is incredibly important to us. <eob>
That's the space where we do things <eol> that make us individuals. <eob>
That's where hobbies happen, <eol> where we have close relationships, <eob> where we really think about our lives, <eol> where we get creative, <eob> where we zoom back and try to work out <eob> whether our lives have been meaningful. <eob>
We get some of that from work as well, <eob> but when people look back on their lives <eob> and wonder what their lives have been like <eob> at the end of their lives, <eob> you look at the last things they say -- <eob> they are talking about those moments <eol> that happen in that white personal space. <eob>
So it's sacred; it's important to us. <eob>
Now, what I'm going to do is show you <eob> how much of that space <eol> is taken up by screens across time. <eob>
In 2007, <eob> this much. <eob>
That was the year that Apple <eol> introduced the first iPhone. <eob>
this much. <eob> Eight years later, <eob> Now, this much. <eob> That's how much time we spend <eol> of that free time in front of our screens. <eob>
This yellow area, this thin sliver, <eol> is where the magic happens. <eob>
That's where your humanity lives. <eob>
And right now, it's in a very small box. <eob>
So what do we do about this? <eob> Well, the first question is: <eob> What does that red space look like? <eob>
Now, of course, screens are miraculous <eob> in a lot of ways. <eob>
I live in New York, <eob> a lot of my family lives in Australia, <eob> and I have a one-year-old son. <eob>
The way I've been able to introduce them <eol> to him is with screens. <eob>
I couldn't have done that 15 <eol> or 20 years ago <eob> in quite the same way. <eob>
So there's a lot of good <eol> that comes from them. <eob>
One thing you can do is ask yourself: <eob> What goes on during that time? <eob>
How enriching are the apps <eol> that we're using? <eob> And some are enriching. <eob> If you stop people while they're <eol> using them and say, <eob> "Tell us how you feel right now," <eob> they say they feel pretty good <eol> about these apps -- <eob> those that focus on relaxation, exercise, weather, reading, <eob> education and health. <eob>
They spend an average <eol> of nine minutes a day on each of these. <eob>
These apps make them much less happy. <eob>
About half the people, <eol> when you interrupt them and say, "How do you feel?" <eob> say they don't feel good about using them. <eob>
What's interesting about these -- <eob> dating, social networking, gaming, <eob> entertainment, news, web browsing -- <eob> people spend 27 minutes <eol> a day on each of these. <eob>
We're spending three times longer on the apps <eol> that don't make us happy. <eob>
That doesn't seem very wise. <eob>
One of the reasons we spend <eol> so much time on these apps <eob> that make us unhappy <eob> is they rob us of stopping cues. <eob> Stopping cues were <eol> everywhere in the 20th century. <eob>
They were baked into everything we did. <eob>
A stopping cue is basically a signal <eol> that it's time to move on, <eob> to do something new, to do something different. <eob>
And -- think about newspapers; <eol> eventually you get to the end, <eob> you fold the newspaper away, <eol> you put it aside. <eob>
The same with magazines, books -- <eol> you get to the end of a chapter, <eob> prompts you to consider <eol> whether you want to continue. <eob>
You watched a show on TV, eventually <eol> the show would end, <eob> and then you'd have a week <eol> until the next one came. <eob>
There were stopping cues everywhere. <eob>
But the way we consume media today <eol> is such that there are no stopping cues. <eob>
The news feed just rolls on, <eob> and everything's bottomless: <eol> Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, <eob> email, text messaging, the news. <eob>
And when you do check <eol> all sorts of other sources, <eob> you can just keep going on <eol> and on and on. <eob>
So, we can get a cue <eol> about what to do from Western Europe, <eob> where they seem to have a number <eol> of pretty good ideas in the workplace. <eob>
Here's one example. <eol> This is a Dutch design firm. <eob>
And what they've done is rigged <eol> the desks to the ceiling. <eob>
And at 6pm every day, <eob> it doesn't matter who you're emailing <eol> or what you're doing, <eob> the desks rise to the ceiling. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Four days a week, the space <eol> turns into a yoga studio, <eob> one day a week, into a dance club. <eob>
It's really up to you which ones <eol> you stick around for. <eob>
But this is a great stopping rule, <eob> because it means at the end of the day, <eob> everything stops, there's no way to work. <eob>
At Daimler, the German car company, <eol> they've got another great strategy. <eob>
When you go on vacation, <eob> instead of saying, "This person's on vacation, <eob> they'll get back to you eventually," <eob> they say, "This person's on vacation, <eol> so we've deleted your email. <eob>
This person will never see <eol> the email you just sent." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"You can email back in a couple of weeks, <eob> or you can email someone else." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You can imagine what that's like. <eob>
You go on vacation, and you're actually <eol> on vacation. <eob>
The people who work at this company feel <eob> that they actually get a break from work. <eob>
But of course, that doesn't tell us much <eob> about what we should do <eol> at home in our own lives, <eob> so I want to make some suggestions. <eob>
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going <eol> to not use my phone. <eob>
The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks <eol> different on different days. <eob>
I think a far better strategy <eol> is to say, <eob> I do certain things every day, <eob> there are certain occasions <eol> that happen every day, <eob> like eating dinner. <eob>
Sometimes I'll be alone, <eob> sometimes with other people, <eob> sometimes in a restaurant, <eob> sometimes at home, <eob> but the rule that I've adopted is: <eol> I will never use my phone at the table. <eob>
It's far away, <eob> as far away as possible. <eob>
Because we're really bad <eol> at resisting temptation. <eob>
But when you have a stopping cue <eol> that, every time dinner begins, <eob> my phone goes far away, <eob> you avoid temptation all together. <eob>
At first, it hurts. <eob>
I had massive FOMO. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I struggled. <eob>
But what happens is, you get used to it. <eob>
You overcome the withdrawal the same way <eol> you would from a drug, <eob> and what happens is, life <eol> becomes more colorful, richer, <eob> more interesting -- <eob> you have better conversations. <eob>
You really connect with the people <eol> who are there with you. <eob>
I think it's a fantastic strategy, <eob> and we know it works, <eol> because when people do this -- <eob> and I've tracked a lot of people <eol> who have tried this -- <eob> it expands. <eob>
They feel so good about it, <eob> they start doing it for the first hour <eol> of the day in the morning. <eob>
They start putting their phones <eol> on airplane mode on the weekend. <eob>
That way, your phone remains a camera, <eol> but it's no longer a phone. <eob>
It's a really powerful idea, <eob> and we know people feel much better <eol> about their lives when they do this. <eob>
So what's the take home here? <eob> Screens are miraculous; <eol> I've already said that, <eob> and I feel that it's true. <eob>
But the way we use them is a lot like driving <eol> down a really fast, long road, <eob> and you're in a car where the accelerator <eol> is mashed to the floor, <eob> it's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal. <eob>
You've got a choice. <eob>
You can either glide by, past, say, <eol> the beautiful ocean scenes <eob> and take snaps out the window -- <eol> that's the easy thing to do -- <eob> or you can go out of your way <eol> to move the car to the side of the road, <eob> to push that brake pedal, <eob> to get out, <eob> take off your shoes and socks, <eob> take a couple of steps onto the sand, <eob> feel what the sand feels like under your feet, <eob> walk to the ocean, <eob> and let the ocean lap at your ankles. <eob>
Your life will be richer and more meaningful <eob> because you breathe in that experience, <eob> and because you've left <eol> your phone in the car. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am a climate scientist, <eob> and I hate weather. <eob>
I have spent too much time in California, <eob> and I strongly feel that weather <eol> should be optional. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I don't want to experience clouds, <eob> let alone study them. <eob>
But clouds seem to follow <eol> me wherever I go. <eob>
The thing is, clouds are a real challenge <eol> for climate science. <eob>
We don't know how they're going <eol> to react as the planet heats up, <eob> and hidden in that uncertainty <eob> might be hope. <eob>
Maybe, just maybe, <eob> clouds could slow down global warming, <eob> and buy us a little bit more time <eol> to get our act together, <eob> which would be very convenient right now. <eob>
I mean, even I could put up <eol> with a few more cloudy days <eob> if clouds saved the planet. <eob>
Now, we are sure about some things. <eob>
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, <eob> we're emitting a lot of it, <eob> and the planet is heating up. <eob> Case closed. <eob> But I still go to work every day. <eob>
It turns out that there is a lot <eol> that we don't understand <eob> about climate change. <eob>
In particular, we haven't answered <eob> what seems to be <eol> a very fundamental question. <eob>
We know it's going to get hot, <eob> but we don't know exactly <eol> how hot it's going to get. <eob>
Now, this is a really easy question to answer <eob> if one of you would like <eol> to give me a time machine. <eob>
But I'm going to be honest with you: <eob> if I had a time machine, <eob> I would not be hanging out <eol> at this particular point in history. <eob>
So in order to see the future, <eob> we have to rely on the output <eol> of computer simulations -- <eob> climate models, like this one. <eob>
Now, in my line of work, <eob> I encounter many very charming people <eol> on the internet <eob> who like to tell me that climate models <eol> are all wrong. <eob>
And I would just like to say: <eob> no kidding! <eob> Seriously? I get paid <eol> to complain about climate models. <eob>
But we don't want models to be perfect. <eob>
We want them to be useful. <eob>
I mean, think about it: <eob> a computer simulation <eob> that's able to exactly reproduce <eol> all of reality. <eob>
That's not a climate model; <eob> That's "The Matrix." <eob> So, models are not crystal balls. <eob>
They're research tools, <eob> and the ways in which they're wrong <eol> can actually teach us a lot. <eob>
For example: <eob> different climate models <eol> are largely able to capture <eob> the warming that we've seen so far. <eob>
But fast-forward to the end of the century <eob> under a business-as-usual scenario, <eob> and climate models <eol> don't really agree anymore. <eob>
Yeah, they're all warming; <eol> that's just basic physics. <eob>
But some of them project catastrophe -- <eob> more than five times the warming <eol> we've seen already. <eob>
And others are literally more chill. <eob>
So why don't climate models agree on how warm it's going to get? <eob>
Well, to a large extent, <eob> it's because they don't agree on <eol> what clouds will do in the future. <eob>
And that is because, just like me, <eob> computers hate clouds. <eob>
Computers hate clouds because <eol> they're simultaneously very large <eob> and very small. <eob>
Clouds are formed <eob> when microscopic water droplets <eol> or ice crystals coalesce <eob> around tiny particles. <eob>
But at the same time, they cover <eol> two-thirds of the earth's surface. <eob>
In order to really accurately model clouds, <eob> we'd need to track the behavior <eol> of every water droplet and dust grain <eob> in the entire atmosphere, <eob> and there's no computer <eol> powerful enough to do that. <eob>
So instead, we have <eol> to make a trade-off: <eob> we can zoom in and get the details right, <eob> but have no idea <eol> what's going on worldwide; <eob> or, we could sacrifice <eol> realism at small scales <eob> in order to see the bigger picture. <eob>
Now, there's no one right answer, <eob> no perfect way to do this, <eob> and different climate models <eol> make different choices. <eob>
Now, it is unfortunate <eob> that computers struggle with clouds, <eob> because clouds are crucially important <eob> in regulating the temperature of the planet. <eob>
In fact, if all the clouds went away, <eob> we would experience <eol> profound climate changes. <eob>
But without clouds, <eob> would it be warmer or colder? <eob>
The answer is both. <eob>
So I'm going to be honest with you, <eol> I am not a cloud spotter. <eob>
My favorite type of cloud is none. <eob>
But even I know that clouds <eol> come in all shapes and sizes. <eob>
Low, thick clouds like these <eol> are really good at blocking out the sun <eob> and ruining your barbecue, <eob> and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus <eob> largely let that sunlight stream through. <eob>
Every sunny day is the same, <eob> but every cloudy day <eol> is cloudy in its own way. <eob>
And it's this diversity <eob> that can make the global impact <eol> of clouds very hard to understand. <eob>
So to see this global effect of clouds, <eob> it really helps to take a selfie. <eob>
It will never cease to blow my mind <eob> that we can see our planet <eol> from outer space, <eob> but we can't see all of it. <eob>
Clouds are blocking the view. <eob>
That's what they do. <eob>
These low, thick clouds <eol> are extremely effective sunshades. <eob>
They turn back about 20 percent <eol> of everything the sun sends us. <eob>
That is a lot of wasted solar power. <eob>
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades, <eob> making the planet cooler. <eob>
But that's not the only effect of clouds. <eob>
Our planet has a temperature, <eob> and like anything with a temperature, <eob> it's giving off heat. <eob>
We are radiating thermal energy <eol> away into space, <eob> and we can see this in the infrared. <eob>
Once again, clouds are blocking the view. <eob>
That's because high clouds live <eol> in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, <eob> where it's very cold. <eob>
And this means that they lose <eol> very little heat to space themselves. <eob>
But at the same time, they block the heat <eol> coming up from the planet below. <eob>
The earth is trying to cool itself off, <eob> and high clouds are getting in the way. <eob>
The result is a very powerful <eol> greenhouse effect. <eob>
So, clouds play <eol> this very large and dual role <eob> in the climate system. <eob>
We've got low clouds <eol> that act like a sunshade, <eob> cooling the planet, <eob> and high clouds which act like a greenhouse, <eob> warming the planet. <eob>
Right now, these two effects -- <eol> they don't cancel out. <eob>
That sunshade -- it's a little bit <eol> more powerful. <eob>
So if we got rid <eol> of all the clouds tomorrow, <eob> which, for the record, I am not advocating, <eob> our planet would get warmer. <eob>
So clearly, all of the clouds <eol> are not going away. <eob>
But climate change is change. <eob>
So we can ask: <eob> How will global warming change clouds? <eob>
But remember, clouds are so important <eob> in regulating the earth's temperature, <eob> and they both warm and cool the planet. <eob>
So even small changes to cloud cover <eob> could have profound consequences. <eob>
So we might also ask: <eob> How will clouds change global warming? <eob>
And that is where <eol> there might be space for hope. <eob>
If global warming triggers cloud changes <eob> that make for a less powerful <eol> greenhouse or a more effective sunshade, <eob> then that would enhance <eol> the cooling power of clouds. <eob>
It would act in opposition <eol> to global warming, <eob> and that's what's happening <eol> in those climate models <eob> that project relatively muted warming. <eob>
But climate models struggle with clouds, <eob> and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways. <eob>
Clouds could help us out <eol> with global warming. <eob>
They could also make it worse. <eob>
Now, we know that climate change <eol> is happening <eob> because we can see it: <eob> rising temperatures, melting icecaps, <eol> shifts in rainfall patterns. <eob>
And you might think <eol> that we could also see it in the clouds. <eob>
But here's something else unfortunate: <eob> clouds are really hard to see. <eob>
I see everybody <eol> from the Pacific Northwest <eob> is like, "I have some suggestions for you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you guys, we have tried looking up. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But in order to do climate science, <eob> we need to see all of the clouds, <eol> everywhere, for a very long time. <eob>
And that's what makes it hard. <eob>
Now, nothing sees more clouds <eol> than a satellite -- <eob> not even a British person. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And fortunately, we do have <eol> satellite observations of clouds <eob> that, like me, date back to the 1980s. <eob>
But these satellites <eol> were designed for weather, <eob> not climate. <eob>
They weren't in it for the long haul. <eob>
So to get that long-term <eol> trend information, <eob> we need to do climate science. <eob>
We have to stitch together the output <eol> of multiple satellites <eob> with different viewing angles and orbits <eob> and carrying different camera equipment. <eob>
And as a result, <eob> there are gaps in our knowledge. <eob>
But even from this very cloudy picture, <eob> we're starting to get hints <eol> of a possible future. <eob>
When we looked at the observations, <eob> one thing jumped out at us: <eob> the clouds are moving. <eob>
As the planet's temperature increases, <eob> high clouds rise up. <eob>
They move to the colder upper <eol> reaches of the atmosphere, <eob> and this means that even as the planet heats up, <eob> high clouds don't. <eob>
They remain at roughly <eol> the same temperature. <eob>
So they are not losing more heat to space. <eob>
But at the same time, <eol> they're trapping more heat <eob> from the warming planet below. <eob>
This intensifies the greenhouse effect. <eob>
High clouds are making <eol> global warming worse. <eob>
Clouds are moving in other dimensions, too. <eob>
The atmospheric circulation, <eol> that large-scale motion <eob> of air and water in the atmosphere, <eob> is changing, <eob> and clouds are going with it. <eob>
On large scales, <eob> clouds seem to be moving from the tropics <eol> toward the poles. <eob>
It's kind of like your grandparents <eol> in reverse. <eob>
And this matters, <eob> because if your job is to block incoming sunlight, <eob> you are going to be much more effective in the tropics <eob> under that intense tropical sun <eob> than you are in higher latitudes. <eob>
So if this keeps up, <eob> this will also make global warming worse. <eob>
And what we have not found, <eob> despite years of looking, <eob> is any indication of the opposite. <eob>
There is no observational evidence <eob> that clouds will substantially <eol> slow down global warming. <eob>
The earth is not going to break <eol> its own fever. <eob>
Now, there are still uncertainties here. <eob>
We don't know for sure <eob> what the future holds. <eob>
But we are sending our kids there, <eob> and they are never coming back. <eob>
I want them to be prepared <eol> for what they'll face, <eob> and that is why it is so important <eob> to keep our earth-observing satellites up there <eob> and to hire diverse <eol> and smart and talented people <eob> who do not hate clouds <eob> to improve the climate models. <eob>
But uncertainty is not ignorance. <eob>
We don't know everything, <eob> but we don't know nothing, <eob> and we know what carbon dioxide does. <eob>
I started my career <eol> as an astrophysicist, <eob> so you can believe me <eob> when I say that this is the greatest place <eol> in the universe. <eob>
Other planets might have liquid water. <eob>
On earth, we have whiskey. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We are so lucky to live here, <eob> but let's not push our luck. <eob>
I don't think that clouds <eol> will save the planet. <eob>
I think that's probably up to us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Just over a year ago, <eob> for the third time in my life, <eol> I ceased to exist. <eob>
I was having a small operation, and my brain <eol> was filling with anesthetic. <eob>
I remember a sense of detachment <eol> and falling apart <eob> and a coldness. <eob>
And then I was back, drowsy <eol> and disoriented, <eob> but definitely there. <eob>
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, <eob> you might feel confused <eol> about the time or anxious about oversleeping, <eob> but there's always a basic sense <eol> of time having passed, <eob> of a continuity <eol> between then and now. <eob>
Coming round from anesthesia <eol> is very different. <eob>
I could have been under <eol> for five minutes, five hours, <eob> five years or even 50 years. <eob>
I simply wasn't there. <eob>
It was total oblivion. <eob>
Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic. <eob>
It turns people into objects, <eob> and then, we hope, back again into people. <eob>
And in this process <eob> is one of the greatest remaining <eol> mysteries in science and philosophy. <eob>
How does consciousness happen? <eob> Somehow, within each of our brains, <eob> the combined activity <eol> of many billions of neurons, <eob> each one a tiny biological machine, <eob> is generating a conscious experience. <eob>
And not just any conscious experience -- <eob> your conscious experience <eol> right here and right now. <eob> How does this happen? <eob>
Answering this question <eol> is so important <eob> because consciousness for each of us <eol> is all there is. <eob>
Without it there's no world, <eob> there's no self, <eob> there's nothing at all. <eob>
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously <eob> whether it's through <eol> mental illness or pain. <eob>
And if we can experience <eol> joy and suffering, <eob> what about other animals? <eob> Might they be conscious, too? <eob>
Do they also have a sense of self? <eob>
And as computers get faster and smarter, <eob> maybe there will come a point, <eol> maybe not too far away, <eob> when my iPhone develops a sense <eol> of its own existence. <eob>
I actually think the prospects for a conscious <eol> AI are pretty remote. <eob>
And I think this because my research <eol> is telling me <eob> that consciousness has less <eol> to do with pure intelligence <eob> and more to do with our nature <eol> as living and breathing organisms. <eob>
Consciousness and intelligence <eol> are very different things. <eob>
You don't have to be smart to suffer, <eol> but you probably do have to be alive. <eob>
In the story I'm going to tell you, <eob> our conscious experiences <eol> of the world around us, <eob> and of ourselves within it, <eob> are kinds of controlled hallucinations <eob> that happen with, through and because <eol> of our living bodies. <eob>
Now, you might have heard <eol> that we know nothing <eob> about how the brain and body <eol> give rise to consciousness. <eob>
Some people even say <eol> it's beyond the reach of science altogether. <eob>
But in fact, <eob> the last 25 years have seen <eol> an explosion of scientific work in this area. <eob>
If you come to my lab <eol> at the University of Sussex, <eob> you'll find scientists <eol> from all different disciplines <eob> and sometimes even philosophers. <eob>
All of us together trying to understand <eol> how consciousness happens <eob> and what happens when it goes wrong. <eob>
And the strategy is very simple. <eob>
I'd like you to think about consciousness <eob> in the way that we've come <eol> to think about life. <eob>
At one time, people thought <eol> the property of being alive <eob> could not be explained by physics <eol> and chemistry -- <eob> that life had to be more <eol> than just mechanism. <eob>
But people no longer think that. <eob>
As biologists got on with the job <eob> of explaining <eol> the properties of living systems <eob> in terms of physics and chemistry -- <eob> things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis -- <eob> the basic mystery of what life <eol> is started to fade away, <eob> and people didn't propose any more magical solutions, <eob> like a force of life <eol> or an élan vital. <eob>
So as with life, so with consciousness. <eob>
Once we start explaining its properties <eob> in terms of things happening <eol> inside brains and bodies, <eob> the apparently insoluble mystery <eol> of what consciousness is <eob> should start to fade away. <eob>
At least that's the plan. <eob> So let's get started. <eob>
What are the properties of consciousness? <eob>
What should a science <eol> of consciousness try to explain? <eob>
Well, for today I'd just like to think <eol> of consciousness in two different ways. <eob>
There are experiences <eol> of the world around us, <eob> full of sights, sounds and smells, <eob> there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie. <eob>
And then there's conscious self. <eob>
The specific experience <eol> of being you or being me. <eob>
The lead character in this inner movie, <eob> and probably the aspect of consciousness <eol> we all cling to most tightly. <eob>
Let's start with experiences <eol> of the world around us, <eob> and with the important idea <eol> of the brain as a prediction engine. <eob>
Imagine being a brain. <eob> You're locked inside a bony skull, <eob> trying to figure what's out there in the world. <eob>
There's no lights inside the skull. <eol> There's no sound either. <eob>
All you've got to go on <eol> is streams of electrical impulses <eob> which are only indirectly related <eol> to things in the world, <eob> whatever they may be. <eob>
So perception -- figuring out what's there -- <eob> has to be a process <eol> of informed guesswork <eob> in which the brain combines <eol> these sensory signals <eob> with its prior expectations <eol> or beliefs about the way the world is <eob> to form its best guess <eol> of what caused those signals. <eob>
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. <eob>
What we perceive is its best guess <eol> of what's out there in the world. <eob>
Let me give you <eol> a couple of examples of all this. <eob>
You might have seen this illusion before, <eob> but I'd like you to think <eol> about it in a new way. <eob>
If you look at those two patches, A and B, <eob> they should look to you to be <eol> very different shades of gray, right? <eob>
But they are in fact exactly <eol> the same shade. <eob>
And I can illustrate this. <eob>
If I put up a second version <eol> of the image here <eob> and join the two patches <eol> with a gray-colored bar, <eob> you can see there's no difference. <eob>
It's exactly the same shade of gray. <eob>
And if you still don't believe me, <eob> I'll bring the bar <eol> across and join them up. <eob>
It's a single colored block of gray, <eol> there's no difference at all. <eob>
This isn't any kind of magic trick. <eob>
It's the same shade of gray, <eob> but take it away again, <eol> and it looks different. <eob>
So what's happening here <eob> is that the brain is using <eol> its prior expectations <eob> built deeply into the circuits <eol> of the visual cortex <eob> that a cast shadow <eol> dims the appearance of a surface, <eob> so that we see B as lighter <eol> than it really is. <eob>
Here's one more example, <eob> which shows just how quickly <eol> the brain can use new predictions <eob> to change what we consciously experience. <eob>
Have a listen to this. <eob>
(Distorted voice) <eob>
Sounded strange, right? <eob> Have a listen again and see <eol> if you can get anything. <eob>
(Distorted voice) <eob>
Still strange. <eob> Now listen to this. <eob>
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit <eol> is a really terrible idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which I do. <eob>
So you heard some words there, right? <eob>
Now listen to the first sound again. <eob>
I'm just going to replay it. <eob>
(Distorted voice) <eob>
Yeah? So you can now hear words there. <eob>
Once more for luck. <eob>
(Distorted voice) <eob>
OK, so what's going on here? <eob>
The remarkable thing is the sensory information <eol> coming into the brain <eob> hasn't changed at all. <eob>
All that's changed <eol> is your brain's best guess <eob> of the causes of that sensory information. <eob>
And that changes what you consciously hear. <eob>
All this puts the brain basis of perception <eob> in a bit of a different light. <eob>
Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain <eob> from the outside world, <eob> it depends as much, if not more, <eob> on perceptual predictions flowing <eol> in the opposite direction. <eob>
We don't just passively perceive the world, <eob> we actively generate it. <eob>
The world we experience comes as much, <eol> if not more, <eob> from the inside out <eob> as from the outside in. <eob>
Let me give you one more example <eol> of perception <eob> as this active, constructive process. <eob>
Here we've combined immersive virtual reality <eol> with image processing <eob> to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions <eob> on experience. <eob>
In this panoramic video, <eol> we've transformed the world -- <eob> which is in this case Sussex campus -- <eob> into a psychedelic playground. <eob>
to simulate the effects <eol> of overly strong perceptual predictions <eob> We've processed the footage using an algorithm <eol> based on Google's Deep Dream <eob>
In this case, to see dogs. <eob>
And you can see this <eol> is a very strange thing. <eob>
When perceptual predictions are too strong, <eob> as they are here, <eob> the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations <eob> people might report in altered states, <eob> or perhaps even in psychosis. <eob>
Now, think about this for a minute. <eob>
If hallucination is a kind <eol> of uncontrolled perception, <eob> then perception right here and right now <eol> is also a kind of hallucination, <eob> but a controlled hallucination <eob> in which the brain's predictions <eol> are being reigned in <eob> by sensory information from the world. <eob>
In fact, we're all hall <eol>ucinating all the time, <eob> including right now. <eob>
It's just that when we agree <eol> about our hallucinations, <eob> we call that reality. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now I'm going to tell you that <eol> your experience of being a self, <eob> the specific experience of being you, <eob> is also a controlled hallucination <eol> generated by the brain. <eob>
This seems a very strange idea, right? <eob>
Yes, visual illusions might <eol> deceive my eyes, <eob> but how could I be deceived <eol> about what it means to be me? <eob>
For most of us, <eob> the experience of being a person <eob> is so familiar, so unified <eol> and so continuous <eob> that it's difficult not to take it for granted. <eob>
But we shouldn't take it for granted. <eob>
There are in fact many different ways <eol> we experience being a self. <eob>
There's the experience of having a body <eob> and of being a body. <eob>
There are experiences <eol> of perceiving the world <eob> from a first person point of view. <eob>
There are experiences <eol> of intending to do things <eob> and of being the cause of things <eol> that happen in the world. <eob>
And there are experiences <eob> of being a continuous <eol> and distinctive person over time, <eob> built from a rich set of memories <eol> and social interactions. <eob>
Many experiments show, <eob> and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well, <eob> that these different ways in which <eol> we experience being a self <eob> can all come apart. <eob> What this means is the basic background experience <eob> of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain. <eob>
Another experience, which just like all others, <eob> requires explanation. <eob>
So let's return to the bodily self. <eob>
How does the brain generate <eol> the experience of being a body <eob> and of having a body? <eob>
Well, just the same principles apply. <eob>
The brain makes its best guess <eob> about what is and what <eol> is not part of its body. <eob>
And there's a beautiful experiment <eol> in neuroscience to illustrate this. <eob>
And unlike most neuroscience experiments, <eob> this is one you can do at home. <eob>
All you need is one of these. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And a couple of paintbrushes. <eob>
In the rubber hand illusion, <eob> a person's real hand <eol> is hidden from view, <eob> and that fake rubber hand is placed <eol> in front of them. <eob>
Then both hands are simultaneously <eol> stroked with a paintbrush <eob> while the person stares <eol> at the fake hand. <eob>
Now, for most people, after a while, <eob> this leads to the very uncanny sensation <eob> that the fake hand is in fact <eol> part of their body. <eob>
And the idea is that the congruence <eol> between seeing touch and feeling touch <eob> on an object that looks like hand and is roughly <eol> where a hand should be, <eob> is enough evidence for the brain <eol> to make its best guess <eob> that the fake hand is in fact part of the body. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you can measure all kinds of clever things. <eob> You can measure skin conductance <eol> and startle responses, <eob> but there's no need. <eob>
It's clear the guy in blue <eol> has assimilated the fake hand. <eob> This means that even experiences <eol> of what our body is <eob> is a kind of best guessing -- <eob> a kind of controlled hallucination <eol> by the brain. <eob>
There's one more thing. <eob> We don't just experience our bodies <eol> as objects in the world from the outside, <eob> we also experience them from within. <eob>
We all experience the sense <eol> of being a body from the inside. <eob>
And sensory signals <eol> coming from the inside of the body <eob> are continually telling the brain <eol> about the state of the internal organs, <eob> how the heart is doing, <eol> what the blood pressure is like, <eob> lots of things. <eob>
This kind of perception, <eol> which we call interoception, <eob> is rather overlooked. <eob>
But it's critically important <eob> because perception <eol> and regulation of the internal state of the body -- <eob> well, that's what keeps us alive. <eob>
Here's another version <eol> of the rubber hand illusion. <eob>
This is from our lab at Sussex. <eob>
And here, people see <eol> a virtual reality version of their hand, <eob> which flashes red and back <eob> either in time or out of time <eol> with their heartbeat. <eob>
And when it's flashing <eol> in time with their heartbeat, <eob> people have a stronger sense <eol> that it's in fact part of their body. <eob>
So experiences of having a body <eol> are deeply grounded <eob> in perceiving our bodies from within. <eob>
There's one last thing <eol> I want to draw your attention to, <eob> which is that experiences <eol> of the body from the inside are very different <eob> from experiences of the world around us. <eob>
When I look around me, <eol> the world seems full of objects -- <eob> tables, chairs, rubber hands, <eob> people, you lot -- <eob> even my own body in the world, <eob> I can perceive it as an object from the outside. <eob>
But my experiences <eol> of the body from within, <eob> they're not like that at all. <eob>
I don't perceive my kidneys here, <eob> my liver here, <eob> my spleen ... <eob> I don't know where my spleen is, <eob> but it's somewhere. <eob>
I don't perceive my insides as objects. <eob>
In fact, I don't experience them much <eol> at all unless they go wrong. <eob>
And this is important, I think. <eob>
Perception of the internal state of the body <eob> isn't about figuring out <eol> what's there, <eob> it's about control and regulation -- <eob> keeping the physiological variables <eol> within the tight bounds <eob> that are compatible <eol> with survival. <eob>
When the brain uses predictions <eol> to figure out what's there, <eob> we perceive objects as the causes <eol> of sensations. <eob>
When the brain uses predictions <eol> to control and regulate things, <eob> we experience how well or how badly <eol> that control is going. <eob>
So our most basic experiences <eol> of being a self, <eob> of being an embodied organism, <eob> are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms <eol> that keep us alive. <eob>
And when we follow this idea <eol> all the way through, <eob> we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences, <eob> since they all depend on the same mechanisms <eol> of predictive perception, <eob> all stem from this basic drive <eol> to stay alive. <eob>
We experience the world and ourselves <eob> with, through and because of our living bodies. <eob>
Let me bring things together step-by-step. <eob>
What we consciously see depends <eob> on the brain's best guess <eol> of what's out there. <eob>
Our experienced world comes <eob> from the inside out, <eob> not just the outside in. <eob>
The rubber hand illusion shows that <eol> this applies to our experiences <eob> of what is and what is not our body. <eob>
And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals <eob> coming from deep inside the body. <eob>
And finally, <eob> experiences of being an embodied self <eol> are more about control and regulation <eob> than figuring out what's there. <eob>
So our experiences of the world <eol> around us and ourselves within it -- <eob> well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations <eob> that have been shaped over millions <eol> of years of evolution <eob> to keep us alive in worlds <eol> full of danger and opportunity. <eob>
We predict ourselves into existence. <eob>
Now, I leave you with three <eol> implications of all this. <eob>
First, just as we can <eol> misperceive the world, <eob> we can misperceive ourselves <eob> when the mechanisms <eol> of prediction go wrong. <eob>
Understanding this opens many <eol> new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, <eob> because we can finally get at the mechanisms <eob> rather than just treating the symptoms <eob> in conditions like depression and schizophrenia. <eob>
Second: <eob> what it means to be me <eol> cannot be reduced to or uploaded to <eob> a software program running on a robot, <eob> however smart or sophisticated. <eob>
We are biological, <eol> flesh-and-blood animals <eob> whose conscious experiences <eol> are shaped at all levels <eob> by the biological mechanisms <eol> that keep us alive. <eob>
Just making computers smarter <eol> is not going to make them sentient. <eob>
Finally, <eob> our own individual inner universe, <eob> our way of being conscious, <eob> is just one possible way <eol> of being conscious. <eob>
And even human consciousness generally -- <eob> it's just a tiny region in a vast space <eol> of possible consciousnesses. <eob>
Our individual self and worlds <eol> are unique to each of us, <eob> but they're all grounded <eol> in biological mechanisms <eob> shared with many other living creatures. <eob>
Now, these are fundamental changes <eob> in how we understand ourselves, <eob> but I think they should be celebrated, <eob> because as so often in science, <eol> from Copernicus -- <eob> we're not at the center <eol> of the universe -- <eob> to Darwin -- <eob> we're related to all other creatures -- <eob> to the present day. <eob>
With a greater sense of understanding <eob> comes a greater sense of wonder, <eob> and a greater realization <eob> that we are part of and not apart <eol> from the rest of nature. <eob>
And... <eob> when the end of consciousness comes, <eob> there's nothing to be afraid of. <eob> Nothing at all. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In ancient Greece, <eob> when anyone from slaves to soldiers, <eol> poets and politicians, <eob> needed to make a big decision <eol> on life's most important questions, <eob> like, "Should I get married?" <eob> or "Should we embark <eol> on this voyage?" <eob> or "Should our army advance <eol> into this territory?" <eob> they all consulted the oracle. <eob>
So this is how it worked: <eob> you would bring her a question <eol> and you would get on your knees, <eob> and then she would go into this trance. <eob>
It would take a couple of days, <eob> and then eventually she would come out of it, <eob> giving you her predictions as your answer. <eob>
From the oracle bones of ancient China <eob> to ancient Greece to Mayan calendars, <eob> people have craved for prophecy <eob> in order to find out <eol> what's going to happen next. <eob>
And that's because we all want <eol> to make the right decision. <eob>
We don't want to miss something. <eob>
The future is scary, <eob> so it's much nicer knowing <eol> that we can make a decision <eob> with some assurance of the outcome. <eob>
Well, we have a new oracle, <eob> and it's name is big data, <eob> or we call it "Watson" <eol> or "deep learning" or "neural net." <eob> And these are the kinds of questions <eol> we ask of our oracle now, <eob> like, "What's the most efficient way <eol> to ship these phones <eob> from China to Sweden?" <eob> Or, "What are the odds <eob> of my child being born <eol> with a genetic disorder?" <eob> Or, "What are the sales volume we can predict for this product?" <eob>
I have a dog. Her name is Elle, <eol> and she hates the rain. <eob>
And I have tried everything <eol> to untrain her. <eob>
But because I have failed at this, <eob> I also have to consult an oracle, called Dark Sky, <eob> every time before we go on a walk, <eob> for very accurate weather predictions <eol> in the next 10 minutes. <eob>
She's so sweet. <eob>
So because of all of this, <eol> our oracle is a $122 billion industry. <eob>
Now, despite the size of this industry, <eob> the returns are surprisingly low. <eob>
Investing in big data is easy, <eob> but using it is hard. <eob>
Over 73 percent of big data projects <eol> aren't even profitable, <eob> and I have executives coming up to me saying, <eob> "We're experiencing the same thing. <eob>
We invested in some big data system, <eob> and our employees aren't making <eol> better decisions. <eob> And they're certainly not coming <eol> up with more breakthrough ideas." <eob>
So this is all really interesting to me, <eob> because I'm a technology ethnographer. <eob>
I study and I advise companies <eob> on the patterns of how people use technology, <eob> and one of my interest <eol> areas is data. <eob>
So why is having more data <eol> not helping us make better decisions, <eob> especially for companies who have all these resources <eob> to invest in these big data systems? <eob>
Why isn't it getting any easier for them? <eob>
So, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand. <eob>
In 2009, I started a research <eol> position with Nokia. <eob>
And at the time, <eob> Nokia was one of the largest <eol> cell phone companies in the world, <eob> dominating emerging markets <eol> like China, Mexico and India -- <eob> all places where I had done <eol> a lot of research <eob> on how low-income people use technology. <eob>
And I spent a lot of extra time in China <eob> getting to know the informal economy. <eob>
So I did things like working <eol> as a street vendor <eob> selling dumplings to construction workers. <eob>
Or I did fieldwork, <eob> spending nights and days <eol> in internet cafés, <eob> hanging out with Chinese youth, <eol> so I could understand <eob> how they were using games and mobile phones <eob> and using it between moving <eol> from the rural areas to the cities. <eob>
Through all of this qualitative evidence <eol> that I was gathering, <eob> I was starting to see so clearly <eob> that a big change was about to happen <eol> among low-income Chinese people. <eob>
Even though they were surrounded <eol> by advertisements for luxury products <eob> like fancy toilets -- <eol> who wouldn't want one? -- <eob> and apartments and cars, <eob> through my conversations with them, <eob> I found out that the ads the actually <eol> enticed them the most <eob> were the ones for iPhones, <eob> promising them this entry <eol> into this high-tech life. <eob>
And even when I was living with them <eol> in urban slums like this one, <eob> I saw people investing <eol> over half of their monthly income <eob> into buying a phone, <eob> and increasingly, <eol> they were "shanzhai," <eob> which are affordable knock-offs <eol> of iPhones and other brands. <eob>
They're very usable. <eob> Does the job. <eob>
And after years of living <eol> with migrants and working with them <eob> and just really doing everything <eol> that they were doing, <eob> I started piecing all these data <eol> points together -- <eob> from the things that seem random, <eol> like me selling dumplings, <eob> to the things that were more obvious, <eob> like tracking how much they were spending <eol> on their cell phone bills. <eob>
And I was able to create <eol> this much more holistic picture <eob> of what was happening. <eob>
And that's when I started to realize <eob> that even the poorest in China <eol> would want a smartphone, <eob> and that they would do almost anything <eol> to get their hands on one. <eob>
You have to keep in mind, <eob> iPhones had just come out, <eol> it was 2009, <eob> so this was, like, eight years ago, <eob> and Androids had just started <eol> looking like iPhones. <eob>
And a lot of very smart <eol> and realistic people said, <eob> "Those smartphones -- <eol> that's just a fad. <eob>
Who wants to carry around these heavy things <eob> where batteries drain quickly <eol> and they break every time you drop them?" <eob> But I had a lot of data, <eob> and I was very confident about <eol> my insights, <eob> so I was very excited <eol> to share them with Nokia. <eob>
But Nokia was not convinced, <eob> because it wasn't big data. <eob>
They said, "We have millions <eol> of data points, <eob> and we don't see any indicators <eol> of anyone wanting to buy a smartphone, <eob> and your data set of 100, <eol> as diverse as it is, is too weak <eob> for us to even take seriously." <eob> And I said, "Nokia, you're right. <eob>
Of course you wouldn't see this, <eob> because you're sending out surveys <eol> assuming that people don't know <eob> what a smartphone is, <eob> so of course you're not <eol> going to get any data back <eob> about people wanting to buy <eol> a smartphone in two years. <eob>
Your surveys, your methods <eol> have been designed <eob> to optimize an existing business model, <eob> and I'm looking at these emergent human dynamics <eob> that haven't happened yet. <eob>
We're looking outside of market dynamics <eob> so that we can get ahead of it." <eob> Well, you know what happened to Nokia? <eob>
Their business fell off a cliff. <eob>
This -- this is the cost of missing something. <eob> It was unfathomable. <eob> But Nokia's not alone. <eob>
I see organizations <eol> throwing out data all the time <eob> because it didn't come from a quant model <eob> or it doesn't fit in one. <eob>
But it's not big data's fault. <eob>
It's the way we use big data; <eol> it's our responsibility. <eob>
Big data's reputation for success <eob> comes from quantifying <eol> very specific environments, <eob> like electricity power grids <eol> or delivery logistics or genetic code, <eob> when we're quantifying in systems <eol> that are more or less contained. <eob>
But not all systems are <eol> as neatly contained. <eob>
When you're quantifying <eol> and systems are more dynamic, <eob> especially systems that involve human beings, <eob> forces are complex and unpredictable, <eob> and these are things that we don't know <eol> how to model so well. <eob>
Once you predict something about human behavior, <eob> new factors emerge, <eob> because conditions are constantly changing. <eob>
That's why it's a never-ending cycle. <eob>
You think you know something, <eob> and then something unknown <eol> enters the picture. <eob>
And that's why just relying <eol> on big data alone <eob> increases the chance that we'll miss something, <eob> while giving us this illusion <eol> that we already know everything. <eob>
And what makes it really hard <eol> to see this paradox <eob> and even wrap our brains around it <eob> is that we have this thing <eol> that I call the quantification bias, <eob> which is the unconscious belief of valuing <eol> the measurable <eob> over the immeasurable. <eob>
And we often experience this at our work. <eob> Maybe we work alongside colleagues <eol> who are like this, <eob> or even our whole entire company <eol> may be like this, <eob> where people become so fixated on that number, <eob> that they can't see anything outside of it, <eob> even when you present them evidence right <eol> in front of their face. <eob>
And this is a very appealing message, <eob> because there's nothing wrong <eol> with quantifying; <eob> it's actually very satisfying. <eob>
I get a great sense of comfort from looking <eol> at an Excel spreadsheet, <eob> even very simple ones. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
It's just kind of like, <eob> "Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK. <eob>
Everything is under control. " <eob>
But the problem is <eob> that quantifying is addictive. <eob>
And when we forget that <eob> and when we don't have something <eol> to kind of keep that in check, <eob> it's very easy to just throw out data <eob> because it can't be expressed <eol> as a numerical value. <eob> It's very easy just to slip <eol> into silver-bullet thinking, <eob> as if some simple solution existed. <eob>
Because this is a great moment <eol> of danger for any organization, <eob> because oftentimes, <eol> the future we need to predict -- <eob> it isn't in that haystack, <eob> but it's that tornado <eol> that's bearing down on us <eob> outside of the barn. <eob>
There is no greater risk <eob> than being blind to the unknown. <eob>
It can cause you to make <eol> the wrong decisions. <eob> It can cause you to miss something big. <eob>
But we don't have to go down this path. <eob>
It turns out that the oracle <eol> of ancient Greece <eob> holds the secret key that shows us <eol> the path forward. <eob>
Now, recent geological research has shown <eob> that the Temple of Apollo, <eol> where the most famous oracle sat, <eob> was actually built over two earthquake faults. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And these faults would release <eol> these petrochemical fumes <eob> from underneath the Earth's crust, <eob> and the oracle literally sat <eol> right above these faults, <eob> inhaling enormous amounts of ethylene gas, these fissures. <eob>
It's true. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> It's all true, and that's what made <eol> her babble and hallucinate <eob> and go into this trance-like state. <eob>
She was high as a kite! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So how did anyone -- <eob> How did anyone get any useful <eol> advice out of her <eob> in this state? <eob>
Well, you see those people <eol> surrounding the oracle? <eob>
You see those people holding her up, <eob> because she's, like, a little woozy? <eob>
And you see that guy <eol> on your left-hand side <eob> holding the orange notebook? <eob>
Well, those were the temple guides, <eob> and they worked hand in hand <eol> with the oracle. <eob>
When inquisitors would come <eol> and get on their knees, <eob> that's when the temple guides would get to work, <eob> because after they asked her questions, <eob> they would observe their emotional state, <eob> and then they would ask them <eol> follow-up questions, <eob> like, "Why do you want <eol> to know this prophecy? Who are you? <eob> What are you going to do <eol> with this information?" <eob> And then the temple guides would take <eol> this more ethnographic, <eob> this more qualitative information, <eob> and interpret the oracle's babblings. <eob>
So the oracle didn't stand alone, <eob> and neither should our big data systems. <eob>
Now to be clear, <eob> I'm not saying that big data systems <eol> are huffing ethylene gas, <eob> or that they're even giving invalid predictions. <eob> The total opposite. <eob> But what I am saying <eob> is that in the same way that the oracle needed <eol> her temple guides, <eob> our big data systems need them, too. <eob>
They need people like ethnographers <eol> and user researchers <eob> who can gather what I call thick data. <eob>
This is precious data from humans, <eob> like stories, emotions and interactions <eol> that cannot be quantified. <eob>
It's the kind of data <eol> that I collected for Nokia <eob> that comes in in the form <eol> of a very small sample size, <eob> but delivers incredible depth <eol> of meaning. <eob>
And what makes it so thick and meaty <eob> is the experience of understanding <eol> the human narrative. <eob>
And that's what helps to see <eol> what's missing in our models. <eob>
Thick data grounds our business questions <eol> in human questions, <eob> and that's why integrating big <eol> and thick data <eob> forms a more complete picture. <eob>
Big data is able <eol> to offer insights at scale <eob> and leverage the best of machine intelligence, <eob> whereas thick data can help us rescue the context loss <eob> that comes from making big data usable, <eob> and leverage the best of human intelligence. <eob>
And when you actually integrate the two, <eol> that's when things get really fun, <eob> because then you're no longer just working with data <eob> you've already collected. <eob> You get to also work with data <eol> that hasn't been collected. <eob>
You get to ask questions about why: <eob> Why is this happening? <eob>
Now, when Netflix did this, <eob> they unlocked a whole new way <eol> to transform their business. <eob>
Netflix is known for their really <eol> great recommendation algorithm, <eob> and they had this $1 million prize <eol> for anyone who could improve it. <eob>
And there were winners. <eob> But Netflix discovered <eol> the improvements were only incremental. <eob>
So to really find out <eol> what was going on, <eob> they hired an ethnographer, <eol> Grant McCracken, <eob> to gather thick data insights. <eob> And what he discovered was something <eol> that they hadn't seen initially <eob> in the quantitative data. <eob>
He discovered that people loved <eol> to binge-watch. <eob>
In fact, people didn't even feel <eol> guilty about it. <eob> They enjoyed it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So Netflix was like, "Oh. <eob>
This is a new insight. <eob> "So they went <eol> to their data science team, <eob> and they were able to scale <eol> this big data insight <eob> in with their quantitative data. <eob>
And once they verified it <eol> and validated it, <eob> Netflix decided to do <eol> something very simple but impactful. <eob>
They said, instead of offering the same show <eol> from different genres <eob> or more of the different shows <eol> from similar users, <eob> we'll just offer more of the same show. <eob>
We'll make it easier <eol> for you to binge-watch. <eob> And they didn't stop there. <eob> They did all these things <eob> to redesign their entire viewer experience, <eob> to really encourage binge-watching. <eob>
It's why people and friends disappear for whole weekends at a time, <eob> catching up on shows like <eol> "Master of None." <eob> By integrating big data and thick data, <eol> they not only improved their business, <eob> but they transformed <eol> how we consume media. <eob>
And now their stocks are projected <eol> to double in the next few years. <eob>
But this isn't just about watching <eol> more videos <eob> or selling more smartphones. <eob>
For some, integrating thick data <eol> insights into the algorithm <eob> could mean life or death, <eob> especially for the marginalized. <eob>
All around the country, police departments <eol> are using big data <eob> for predictive policing, <eob> to set bond amounts and sentencing recommendations <eob> in ways that reinforce existing biases. <eob>
NSA's Skynet machine learning algorithm <eob> has possibly aided <eol> in the deaths of thousands of civilians in Pakistan <eob> from misreading cellular device metadata. <eob>
As all of our lives become more automated, <eob> from automobiles <eol> to health insurance or to employment, <eob> it is likely that all of us <eob> will be impacted by the quantification bias. <eob>
Now, the good news is that <eol> we've come a long way <eob> from huffing <eol> ethylene gas to make predictions. <eob>
We have better tools, <eol> so let's just use them better. <eob>
Let's integrate the big data <eol> with the thick data. <eob>
Let's bring our temple guides <eol> with the oracles, <eob> and whether this work happens in companies <eol> or nonprofits <eob> or government or even in the software, <eob> all of it matters, <eob> because that means we're collectively committed <eob> to making better data, <eob> better algorithms, better outputs <eob> and better decisions. <eob>
This is how we'll avoid missing <eol> that something. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
If you've been thinking about US politics <eob> and trying to make sense of it <eol> for the last year or so, <eob> you might have hit on something <eol> like the following three propositions: <eob> one, US partisanship <eol> has never been so bad before; <eob> two, <eob> for the first time, it's geographically spatialized — <eob> we're divided between the coasts, <eol> which want to look outwards, <eob> and the center of the country, <eol> which wants to look inwards; <eob> and third, <eob> there's nothing we can do about it. <eob>
I'm here to today to say <eol> that all three of these propositions, <eob> all of which sound reasonable, <eob> are not true. <eob>
In fact, <eob> our US partisanship goes all the way back <eob> to the very beginning of the republic. <eob>
It was geographically spatialized in almost <eol> eerily the same way <eob> that it is today, <eob> and it often has been throughout US history. <eob>
And last, <eob> and by far most importantly, <eob> we actually have an extraordinary mechanism <eob> that's designed to help us manage factional disagreement <eol> and partisanship. <eob>
That technology is the Constitution. <eob>
And this is an evolving, subtly, <eol> supplely designed entity <eob> that has the specific purpose <eob> of teaching us how to manage <eol> factional disagreement <eob> where it's possible to do that, <eob> and giving us techniques <eol> for overcoming that disagreement <eob> when that's possible. <eob>
Now, in order to tell you the story, <eob> I want to go back to a pivotal moment <eol> in US history, <eob> and that is the moment <eob> when factional disagreement <eol> and partisanship was born. <eob>
There actually was a birth moment -- <eob> a moment in US history <eol> when partisanship snapped into place. <eob>
The person who's at the core <eol> of that story is James Madison. <eob>
And at the moment that this began, <eob> James Madison was riding high. <eob>
He himself was the Einstein <eol> of not only the US Constitution, <eob> but of constitutional thought <eol> more globally, <eob> and, to give him his due, <eob> he knew it. <eob>
In a period of time <eol> of just three years, <eob> from 1785 to 1788, <eob> he had conceived, theorized, designed, <eol> passed and gotten ratified <eob> the US Constitution. <eob>
And just to give you some <eol> sense of the enormity <eob> of what that accomplishment actually was, <eob> although Madison couldn't have <eol> known it at the time, <eob> today that same constitutional technology <eol> that he invented is still in use <eob> not only in the US, <eob> but, 230 years later, <eob> in places like Canada, <eob> India, <eob> South Africa, <eob> Brazil. <eob>
So in an extraordinary range <eol> of contexts all over the world, <eob> this technology is still the dominant, <eob> most used, most effective technology <eol> to manage governance. <eob>
In that moment, <eob> Madison believed <eol> that, having solved this problem, <eob> the country would run smoothly, <eob> and that he had designed a technology <eob> that would minimize the results of factions <eob> so there would be no political parties. <eob>
Remarkably, he thought <eol> he had designed a constitution <eob> that was against political parties <eob> and would make them unnecessary. <eob>
He had gotten an enormous degree of help <eob> in the final marketing phase <eol> of his constitutional project <eob> from a man you may have heard <eol> of, called Alexander Hamilton. <eob>
Now, Hamilton was everything <eol> Madison was not. <eob>
He was passionate, where Madison <eol> was restrained. <eob>
He was pansexual, <eob> where Madison didn't speak <eol> to a woman expect for once <eob> until he was 42 years old, <eob> and then married Dolley <eol> and lived happily ever after for 40 years. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
Or indeed, a musical <eol> of any kind at all. <eob> But together, <eob> they had become <eol> a rather unlikely pairing, <eob> and they had produced the Federalist Papers, <eob> which offered a justification <eob> and, as I mentioned, <eob> a marketing plan for the Constitution, <eob> which had been wildly effective <eol> and wildly successful. <eob>
Once the new government was in place, <eob> Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury, <eob> and he had a very specific idea in mind. <eob>
And that was <eob> to do for financial <eol> institutions and infrastructure <eob> exactly what Madison had done <eol> for constitutions. <eob>
Again, his contemporaries all knew it. <eob>
One of them told Madison, <eob> who can't have liked it very much, <eob> that Hamilton was the Newton <eol> of infrastructure. <eob>
The idea was pretty straightforward. <eob>
Hamilton would give <eol> the United States a national bank, <eob> a permanent national debt -- <eob> he said it would be "immortal," his phrase -- <eob> and a manufacturing policy <eol> that would enable trade and manufacturing <eob> rather than agriculture, <eob> which was where the country's primary <eol> wealth had historically been. <eob> Madison went utterly ballistic. <eob> And in this pivotal, critical decision, <eob> instead of just telling the world <eol> that his old friend Hamilton was wrong <eob> and was adopting the wrong policies, <eob> he actually began to argue <eob> that Hamilton's ideas were unconstitutional -- <eob> that they violated the very nature of the Constitution <eob> that the two of them had drafted together. <eob>
Hamilton responded the way <eol> you would expect. <eob>
He declared Madison to be <eol> his "personal and political enemy" -- <eob> these are his words. <eob>
So these two founders who had been such close friends <eol> and such close allies <eob> and such partners, <eob> then began to produce enmity. <eob>
And they did it in the good, old-fashioned way. <eob>
First, they founded political parties. <eob>
Madison created a party originally <eol> called the Democratic Republican Party -- <eob> "Republican" for short -- <eob> and Hamilton created a party <eol> called the Federalist Party. <eob>
Those two parties adopted <eol> positions on national politics <eob> that were extreme and exaggerated. <eob>
To give you a clear example: <eob> Madison, who had always believed <eob> that the country would have <eol> some manufacturing and some trade <eob> and some agriculture, <eob> began attacking Hamilton <eob> as a kind of tool <eol> of the financial markets <eob> whom Hamilton himself intended <eol> to put in charge of the country. <eob>
That was an overstatement, <eob> but it was something Madison <eol> came to believe. <eob>
He also attacked city life, <eob> and he said that the coasts were corrupt, <eob> and what people needed to do <eol> was to look inwards <eob> to the center of the country, <eob> to farmers, who were the essence <eol> of Republican virtue, <eob> and they should go back to the values <eol> that had made American great, <eob> specifically the values <eol> of the Revolution, <eob> and those were the values <eol> of low taxes, <eob> agriculture <eob> and less trade. <eob>
Hamilton responded to this by saying <eol> that Madison was naïve, <eob> that he was childish, <eob> and that his goal was to turn the United States <eob> into a primitive autarchy, <eob> self-reliant and completely ineffectual <eol> on the global scale. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> They both meant it, <eob> and there was some truth <eol> to each of their claims, <eob> because each side was grossly exaggerating <eol> the views of the other <eob> in order to fight their war. <eob>
They founded newspapers, <eob> and so for the first time in US history, <eob> the news that people received <eol> came entirely through the lens <eob> of either the Republican <eol> or the Federalist party. <eob>
How does this end? <eob> Well, as it turned out, <eol> the Constitution did its work. <eob>
But it did its work in surprising ways <eob> that Madison himself <eol> had not fully anticipated. <eob>
First, there was a series of elections. <eob>
And the first two times out of the box, <eob> the Federalists destroyed the Republicans. <eob> Madison was astonished. <eob> Of course, he blamed the press. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> And in a rather innovative view — <eob> Madison never failed to innovate <eol> when he thought about anything — <eob> he said the reason <eol> that the press was so pro-Federalist <eob> is that the advertisers <eol> were all Federalists, <eob> because they were traders on the coasts <eol> who got their capital from Britain, <eob> which Federalism was in bed with. <eob>
That was his initial explanation. <eob>
But despite the fact that the Federalists, <eob> once in power, <eob> actually enacted laws <eol> that criminalized criticism of the government — <eob> that happened in the United States — <eob> nevertheless, <eob> the Republicans fought back, <eob> and Madison began to emphasize <eol> the freedom of speech, <eob> which he had built into the Bill of Rights, <eob> and the capacity of civil society <eob> to organize. <eob>
And sure enough, nationally, <eob> small local groups -- <eol> they were called Democratic-Republican Societies -- <eob> began to form and protest against Federalist-dominated <eol> hegemony. <eob>
Eventually, the Republicans managed <eol> to win a national election -- <eob> that was in 1800. <eob>
Madison became the Secretary of State, <eob> his friend and mentor Jefferson became president, <eob> and they actually, over time, <eob> managed to put the Federalists <eol> completely out of business. <eob>
That was their goal. <eob> Now, why did that happen? <eob> It happened because in the structure <eol> of the Constitution <eob> were several features <eol> that actually managed faction <eob> the way there were supposed to do <eol> in the first place. <eob> What were those? <eob> One -- most important of all -- <eob> the freedom of speech. <eob>
This was an innovative idea at the time. <eob>
Namely, that if you were out of power, <eob> you could still say that <eol> the government was terrible. <eob>
Two, <eob> civil society organization. <eob>
The capacity to put together <eol> private groups, individuals, <eob> political parties and others <eob> who would organize to try <eol> to bring about fundamental change. <eob>
Perhaps most significantly was <eol> the separation of powers -- <eob> an extraordinary component <eol> of the Constitution. <eob>
The thing about the separation of powers <eob> is that it did then and it does now, <eob> drive governance to the center. <eob>
You can get elected to office <eol> in the United States <eob> with help from the periphery, <eob> right or left. <eob>
It turns out, <eob> you actually can't govern <eol> unless you bring on board the center. <eob>
There are midterm elections <eol> that come incredibly fast <eob> after a presidency begins. <eob>
Those drive presidents towards the center. <eob>
There's a structure in which the president, <eol> in fact, does not rule <eob> or even govern, <eob> but can only propose laws <eol> which other people have to agree with -- <eob> another feature that tends to drive presidents <eob> who actually want to get things done <eob> to the center. <eob>
And a glance at the newspapers <eol> today will reveal to you <eob> that these principles <eol> are still completely in operation. <eob>
No matter how a president gets elected, <eob> the president cannot get anything done <eob> unless the president first of all follows <eol> the rules of the Constitution, <eob> because if not, <eob> the courts will stand up, <eol> as indeed has sometimes occurred, <eob> not only recently, but in the past, <eol> in US history. <eob>
And furthermore, <eob> the president needs people, <eob> elected officials who know <eol> they need to win election <eob> from centrist voters, <eob> also to back his or her policies <eol> in order to pass laws. <eob>
Without it, nothing much happens. <eob>
The takeaway <eol> of this brief excursus <eob> into the history of partisanship, <eol> then, is the following: <eob> partisanship is real; <eob> it's profound; <eob> it's extraordinarily powerful, <eob> and it's terribly upsetting. <eob>
But the design of the Constitution <eol> is greater than partisanship. <eob>
It enables us to manage partisanship <eob> when that's possible, <eob> and it enables us actually <eol> to overcome partisan division <eob> and produce compromise, <eob> when and only when that is possible. <eob>
A technology like that <eol> is a technology that worked <eob> for the founders, <eob> it worked for their grandchildren, <eob> it didn't work at the moment <eol> of the Civil War, <eob> but then it started working again. <eob>
And it worked for our grandparents, <eob> our parents, <eob> and it's going to work for us. <eob> (Applause) <eob> So what you should do is really simple. <eob>
Stand up for what you believe in, <eob> support the organizations that you care about, <eob> speak out on the issues <eol> that matter to you, <eob> get involved, <eob> make change, <eob> express you opinion, <eob> and do it with respect <eol> and knowledge and confidence <eob> that it's only by working together <eob> that the constitutional technology can do the job <eol> that it is designed to do. <eob>
Stand up for what you believe, <eob> but take a deep breath while you do it. <eob> It's going to be OK. <eob>
I'd like to introduce you to my mom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm guessing that's not <eol> what you expected, <eob> and it's not what I expected either, <eob> and thank goodness I realized <eol> that an Asian man was not my mom <eob> before I hugged him, <eob> because that would have <eol> been so awkward. <eob>
Recognizing people isn't one of my strengths <eob> due to a genetic visual impairment <eol> that has no correction or cure. <eob>
As a result, I am legally blind, <eob> though I prefer "partially sighted" <eol> because it's more optimistic. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I'm entitled to the label "disabled." <eob>
I hate the word disabled <eol> when it's used to describe people. <eob>
It detonates a mindset of less than <eob> that utterly disregards capacity, <eob> ability, potential, <eob> instead prioritizing brokenness <eob> and lack. <eob>
The perspective can be overt. <eob>
What can't he do for himself that <eol> I'm going to have to do for him? <eob>
She'll probably need some accommodation <eob> that no other employee <eol> at this business needs. <eob>
Sometimes, the hidden bias <eob> is so sweetly conveyed. <eob> "Wow, Susan, <eob> look at everything you've done <eol> in your career and your life. <eob>
How did you do all of that <eol> and be visually impaired?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I fail at being disabled. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So in the spirit of incentivizing <eol> the rampant failure <eob> of people all over the world <eob> and enticing the so-called normal <eol> to just give it a rest already, <eob> here are five tips <eob> to fail at being disabled. <eob>
Tip one: <eob> know your superpowers. <eob>
The best team I ever <eol> led in my career <eob> was based on superpowers, <eob> and we even gave ourselves fancy-pantsy titles <eob> like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen." <eob> "The Biscuit Butterer." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"The Voice of Reason." <eob>
Because we relied on our strengths, <eob> our best strengths, <eob> we achieved tremendous outcomes. <eob>
The trait that prevents me <eol> from recognizing my mom <eob> allows me to smoothly adapt, <eob> to quickly absorb and accurately process <eol> an exhausting volume of cues, <eob> tease out what's important, <eob> determine multiple processes or potentials <eol> for any situation that I'm in, <eob> and then select the one that makes the most sense, <eob> all in a matter of seconds. <eob>
I see what other people do not. <eob>
Some people think that's a superpower, <eob> but my real superpowers <eob> are ricocheting off of glass walls -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and letting my friends walk <eol> around with kale in their teeth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's true. Don't have lunch with me, <eob> or dinner. <eob>
Tip two: be supremely skilled, <eob> supremely skilled at getting it wrong. <eob>
It is important to be as equally <eol> confident in your superpowers <eob> as you are in you FUBARs. <eob>
That's "effed up beyond all recognition" <eob> for you millennials. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's a good example. <eob>
It is not a great idea to say, <eob> "Don't worry, everything in here <eol> is too small for me to see" <eob> when you accidentally walk <eol> into the men's room -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
at one of the world's largest <eol> sporting arenas -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
or anywhere. <eob> I really wish <eol> that one wasn't true. <eob> I'm serious. It is better to just walk out <eol> and let them think you're drunk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Tip three: know that everyone <eol> is disabled in some way, <eob> like when you have a cold <eol> and you can't smell <eob> and you realize that the milk <eol> that you splashed in your coffee was sour <eob> only after you've tasted it. <eob>
Very recently, a woman walked <eol> up to me frantic. <eob>
She could not find the bakery <eol> she was looking for. <eob>
As I motioned in the direction <eol> I thought she should go, <eob> saying, "There are no stores on this side of the street <eob> so your best bet is to cross --" <eob>
"Oh my goodness," she interrupted. <eob> "There it is. <eob> All I needed was another set of eyes." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I just let her have it. <eob>
I would have said that, you know, <eob> being logical and paying attention <eob> and staying calm would have done the trick, <eob> but who am I? <eob>
Tip four: point out <eol> the disability in others. <eob>
This one is best reserved -- <eol> very important note -- <eob> this one is best reserved <eol> for people you know well, <eob> because random strangers <eol> typically don't appreciate <eob> teachable moments. <eob>
A few years ago, my parents <eol> and I went to see the Rockettes, <eob> Radio City's high-kicking dancers. <eob>
I leaned over to my dad. <eob>
"The two Rockettes on the left <eol> aren't kicking in a straight line." <eob>
"Yes, they are." <eob>
"No, they're not." <eob>
"Yes, they are, <eob> and how do you know? <eob>
You can't see." <eob>
But I know what a straight line <eol> looks like. <eob>
I had snapped a picture <eol> during our back and forth <eob> and presented him the evidence <eol> that proved I was right. <eob>
He looked at the picture. <eob>
I leaned in further. <eob>
"Who's disabled now?" <eob>
Tip five: pursue audacious goals. <eob>
Flip expectation upside down <eob> and shove limitation off a cliff <eol> to meet its demise. <eob>
There is a college football linebacker <eob> who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles <eob> while having one hand. <eob>
There is a teacher <eol> who successfully transfers knowledge <eob> and inspires countless students <eob> while living with Down syndrome. <eob>
And for me, <eob> on my long list, <eob> to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal, <eol> to Darjeeling, India <eob> on the backseat <eol> of a bicycle built for two. <eob>
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure, <eob> and I'm sure I will have <eol> the blurry photos to show for it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh, before we go on, I forgot <eol> to introduce you to my mom. <eob>
I need to do that. <eob>
And here she is, <eob> as she would appear to me <eob> if I were looking through a crowd <eol> of people looking for her. <eob>
Or is that an Asian man? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Cancer. <eob> Many of us have lost family, <eol> friends or loved ones <eob> to this horrible disease. <eob>
I know there are some <eol> of you in the audience <eob> who are cancer survivors, <eob> or who are fighting cancer <eol> at this moment. <eob>
My heart goes out to you. <eob>
While this word often conjures up <eol> emotions of sadness and anger and fear, <eob> I bring you good news from the front lines <eol> of cancer research. <eob>
The fact is, we are starting <eol> to win the war on cancer. <eob>
In fact, we lie at the intersection <eob> of the three of the most exciting <eol> developments within cancer research. <eob>
The first is cancer genomics. <eob>
The genome is a composition <eob> of all the genetic information <eol> encoded by DNA <eob> in an organism. <eob>
In cancers, changes in the DNA <eol> called mutations <eob> are what drive these cancers <eol> to go out of control. <eob>
Around 10 years ago, I was part <eol> of the team at Johns Hopkins <eob> that first mapped the mutations <eol> of cancers. <eob>
We did this first for colorectal, <eob> breast, pancreatic and brain cancers. <eob>
And since then, there have been <eol> over 90 projects in 70 countries <eob> all over the world, <eob> working to understand the genetic <eol> basis of these diseases. <eob>
Today, tens of thousands of cancers <eol> are understood <eob> down to exquisite molecular detail. <eob>
The second revolution is precision medicine, <eob> also known as "personalized medicine." <eob> Instead of one-size-fits-all methods <eol> to be able to treat cancers, <eob> there is a whole new class of drugs <eol> that are able to target cancers <eob> based on their unique genetic profile. <eob>
Today, there are a host <eol> of these tailor-made drugs, <eob> called targeted therapies, <eob> available to physicians even today <eob> to be able to personalize their therapy <eol> for their patients, <eob> and many others <eol> are in development. <eob>
The third exciting revolution <eol> is immunotherapy, <eob> and this is really exciting. <eob>
Scientists have been able <eol> to leverage the immune system <eob> in the fight against cancer. <eob>
For example, there have been ways <eol> where we find the off switches of cancer, <eob> and new drugs have been able to turn <eol> the immune system back on, <eob> to be able to fight cancer. <eob>
In addition, there are ways <eol> where you can take away immune cells <eob> from the body, <eob> train them, engineer them <eol> and put them back into the body <eob> to fight cancer. <eob>
Almost sounds like science <eol> fiction, doesn't it? <eob>
While I was a researcher <eol> at the National Cancer Institute, <eob> I had the privilege <eol> of working with some of the pioneers of this field <eob> and watched the development firsthand. <eob>
It's been pretty amazing. <eob>
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open, <eob> actively recruiting patients <eol> to explore all aspects in immunotherapy. <eob>
While these three exciting revolutions are ongoing, <eob> unfortunately, this is only the beginning, <eob> and there are still many, many challenges. <eob>
Let me illustrate with a patient. <eob>
Here is a patient with a skin cancer <eol> called melanoma. <eob>
It's horrible; the cancer <eol> has gone everywhere. <eob>
However, scientists were able to map <eol> the mutations of this cancer <eob> and give a specific treatment <eol> that targets one of the mutations. <eob>
And the result is almost miraculous. <eob>
Tumors almost seem to melt away. <eob>
Unfortunately, this is not <eol> the end of the story. <eob>
A few months later, this picture is taken. <eob>
The tumor has come back. <eob>
The question is: Why? <eob>
The answer is tumor heterogeneity. <eob> Let me explain. <eob>
Even a cancer as small <eol> as one centimeter in diameter <eob> harbors over a hundred million different cells. <eob>
While genetically similar, <eob> there are small differences <eol> in these different cancers <eob> that make them differently <eol> prone to different drugs. <eob>
So even if you have a drug <eol> that's highly effective, <eob> that kills almost all the cells, <eob> there is a chance that there's a small population <eob> that's resistant to the drug. <eob>
This ultimately is the population <eob> that comes back, <eob> and takes over the patient. <eob>
So then the question is: <eol> What do we do with this information? <eob>
Well, the key, then, <eob> is to apply all these exciting advancements <eol> in cancer therapy earlier, <eob> as soon as we can, <eob> before these resistance <eol> clones emerge. <eob>
The key to cancer and curing cancer <eol> is early detection. <eob>
And we intuitively know this. <eob>
Finding cancer early results <eol> in better outcomes, <eob> and the numbers show this as well. <eob>
For example, in ovarian cancer, <eol> if you detect cancer in stage four, <eob> only 17 percent of the women <eol> survive at five years. <eob>
However, if you are able to detect <eol> this cancer as early as stage one, <eob> over 92 percent of women will survive. <eob>
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent <eol> of women are detected at stage one, <eob> whereas the vast majority, 70 percent, <eol> are detected in stages three and four. <eob>
We desperately need better detection <eol> mechanisms for cancers. <eob>
The current best ways to screen cancer <eol> fall into one of three categories. <eob>
First is medical procedures, <eob> which is like colonoscopy <eol> for colon cancer. <eob>
Second is protein biomarkers, <eol> like PSA for prostate cancer. <eob>
Or third, imaging techniques, <eob> such as mammography for breast cancer. <eob>
Medical procedures are the gold standard; <eob> however, they are highly invasive <eob> and require a large infrastructure <eol> to implement. <eob>
Protein markers, while effective <eol> in some populations, <eob> are not very specific in some circumstances, <eob> resulting in high numbers of false positives, <eob> which then results in unnecessary <eol> work-ups and unnecessary procedures. <eob>
Imaging methods, while useful <eol> in some populations, <eob> expose patients to harmful radiation. <eob>
In addition, it is not <eol> applicable to all patients. <eob>
For example, mammography has problems <eol> in women with dense breasts. <eob>
So what we need is a method <eol> that is noninvasive, <eob> that is light in infrastructure, <eob> that is highly specific, <eob> that also does not have <eol> false positives, <eob> does not use any radiation <eob> and is applicable to large populations. <eob>
Even more importantly, <eob> we need a method to be able <eol> to detect cancers <eob> before they're 100 million cells in size. <eob>
Does such a technology exist? <eob>
Well, I wouldn't be up here <eol> giving a talk if it didn't. <eob>
I'm excited to tell you about this latest <eol> technology we've developed. <eob>
Central to our technology <eol> is a simple blood test. <eob>
The blood circulatory system, <eol> while seemingly mundane, <eob> is essential for you to survive, <eob> providing oxygen and nutrients to your cells, <eob> and removing waste <eol> and carbon dioxide. <eob>
Here's a key biological insight: <eob> Cancer cells grow and die <eol> faster than normal cells, <eob> and when they die, <eob> DNA is shed into the blood system. <eob>
Since we know the signatures <eol> of these cancer cells <eob> from all the different cancer genome <eol> sequencing projects, <eob> we can look for those signals <eol> in the blood <eob> to be able to detect <eol> these cancers early. <eob>
So instead of waiting for cancers <eob> to be large enough <eol> to cause symptoms, <eob> or for them to be dense enough <eol> to show up on imaging, <eob> or for them to be prominent enough <eob> for you to be able to visualize <eol> on medical procedures, <eob> we can start looking for cancers <eol> while they are relatively pretty small, <eob> by looking for these small amounts <eol> of DNA in the blood. <eob>
So let me tell you how we do this. <eob>
First, like I said, we start <eol> off with a simple blood test -- <eob> no radiation, no complicated equipment -- <eob> a simple blood test. <eob>
Then the blood is shipped to us, <eob> and what we do is extract <eol> the DNA out of it. <eob>
While your body is mostly healthy cells, <eob> most of the DNA <eol> that's detected will be from healthy cells. <eob>
However, there will be a small amount, <eol> less than one percent, <eob> that comes from the cancer cells. <eob>
Then we use molecular biology methods <eol> to be able to enrich this DNA <eob> for areas of the genome <eol> which are known to be associated with cancer, <eob> based on the information <eol> from the cancer genomics projects. <eob>
We're able to then put this DNA <eol> into DNA-sequencing machines <eob> and are able to digitize the DNA <eol> into A's, C's, T's and G's <eob> and have this final readout. <eob>
Ultimately, we have information <eol> of billions of letters <eob> that output from this run. <eob>
We then apply statistical <eol> and computational methods <eob> to be able to find <eol> the small signal that's present, <eob> indicative of the small amount <eol> of cancer DNA in the blood. <eob>
So does this actually work in patients? <eob>
Well, because there's no way <eol> of really predicting right now <eob> which patients will get cancer, <eob> we use the next best population: <eob> cancers in remission; <eob> specifically, lung cancer. <eob>
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs <eol> that we have today, <eob> most lung cancers <eol> come back. <eob>
The key, then, is to see <eob> whether we're able to detect <eol> these recurrences of cancers <eob> earlier than with standard methods. <eob>
We just finished a major trial <eob> with Professor Charles Swanton <eol> at University College London, <eob> examining this. <eob>
Let me walk you through an example <eol> of one patient. <eob>
Here's an example of one patient <eol> who undergoes surgery <eob> at time point zero, <eob> and then undergoes chemotherapy. <eob>
Then the patient is under remission. <eob>
He is monitored using clinical <eol> exams and imaging methods. <eob>
Around day 450, unfortunately, <eol> the cancer comes back. <eob>
The question is: Are we able <eol> to catch this earlier? <eob>
During this whole time, we've been <eol> collecting blood serially <eob> to be able to measure <eol> the amount of ctDNA in the blood. <eob>
So at the initial time point, as expected, <eob> there's a high level of cancer DNA in the blood. <eob>
However, this goes away to zero <eol> in subsequent time points <eob> and remains negligible after subsequent points. <eob>
However, around day 340, we see <eol> the rise of cancer DNA in the blood, <eob> and eventually, it goes up higher for days <eol> 400 and 450. <eob>
Here's the key, <eol> if you've missed it: <eob> At day 340, we see the rise <eol> in the cancer DNA in the blood. <eob>
That means we are catching this cancer <eol> over a hundred days earlier <eob> than traditional methods. <eob>
This is a hundred days earlier <eol> where we can give therapies, <eob> a hundred days earlier where we can do <eol> surgical interventions, <eob> or even a hundred days less <eol> for the cancer to grow <eob> or a hundred days less <eol> for resistance to occur. <eob>
For some patients, this hundred days <eol> means the matter of life and death. <eob>
We're really excited <eol> about this information. <eob>
Because of this assignment, <eol> we've done additional studies now <eob> in other cancers, <eob> including breast cancer, lung cancer <eob> and ovarian cancer, <eob> and I can't wait to see how much <eol> earlier we can find these cancers. <eob>
Ultimately, I have a dream, <eob> a dream of two vials of blood, <eob> and that, in the future, as part of all of our standard <eol> physical exams, <eob> we'll have two vials <eol> of blood drawn. <eob>
And from these two vials of blood <eol> we will be able to compare <eob> the DNA from all known <eol> signatures of cancer, <eob> and hopefully then detect <eol> cancers months to even years earlier. <eob>
Even with the therapies we have currently, <eob> this could mean that millions of lives <eol> could be saved. <eob>
And if you add on to that recent <eol> advancements in immunotherapy <eob> and targeted therapies, <eob> the end of cancer is in sight. <eob>
The next time you hear the word "cancer," <eob> I want you to add to the emotions: hope. <eob> Hold on. <eob> Cancer researchers all around the world <eol> are working feverishly <eob> to beat this disease, <eob> and tremendous progress <eol> is being made. <eob>
This is the beginning of the end. <eob>
We will win the war on cancer. <eob>
And to me, this is amazing news. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here's a question for you: <eob> how many different scents do you think you can smell, <eob> and maybe even identify with accuracy? <eob> 100? <eob> 300? <eob> 1,000? <eob> One study estimates that humans <eol> can detect up to one trillion different odors. <eob> A trillion. <eob> It's hard to imagine, <eob> but your nose has the molecular machinery to make it happen. <eob>
Olfactory receptors -- <eob> tiny scent detectors -- <eob> are packed into your nose, <eob> each one patiently waiting to <eol> be activated by the odor, <eob> or ligand, <eob> that it's been assigned to detect. <eob>
It turns out we humans, <eol> like all vertebrates, <eob> have lots of olfactory receptors. <eob>
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted <eol> to genes for different olfactory receptors <eob> than for any other type of protein. <eob>
Why is that? <eob> Could olfactory receptors <eol> be doing something else <eob> in addition to allowing us to smell? <eob>
In 1991, Linda Buck <eol> and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity <eob> of olfactory receptors -- <eob> work which ultimately <eol> led to a Nobel Prize. <eob>
At the time, <eob> we all assumed that these <eol> receptors were only found in the nose. <eob>
However, about a year or so later, <eob> a report emerged <eol> of an olfactory receptor expressed in a tissue <eob> other than the nose. <eob>
And then another such report emerged, <eob> and another. <eob>
We now know that these receptors <eol> are found all over the body, <eob> including in some pretty unexpected places -- <eob> in muscle, <eob> in kidneys, <eob> lungs <eob> and blood vessels. <eob>
But what are they doing there? <eob> Well, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors <eob> in the nose -- <eob> that's how they mediate <eol> our sense of smell. <eob>
It turns out they also act <eol> as sensitive chemical sensors <eob> in many other parts of the body. <eob>
Now, I'm not saying that your liver <eol> can detect the aroma of your morning coffee <eob> as you walk into the kitchen. <eob> Rather, after you drink your morning coffee, <eob> your liver might use <eol> an olfactory receptor <eob> to chemically detect the change in concentration <eob> of a chemical floating <eol> through your bloodstream. <eob>
Many cell types and tissues <eol> in the body use chemical sensors, <eob> or chemosensors, <eob> to keep track of the concentration <eol> of hormones, metabolites <eob> and other molecules, <eob> and some of these chemosensors <eol> are olfactory receptors. <eob>
If you are a pancreas or a kidney <eob> and you need a specialized chemical sensor <eob> that will allow you to keep track <eol> of a specific molecule, <eob> why reinvent the wheel? <eob>
One of the first examples <eob> of an olfactory receptor <eol> found outside the nose <eob> showed that human sperm express <eol> an olfactory receptor, <eob> and that sperm with this receptor <eol> will seek out the chemical <eob> that the receptor responds to -- <eob> the receptor's ligand. <eob>
That is, the sperm will swim <eol> toward the ligand. <eob>
This has intriguing implications. <eob>
Are sperm aided in finding the egg <eob> by sniffing out the area <eol> with the highest ligand concentration? <eob>
I like this example because <eol> it clearly demonstrates <eob> that an olfactory receptor's primary <eol> job is to be a chemical sensor, <eob> but depending on the context, <eob> it can influence how you perceive a smell, <eob> or in which direction <eol> sperm will swim, <eob> and as it turns out, <eob> a huge variety of other processes. <eob>
Olfactory receptors -- <eob> in muscle, <eob> Olfactory receptors <eol> have been implicated in muscle cell migration, <eob> in helping the lung to sense <eol> and respond to inhaled chemicals, <eob>
Similarly, taste receptors once thought <eol> to be found only in the tongue, <eob> are now known to be expressed in cells <eol> and tissues throughout the body. <eob>
Even more surprisingly, <eob> a recent study found <eob> that the light receptors in our eyes <eol> also play a role in our blood vessels. <eob>
In my lab, <eob> we work on trying to understand <eol> the roles of olfactory receptors and taste receptors <eob> in the context of the kidney. <eob>
The kidney is a central control <eol> center for homeostasis. <eob>
And to us, <eob> it makes sense that a homeostatic control center <eol> would be a logical place <eob> to employ chemical sensors. <eob>
We've identified a number of different <eol> olfactory and taste receptors <eob> in the kidney, <eob> one of which, olfactory receptor 78, <eob> is known to be expressed <eol> in cells and tissues <eob> that are important <eol> in the regulation of blood pressure. <eob>
When this receptor is deleted in mice, <eob> their blood pressure is low. <eob>
Surprisingly, this receptor was found to respond <eob> to chemicals called short-chain fatty acids <eob> that are produced by the bacteria <eol> that reside in your gut -- <eob> your gut microbiota. <eob>
After being produced by <eob> your gut microbiota, <eob> these chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream <eob> where they can then interact with receptors <eob> like olfactory receptor 78, <eob> meaning that the changes in metabolism <eol> of your gut microbiota <eob> may influence your blood pressure. <eob>
in the kidney, <eob> Although we've identified a number <eol> of different olfactory and taste receptors <eob> we've only just begun to tease <eol> out their different functions <eob> and to figure out which chemicals <eol> each of them responds to. <eob>
Similar investigations lie ahead <eol> for many other organs and tissues -- <eob> only a small minority of receptors <eol> has been studied to date. <eob>
This is exciting stuff. <eob>
It's revolutionizing our understanding <eol> of the scope of influence <eob> for one of the five senses. <eob>
And it has the potential <eol> to change our understanding <eob> of some aspects <eol> of human physiology. <eob>
It's still early, <eob> but I think we've picked up <eol> on the scent of something we're following. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The first time I cried underwater <eob> was in 2008, <eob> the island of Curaçao, <eob> way down in the southern Caribbean. <eob>
It's beautiful there. <eob>
I was studying these corals for my PhD, <eob> and after days and days <eol> of diving on the same reef, <eob> I had gotten to know them as individuals. <eob>
I had made friends with coral colonies -- <eob> totally a normal thing to do. <eob>
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart <eol> and ripped off their skin, <eob> leaving little bits of wounded tissue <eol> that would have a hard time healing, <eob> and big patches of dead skeleton <eol> that would get overgrown by algae. <eob>
When I saw this damage for the first time, <eob> stretching all the way down the reef, <eob> I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear <eob> and I cried. <eob>
If a coral could die that fast, <eob> how could a reef ever survive? <eob>
And why was I making it my job <eol> to try to fight for them? <eob>
I never heard another scientist <eol> tell that kind of story <eob> until last year. <eob>
A scientist in Guam wrote, <eob> "I cried right into my mask," <eob> seeing the damage on the reefs. <eob>
Then a scientist in Australia wrote, <eob> "I showed my students <eol> the results of our coral surveys, <eob> and we wept." <eob> Crying about corals <eol> is having a moment, guys. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that's because reefs in the Pacific <eob> are losing corals faster <eol> than we've ever seen before. <eob>
Because of climate change, <eob> the water is so hot <eol> for so long in the summers, <eob> that these animals can't function normally. <eob>
They're spitting out the colored algae <eol> that lives in their skin, <eob> and the clear bleached tissue <eol> that's left usually starves to death <eob> and then rots away. <eob>
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae. <eob>
This is happening <eol> over an unbelievable scale. <eob>
The Northern Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds <eol> of its corals last year <eob> over a distance of hundreds of miles, <eob> then bleached again this year, <eob> and the bleaching stretched further south. <eob>
Reefs in the Pacific are in <eol> a nosedive right now, <eob> and no one knows how bad it's <eol> going to get, <eob> except... <eob> over in the Caribbean <eol> where I work, <eob> we've already been <eol> through the nosedive. <eob>
Reefs there have suffered <eol> through centuries of intense human abuse. <eob>
We kind of already know <eol> how the story goes. <eob>
And we might be able to help <eol> predict what happens next. <eob>
Let's consult a graph. <eob> Since the invention of scuba, <eob> scientists have measured the amount <eol> of coral on the seafloor, <eob> and how it's changed through time. <eob>
And after centuries <eol> of ratcheting human pressure, <eob> Caribbean reefs met one of three fates. <eob>
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly. <eob>
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly, <eob> but kind of ended up in the same place. <eob>
OK, so far this is not going very well. <eob>
But some reefs in the Caribbean -- <eob> the ones best protected <eob> and the ones a little further from humans -- <eob> they managed to hold onto their corals. <eob>
Give us a challenge. <eob>
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero. <eob>
The second time I cried underwater <eob> was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011. <eob>
It was the calmest day of the year, <eob> but it's always pretty sketchy diving there. <eob>
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves. <eob>
I watched my compass so we could find <eol> our way back out, <eob> and he watched for sharks, <eob> and after 20 minutes of swimming <eol> that felt like an hour, <eob> we finally dropped <eol> down to the reef, <eob> and I was so shocked, <eob> and I was so happy <eob> that my eyes filled with tears. <eob>
There were corals 1,000 years old <eol> lined up one after another. <eob>
They had survived the entire history <eol> of European colonialism in the Caribbean, <eob> and for centuries before that. <eob>
I never knew what a coral could do <eol> when it was given a chance to thrive. <eob>
The truth is that even as <eol> we lose so many corals, <eob> even as we go through <eol> this massive coral die-off, <eob> some reefs will survive. <eob>
Some will be ragged on the edge, <eob> some will be beautiful. <eob>
And by protecting shorelines <eol> and giving us food to eat <eob> and supporting tourism, <eob> they will still be worth billions <eol> and billions of dollars a year. <eob>
The best time to protect a reef <eol> was 50 years ago, <eob> but the second-best time is right now. <eob>
Even as we go through bleaching events, <eob> more frequent and in more places, <eob> some corals will be able to recover. <eob>
We had a bleaching event in 2010 <eol> in the Caribbean <eob> that took off big patches of skin <eol> on boulder corals like these. <eob>
This coral lost half of its skin. <eob>
But if you look at the side <eol> of this coral a few years later, <eob> this coral is actually healthy again. <eob>
It's doing what a healthy coral does. <eob>
It's making copies of its polyps, <eob> it's fighting back the algae <eob> and it's reclaiming its territory. <eob>
If a few polyps survive, <eob> a coral can regrow; <eob> it just needs time and protection <eol> and a reasonable temperature. <eob>
Some corals can regrow in 10 years -- <eob> others take a lot longer. <eob>
But the more stresses <eol> we take off them locally -- <eob> things like overfishing, <eol> sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution, <eob> dredging, coastal construction -- <eob> the better they can hang <eol> on as we stabilize the climate, <eob> and the faster they can regrow. <eob>
And as we go through the long, <eol> tough and necessary process <eob> of stabilizing the climate of planet Earth, <eob> some new corals will still be born. <eob>
This is what I study in my research. <eob>
We try to understand <eol> how corals make babies, <eob> and how those babies find <eol> their way to the reef, <eob> and we invent new methods <eol> to help them survive <eob> those early, fragile life stages. <eob>
One of my favorite coral babies of all time <eob> showed up right after <eol> Hurricane Omar. <eob>
It's the same species <eol> I was studying before the storm, <eob> but you almost never see <eol> babies of this species -- <eob> it's really rare. <eob>
This is actually an endangered species. <eob>
In this photo, this little baby coral, <eol> this little circle of polyps, <eob> is a few years old. <eob>
it's fighting back the algae <eob> Like its cousins that bleach, <eob>
And like its cousins on the north shore, <eob> it's aiming to live for 1,000 years. <eob>
What's happening <eol> in the world and in the ocean <eob> has changed our time horizon. <eob>
We can be incredibly pessimistic <eol> on the short term, <eob> and mourn what we lost <eob> and what we really took for granted. <eob>
But we can still be optimistic <eol> on the long term, <eob> and we can still be ambitious <eol> about what we fight for <eob> and what we expect from our governments, <eob> from our planet. <eob>
Corals have been living on planet <eol> Earth for hundreds of millions of years. <eob>
They survived the extinction <eol> of the dinosaurs. <eob> They're badasses. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
An individual coral can go <eol> through tremendous trauma and fully recover <eob> if it's given a chance <eol> and it's given protection. <eob>
Corals have always been <eol> playing the long game, <eob> and now so are we. <eob>
Thanks very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today I'm going to talk <eol> about technology and society. <eob>
The Department of Transport estimated <eol> that last year <eob> 35,000 people died from traffic <eol> crashes in the US alone. <eob>
Worldwide, 1.2 million people die <eol> every year in traffic accidents. <eob>
If there was a way we could eliminate 90 percent <eol> of those accidents, <eob> would you support it? <eob>
Of course you would. <eob>
This is what driverless car technology <eol> promises to achieve <eob> by eliminating the main source <eol> of accidents -- <eob> human error. <eob>
Now picture yourself in a driverless car <eol> in the year 2030, <eob> sitting back and watching <eol> this vintage TEDxCambridge video. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
All of a sudden, <eob> the car experiences mechanical failure <eol> and is unable to stop. <eob>
If the car continues, <eob> it will crash into a bunch <eol> of pedestrians crossing the street, <eob> but the car may swerve, <eob> hitting one bystander, <eob> killing them to save the pedestrians. <eob>
What should the car do, <eol> and who should decide? <eob>
What if instead the car <eol> could swerve into a wall, <eob> crashing and killing you, the passenger, <eob> in order to save those pedestrians? <eob>
This scenario is inspired <eol> by the trolley problem, <eob> which was invented <eol> by philosophers a few decades ago <eob> to think about ethics. <eob>
Now, the way we think <eol> about this problem matters. <eob>
We may for example not think <eol> about it at all. <eob>
We may say this scenario is unrealistic, <eob> incredibly unlikely, or just silly. <eob>
But I think this criticism <eol> misses the point <eob> because it takes the scenario <eol> too literally. <eob>
Of course no accident <eol> is going to look like this; <eob> no accident has two or three options <eob> where everybody dies somehow. <eob>
Instead, the car is going <eol> to calculate something <eob> like the probability of hitting <eol> a certain group of people, <eob> if you swerve one direction <eol> versus another direction, <eob> you might slightly increase <eol> the risk to passengers or other drivers <eob> versus pedestrians. <eob>
It's going to be a more complex calculation, <eob> but it's still going to involve trade-offs, <eob> and trade-offs often require ethics. <eob>
We might say then, "Well, let's not <eol> worry about this. <eob>
Let's wait until technology <eol> is fully ready and 100 percent safe." <eob> Suppose that we can indeed eliminate <eol> 90 percent of those accidents, <eob> or even 99 percent in the next 10 years. <eob>
What if eliminating the last one percent <eol> of accidents <eob> requires 50 more years of research? <eob>
Should we not adopt the technology? <eob>
That's 60 million people <eol> dead in car accidents <eob> if we maintain the current rate. <eob>
So the point is, <eob> waiting for full safety is also a choice, <eob> and it also involves trade-offs. <eob>
People online on social media <eol> have been coming up with all sorts of ways <eob> to not think about this problem. <eob>
One person suggested the car <eol> should just swerve somehow <eob> in between the passengers -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and the bystander. <eob> Of course if that's what the car can do, <eol> that's what the car should do. <eob>
We're interested in scenarios <eol> in which this is not possible. <eob>
And my personal favorite <eol> was a suggestion by a blogger <eob> to have an eject button <eol> in the car that you press -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
just before the car self-destructs. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So if we acknowledge that cars <eol> will have to make trade-offs on the road, <eob> how do we think about those trade-offs, <eob> and how do we decide? <eob>
Well, maybe we should run a survey <eol> to find out what society wants, <eob> because ultimately, <eob> regulations and the law <eol> are a reflection of societal values. <eob>
So this is what we did. <eob>
With my collaborators, <eob> Jean-François Bonnefon and Azim Shariff, <eob> we ran a survey <eob> in which we presented people with <eol> these types of scenarios. <eob>
We gave them two options <eol> inspired by two philosophers: <eob> Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant. <eob>
Bentham says the car <eol> should follow utilitarian ethics: <eob> it should take the action <eol> that will minimize total harm — <eob> even if that action <eol> will kill a bystander <eob> and even if that action <eol> will kill the passenger. <eob>
Immanuel Kant says the car <eol> should follow duty-bound principles, <eob> like "Thou shalt not kill." <eob> So you should not take an action <eol> that explicitly harms a human being, <eob> and you should let the car take its course <eob> even if that's going to harm more people. <eob>
What do you think? <eob> Bentham or Kant? <eob> Here's what we found. <eob> Most people sided with Bentham. <eob>
So it seems that people want cars <eol> to be utilitarian, <eob> minimize total harm, <eob> and that's what we should all do. <eob> Problem solved. <eob> But there is a little catch. <eob>
When we asked people <eol> whether they would purchase such cars, <eob> they said, "Absolutely not." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They would like to buy cars <eol> that protect them at all costs, <eob> but they want everybody else <eol> to buy cars that minimize harm. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We've seen this problem before. <eob>
It's called a social dilemma. <eob>
And to understand <eol> the social dilemma, <eob> we have to go a little bit back in history. <eob>
In the 1800s, <eob> English economist William Forster Lloyd published <eol> a pamphlet <eob> which describes the following scenario. <eob>
You have a group of farmers -- <eob> English farmers -- <eob> who are sharing a common land <eol> for their sheep to graze. <eob>
Now, if each farmer brings <eol> a certain number of sheep -- <eob> let's say three sheep -- <eob> the land will be rejuvenated, <eob> the farmers are happy, <eob> the sheep are happy, <eob> everything is good. <eob>
Now, if one farmer brings one extra sheep, <eob> that farmer will do slightly better, <eol> and no one else will be harmed. <eob>
But if every farmer made <eol> that individually rational decision, <eob> the land will be overrun, <eol> and it will be depleted <eob> to the detriment of all the farmers, <eob> and of course, to the detriment <eol> of the sheep. <eob>
We see this problem in many places: <eob> in the difficulty of managing <eol> overfishing, <eob> or in reducing carbon emissions <eol> to mitigate climate change. <eob>
When it comes to the regulation <eol> of driverless cars, <eob> the common land now <eol> is basically public safety -- <eob> that's the common good -- <eob> and the farmers are the passengers <eob> or the car owners who are choosing <eol> to ride in those cars. <eob>
And by making the individually rational choice <eob> of prioritizing their own safety, <eob> they may collectively be <eol> diminishing the common good, <eob> which is minimizing total harm. <eob>
It's called the tragedy <eol> of the commons, <eob> traditionally, <eob> but I think in the case <eol> of driverless cars, <eob> the problem may be a little bit more insidious <eob> because there is not necessarily <eol> an individual human being <eob> making those decisions. <eob>
So car manufacturers <eol> may simply program cars <eob> that will maximize safety <eol> for their clients, <eob> and those cars may learn <eol> automatically on their own <eob> that doing so requires slightly increasing <eol> risk for pedestrians. <eob>
So to use the sheep metaphor, <eob> it's like we now have electric sheep <eol> that have a mind of their own. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they may go and graze <eol> even if the farmer doesn't know it. <eob>
So this is what we may call <eol> the tragedy of the algorithmic commons, <eob> and if offers new types of challenges. <eob>
Typically, <eob> traditionally, <eob> we solve these types of social dilemmas using regulation, <eob> so either governments or communities <eol> get together, <eob> and they decide collectively <eol> what kind of outcome they want <eob> and what sort of constraints <eol> on individual behavior <eob> they need to implement. <eob>
And then using monitoring and enforcement, <eob> they can make sure that the public <eol> good is preserved. <eob>
So why don't we just, <eob> as regulators, <eob> require that all cars minimize harm? <eob>
After all, this is what people <eol> say they want. <eob>
And more importantly, <eob> I can be sure that as an individual, <eob> if I buy a car that may sacrifice <eol> me in a very rare case, <eob> I'm not the only sucker doing that <eob> while everybody else enjoys <eol> unconditional protection. <eob>
In our survey, we did ask people <eol> whether they would support regulation <eob> and here's what we found. <eob>
First of all, people said no to regulation; <eob> and second, they said, <eob> "Well if you regulate cars <eol> to do this and to <eob> minimize total harm, <eob> I will not buy those cars." <eob> So ironically, <eob> by regulating cars <eol> to minimize harm, <eob> we may actually end up with more harm <eob> because people may not opt <eol> into the safer technology <eob> even if it's much safer <eol> than human drivers. <eob>
I don't have the final answer <eol> to this riddle, <eob> but I think as a starting point, <eob> we need society to come together <eob> to decide what trade-offs we are comfortable with <eob> and to come up with ways <eol> in which we can enforce those trade-offs. <eob>
As a starting point, <eol> my brilliant students, <eob> Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza, <eob> built the Moral Machine website, <eob> which generates random scenarios at you -- <eob> basically a bunch of random dilemmas <eol> in a sequence <eob> where you have to choose what the car should do <eol> in a given scenario. <eob>
And we vary the ages and even the species <eol> of the different victims. <eob>
So far we've collected <eol> over five million decisions <eob> by over one million people worldwide <eob> from the website. <eob>
And this is helping us form an early picture <eob> of what trade-offs people <eol> are comfortable with <eob> and what matters to them -- <eob> even across cultures. <eob>
But more importantly, <eob> doing this exercise <eol> is helping people recognize <eob> the difficulty of making those choices <eob> and that the regulators are tasked <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
And maybe this will help us as a society <eol> understand the kinds of trade-offs <eob> that will be implemented <eol> ultimately in regulation. <eob>
And indeed, I was very happy to hear <eob> that the first set of regulations <eob> that came from the Department of Transport -- <eob> announced last week -- <eob> included a 15-point checklist <eol> for all carmakers to provide, <eob> and number 14 was ethical consideration -- <eob> how are you going to deal with that. <eob>
We also have people reflect <eol> on their own decisions <eob> by giving them summaries <eol> of what they chose. <eob>
I'll give you one example -- <eob> I'm just going to warn you <eol> that this is not your typical example, <eob> your typical user. <eob>
This is the most sacrificed <eol> and the most saved character for this person. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Some of you may agree with him, <eob> or her, we don't know. <eob>
But this person also seems to slightly <eol> prefer passengers over pedestrians <eob> in their choices <eob> and is very happy to punish jaywalking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So let's wrap up. <eob> We started with the question -- <eol> let's call it the ethical dilemma -- <eob> of what the car should do <eol> in a specific scenario: <eob> swerve or stay? <eob>
But then we realized that the problem <eol> was a different one. <eob>
It was the problem of how to get society <eol> to agree on and enforce <eob> the trade-offs they're comfortable with. <eob>
It's a social dilemma. <eob>
In the 1940s, Isaac Asimov wrote <eol> his famous laws of robotics -- <eob> the three laws of robotics. <eob>
A robot may not harm <eol> a human being, <eob> a robot may not disobey a human being, <eob> and a robot may not <eol> allow itself to come to harm -- <eob> in this order of importance. <eob>
But after 40 years or so <eob> and after so many stories pushing <eol> these laws to the limit, <eob> Asimov introduced the zeroth law <eob> which takes precedence above all, <eob> and it's that a robot <eol> may not harm humanity as a whole. <eob>
I don't know what this means <eol> in the context of driverless cars <eob> or any specific situation, <eob> and I don't know how we can implement it, <eob> but I think that by recognizing <eob> that the regulation of driverless cars <eol> is not only a technological problem <eob> but also a societal cooperation problem, <eob> I hope that we can at least begin <eol> to ask the right questions. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's SpotMini. <eob> He'll be back in a little while. <eob>
I -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I love building robots. <eob> And my long-term goal is to build robots <eob> that can do what people and animals do. <eob>
And there's three things in particular <eob> that we're interested in. <eob>
One is balance and dynamic mobility, <eob> the second one is mobile manipulation, <eob> and the third one is mobile perception. <eob>
So, dynamic mobility and balance -- <eob> I'm going to do a demo for you. <eob>
I'm standing here, balancing. <eob> I can see you're not very impressed. <eob>
OK, how about now? <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
How about now? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Those simple capabilities mean <eol> that people can go almost anywhere on earth, <eob> on any kind of terrain. <eob>
We want to capture that for robots. <eob>
What about manipulation? <eob> I'm holding this clicker in my hand; <eob> I'm not even looking at it, <eob> and I can manipulate it without any problem. <eob>
But even more important, <eob> I can move my body <eol> while I hold the manipulator, the clicker, <eob> and stabilize and coordinate my body, <eob> and I can even walk around. <eob>
And that means I can move around in the world <eob> and expand the range of my arms and my hands <eob> and really be able to handle almost anything. <eob>
So that's mobile manipulation. <eob>
And all of you can do this. <eob>
Third is perception. <eob> I'm looking at a room <eol> with over 1,000 people in it, <eob> and my amazing visual system <eol> can see every one of you -- <eob> you're all stable in space, <eob> even when I move my head, <eob> even when I move around. <eob>
That kind of mobile perception <eol> is really important for robots <eob> that are going to move and act <eob> out in the world. <eob>
I'm going to give you a little status report <eob> on where we are in developing robots <eol> toward these ends. <eob>
The first three robots <eol> are all dynamically stabilized robots. <eob>
This one goes back a little over <eol> 10 years ago -- <eob> "BigDog." <eob> It's got a gyroscope that helps stabilize it. <eob>
It's got sensors and a control computer. <eob>
Here's a Cheetah robot <eol> that's running with a galloping gait, <eob> where it recycles its energy, <eob> it bounces on the ground, <eob> and it's computing all the time <eob> in order to keep itself <eol> stabilized and propelled. <eob>
And here's a bigger robot <eob> that's got such good locomotion <eol> using its legs, <eob> that it can go in deep snow. <eob>
This is about 10 inches deep, <eob> and it doesn't really have any trouble. <eob>
This is Spot, a new generation of robot -- <eob> just slightly older than the one <eol> that came out onstage. <eob>
And we've been asking the question -- <eob> you've all heard about drone delivery: <eob> Can we deliver packages <eol> to your houses with drones? <eob> Well, what about plain old legged-robot delivery? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So we've been taking our robot <eol> to our employees' homes <eob> to see whether we could get in -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> the various access ways. <eob> And believe me, in the Boston area, <eob> there's every manner <eol> of stairway twists and turns. <eob>
So it's a real challenge. <eob> But we're doing very well, <eol> about 70 percent of the way. <eob>
And here's mobile manipulation, <eob> where we've put an arm on the robot, <eob> and it's finding its way through the door. <eob>
Now, one of the important things <eol> about making autonomous robots <eob> is to make them not do <eol> just exactly what you say, <eob> but make them deal with the uncertainty <eol> of what happens in the real world. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So we have Steve there, <eol> one of the engineers, <eob> giving the robot a hard time. <eob>
And the fact that the programming <eol> still tolerates all that disturbance -- <eob> it does what it's supposed to. <eob>
Here's another example, <eol> where Eric is tugging on the robot <eob> as it goes up the stairs. <eob>
And believe me, <eob> getting it to do what it's supposed <eol> to do in those circumstances <eob> is a real challenge, <eob> but the result is something <eol> that's going to generalize <eob> and make robots much more autonomous <eol> than they would be otherwise. <eob>
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot. <eob>
It's a third-generation humanoid <eol> that we've been building. <eob>
I'll tell you a little bit <eol> about the hardware design later. <eob>
And we've been saying: <eob> How close to human levels <eol> of performance and speed could we get <eob> in an ordinary task, <eob> like moving boxes around on a conveyor? <eob>
We're getting up to about two-thirds <eol> of the speed that a human operates <eob> on average. <eob>
And this robot is using both hands, <eol> it's using its body, <eob> it's stepping, <eob> so it's really an example <eol> of dynamic stability, <eob> mobile manipulation <eob> and mobile perception. <eob> Here -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We actually have two Atlases. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, everything doesn't go exactly <eol> the way it's supposed to. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And here's our latest robot, called "Handle." <eob> Handle is interesting, because it's <eol> sort of half like an animal, <eob> and it's half something else <eob> with these leg-like things and wheels. <eob>
It's got its arms <eol> on in kind of a funny way, <eob> but it really does some remarkable things. <eob>
It can carry 100 pounds. <eob>
It's probably going <eol> to lift more than that, <eob> but so far we've done 100. <eob>
It's got some pretty good <eol> rough-terrain capability, <eob> even though it has wheels. <eob>
And Handle loves to put on a show. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to give you <eol> a little bit of robot religion. <eob>
A lot of people think that a robot is a machine <eol> where there's a computer <eob> that's telling it what to do, <eob> and the computer is listening <eol> through its sensors. <eob>
But that's really only half of the story. <eob>
The real story is <eol> that the computer is on one side, <eob> making suggestions to the robot, <eob> and on the other side <eol> are the physics of the world. <eob> And that physics involves gravity, friction, <eol> bouncing into things. <eob>
In order to have a successful robot, <eob> my religion is that you have to do <eol> a holistic design, <eob> where you're designing <eol> the software, the hardware and the behavior <eob> all at one time, <eob> and all these parts really intermesh <eol> and cooperate with each other. <eob>
And when you get the perfect design, <eol> you get a real harmony <eob> between all those parts interacting <eol> with each other. <eob>
So it's half software and half hardware, <eob> plus the behavior. <eob>
We've done some work lately <eol> on the hardware, where we tried to go — <eob> the picture on the left <eol> is a conventional design, <eob> where you have parts <eol> that are all bolted together, <eob> conductors, tubes, connectors. <eob> And on the right is a more integrated thing; <eob> it's supposed to look like an anatomy drawing. <eob>
Using the miracle of 3-D printing, <eob> we're starting to build <eol> parts of robots <eob> that look a lot more like the anatomy <eol> of an animal. <eob>
So that's an upper-leg part <eol> that has hydraulic pathways -- <eob> actuators, filters -- <eob> all embedded, all printed as one piece, <eob> and the whole structure is developed <eob> with a knowledge of what the loads <eol> and behavior are going to be, <eob> which is available from data recorded from robots <eob> and simulations and things like that. <eob>
So it's a data-driven hardware design. <eob>
And using processes like that, <eob> not only the upper leg <eol> but some other things, <eob> we've gotten our robots to go <eol> from big, behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots -- <eob> that one on the right, <eol> weighing almost 400 pounds -- <eob> down to the one in the middle <eol> which was just in the video, <eob> weighs about 190 pounds, <eob> just a little bit more than me, <eob> and we have a new one, <eob> which is working but I'm not <eol> going to show it to you yet, <eob> on the left, <eob> which weighs just 165 pounds, <eob> with all the same strength and capabilities. <eob>
So these things are really <eol> getting better very quickly. <eob>
So it's time for Spot <eol> to come back out, <eob> and we're going to demonstrate <eol> a little bit of mobility, <eob> dexterity and perception. <eob>
This is Seth Davis, who's my robot wrangler today, <eob> and he's giving Spot some general direction <eob> by steering it around, <eob> but all the coordination <eol> of the legs and the sensors <eob> is done by the robot's computers on board. <eob>
The robot can walk <eol> with a number of different gaits; <eob> it's got a gyro, <eob> or a solid-state gyro, <eob> an IMU on board. <eob>
Obviously, it's got a battery, <eol> and things like that. <eob>
One of the cool things <eol> about a legged robot is, <eob> it's omnidirectional. <eob>
In addition to going forward, <eol> it can go sideways, <eob> it can turn in place. <eob>
And this robot is a little bit <eol> of a show-off. <eob>
It loves to use its dynamic gaits, <eob> like running -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it's got one more. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now if it were really a show-off, <eol> it would be hopping on one foot, <eob> but, you know. <eob>
Now, Spot has a set of cameras <eol> here, stereo cameras, <eob> and we have a feed up in the center. <eob>
It's kind of dark out in the audience, <eob> but it's going to use those cameras <eol> in order to look at the terrain <eob> right in front of it, <eob> while it goes over these obstacles <eol> back here. <eob>
For this demo, Seth is steering, <eob> but the robot's doing <eol> all its own terrain planning. <eob>
This is a terrain map, <eob> where the data from the cameras <eol> is being developed in real time, <eob> showing the red spots, <eol> which are where it doesn't want to step, <eob> and the green spots <eol> are the good places. <eob>
And here it's treating them <eol> like stepping-stones. <eob>
So it's trying to stay up <eol> on the blocks, <eob> and it adjusts its stride, <eob> and there's a ton of planning <eob> that has to go into an operation like that, <eob> and it does all that planning in real time, <eob> where it adjusts the steps a little bit longer <eob> or a little bit shorter. <eob>
Now we're going to change <eol> it into a different mode, <eob> where it's just going to treat <eol> the blocks like terrain <eob> and decide whether to step up or down <eob> as it goes. <eob>
and mobile perception. <eob> So this is using dynamic balance <eob> because it has to coordinate <eol> what it sees along with how it's moving. <eob>
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm. <eob>
Some of you may see <eol> that as a head and a neck, <eob> but believe me, it's an arm. <eob>
Seth is driving it around. <eob>
He's actually driving the hand <eol> and the body is following. <eob>
So the two are coordinated <eol> in the way I was talking about before -- <eob> in the way people can do that. <eob>
In fact, one of the cool things Spot <eol> can do we call, "chicken-head mode," <eob> and it keeps its head <eol> in one place in space, <eob> and it moves its body all around. <eob>
There's a variation <eol> of this that's called "twerking" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> but we're not going to use that today. <eob>
So, Spot: <eob> I'm feeling a little thirsty. <eob>
Could you get me a soda? <eob>
For this demo, Seth is not doing <eol> any driving. <eob>
We have a LIDAR <eol> on the back of the robot, <eob> and it's using these props <eol> we've put on the stage <eob> to localize itself. <eob>
It's gone over to that location. <eob>
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand <eob> to find the cup, <eob> picks it up -- <eob> and again, Seth's not driving. <eob>
We've planned out a path <eol> for it to go -- <eob> it looked like it was going off the path -- <eob> and now Seth's going to take over control again, <eob> because I'm a little bit chicken <eol> about having it do this by itself. <eob>
Thank you, Spot. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, Spot: <eob> How do you feel about having <eol> just finished your TED performance? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Me, too! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you all, <eob> and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics, <eob> who did all the hard work behind this. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Helen Walters: Marc, come back in the middle. <eob> Thank you so much. <eob> Come over here, I have questions. <eob>
So, you mentioned the UPS <eol> and the package delivery. <eob>
What are the other applications <eol> that you see for your robots? <eob>
Marc Raibert: You know, <eol> I think that robots <eob> that have the capabilities <eol> I've been talking about <eob> are going to be incredibly useful. <eob>
About a year ago, <eol> I went to Fukushima <eob> to see what the situation was there, <eob> and there's just a huge need <eob> for machines that can go into some <eol> of the dirty places <eob> and help remediate that. <eob>
I think it won't be too long <eol> until we have robots like this in our homes, <eob> and one of the big needs <eol> is to take care of the aging <eob> and invalids. <eob>
I think that it won't be too long <eol> till we're using robots <eob> to help take care of our parents, <eob> or probably more likely, have <eol> our children help take care of us. <eob>
And there's a bunch of other things. <eob>
I think the sky's the limit. <eob>
Many of the ideas <eol> we haven't thought of yet, <eob> and people like you will help us <eol> think of new applications. <eob>
HW: So what about the dark side? <eob>
What about the military? <eob> Are they interested? <eob>
MR: Sure, the military <eol> has been a big funder of robotics. <eob>
I don't think the military <eol> is the dark side myself, <eob> but I think, as with all advanced technology, <eob> it can be used for all kinds of things. <eob>
HW: Awesome. <eob> Thank you so much. <eob> MR: OK, you're welcome. <eob>
I love museums. <eob> Have you guys ever been <eol> to the Natural History Museum? <eob> In New York City? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So one of the things that I do <eol> is I take my kids to the museum. <eob>
Recently I took them <eol> to the Natural History Museum. <eob>
I had my two sons with me, <eol> Sabian and Dabith. <eob>
And we go into the front <eol> entrance of the museum, <eob> and there's that amazing sculpture <eol> of Teddy Roosevelt out there. <eob>
You guys know which one I'm talking about. <eob>
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting <eol> there with one hand on the horse, <eob> bold, strong, sleeves <eol> rolled up. <eob>
I don't know if he's bare-chested, <eol> but it kind of feels like it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And on the left-hand side of him <eol> is a Native American walking. <eob>
And on the right-hand side of him <eol> is an African-American walking. <eob>
And as we're moving up the stairs, <eob> getting closer to the sculpture, <eob> my oldest son, who's nine, says, <eob> "Dad, how come he gets to ride, <eob> and they have to walk?" <eob>
It stopped me in my tracks. <eob>
It stopped me in my tracks. <eob>
There was so much history <eob> that we would have to go through <eol> to try to explain that, <eob> and that's something I try to do <eol> with them anyways. <eob>
It's a question that I probably <eol> would have never really asked. <eob>
But fundamentally what he was saying was, <eob> "That doesn't look fair. <eob>
Dad, that doesn't look fair. <eob>
And why is this thing that's so not fair <eob> sitting outside <eol> of such an amazing institution." <eob> And his question got me wondering, <eob> is there a way for us <eol> to amend our public sculptures, <eob> our national monuments? <eob>
Not erase them, <eob> but is there a way to amend them? <eob>
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums. <eob>
That's not my history. <eob>
My mother was 15 years old <eol> when I was born. <eob> She is amazing. <eob> My father was struggling <eol> with his own things <eob> for most of my life. <eob>
If you really want to know the truth, <eob> the only reason I got into art <eol> is because of a woman. <eob>
There was this amazing, amazing, fantastic, <eol> beautiful, smart woman, <eob> four years older than me, <eob> and I wanted to go out with her. <eob>
But she said, "You're too young <eob> and you're not thinking <eol> about your future." <eob> So I ran on down to the junior college, <eob> registered for some classes, <eob> ran on back, <eob> and basically was like, <eol> "I'm thinking about my future now." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Can we go out?" <eob>
For the record, she's even more amazing. <eob> I married her. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So when I randomly ran down <eol> to the junior college <eob> and registered for classes, <eob> I really wasn't paying attention <eol> to what I was registering to. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I ended up with an art history class, <eob> and I didn't know a thing about art history. <eob> But something amazing happened <eol> when I went into that class. <eob>
For the first time in my academic career, <eob> my visual intelligence was required of me. <eob>
For the first time. <eob>
The professor would put up an image, <eob> bold strokes of blues and yellows, <eol> and say, "Who's that?" <eob> And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh. <eob>
Clearly that is Van Gogh. <eob>
I got this. <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I got a B in that class. <eob>
For me, that was amazing. <eob>
In high school, let's just say <eol> I wasn't a great student. OK? <eob> In high school, my GPA was .65. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Decimal point first, six five. <eob>
So me getting a B was huge, huge, <eob> absolutely huge. <eob>
And because of the fact that I realized that <eol> I was able to learn things visually <eob> that I couldn't learn in other ways, <eob> this became my strategy, <eol> this became my tactic <eob> for understanding everything else. <eob>
I wanted to stay in this relationship. <eob>
Things were going well. <eob> I decided, let me keep taking <eol> these art history classes. <eob> One of the last art history classes, I will not forget, I will never forget. <eob>
It was one of those survey <eol> art history classes. <eob>
Anybody ever have one <eol> of those survey art history classes, <eob> where they try to teach <eol> you the entire history of art <eob> in a single semester? <eob>
I'm talking about cave paintings <eol> and Jackson Pollock <eob> just crunched together all in the same -- <eob> It doesn't really work, <eol> but they try anyway. <eob>
Well, at the beginning of the semester, <eob> I looked at the book, <eob> and in this 400-page book <eol> was about a 14-page section <eob> that was on black people in painting. <eob>
Now, this was a crammed in section <eob> that had representations <eol> of black people in painting <eob> and black people who painted. <eob>
It was poorly curated, let's just put it <eol> that way. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nonetheless I was really excited about it, <eob> because in all the other classes <eol> that I had, <eob> we didn't even have that conversation. <eob>
We didn't talk about it at all. <eob>
So imagine my surprise <eob> when I get to class <eob> and on the day <eol> that we're supposed to go over that particular chapter, <eob> my professor announces, <eob> "We're going to skip this chapter today <eob> because we do not have time <eol> to go through it." <eob>
"Whoa, I'm sorry, hold on, <eol> professor, professor. <eob> I'm sorry. This is a really <eol> important chapter to me. <eob>
Are we going to go over it at any point?" <eob>
"Titus, we don't have time for this." <eob>
"I'm sorry, <eol> I'm sorry, <eob> I'm sorry, <eol> I'm sorry, <eob> please, I really need to understand. <eob>
Clearly the author thinks <eol> that this is significant. <eob>
Why are we skipping over this?" <eob>
"Titus, I do not have time for this." <eob>
"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here. <eob>
When can we talk, <eol> because we need to talk." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I went to her office hours. <eob>
I ended up getting kicked <eol> out of her office. <eob>
I went to the dean. <eob> The dean finally told me, "I can't force her <eol> to teach anything." <eob> And I knew in that moment <eol> if I wanted to understand this history, <eob> if I wanted to understand <eol> the roles of those folks who had to walk, <eob> I was probably going to have <eol> to figure that out myself. <eob>
So... <eob> above you right here on the slide <eob> is a painting by Frans Hals. <eob>
This is one of the kinds of images <eob> that was in that chapter. <eob>
I taught myself how to paint <eob> by going to museums <eol> and looking at images like this. <eob>
I want to show you something. <eob>
I made this. <eob> I -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I made some alterations. <eob> You'll see there are some slight <eol> differences in the painting. <eob>
All this art history <eol> that I had been absorbing <eob> helped me to realize that painting <eol> is a language. <eob>
There is a reason <eob> why he is the highest <eol> in the composition here. <eob>
There is a reason <eob> why the painter is showing us <eol> this gold necklace here. <eob>
He's trying to tell us something <eol> about the economic status <eob> of these people in these paintings. <eob>
Painting is a visual language <eob> where everything in the painting <eob> is meaningful, is important. <eob> It's coded. <eob> But sometimes, because of the compositional structure, <eob> because of compositional hierarchy, <eob> it's hard to see other things. <eob>
This silk is supposed to tell us also <eol> that they have quite a bit of money. <eob>
There's more written <eob> about dogs in art history <eob> than there are about <eol> this other character here. <eob>
Historically speaking, in research <eol> on these kinds of paintings, <eob> I can find out more about the lace <eob> that the woman is wearing in this painting -- <eob> the manufacturer of the lace -- <eol> than I can about this character here, <eob> about his dreams, about his hopes, <eob> about what he wanted out of life. <eob>
I want to show you something. <eob>
I don't want you to think <eob> that this is about eradication. <eob> It's not. <eob> The oil that you saw me <eol> just put inside of this paint <eob> is linseed oil. <eob>
It becomes transparent over time, <eob> so eventually what's going to happen <eob> is these faces <eob> will emerge a little bit. <eob>
What I'm trying to do, <eob> what I'm trying to show you, <eob> is how to shift your gaze just slightly, <eob> just momentarily, <eob> just momentarily, <eob> to ask yourself the question, <eob> why do some have to walk? <eob>
What is the impact of these kinds <eol> of sculptures at museums? <eob>
What is the impact of these kinds of paintings <eob> on some of our most vulnerable in society, <eob> seeing these kinds of depictions <eol> of themselves all the time? <eob>
I'm not saying erase it. <eob>
We can't erase this history. <eob> It's real. We have to know it. <eob>
I think of it in the same way <eob> we think of -- <eob>
Let me step back a second. <eob>
You remember old-school cameras, <eob> where when you took a picture, <eol> you actually had to focus. Right? <eob> You'd put the camera up, <eob> and if I wanted you in focus, <eob> I would move the lens a little to the left <eob> and you would come forward. <eob>
I could move the lens a little to the right, <eob> and you would go back and the folks <eol> in the background would come out. <eob>
I'm just trying to do that here. <eob>
I'm trying to give you that opportunity. <eob>
I'm trying to answer that question <eob> that my son had. <eob>
I want to make paintings, <eob> I want to make sculptures <eob> that are honest, <eob> that wrestle with the struggles of our past <eob> but speak to the diversity <eol> and the advances of our present. <eob>
And we can't do that by taking <eol> an eraser and getting rid of stuff. <eob>
That's just not going to work. <eob>
I think that we should do it <eol> in the same way <eob> the American Constitution works. <eob>
When we have a situation <eob> where we want to change a law <eol> in the American Constitution, <eob> we don't erase the other one. <eob>
Alongside that is an amendment, <eob> something that says, <eob> "This is where we were, <eol> but this is where we are right now." <eob> I figure if we can do that, <eob> then that will help us understand a little bit <eob> about where we're going. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Loneliness. <eob> All of us in this room <eol> will experience loneliness <eob> at some point in our lives. <eob>
Loneliness is not a function <eol> of being alone, <eob> but rather, a function of how socially <eol> connected you are <eob> to those around you. <eob>
There could be somebody <eol> in this room right now <eob> surrounded by a thousand people <eob> experiencing loneliness. <eob>
And while loneliness <eol> can be attributed to many things, <eob> as an architect, <eob> I'm going to tell you today how loneliness <eol> can be the result <eob> of our built environments -- <eob> the very homes we choose <eol> to live in. <eob>
Let's take a look at this house. <eob> It's a nice house. <eob>
There's a big yard, picket fence, <eob> two-car garage. <eob>
And the home might be <eol> in a neighborhood like this. <eob>
And for many people around the globe, <eob> this home, this neighborhood -- <eob> it's a dream. <eob>
And yet the danger of achieving this dream <eob> is a false sense of connection <eob> and an increase in social isolation. <eob>
I know, I can hear you now, <eob> there's somebody in the room <eol> screaming at me inside their head, <eob> "That's my house, <eol> and that's my neighborhood, <eob> and I know everyone <eol> on my block!" <eob> To which I would answer, "Terrific!" <eob> And I wish there were more people like you, <eob> because I'd wager to guess <eol> there's more people in the room <eob> living in a similar situation <eob> that might not know their neighbors. <eob>
They might recognize them <eol> and say hello, <eob> but under their breath, <eob> they're asking their spouse, <eob> "What was their name again?" <eob> so they can ask a question <eol> by name to signify they know them. <eob>
Social media also contributes <eol> to this false sense of connection. <eob>
This image is probably all too familiar. <eob>
You're standing in the elevator, <eob> sitting in a cafe, <eob> and you look around, <eob> and everyone's on their phone. <eob>
You're not texting <eol> or checking Facebook, <eob> but everyone else is, <eob> and maybe, like me, <eol> you've been in a situation <eob> where you've made eye contact, <eob> smiled and said hello, <eob> and have that person yank <eol> out their earbuds <eob> and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?" <eob> I find this incredibly isolating. <eob>
The concept I'd like to share with you today <eob> is an antidote to isolation. <eob>
It's not a new concept. <eob>
In fact, it's an age-old way of living, <eob> and it still exists in many <eol> non-European cultures <eob> around the world. <eob>
And about 50 years ago, <eob> the Danes decided <eol> to make up a new name, <eob> and since then, <eob> tens of thousands of Danish people <eol> have been living in this connected way. <eob>
And it's being pursued <eol> more widely around the globe <eob> as people are seeking community. <eob>
This concept <eob> is cohousing. <eob>
Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood <eol> where people know each other <eob> and look after one another. <eob>
In cohousing, you have your own home, <eob> but you also share significant spaces, <eol> both indoors and out. <eob>
Before I show you some pictures <eol> of cohousing, <eob> I'd like to first introduce you <eol> to my friends Sheila and Spencer. <eob>
When I first met Sheila and Spencer, <eol> they were just entering their 60s, <eob> and Spencer was looking ahead <eol> at the end of a long career <eob> in elementary education. <eob>
And he really disliked the idea <eob> that he might not have <eol> children in his life <eob> upon retirement. <eob>
They're now my neighbors. <eob>
We live in a cohousing community <eol> that I not only designed, <eob> but developed <eob> and have my architecture practice in. <eob>
This community is very intentional <eol> about our social interactions. <eob>
So let me take you on a tour. <eob>
From the outside, we look like <eol> any other small apartment building. <eob>
In fact, we look identical <eol> to the one next door, <eob> except that we're bright yellow. <eob>
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional. <eob> We all have living rooms <eol> and kitchens, <eob> bedrooms <eol> and baths, <eob> and there are nine of these homes <eol> around a central courtyard. <eob>
This one's mine, <eob> and this one is Spencer and Sheila's. <eob>
The thing that makes <eol> this building uniquely cohousing <eob> are not the homes, <eob> but rather, what happens here -- <eob> the social interactions that happen <eol> in and around that central courtyard. <eob>
When I look across the courtyard, <eob> I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila. <eob>
In fact, every morning, <eol> this is what I see, <eob> Spencer waving at me furiously <eol> as we're making our breakfasts. <eob>
From our homes, we look down <eol> into the courtyard, <eob> and depending on the time of year, <eob> we see this: <eob> kids and grownups <eol> in various combinations <eob> playing and hanging out with each other. <eob>
There's a lot of giggling and chatter. <eob>
There's a lot of hula-hooping. <eob>
And every now and then, <eol> "Hey, quit hitting me!" <eob> or a cry from one of the kids. <eob>
These are the sounds of our daily lives, <eob> and the sounds of social connectedness. <eob>
At the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors, <eob> and those lead into the common house. <eob>
I consider the common house <eol> the secret sauce of cohousing. <eob>
It's the secret sauce <eob> because it's the place <eol> where the social interactions <eob> and community life begin, <eob> and from there, it radiates out <eol> through the rest of the community. <eob>
Inside our common house, <eol> we have a large dining room <eob> to seat all 28 of us and our guests, <eob> and we dine together three times a week. <eob>
In support of those meals, <eol> we have a large kitchen <eob> so that we can take turns <eol> cooking for each other <eob> in teams of three. <eob>
So that means, with 17 adults, <eob> I lead cook once every six weeks. <eob>
Two other times, <eol> I show up and help my team <eob> with the preparation and cleanup. <eob>
And all those other nights, <eob> I just show up. <eob>
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors, <eob> and I go home, having been <eol> fed a delicious meal <eob> by someone who cares about <eol> my vegetarian preferences. <eob>
Our nine families <eol> have intentionally chosen <eob> an alternative way of living. <eob>
Instead of pursuing the American dream, <eob> where we might have been isolated <eol> in our single-family homes, <eob> we instead chose cohousing, <eob> so that we can increase our social connections. <eob>
And that's how cohousing starts: <eob> with a shared intention <eob> to live collaboratively. <eob>
And intention is the single <eol> most important characteristic <eob> that differentiates cohousing from any other housing model. <eob>
And while intention is difficult to see <eob> or even show, <eob> I'm an architect, and I can't help <eol> but show you more pictures. <eob>
So here are a few examples to illustrate <eob> how intention has been expressed <eob> in some of the communities I've visited. <eob>
Through the careful selection of furniture, <eob> lighting and acoustic materials <eol> to support eating together; <eob> in the careful visual location <eol> and visual access <eob> to kids' play areas <eol> around and inside the common house; <eob> in the consideration of scale <eob> and distribution of social gathering nodes <eob> in and around the community <eol> to support our daily lives, <eob> all of these spaces help contribute to and elevate <eob> the sense of communitas <eob> in each community. <eob>
What was that word? "Communitas." <eob> Communitas is a fancy social science way <eol> of saying "spirit of community." <eob> And in visiting over 80 different communities, <eob> my measure of communitas became: <eob> How frequently did residents eat together? <eob>
While it's completely up to each group <eob> how frequently they have common meals, <eob> I know some that have eaten <eol> together every single night <eob> for the past 40 years. <eob>
I know others <eob> that have an occasional potluck <eol> once or twice a month. <eob>
And from my observations, I can tell you, <eob> those that eat together more frequently, <eob> exhibit higher levels of communitas. <eob>
It turns out, when you eat together, <eob> you start planning <eol> more activities together. <eob>
When you eat together, <eol> you share more things. <eob>
You start to watch each other's kids. <eob> You lend our your power tools. <eol> You borrow each other's cars. <eob>
And despite all this, <eob> as my daughter loves to say, <eob> everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing, <eob> and I'm not best friends <eol> with every single person in my community. <eob>
We even have differences and conflicts. <eob>
But living in cohousing, we're intentional <eol> about our relationships. <eob>
We're motivated <eol> to resolve our differences. <eob>
We follow up, we check in, <eob> we speak our personal truths <eob> and, when appropriate, <eob> we apologize. <eob>
Skeptics will say that cohousing <eol> is only interesting or attractive <eob> to a very small group of people. <eob>
And I'll agree with that. <eob>
If you look at Western cultures <eol> around the globe, <eob> those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent. <eob>
But that needs to change, <eob> because our very lives depend upon it. <eob>
In 2015, Brigham Young University <eol> completed a study <eob> that showed a significant increase <eol> risk of premature death <eob> in those who were living in isolation. <eob>
The US Surgeon General <eol> has declared isolation <eob> to be a public health epidemic. <eob>
And this epidemic is not restricted <eol> to the US alone. <eob>
So when I said earlier <eob> that cohousing <eob> is an antidote to isolation, <eob> what I should have said <eob> is that cohousing can save your life. <eob>
If I was a doctor, I would tell you <eol> to take two aspirin, <eob> and call me in the morning. <eob>
But <eob> as an architect, <eob> I'm going to suggest <eol> that you take a walk with your neighbor, <eob> share a meal together, <eob> and call me in 20 years. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
So 24 years ago, <eob> I was brought to The New Yorker <eob> as art editor <eob> to rejuvenate <eob> what had by then become <eol> a somewhat staid institution <eob> and to bring in new artists <eob> and to try to bring the magazine <eol> from its ivory tower <eob> into engaging with its time. <eob>
And it was just the right thing for me to do <eob> because I've always been captivated <eol> by how an image can -- <eob> a simple drawing -- <eob> can cut through the torrent <eol> of images that we see every single day. <eob>
How it can capture a moment, <eob> how it can crystallize a social trend <eol> or a complex event <eob> in a way that a lot of words <eol> wouldn't be able to do -- <eob> and reduce it to its essence <eol> and turn it into a cartoon. <eob>
So I went to the library <eob> and I looked at the first cover drawn <eol> by Rea Irvin in 1925 -- <eob> a dandy looking at a butterfly <eol> through his monocle, <eob> and we call it Eustace Tilley. <eob>
And I realized that as the magazine <eol> had become known <eob> for its in-depth research and long reports, <eob> some of the humor had gotten <eol> lost along the way, <eob> because now often Eustace Tilley <eol> was seen as a haughty dandy, <eob> but in fact, in 1925, <eob> when Rea Irvin first drew this image, <eob> he did it as part of a humor magazine <eob> to amuse the youth of the era, <eob> which was the flappers of the roaring twenties. <eob>
And in the library, <eob> I found the images <eol> that really captured the zeitgeist <eob> of the Great Depression. <eob>
And it showed us not just how people dressed <eob> or what their cars looked like, <eob> but also what made them laugh, <eob> what their prejudices were. <eob>
And you really got a sense <eob> of what it felt like <eol> to be alive in the '30s. <eob>
So I called on contemporary artists, <eob> such as Adrian Tomine here. <eob>
I often call on narrative artists -- <eob> cartoonists, children's book authors -- <eob> and I give them themes such as, <eob> you know, what it's like <eol> to be in the subway, <eob> or Valentine's Day, <eob> and they send me sketches. <eob>
And once the sketches <eol> are approved by the editor, <eob> David Remnick, <eob> it's a go. <eob>
And I love the way <eob> those images are actually not <eol> telling you what to think. <eob>
But they do make you think, <eob> because the artist is actually -- <eob> it's almost a puzzle; <eob> the artist is drawing the dots, <eob> and you, the reader, <eol> have to complete the picture. <eob>
So to get this image on the left <eol> by Anita Kunz, <eob> or the one on right <eol> by Tomer Hanuka, <eob> you have to play spot the differences. <eob>
And it is something that ... <eob> It's really exciting to see <eob> how the engagement with the reader ... <eob> how those images really capture -- <eob> play with the stereotypes. <eob>
But when you get it, <eob> it rearranges the stereotypes <eol> that are in your head. <eob>
But the images don't just have to show people, <eob> sometimes it can be a feeling. <eob>
Right after September 11, <eob> I was at a point, <eob> like everybody else, <eob> where I really didn't know how to deal <eol> with what we were going through, <eob> and I felt that no image <eol> could capture this moment, <eob> and I wanted to just do a black cover, <eob> like no cover. <eob>
And I talked to my husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman, <eob> and mentioned to him <eob> that I was going <eol> to propose that, <eob> and he said, "Oh, if you're going <eol> to do a black cover, <eob> then why don't you do the silhouette <eol> of the Twin Towers, <eob> black on black?" <eob> And I sat down to draw this, <eob> and as soon as I saw it, <eob> a shiver ran down my spine <eob> and I realized <eob> that in this refusal to make an image, <eob> we had found a way to capture loss <eob> and mourning <eob> and absence. <eob>
And it's been a profound thing <eol> that I learned in the process -- <eob> that sometimes some of the images <eol> that say the most <eob> do it with the most spare means. <eob>
And a simple image can speak volumes. <eob>
So this is the image <eol> that we published by Bob Staake <eob> right after the election <eol> of Barack Obama, <eob> and captured a historic moment. <eob>
But we can't really plan for this, <eob> because in order to do this, <eob> we have to let the artist <eol> experience the emotions that we all feel <eob> when that is happening. <eob>
So back in November 2016, <eob> during the election last year, <eob> the only image that we could publish was this, <eob> which was on the stand on the week <eol> that everybody voted. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Because we knew <eol> somebody would feel this -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
when the result of the election <eol> was announced. <eob>
And when we found out the result, <eob> we really were at a loss, <eob> and this is the image that was sent <eol> by Bob Staake again, <eob> and that really hit a chord. <eob>
And again, <eob> we can't really figure out <eol> what's going to come next, <eob> but here it felt like <eol> we didn't know how to move forward, <eob> but we did move forward, <eob> and this is the image that we published <eol> after Donald Trump's election <eob> and at the time of the Women's March <eob> all over the US. <eob>
So over those 24 years, <eob> I have seen over 1,000 images <eol> come to life week after week, <eob> and I'm often asked which one is my favorite, <eob> but I can't pick one <eob> because what I'm most proud <eol> of is how different every image is, <eob> one from the other. <eob>
And that's due to the talent <eol> and the diversity <eob> of all of the artists <eol> that contribute. <eob>
And now, well, <eob> now, we're owned by Russia, <eob> so -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In a rendering by Barry Blitt here, <eob> Eustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley. <eob>
And the butterfly is none other <eol> than a flabbergasted Donald Trump <eob> flapping his wings, <eob> trying to figure out how to control <eol> the butterfly effect, <eob> and the famed logo <eol> that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925 <eob> is now in Cyrillic. <eob>
So, what makes me really excited <eol> about this moment <eob> is the way that ... <eob> You know, free press is essential <eol> to our democracy. <eob>
And we can see from the sublime <eol> to the ridiculous <eob> that artists can capture <eol> what is going on <eob> in a way that an artist <eob> armed with just India ink and watercolor <eob> can capture and enter <eol> into the cultural dialogue. <eob>
It puts those artists <eol> at the center of that culture, <eob> and that's exactly where I think they should be. <eob>
Because the main thing we need <eol> right now is a good cartoon. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Ten years ago, <eob> computer vision researchers <eol> thought that getting a computer <eob> to tell the difference <eol> between a cat and a dog <eob> would be almost impossible, <eob> even with the significant advance in the state <eol> of artificial intelligence. <eob>
Now we can do it at a level greater <eol> than 99 percent accuracy. <eob>
This is called image classification -- <eob> give it an image, <eol> put a label to that image -- <eob> and computers know thousands <eol> of other categories as well. <eob>
I'm a graduate student <eol> at the University of Washington, <eob> and I work on a project called Darknet, <eob> which is a neural network framework <eob> for training and testing computer <eol> vision models. <eob>
So let's just see what Darknet thinks <eob> of this image that we have. <eob>
When we run our classifier <eob> on this image, <eob> we see we don't just get <eol> a prediction of dog or cat, <eob> we actually get specific breed predictions. <eob>
That's the level of granularity <eol> we have now. <eob>
And it's correct. <eob>
My dog is in fact a malamute. <eob>
So we've made amazing strides <eol> in image classification, <eob> but what happens when we run <eol> our classifier <eob> on an image that looks like this? <eob>
Well... <eob> We see that the classifier comes back <eol> with a pretty similar prediction. <eob>
And it's correct, <eob> there is a malamute in the image, <eob> but just given this label, <eol> we don't actually know that much <eob> about what's going on in the image. <eob>
We need something more powerful. <eob>
I work on a problem called object detection, <eob> where we look at an image <eol> and try to find all of the objects, <eob> put bounding boxes around them <eob> and say what those objects are. <eob>
So here's what happens <eol> when we run a detector <eob> on this image. <eob>
Now, with this kind of result, <eob> we can do a lot more <eol> with our computer vision algorithms. <eob>
We see that it knows <eol> that there's a cat and a dog. <eob>
It knows their relative locations, <eob> their size. <eob>
It may even know some extra information. <eob>
There's a book sitting in the background. <eob>
And if you want to build a system <eol> on top of computer vision, <eob> say a self-driving vehicle <eol> or a robotic system, <eob> this is the kind of information <eol> that you want. <eob>
You want something so that you can interact <eol> with the physical world. <eob>
Now, when I started working <eol> on object detection, <eob> it took 20 seconds <eol> to process a single image. <eob>
And to get a feel for why speed <eol> is so important in this domain, <eob> here's an example <eol> of an object detector <eob> that takes two seconds <eol> to process an image. <eob>
So this is 10 times faster <eob> than the 20-seconds-per-image detector, <eob> and you can see that by the time <eol> it makes predictions, <eob> the entire state of the world has changed, <eob> and this wouldn't be very useful <eob> for an application. <eob>
If we speed this up by another factor of 10, <eob> this is a detector running at five frames per second. <eob>
This is a lot better, <eob> but for example, <eob> if there's any significant movement, <eob> I wouldn't want a system <eol> like this driving my car. <eob>
This is our detection system running <eol> in real time on my laptop. <eob>
So it smoothly tracks me <eol> as I move around the frame, <eob> and it's robust to a wide variety <eol> of changes in size, <eob> pose, <eob> forward, backward. <eob> This is great. <eob> This is what we really need <eob> if we're going to build systems <eol> on top of computer vision. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So in just a few years, <eob> we've gone from 20 seconds <eol> per image <eob> to 20 milliseconds <eol> per image, a thousand times faster. <eob>
How did we get there? <eob> Well, in the past, object detection systems <eob> would take an image like this <eob> and split it into a bunch of regions <eob> and then run a classifier on each of these regions, <eob> and high scores for that classifier <eob> would be considered detections <eol> in the image. <eob>
But this involved running a classifier <eol> thousands of times over an image, <eob> thousands of neural network <eol> evaluations to produce detection. <eob>
Instead, we trained a single network <eol> to do all of detection for us. <eob>
It produces all of the bounding boxes <eol> and class probabilities simultaneously. <eob>
With our system, instead of looking <eol> at an image thousands of times <eob> to produce detection, <eob> you only look once, <eob> and that's why we call it <eol> the YOLO method of object detection. <eob>
So with this speed, we're not <eol> just limited to images; <eob> we can process video in real time. <eob>
And now, instead of just seeing <eol> that cat and dog, <eob> we can see them move around <eol> and interact with each other. <eob>
This is a detector that we trained <eob> on 80 different classes <eob> in Microsoft's COCO dataset. <eob>
It has all sorts of things like spoon <eol> and fork, bowl, <eob> common objects like that. <eob>
It has a variety of more exotic things: <eob> animals, cars, zebras, giraffes. <eob>
And now we're going to do something fun. <eob>
We're just going to go out into the audience <eob> and see what kind of things <eol> we can detect. <eob>
Does anyone want a stuffed animal? <eob>
There are some teddy bears out there. <eob>
And we can turn down our threshold <eol> for detection a little bit, <eob> so we can find more of you guys <eol> out in the audience. <eob>
Let's see if we can get these stop signs. <eob> We find some backpacks. <eob>
Let's just zoom in a little bit. <eob>
And this is great. <eob> And all of the processing <eol> is happening in real time <eob> on the laptop. <eob>
And it's important to remember <eob> that this is a general purpose <eol> object detection system, <eob> so we can train this for any image domain. <eob>
The same code that we use <eob> to find stop signs or pedestrians, <eob> bicycles in a self-driving vehicle, <eob> can be used to find cancer cells <eob> in a tissue biopsy. <eob>
And there are researchers <eol> around the globe already using this technology <eob> for advances in things like medicine, robotics. <eob>
This morning, I read a paper <eob> where they were taking a census <eol> of animals in Nairobi National Park <eob> with YOLO as part of this detection system. <eob>
And that's because Darknet <eol> is open source <eob> and in the public domain, <eol> free for anyone to use. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But we wanted to make detection <eol> even more accessible and usable, <eob> so through a combination of model optimization, <eob> network binarization and approximation, <eob> we actually have object detection <eol> running on a phone. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I'm really excited because <eol> now we have a pretty powerful solution <eob> to this low-level computer vision problem, <eob> and anyone can take it <eol> and build something with it. <eob>
So now the rest is up to all of you <eob> and people around the world <eol> with access to this software, <eob> and I can't wait to see <eol> what people will build with this technology. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, imagine that you take <eol> a 19-hour, very long drive <eob> to Disney World, <eob> with two kids in the back seat. <eob>
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip, <eob> the immutable laws of nature dictate <eob> that you get the question: <eob> "Are we there yet?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you answer this question <eol> a hundred more times, easily, <eob> in the negative, <eob> but you finally arrive. <eob>
You have a wonderful, wonderful, <eol> wonderful trip. <eob>
You drive 19 long hours back home. <eob>
And when you get there, <eob> the police are waiting on you. <eob>
They accuse you of committing a crime <eob> that occurred <eol> while you were away in Florida. <eob>
You tell anybody and everybody <eol> who will listen, <eob> "I didn't do it! <eob>
I couldn't have done it! <eob>
I was hanging out with Mickey <eol> and Minnie and my kids!" <eob> But no one believes you. <eob>
Ultimately, you're arrested, <eob> you're tried, <eob> you're convicted <eob> and you are sentenced. <eob>
And you spend 25 years in jail, <eob> until someone comes along and proves -- <eob> has the evidence to prove -- <eob> that you actually were in Florida <eob> when this crime was committed. <eob> So. <eob>
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor, <eob> and the last several years, <eol> I have worked on <eob> winning the release of innocent people <eob> who've been wrongfully convicted -- <eob> people like Jonathan Fleming, <eob> who spent 24 years, eight months in jail <eob> for a murder that was committed <eol> in Brooklyn, New York, <eob> while he was in Disney World <eob> with his kids. <eob>
How do we know this? <eob> Because when he was arrested, <eob> among his property in his back pocket <eob> was a receipt -- <eob> time-stamped receipt <eob> that showed that he was in Disney World. <eob> That receipt was put in the police file, <eob> a copy of it was put in the prosecutor's file, <eob> and they never gave it <eol> to his public defender. <eob>
In fact, nobody even knew it was there. <eob>
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years. <eob>
My team looked through the file, <eol> and we found it, <eob> did the rest of the investigation, <eob> and figured out someone else <eol> committed the crime. <eob>
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World, <eob> and he is now released. <eob>
Let me give you <eol> a little bit of context. <eob> So about three years ago, <eol> I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney. <eob>
He asked whether I'd be interested <eol> in designing a program <eob> called a "conviction review unit." <eob> So I said yes. <eob>
A conviction review unit is essentially <eol> a unit in a prosecutor's office <eob> where prosecutors look <eol> at their past cases <eob> to determine whether <eol> or not they made mistakes. <eob>
Over the course of the first year, <eob> we found about 13 wrongful convictions, <eob> people having been in jail for decades, <eob> and we released all of them. <eob>
It was the most in New York history. <eob>
The program is still going on, <eob> and they're up to 21 releases now -- <eob> 21 people who spent significant <eol> time behind bars. <eob>
So let me tell you about a couple <eol> other of the men and women <eob> that I interacted with <eol> in the course of this program. <eob> One name is Roger Logan. <eob>
Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years <eob> and wrote me a letter. <eob> It was a simple letter; it basically said, <eob> "Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent. <eob>
I've been framed. <eob>
Can you look at my case?" <eob> At first blush, the case <eol> seemed like it was open and shut, <eob> but my research had shown <eob> that single-witness identification cases <eob> are prone to error. <eob>
It doesn't mean he was innocent, <eob> it just means we ought to look <eol> a little bit closer at those cases. <eob>
So we did. <eob> And the facts were relatively simple. <eob>
The eyewitness said she heard a shot, <eob> and she ran to the next building <eol> and turned around and looked, <eob> and there was Mr. Logan. <eob>
And he was tried and convicted <eol> and in jail for 17-some-odd years. <eob>
But it was a single-witness case, <eol> so we took a look at it. <eob>
I sent some people to the scene, <eol> and there was an inconsistency. <eob>
And to put it politely: <eob> Usain Bolt couldn't have run <eol> from where she said she was <eob> to the other spot. <eob> Right? <eob> So we knew that wasn't true. <eob>
So it still didn't mean <eol> that he didn't do it, <eob> but we knew something was maybe <eol> fishy about this witness. <eob>
So we looked through the file, <eob> a piece of paper in the file <eol> had a number on it. <eob>
The number indicated <eol> that this witness had a record. <eob>
We went back through 20 years <eol> of non-digitized papers <eob> to figure out what this record was about, <eob> and it turned out — it turned out — <eob> the eyewitness was in jail <eob> when she said she saw <eol> what she saw. <eob>
The man spent 17 years behind bars. <eob>
The last one is a case about two boys, <eob> Willie Stuckey, David McCallum. <eob>
They were arrested at 15, <eob> and their conviction was vacated <eol> 29 years later. <eob>
are prone to error. <eob> Now this was a case, <eob> once again -- first blush, it looked open and shut. <eob> They had confessed. <eob> But my research showed <eol> that juvenile confessions <eob> without a parent present <eob>
The DNA cases proved this several times. <eob>
So we took a close look. <eob> We looked at the confession, <eob> and it turned out, <eob> there was something in the confession <eob> that those boys could not have known. <eob>
The only people who knew <eol> it were police and prosecutors. <eob>
We knew what really happened; <eob> someone told them to say this. <eob>
We don't exactly know who, <eob> which person did, <eob> but any rate, the confession was coerced, <eob> we determined. <eob>
We then went back and did forensics <eob> and did a fulsome investigation <eob> and found that two other, <eob> much older, different heights, different hairstyle, <eob> two other people committed the crime, <eob> not these two boys. <eob>
I actually went to court that day, <eob> for what's called a "vacatur hearing," <eob> where the conviction is thrown out. <eob>
I went to court; I wanted to see <eob> Mr. McCallum walk out of there. <eob>
So I went to court, <eob> and the judge said something <eol> that judges say all the time, <eob> but this took on a really special meaning. <eob>
He looked up after the arguments and said, <eob> "Mr. McCallum," <eob> he said five beautiful words: <eob> "You are free to go." <eob> Can you imagine? <eob>
"You are free to go." <eob> After just about 30 years: <eob> And he walked out of that courtroom. <eob>
Unfortunately, his codefendant, <eol> Mr. Stuckey, <eob> didn't get the benefit of that. <eob>
You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison <eob> at 34 years old, <eob> and his mother sat at counsel table <eol> in his place. <eob>
I'll never forget this <eol> the rest of my life. <eob>
She just rocked at the table, saying, <eob> "I knew my baby didn't do this. <eob>
"I knew my baby didn't do this. <eob> And her baby didn't do this. <eob>
Two other guys did it. <eob>
If there's anything that we've learned, <eol> anything that I've learned, <eob> with this conviction integrity work, <eob> it's that justice doesn't happen. <eob>
People make justice happen. <eob>
Justice is not a thing <eol> that just descends from above <eob> and makes everything right. <eob>
If it did, Mr. Stuckey <eol> wouldn't have died in prison. <eob>
Justice is something <eob> that people of goodwill make happen. <eob>
Justice is a decision. <eob>
Justice is a decision. <eob>
We make justice happen. <eob>
You know, the scary thing is, <eob> in each of these three cases <eol> I described, <eob> it would have only taken just an extra minute -- <eob> an extra minute -- <eob> for someone to look <eol> through the file <eob> and find this receipt. <eob>
Just one -- to look through the file, <eol> find the receipt, <eob> give it to the public defender. <eob>
It would have taken someone just a minute <eob> to look at the video confession and say, <eol> "That cannot be." <eob> Just a minute. <eob>
And perhaps Mr. Stuckey <eol> would be alive today. <eob>
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems. <eob>
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays would always recite, <eob> and he called it "God's Minute." <eob> And it goes something like this: <eob> "I have only just a minute, <eob> only 60 seconds in it, <eob> forced upon me, can't refuse it, <eob> didn't seek it, didn't choose it. <eob>
But it's up to me to use it. <eob>
I must suffer if I lose it, give account <eol> if I abuse it. <eob>
Just a tiny little minute, <eob> but eternity is in it." <eob>
If I were to charge <eob> each and every one of us, <eob> I would want to say something like, <eob> "Every day, <eob> every day, <eob> take just one extra minute <eob> and do some justice. <eob>
You don't have to — <eob> I mean, some people <eol> spend their careers and their lives, <eob> like public defenders, <eob> doing justice <eob> every day. <eob>
But in your professional lives, whatever you do, <eob> take time out <eob> to just <eob> do some justice. <eob> Make a colleague feel better. <eob>
If you hear something that's sexist, <eob> don't laugh, speak up. <eob>
If someone is down, lift them up, <eob> one extra minute each day, <eob> and it'll be a great, great place. <eob>
I want to show you something. <eob>
Now, above me is a picture <eob> of David McCallum. <eob>
This is the day <eol> he was released from prison. <eob>
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece <eob> he had never been able to touch before. <eob>
And I asked him then, <eob> I said, "What's the first thing <eol> you want to do?" <eob> And he said, "I just want to walk on the sidewalk <eob> without anybody telling me where to go." <eob> Wasn't bitter, <eob> just wanted to walk on the sidewalk. <eob>
I spoke to Mr. McCallum <eol> about two weeks ago. <eob>
I went to New York. <eob>
It was on the two-year anniversary <eob> of his release. <eob>
And we talked, <eob> we laughed, we hugged, we cried. <eob>
And he's doing quite well. <eob>
And one of the things <eol> he said when we met with him <eob> is that he now has dedicated his life <eob> and his career <eob> to ensuring that nobody else <eol> is locked up unjustly. <eob>
Justice, my friends, <eob> is a decision. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want you to touch your face. <eob> Go on. <eob> What do you feel? <eob> Soft? Squishy? <eob> It's you, right? You're feeling you? <eob> Well, it's not quite true. <eob>
You're actually feeling <eol> thousands of microscopic creatures <eob> that live on our face and fingers. <eob>
You're feeling some of the fungi <eob> that drifted down from the air ducts today. <eob>
They set off our allergies <eob> and smell of mildew. <eob>
You're feeling some <eol> of the 100 billion bacterial cells <eob> that live on our skin. <eob>
They've been munching away <eol> at your skin oils and replicating, <eob> producing the smells of body odor. <eob>
You're likely even touching <eol> the fecal bacteria <eob> that sprayed onto you the last time <eol> you flushed a toilet, <eob> or those bacteria that live in our water pipes <eob> and sprayed onto you <eol> with your last shower. <eob> Sorry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You're probably even giving <eol> a microscopic high five <eob> to the two species of mites <eol> that live on our faces, <eob> on all of our faces. <eob>
They've spent the night squirming <eol> across your face <eob> and having sex on the bridge <eol> of your nose. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Many of them are now leaking <eol> their gut contents onto your pores. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now look at your finger. <eob> How's it feel? Gross? <eob> In desperate need of soap or bleach? <eob>
That's how you feel now, <eob> but it's not going to be <eol> how you feel in the future. <eob>
For the last 100 years, <eob> we've had an adversarial relationship <eob> with the microscopic life nearest us. <eob>
If I told you there was a bug in your house <eob> or bacteria in your sink, <eob> there was a human-devised solution for that, <eob> a product to eradicate, exterminate, <eob> disinfect. <eob>
We strive to remove most of the microscopic life <eol> in our world now. <eob>
But in doing so, we're ignoring <eol> the best source of new technology <eob> on this planet. <eob>
The last 100 years have featured <eol> human solutions to microbial problems, <eob> but the next 100 years will feature <eol> microbial solutions to human problems. <eob>
I'm a scientist, and I work with researchers <eob> at North Carolina State University <eol> and the University of Colorado <eob> to uncover the microscopic life <eol> that is nearest us, <eob> and that's often in our most intimate <eol> and boring environments, <eob> be it under our couches, in our backyards, <eob> or in our belly buttons. <eob>
I do this work because it turns <eol> out that we know very little <eob> about the microscopic life <eol> that's nearest us. <eob>
As of a few years ago, <eol> no scientist could tell you <eob> what bugs or microorganisms <eol> live in your home -- <eob> your home, the place <eol> you know better than anywhere else. <eob>
And so I and teams of others <eob> are armed with Q-tips and tweezers <eob> and advanced DNA techniques <eob> to uncover the microscopic life nearest us. <eob>
In doing so, we found <eol> over 600 species of bugs <eob> that live in USA homes, <eob> everything from spiders <eol> and cockroaches <eob> to tiny mites that cling to feathers. <eob>
And we found over 100,000 species <eol> of bacteria and fungi <eob> that live in our dust bunnies, <eob> thousands more that live on our clothes <eol> or in our showers. <eob>
We've gone further still, <eob> and we looked at the microorganisms <eob> that live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home. <eob>
In each bug, for example, a wasp, <eob> we see a microscopic jungle <eol> unfold in a petri plate, <eob> a world of hundreds of vibrant species. <eob>
Behold the biological cosmos! <eob>
So many of the species <eol> you're looking at right now <eob> don't yet have names. <eob>
Most of the life around us <eol> remains unknown. <eob>
I remember the first time <eol> I discovered and got to name a new species. <eob>
It was a fungus that lives in the nest <eol> of a paper wasp. <eob>
It's white and fluffy, <eob> and I named it "mucor nidicola," <eob> meaning in Latin that it lives <eol> in the nest of another. <eob>
This is a picture of it <eol> growing on a dinosaur, <eob> because everyone thinks <eol> dinosaurs are cool. <eob>
At the time, I was in graduate school, <eob> and I was so excited <eol> that I had found this new life form. <eob>
I called up my dad, and I go, <eob> "Dad! <eob>
I just discovered <eol> a new microorganism species. <eob> "And he laughed and he goes," <eob> That's great. <eob>
I hope you also discovered <eol> a cure for it. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Cure it." <eob>
Now, my dad is my biggest fan, <eob> so in that crushing moment <eol> where he wanted to kill my new little life form, <eob> I realized that actually <eol> I had failed him, <eob> both as a daughter and a scientist. <eob>
In my years toiling away in labs <eol> and in people's backyards, <eob> investigating and cataloging <eol> the microscopic life around us, <eob> I'd never made clear my true mission to him. <eob>
My goal is not to find technology <eob> to kill the new microscopic life around us. <eob> My goal is to find new technology from this life, <eol> that will help save us. <eob>
The diversity of life in our homes <eol> is more than a list of 100,000 new species. <eob>
It is 100,000 new sources <eol> of solutions to human problems. <eob>
I know it's hard to believe <eol> that anything that's so small <eob> or only has one cell <eob> can do anything powerful, <eob> but they can. <eob>
These creatures are microscopic alchemists, <eob> with the ability to transform <eol> their environment <eob> with an arsenal of chemical tools. <eob>
This means that they can live <eol> anywhere <eob> on this planet, <eob> and they can eat whatever food is around them. <eob>
This means they can eat everything <eol> from toxic waste to plastic, <eob> and they can produce waste products <eol> like oil and battery power <eob> and even tiny nuggets of real gold. <eob>
They can transform the inedible <eol> into nutritive. <eob>
They can make sugar into alcohol. <eob>
They give chocolate its flavor, <eob> and soil the power to grow. <eob>
I'm here to tell you <eob> that the next 100 years will feature <eol> these microscopic creatures <eob> solving more of our problems. <eob>
And we have a lot of problems <eol> to choose from. <eob>
We've got the mundane: bad-smelling clothes or bland food. <eob>
And we've got the monumental: <eob> disease, pollution, war. <eob>
And so this is my mission: <eob> to not just catalog the microscopic life around us, <eob> but to find out what it's uniquely well-suited <eol> to help us with. <eob>
Here's an example. <eob> We started with a pest, <eob> a wasp that lives on many of our homes. <eob>
Inside that wasp, we plucked <eol> out a little-known microorganism species <eob> with a unique ability: <eob> it could make beer. <eob>
This is a trait that only a few species <eob> on this planet <eob> have. <eob>
In fact, all commercially <eol> produced beer you've ever had <eob> likely came from one of only <eol> three microorganism species. <eob>
Yet our species, it could make a beer <eol> that tasted like honey, <eob> and it could also make a delightfully tart beer. <eob>
In fact, this microorganism species <eol> that lives in the belly of a wasp, <eob> it could make a valuable sour beer <eob> better than any other species <eob> on this planet. <eob>
There are now four species <eol> that produce commercial beer. <eob>
Where you used to see a pest, <eob> now think of tasting <eol> your future favorite beer. <eob>
As a second example, <eob> I worked with researchers <eol> to dig in the dirt in people's backyards. <eob>
There, we uncovered a microorganism <eol> that could make novel antibiotics, <eob> antibiotics that can kill <eol> the world's worst superbugs. <eob>
This was an awesome thing to find, <eob> but here's the secret: <eob> for the last 60 years, <eob> most of the antibiotics on the market <eob> have come from similar soil bacteria. <eob>
Every day, you and I <eol> and everyone in this room <eob> and <eob> on this planet, <eob> are saved by similar soil bacteria <eol> that produce most of our antibiotics. <eob>
Where you used to see dirt, <eob> now think of medication. <eob>
Perhaps my favorite example comes <eol> from colleagues <eob> who are studying a pond scum microorganism, <eob> which is tragically named <eol> after the cow dung it was first found in. <eob>
It's pretty unremarkable <eol> and would be unworthy of discussion, <eob> except that the researchers found <eol> that if you feed it to mice, <eob> it vaccinates against PTSD. <eob>
It vaccinates against fear. <eob>
Where you used to see pond scum, <eol> now think of hope. <eob>
There are so many more microbial examples <eob> that I don't have time <eol> to talk about today. <eob>
I gave you examples of solutions <eol> that came from just three species, <eob> but imagine what those other 100,000 species <eol> in your dust bunnies <eob> might be able to do. <eob>
In the future, they might be able <eol> to make you sexier <eob> or smarter <eob> or perhaps live longer. <eob>
So I want you to look <eol> at your finger again. <eob>
Think about all those microscopic creatures <eob> that are unknown. <eob>
Think about in the future what they <eob> might be able to do <eob> or make <eob> or whose life they might be able to save. <eob>
How does your finger feel right now? <eob>
A little bit powerful? <eob>
That's because you're feeling the future. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My son and the iPhone <eol> were born three weeks apart <eob> in June 2007. <eob>
So while those early adopters were lined up outside, <eob> waiting to get their hands <eol> on this amazing new gadget, <eob> I was stuck at home with my hands <eol> full of something else <eob> that was sending out constant <eol> notifications -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a miserable, colicky baby <eob> who would only sleep in a moving stroller <eol> with complete silence. <eob>
I literally was walking <eol> 10 to 15 miles a day, <eob> and the baby weight came off. <eob>
That part was great. <eob>
But man, was I bored. <eob>
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist <eob> who rushed off when the Concorde crashed. <eob>
I was one of the first people into Belgrade <eob> when there was a revolution in Serbia. <eob>
Now, I was exhausted. <eob>
This walking went on for weeks. <eob>
It was only until about three months <eol> in that something shifted, though. <eob>
As I pounded the pavement, <eob> my mind started to wander, too. <eob>
I began imagining what I would do <eol> when I finally did sleep again. <eob>
So the colic did fade, <eob> and I finally got an iPhone <eob> and I put all those hours <eol> of wandering into action. <eob>
I created my dream job hosting <eol> a public radio show. <eob>
So there was no more rushing <eol> off to war zones, <eob> but thanks to my new smartphone, <eob> I could be a mother and a journalist. <eob>
I could be on the playground <eol> and on Twitter at the same time. <eob>
Yeah, well, when I thought that, <eob> when the technology came in and took over, <eob> that is when I hit a wall. <eob>
So, I want you to picture this: <eob> you host a podcast, and you have to prove <eob> that the investment of precious <eol> public radio dollars in you <eob> is worth it. <eob>
My goal was to increase <eol> my audience size tenfold. <eob>
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm, <eob> as you do, <eob> and I came up barren. <eob>
This was different <eol> than writer's block, right? <eob>
It wasn't like there was something <eol> there waiting to be unearthed. <eob>
There was just nothing. <eob>
And so I started to think back: <eob> When was the last time <eol> I actually had a good idea? <eob>
Yeah, it was when I was pushing <eol> that damn stroller. <eob>
Now all the cracks in my day <eol> were filled with phone time. <eob>
I checked the headlines <eol> while I waited for my latte. <eob>
I updated my calendar while <eol> I was sitting on the couch. <eob>
Texting turned every spare moment <eob> into a chance to show <eol> to my coworkers and my dear husband <eob> what a responsive person I was, <eob> or at least it was a chance to find <eol> another perfect couch <eob> for my page on Pinterest. <eob>
I realized that I was never bored. <eob>
And anyway, don't only boring <eol> people get bored? <eob>
But then I started to wonder: <eob> What actually happens to us <eol> when we get bored? <eob>
Or, more importantly: What happens <eol> to us if we never get bored? <eob>
And what could happen <eol> if we got rid of this human emotion entirely? <eob>
I started talking to neuroscientists <eol> and cognitive psychologists, <eob> and what they told me was fascinating. <eob>
It turns out that when you get bored, <eob> you ignite a network <eol> in your brain called the "default mode." <eob> So our body, it goes on autopilot <eol> while we're folding the laundry <eob> or we're walking to work, <eob> but actually that is when our brain gets really busy. <eob>
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann. <eob>
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann: Once you start daydreaming <eob> and allow your mind to really wander, <eob> you start thinking a little bit beyond the conscious, <eob> a little bit into the subconscious, <eob> which allows sort of different connections to take place. <eob>
It's really awesome, actually. <eob>
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right? <eob>
So this is my brain in an fMRI, <eob> and I learned that in the default mode <eol> is when we connect disparate ideas, <eob> we solve some of our most <eol> nagging problems, <eob> and we do something called "autobiographical planning." <eob> This is when we look back at our lives, <eob> we take note of the big moments, <eol> we create a personal narrative, <eob> and then we set goals <eob> and we figure out what steps we need <eol> to take to reach them. <eob>
But now we chill out on the couch also <eol> while updating a Google Doc <eob> or replying to email. <eob>
We call it "getting shit done," <eob> but here's what neuroscientist Dr. <eol> Daniel Levitin says <eob> we're actually doing. <eob>
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin: Every time you shift your attention <eob> from one thing to another, <eob> the brain has to engage <eol> a neurochemical switch <eob> that uses up nutrients <eol> in the brain to accomplish that. <eob>
So if you're attempting to multitask, <eob> you know, doing four or five things at once, <eob> you're not actually doing four <eol> or five things at once, <eob> because the brain doesn't work that way. <eob>
Instead, you're rapidly shifting <eol> from one thing to the next, <eob> depleting neural resources as you go. <eob>
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, <eol> switch, you're using glucose, glucose, glucose. <eob>
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, <eol> and we have a limited supply of that stuff. <eob>
MZ: A decade ago, <eol> we shifted our attention at work <eob> every three minutes. <eob>
Now we do it every 45 seconds, <eob> and we do it all day long. <eob>
The average person checks email <eol> 74 times a day, <eob> and switches tasks on their computer <eob> 566 times a day. <eob>
I discovered all this talking <eol> to professor of informatics, <eob> Dr. Gloria Mark. <eob>
(Audio) <eob> Dr. Gloria Mark: <eob> So we find that when people are stressed, <eob> they tend to shift their attention <eol> more rapidly. <eob>
We also found, strangely enough, <eob> that the shorter the amount <eol> of sleep that a person gets, <eob> the more likely they are to check Facebook. <eob>
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle. <eob>
MZ: But could this cycle be broken? <eob>
What would happen <eol> if we broke this vicious cycle? <eob>
Maybe my listeners could help me find out. <eob>
What if we reclaimed <eol> those cracks in our day? <eob>
Could it help us jump-start <eol> our creativity? <eob>
We called the project "Bored and Brilliant." <eob> And I expected, you know, <eol> a couple hundred people to play along, <eob> but thousands of people <eol> started signing up. <eob>
And they told me the reason <eol> they were doing it <eob> was because they were worried <eol> that their relationship with their phone <eob> had grown kind of ... "codependent," <eol> shall we say. <eob>
(Audio) Man: The relationship <eol> between a baby and its teddy bear <eob> or a baby and its binky <eob> or a baby that wants its mother's cradle <eob> when it's done with being held by a stranger -- <eob>
(Laughs) <eob>
that's the relationship <eol> between me and my phone. <eob>
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone <eol> like a power tool: <eob> extremely useful, but dangerous <eol> if I'm not handling it properly. <eob>
(Audio) Woman 2: If I don't pay close attention, <eob> I'll suddenly realize that I've lost an hour of time <eob> doing something totally mindless. <eob>
MZ: OK, but to really <eol> measure any improvement, <eob> we needed data, right? <eob>
Because that's what we do these days. <eob>
So we partnered with some apps <eol> that would measure how much time <eob> we were spending every day on our phone. <eob>
If you're thinking it's ironic <eob> that I asked people <eol> to download another app <eob> so that they would spend less time <eol> on their phones: <eob> yeah, but you gotta meet people <eol> where they are. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So before challenge week, <eob> we were averaging two hours <eol> a day on our phones <eob> and 60 pickups, <eob> you know, like, a quick check, <eol> did I get a new email? <eob>
Here's what Tina, a student <eol> at Bard College, <eob> discovered about herself. <eob>
(Audio) Tina: So far, <eol> I've been spending <eob> between 150 and 200 minutes <eol> on my phone per day, <eob> and I've been picking up my phone 70 <eol> to 100 times per day. <eob>
And it's really concerning, <eob> because that's so much time <eol> that I could have spent <eob> doing something more productive, <eol> more creative, more towards myself, <eob> because when I'm on my phone, <eol> I'm not doing anything important. <eob>
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting <eol> to observe their own behavior. <eob>
They were getting ready <eol> for challenge week. <eob>
And that Monday, <eob> they started to wake up <eol> to instructions in their inbox, <eob> an experiment to try. <eob>
Day one: <eob> "Put it in your pocket." <eob> Take that phone out of your hand. <eob>
See if you can eliminate the reflex <eol> to check it all day long, <eob> just for a day. <eob>
And if this sounds easy, <eob> you haven't tried it. <eob>
Here's listener Amanda Itzko. <eob>
(Audio) Amanda Itzko: <eol> I am absolutely itching. <eob>
I feel a little bit crazy, <eob> because I have noticed <eol> that I pick up my phone <eob> when I'm just walking <eol> from one room to another, <eob> getting on the elevator, <eob> and even -- and this is the part <eol> that I am really embarrassed <eob> to actually say out loud -- <eob> in the car. <eob>
MZ: Yikes. <eob> Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned, <eob> this itching feeling <eol> is not actually her fault. <eob>
That is exactly the behavior that the technology <eol> is built to trigger. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I mean, right? <eob> Here's former Google designer, Tristan Harris. <eob>
(Audio) Tristan Harris: <eol> If I'm Facebook or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat, <eob> I have literally a thousand engineers <eob> whose job is to get more attention from you. <eob>
I'm very good at this, <eob> and I don't want you to ever stop. <eob>
And you know, the CEO of Netflix recently said, <eob> "Our biggest competitors <eol> are Facebook, YouTube and sleep." <eob> I mean, so there's a million places <eol> to spend your attention, <eob> but there's a war going on to get it. <eob>
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling: <eob> that amazing episode <eol> of "Transparent" ends, <eob> and then the next one starts playing <eob> so you're like, eh, OK fine, <eol> I'll just stay up and watch it. <eob> Or the LinkedIn progress bar says you are this close <eob> to having the perfect profile, <eob> so you add a little more personal information. <eob>
As one UX designer told me, <eob> the only people who refer <eol> to their customers as "users" <eob> are drug dealers and technologists. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And users, as we know, <eol> are worth a lot of money. <eob>
Here's former Facebook product <eol> manager and author, <eob> Antonio García Martínez. <eob>
(Audio) <eob> Antonio García Martínez: <eob> The saying is, if any product is free <eob> then you're the product; <eol> your attention is the product. <eob>
But what is your attention worth? <eob>
That's why literally every time <eol> you load a page, <eob> not just on Facebook or any app, <eob> there's an auction being held <eol> instantly, billions of times a day, <eob> for exactly how much that one ad impression cost. <eob>
MZ: By the way, the average person <eol> will spend two years of their life <eob> on Facebook. <eob> So, back to challenge week. <eob> Immediately, we saw <eol> some creativity kick in. <eob>
Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert. <eob>
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess. <eob>
So I suddenly looked at the stairway that went <eol> up to the top of the station, <eob> and I thought, you know, <eob> I had just come down that stairway, <eol> but I could go back up <eob> and then come back down <eol> and get a little cardio. <eob>
So I did, <eob> and then I had a little more time, so <eol> I did it again and I did it again, <eob> and I did it 10 times. <eob>
And I had a complete cardio workout. <eob>
I got on that R train feeling <eol> kind of exhausted, <eob> but, like, wow, <eol> that had never occurred to me. <eob> How is that possible? <eob>
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means <eol> different things to different people. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But everyone found day <eol> three's challenge the hardest. <eob>
It was called "Delete that app." <eob> Take that app -- you know the one; <eob> that one that always gets you, <eol> it sucks you in -- <eob> take it off your phone, <eob> even if just for the day. <eob>
I deleted the game Two Dots <eol> and nearly cried. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, Two Dots players know <eol> what I'm talking about. <eob>
But my misery had good company. <eob>
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam in Los Angeles, <eob> and I deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine <eob> from my phone <eob> in one fell swoop. <eob>
And it was kind of an embarrassingly emotional experience <eol> at first. <eob>
It felt weirdly lonely <eol> to look at that lock screen <eob> with no new notifications on it. <eob>
But I really liked deciding for myself <eob> when to think about <eol> or access my social networks, <eob> not giving my phone the power <eol> to decide that for me. <eob> So thank you. <eob>
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter <eol> app was very sad, <eob> and I feel I maybe, over the last year <eol> when I've been on Twitter, <eob> have developed an addiction to it, <eob> and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge <eol> has really made me realize it. <eob>
After a brief period of really <eol> horrible withdrawal feeling, <eob> like lack-of-caffeine headache, <eob> I now feel lovely. <eob>
I had a lovely dinner <eol> with my family, <eob> and I hope to continue this structured use <eol> of these powerful tools. <eob>
(Audio) Woman 4: <eol> I don't have that guilty gut feeling <eob> I have when I know <eol> I'm wasting time on my phone. <eob>
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself <eol> challenges and reminders like this <eob> every morning. <eob>
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress. <eob>
I could not wait <eol> to see what the numbers said <eob> at the end of that week. <eob>
But when the data came in, <eob> it turned out that we had cut down, <eob> on average, <eob> just six minutes -- <eob> from 120 minutes a day on our phones <eob> to 114. <eob> Yeah. Whoop-de-do. <eob>
So I went back to the scientists <eol> feeling kind of low, <eob> and they just laughed at me, <eob> and they said, you know, <eol> changing people's behavior <eob> in such a short time period <eob> was ridiculously ambitious, <eob> and actually what you've achieved is far beyond what we thought possible. <eob>
Because more important than the numbers, <eol> were the people's stories. <eob> They felt empowered. <eob> Their phones had been transformed <eob> from taskmasters <eob> back into tools. <eob>
And actually, I found what the young people <eol> said most intriguing. <eob>
Some of them told me <eob> that they didn't recognize <eol> some of the emotions <eob> that they felt during challenge week, <eob> because, if you think about it, <eob> if you have never known life <eol> without connectivity, <eob> you may never have experienced <eol> boredom. <eob>
And there could be consequences. <eob>
Researchers at USC have found -- <eol> they're studying teenagers <eob> who are on social media <eol> while they're talking to their friends <eob> or they're doing homework, <eob> and two years down the road, <eol> they are less creative and imaginative <eob> about their own personal futures <eob> and about solving societal problems, <eol> like violence in their neighborhoods. <eob>
And we really need this next generation <eob> to be able to focus on some big problems: <eob> climate change, economic disparity, <eob> massive cultural differences. <eob>
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey <eob> identified creativity as the number <eol> one leadership competency. <eob>
OK, here's the good news, though: <eob> In the end, 20,000 people <eol> did "Bored and Brilliant" that week. <eob>
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes. <eob>
Seventy percent got more time to think. <eob>
People told me that they slept better. <eob> They felt happier. <eob> My favorite note was from a guy <eol> who said he felt like he was waking up <eob> from a mental hibernation. <eob>
Some personal data and some neuroscience <eob> gave us permission to be offline <eol> a little bit more, <eob> and a little bit of boredom <eol> gave us some clarity <eob> and helped some of us set some goals. <eob>
I mean, maybe constant connectivity <eob> won't be cool in a couple of years. <eob>
But meanwhile, teaching people, <eol> especially kids, <eob> how to use technology to improve <eol> their lives <eob> and to self-regulate <eob> needs to be part of digital literacy. <eob>
So the next time <eol> you go to check your phone, <eob> remember that if you don't decide <eol> how you're going to use the technology, <eob> the platforms <eol> will decide for you. <eob>
And ask yourself: <eob> What am I really looking for? <eob>
Because if it's to check email, <eol> that's fine -- do it and be done. <eob>
But if it's to distract yourself <eol> from doing the hard work <eob> that comes with deeper thinking, <eob> take a break, <eob> stare out the window <eob> and know that by doing nothing <eob> you are actually being your most productive <eol> and creative self. <eob>
It might feel weird and uncomfortable at first, <eob> but boredom truly can lead to brilliance. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How many companies <eol> have you interacted with today? <eob>
Well, you got up in the morning, <eob> took a shower, <eob> washed your hair, <eob> used a hair dryer, <eob> ate breakfast -- <eob> ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever -- <eob> had coffee -- <eob> tea. <eob>
You took public transport to come here, <eob> or maybe used your private car. <eob>
You interacted with the company <eol> that you work for or that you own. <eob>
You interacted with your clients, <eob> your customers, <eob> and so on and so forth. <eob>
I'm pretty sure there are at least <eol> seven companies <eob> you've interacted with today. <eob>
Let me tell you a stunning statistic. <eob>
One out of seven large, public corporations <eob> commit fraud every year. <eob>
This is a US academic study <eol> that looks at US companies -- <eob> I have no reason to believe <eol> that it's different in Europe. <eob>
This is a study that looks <eol> at both detected and undetected fraud <eob> using statistical methods. <eob>
This is not petty fraud. <eob>
These frauds cost the shareholders <eol> of these companies, <eob> and therefore society, <eob> on the order of 380 billion dollars per year. <eob>
We can all think of some examples, right? <eob>
The car industry's secrets <eol> aren't quite so secret anymore. <eob>
Fraud has become a feature, <eob> not a bug, <eob> of the financial services industry. <eob>
That's not me who's claiming that, <eob> that's the president <eol> of the American Finance Association <eob> who stated that in his presidential address. <eob>
That's a huge problem <eol> if you think about, especially, <eob> an economy like Switzerland, <eob> which relies so much on the trust <eol> put into its financial industry. <eob>
On the other hand, <eob> there are six out of seven companies <eol> who actually remain honest <eob> despite all temptations <eol> to start engaging in fraud. <eob>
There are whistle-blowers <eol> like Michael Woodford, <eob> who blew the whistle on Olympus. <eob>
These whistle-blowers <eol> risk their careers, <eob> their friendships, <eob> to bring out the truth <eol> about their companies. <eob>
There are journalists <eol> like Anna Politkovskaya <eob> who risk even their lives <eol> to report human rights violations. <eob>
She got killed -- <eob> every year, <eob> around 100 journalists get killed <eob> because of their conviction to bring <eol> out the truth. <eob>
So in my talk today, <eob> I want to share with you <eol> some insights I've obtained and learned <eob> in the last 10 years of conducting <eol> research in this. <eob>
I'm a researcher, a scientist working <eol> with economists, <eob> financial economists, <eob> ethicists, neuroscientists, <eob> lawyers and others <eob> trying to understand <eol> what makes humans tick, <eob> and how can we address <eol> this issue of fraud in corporations <eob> and therefore contribute <eol> to the improvement of the world. <eob>
I want to start by sharing <eol> with you two very distinct visions <eob> of how people behave. <eob>
First, meet Adam Smith, <eob> founding father of modern economics. <eob>
His basic idea was that if everybody behaves <eol> in their own self-interests, <eob> that's good for everybody in the end. <eob>
Self-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept <eob> just for your immediate utility. <eob>
It has a long-run implication. <eob> Let's think about that. <eob>
Think about this dog here. <eob>
That might be us. <eob>
There's this temptation -- <eob> I apologize to all vegetarians, but -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Dogs do like the bratwurst. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, the straight-up, <eol> self-interested move here <eob> is to go for that. <eob>
So my friend Adam here might jump up, <eob> get the sausage and thereby ruin <eol> all this beautiful tableware. <eob>
But that's not what Adam Smith meant. <eob>
He didn't mean disregard <eol> all consequences -- <eob> to the contrary. <eob>
He would have thought, <eob> well, there may be negative consequences, <eob> for example, <eob> the owner might be angry with the dog <eob> and the dog, anticipating <eol> that, might not behave in this way. <eob>
That might be us. <eob> weighing the benefits <eol> and costs of our actions. <eob>
How does that play out? <eob>
Well, many of you, I'm sure, <eob> have in your companies, <eob> especially if it's a large company, <eob> a code of conduct. <eob>
And then if you behave <eol> according to that code of conduct, <eob> that improves your chances <eol> of getting a bonus payment. <eob>
And on the other hand, <eol> if you disregard it, <eob> then there are higher chances <eol> of not getting your bonus <eob> or its being diminished. <eob>
In other words, <eob> this is a very economic motivation <eob> of trying to get people <eol> to be more honest, <eob> or more aligned with the corporation's principles. <eob>
Similarly, reputation is a very powerful <eol> economic force, right? <eob>
We try to build a reputation, <eob> maybe for being honest, <eob> because then people trust us <eol> more in the future. <eob> Right? <eob> Adam Smith talked about the baker <eob> who's not producing good bread <eol> out of his benevolence <eob> for those people who consume the bread, <eob> but because he wants to sell more future bread. <eob>
In my research, we find, <eob> for example, <eob> at the University of Zurich, <eob> that Swiss banks who get <eol> caught up in media, <eob> and in the context, for example, <eob> of tax evasion, of tax fraud, <eob> have bad media coverage. <eob>
They lose net new money in the future <eob> and therefore make lower profits. <eob>
That's a very powerful reputational force. <eob> Benefits and costs. <eob>
Here's another viewpoint of the world. <eob>
Meet Immanuel Kant, <eob> 18th-century German philosopher superstar. <eob>
He developed this notion <eob> that independent of the consequences, <eob> some actions are just right <eob> and some are just wrong. <eob>
It's just wrong to lie, <eob> for example. <eob>
So, meet my friend Immanuel here. <eob>
He knows that the sausage <eol> is very tasty, <eob> but he's going to turn away <eol> because he's a good dog. <eob>
He knows it's wrong to jump up <eob> and risk ruining <eol> all this beautiful tableware. <eob>
If you believe that people <eol> are motivated like that, <eob> then all the stuff about incentives, <eob> all the stuff about code of conduct <eol> and bonus systems and so on, <eob> doesn't make a whole lot of sense. <eob>
People are motivated <eol> by different values perhaps. <eob>
So, what are people actually motivated by? <eob>
These two gentlemen here <eol> have perfect hairdos, <eob> but they give us very different <eol> views of the world. <eob>
What do we do with this? <eob>
Well, I'm an economist <eob> and we conduct so-called experiments <eol> to address this issue. <eob>
We strip away facts <eol> which are confusing in reality. <eob>
Reality is so rich, <eol> there is so much going on, <eob> it's almost impossible to know <eol> what drives people's behavior really. <eob>
So let's do a little experiment together. <eob>
Imagine the following situation. <eob>
You're in a room alone, <eob> not like here. <eob>
There's a five-franc coin like <eol> the one I'm holding up right now <eob> in front of you. <eob>
Here are your instructions: <eob> toss the coin four times, <eob> and then on a computer terminal <eob> in front of you, <eob> enter the number of times tails came up. <eob>
This is the situation. <eob>
Here's the rub. <eob>
For every time that you announce <eol> that you had a tails throw, <eob> you get paid five francs. <eob>
So if you say I had two tails throws, <eob> you get paid 10 francs. <eob>
If you say you had zero, <eol> you get paid zero francs. <eob>
If you say, "I had four tails throws," <eob> then you get paid 20 francs. <eob>
It's anonymous, <eob> nobody's watching what you're doing, <eob> and you get paid that money anonymously. <eob>
I've got two questions for you. <eob>
You know what's coming now, right? <eob>
First, how would you behave <eol> in that situation? <eob>
The second, look to your left <eol> and look to your right -- <eob>
and think about how the person <eol> sitting next to you <eob> might behave in that situation. <eob>
We did this experiment for real. <eob>
We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition <eob> that took place here in Zurich recently, <eob> not with students in the lab <eol> at the university <eob> but with the real population, <eob> like you guys. <eob>
First, a quick reminder of stats. <eob>
If I throw the coin four times <eol> and it's a fair coin, <eob> then the probability that it comes up <eol> four times tails <eob> is 6.25 percent. <eob>
And I hope you can intuitively see <eob> that the probability that all four of them <eol> are tails is much lower <eob> than if two of them are tails, right? <eob>
Here are the specific numbers. <eob> Here's what happened. <eob>
People did this experiment for real. <eob>
Around 30 to 35 percent of people said, <eob> "Well, I had four tails throws." <eob> That's extremely unlikely. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the really amazing thing here, <eob> perhaps to an economist, <eob> is there are around 65 percent of people <eol> who did not say I had four tails throws, <eob> even though in that situation, <eob> nobody's watching you, <eob> the only consequence that's in place <eob> is you get more money <eol> if you say four than less. <eob>
You leave 20 francs on the table <eol> by announcing zero. <eob>
I don't know whether <eol> the other people all were honest <eob> or whether they also said a little bit <eol> higher or lower than what they did <eob> because it's anonymous. <eob>
We only observed the distribution. <eob>
But what I can tell you -- <eol> and here's another coin toss. <eob> There you go, it's tails. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Don't check, OK? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What I can tell you <eob> is that not everybody behaved <eol> like Adam Smith would have predicted. <eob>
So what does that leave us with? <eob>
Well, it seems people are motivated <eol> by certain intrinsic values <eob> and in our research, we look at this. <eob>
We look at the idea that people <eol> have so-called protected values. <eob>
A protected value isn't just any value. <eob>
A protected value is a value <eol> where you're willing to pay a price <eob> to uphold that value. <eob>
You're willing to pay a price to withstand <eol> the temptation to give in. <eob>
And the consequence is you feel better <eob> if you earn money in a way <eol> that's consistent with your values. <eob>
Let me show you this again <eol> in the metaphor of our beloved dog here. <eob>
If we succeed in getting the sausage <eol> without violating our values, <eob> then the sausage tastes better. <eob>
That's what our research shows. <eob>
If, on the other hand, <eob> we do so -- <eob> if we get the sausage <eob> and in doing so we actually violate values, <eob> we value the sausage less. <eob>
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful. <eob>
for example, <eob> We can measure these protected values, <eob> by a survey measure. <eob>
Simple, nine-item survey <eol> that's quite predictive in these experiments. <eob>
If you think about the average <eol> of the population <eob> and then there's a distribution around it -- <eob> people are different, we all are different. <eob>
People who have a set of protected values <eob> that's one standard deviation <eol> above the average, <eob> they discount money they receive <eol> by lying by about 25 percent. <eob>
That means a dollar received when lying <eob> is worth to them <eol> only 75 cents <eob> without any incentives you put <eol> in place for them to behave honestly. <eob>
It's their intrinsic motivation. <eob>
By the way, I'm not a moral authority. <eob> I'm not saying I have all these <eol> beautiful values, right? <eob>
But I'm interested <eol> in how people behave <eob> and how we can leverage <eol> that richness in human nature <eob> to actually improve the workings <eol> of our organizations. <eob>
So there are two very, <eol> very different visions here. <eob>
On the one hand, <eob> you can appeal <eol> to benefits and costs <eob> and try to get people to behave <eol> according to them. <eob>
On the other hand, <eob> you can select people who have the values <eob> and the desirable characteristics, of course -- <eob> competencies that go in line <eol> with your organization. <eob>
I do not yet know where these protected <eol> values really come from. <eob>
Is it nurture or is it nature? <eob>
What I can tell you <eob> is that the distribution looks <eol> pretty similar for men and women. <eob>
It looks pretty similar for those <eol> who had studied economics <eob> or those who had studied psychology. <eob>
It looks even pretty similar <eol> around different age categories <eob> among adults. <eob>
But I don't know yet <eol> how this develops over a lifetime. <eob>
That will be the subject <eol> of future research. <eob>
The idea I want to leave you with <eob> is it's all right <eol> to appeal to incentives. <eob> I'm an economist; <eob> I certainly believe <eol> in the fact that incentives work. <eob>
But do think about selecting the right people <eob> rather than having people and then <eol> putting incentives in place. <eob>
Selecting the right people <eol> with the right values <eob> may go a long way to saving <eol> a lot of trouble <eob> and a lot of money <eob> in your organizations. <eob>
In other words, <eob> it will pay off to put people first. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's 1878. <eob> Sir Francis Galton gives a remarkable talk. <eob>
He's speaking to the anthropologic institute <eol> of Great Britain and Ireland. <eob>
Known for his pioneering work <eol> in human intelligence, <eob> Galton is a brilliant polymath. <eob> He's an explorer, <eob> an anthropologist, <eob> a sociologist, <eob> a psychologist <eob> and a statistician. <eob>
He's also a eugenist. <eob>
In this talk, <eob> he presents a new technique <eol> by which he can combine photographs <eob> and produce composite portraits. <eob>
This technique could be used to characterize <eol> different types of people. <eob>
Galton thinks that if he combines <eol> photographs of violent criminals, <eob> he will discover <eol> the face of criminality. <eob>
But to his surprise, <eob> the composite portrait that he produces <eob> is beautiful. <eob>
Galton's surprising <eol> finding raises deep questions: <eob> What is beauty? <eob>
Why do certain configurations of line <eol> and color and form excite us so? <eob>
For most of human history, <eob> these questions have been approached <eol> using logic and speculation. <eob>
But in the last few decades, <eob> scientists have addressed <eol> the question of beauty <eob> using ideas from evolutionary psychology <eol> and tools of neuroscience. <eob>
We're beginning to glimpse the why <eol> and the how of beauty, <eob> at least in terms of what it means <eol> for the human face and form. <eob>
And in the process, <eob> we're stumbling upon some surprises. <eob>
When it comes to seeing beauty <eol> in each other, <eob> while this decision is certainly <eol> subjective for the individual, <eob> it's sculpted by factors <eol> that contribute to the survival of the group. <eob>
Many experiments have shown <eob> that a few basic parameters <eol> contribute to what makes a face attractive. <eob>
These include averaging, symmetry <eol> and the effects of hormones. <eob>
Let's take each one of these in turn. <eob>
Galton's finding <eob> that composite or average faces <eol> are typically more attractive <eob> than each individual face <eol> that contributes to the average <eob> has been replicated many times. <eob>
This laboratory finding fits <eol> with many people's intuitions. <eob>
Average faces represent <eol> the central tendencies of a group. <eob>
People with mixed features <eol> represent different populations, <eob> and presumably harbor greater genetic diversity <eob> and adaptability to the environment. <eob>
Many people find mixed-race individuals <eol> attractive <eob> and inbred families less so. <eob>
The second factor that contributes <eol> to beauty is symmetry. <eob>
People generally find symmetric faces <eol> more attractive than asymmetric ones. <eob>
Developmental abnormalities <eol> are often associated with asymmetries. <eob>
And in plants, animals and humans, <eob> asymmetries often <eol> arise from parasitic infections. <eob>
Symmetry, it turns out, <eob> is also an indicator of health. <eob>
In the 1930s, <eob> a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz <eob> recognized the importance <eol> of symmetry for beauty <eob> when he designed the beauty <eol> micrometer. <eob>
With this device, <eob> he could measure minor asymmetric flaws <eob> which he could then make up for with products <eol> he sold from his company, <eob> named brilliantly after himself, Max Factor, <eob> which, as you know, is one of the world's <eol> most famous brands <eob> for "make up." <eob>
The third factor that contributes <eol> to facial attractiveness <eob> is the effect of hormones. <eob>
And here, I need to apologize <eol> for confining my comments <eob> to heterosexual norms. <eob>
But estrogen and testosterone <eol> play important roles <eob> in shaping features <eol> that we find attractive. <eob>
Estrogen produces features <eol> that signal fertility. <eob>
Men typically find women attractive <eob> who have elements of both youth <eol> and maturity. <eob>
A face that's too baby-like <eol> might mean that the girl is not yet fertile, <eob> so men find women attractive <eob> who have large eyes, full lips <eol> and narrow chins <eob> as indicators of youth, <eob> and high cheekbones as an indicator of maturity. <eob>
Testosterone produces features <eol> that we regard as typically masculine. <eob>
These include heavier brows, <eob> thinner cheeks <eob> and bigger, squared-off jaws. <eob>
But here's a fascinating irony. <eob>
In many species, <eob> if anything, <eob> testosterone suppresses the immune system. <eob>
So the idea that testosterone-infused <eol> features are a fitness indicator <eob> doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. <eob>
Here, the logic is turned on its head. <eob>
Instead of a fitness indicator, <eob> scientists invoke a handicap principle. <eob>
The most commonly cited <eol> example of a handicap <eob> is the peacock's tail. <eob>
This beautiful but cumbersome tail <eol> doesn't exactly help the peacock <eob> avoid predators <eob> and approach peahens. <eob>
Why should such an extravagant <eol> appendage evolve? <eob>
Even Charles Darwin, <eob> in an 1860 letter <eol> to Asa Gray wrote <eob> that the sight of the peacock's tail made him <eol> physically ill. <eob>
He couldn't explain it with his theory <eol> of natural selection, <eob> and out of this frustration, <eob> he developed the theory <eol> of sexual selection. <eob>
On this account, <eob> the display of the peacock's tail <eol> is about sexual enticement, <eob> and this enticement means it's more likely <eol> the peacock will mate <eob> and have offspring. <eob>
Now, the modern twist <eol> on this display argument <eob> is that the peacock is also advertising <eol> its health to the peahen. <eob>
Only especially fit organisms <eol> can afford to divert resources <eob> to maintaining such an extravagant appendage. <eob>
Only especially fit men can afford <eol> the price that testosterone levies <eob> on their immune system. <eob>
And by analogy, think of the fact <eob> that only very rich men <eol> can afford to pay more than $10,000 for a watch <eob> as a display of their financial fitness. <eob>
Now, many people hear <eol> these kinds of evolutionary claims <eob> and think they mean that we somehow <eol> are unconsciously seeking mates <eob> who are healthy. <eob>
And I think this idea <eol> is probably not right. <eob>
Teenagers and young adults are not <eol> exactly known for making decisions <eob> that are predicated <eol> on health concerns. <eob>
But they don't have to be, <eob> and let me explain why. <eob>
Imagine a population <eob> in which people have three different <eol> kinds of preferences: <eob> for green, for orange and for red. <eob>
From their point of view, <eob> these preferences have nothing <eol> to do with health; <eob> they just like what they like. <eob>
But if it were also the case <eol> that these preferences are associated <eob> with the different likelihood <eol> of producing offspring — <eob> let's say in a ratio <eol> of 3: 2: 1 — <eob> then in the first generation, <eob> there would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red, <eob> and in each subsequent generation, <eob> the proportion of greens increase, <eob> so that in 10 generations, <eob> 98 percent of this population <eol> has a green preference. <eob>
Now, a scientist coming <eol> in and sampling this population <eob> discovers that green preferences <eol> are universal. <eob>
So the point about this little abstract example <eob> is that while preferences <eol> for specific physical features <eob> can be arbitrary for the individual, <eob> if those features <eol> are heritable <eob> and they are associated with <eol> a reproductive advantage, <eob> over time, <eob> they become universal for the group. <eob>
So what happens in the brain <eol> when we see beautiful people? <eob>
Attractive faces <eol> activate parts of our visual cortex <eob> in the back of the brain, <eob> an area <eol> called the fusiform gyrus, <eob> that is especially tuned <eol> to processing faces, <eob> and an adjacent area <eol> called the lateral occipital complex, <eob> that is especially attuned <eol> to processing objects. <eob>
In addition, <eob> attractive faces activate <eol> parts of our reward and pleasure centers <eob> in the front and deep in the brain, <eob> and these include areas <eol> that have complicated names, <eob> like the ventral striatum, <eob> the orbitofrontal cortex <eob> and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. <eob>
Our visual brain that is tuned <eol> to processing faces <eob> interacts with our pleasure centers <eob> to underpin the experience <eol> of beauty. <eob>
Amazingly, while we all engage with beauty, <eob> without our knowledge, <eob> beauty also engages us. <eob>
Our brains respond to attractive faces <eob> even when we're not thinking about beauty. <eob>
We conducted an experiment <eol> in which people saw a series of faces, <eob> and in one condition, <eob> they had to decide if a pair of faces <eol> were the same or a different person. <eob>
Even in this condition, <eob> attractive faces drove <eol> neural activity robustly in their visual cortex, <eob> despite the fact that they were thinking <eol> about a person's identity <eob> and not their beauty. <eob>
Another group similarly found <eol> automatic responses to beauty <eob> within our pleasure centers. <eob>
Taken together, these studies suggest <eob> that our brain automatically <eol> responds to beauty <eob> by linking vision and pleasure. <eob>
These beauty detectors, it seems, <eob> ping every time we see beauty, <eob> regardless of whatever else <eol> we might be thinking. <eob>
We also have a "beauty is good" stereotype <eol> embedded in the brain. <eob>
Within <eob> the orbitofrontal cortex, <eob> there's overlapping <eol> neural activity <eob> in response to beauty and to goodness, <eob> and this happens even when people <eol> aren't explicitly thinking <eob> about beauty or goodness. <eob>
Our brains seem to reflexively <eol> associate beauty and good. <eob>
And this reflexive association <eol> may be the biologic trigger <eob> for the many social effects of beauty. <eob>
Attractive people receive <eol> all kinds of advantages in life. <eob>
They're regarded as more intelligent, <eob> more trustworthy, <eob> they're given higher pay <eol> and lesser punishments, <eob> even when such judgments <eol> are not warranted. <eob>
These kinds of observations <eol> reveal beauty's ugly side. <eob>
In my lab, we recently found <eob> that people with minor <eol> facial anomalies and disfigurements <eob> are regarded as less good, less kind, <eob> less intelligent, less competent <eol> and less hardworking. <eob>
Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured <eol> is bad" stereotype. <eob>
This stereotype is probably exploited <eol> and magnified <eob> by images in popular media, <eob> in which facial disfigurement <eol> is often used as a shorthand <eob> to depict someone <eol> of villainous character. <eob>
We need to understand <eol> these kinds of implicit biases <eob> if we are to overcome them <eob> and aim for a society in which we treat people fairly, <eob> based on their behavior and not <eol> on the happenstance of their looks. <eob>
Let me leave you with one final thought. <eob>
Beauty is a work in progress. <eob>
The so-called universal attributes of beauty <eob> were selected for during the almost <eol> two million years of the Pleistocene. <eob>
Life was nasty, brutish <eol> and a very long time ago. <eob>
The selection criteria <eol> for reproductive success from that time <eob> doesn't really apply today. <eob>
For example, <eob> death by parasite is not one of the top ways <eol> that people die, <eob> at least not in the technologically <eol> developed world. <eob>
From antibiotics to surgery, <eob> birth control to in vitro fertilization, <eob> the filters for reproductive success <eol> are being relaxed. <eob>
And under these relaxed conditions, <eob> preference and trait combinations <eol> are free to drift <eob> and become more variable. <eob>
Even as we are profoundly <eol> affecting our environment, <eob> modern medicine and technological innovation <eob> is profoundly affecting <eob> the very essence of what it <eol> means to look beautiful. <eob>
The universal nature of beauty is changing <eob> even as we're changing the universe. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
So, I'm afraid. <eob> Right now, <eob> on this stage, <eob> I feel fear. <eob>
In my life, I ain't met many people <eob> that will readily admit <eol> when they are afraid. <eob>
And I think that's because deep down, <eob> they know how easy it spreads. <eob>
See, fear is like a disease. <eob>
When it moves, it moves like wildfire. <eob>
But what happens when, <eob> even in the face of that fear, <eob> you do what you've got to do? <eob>
That's called courage. <eob>
And just like fear, <eob> courage is contagious. <eob>
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois. <eob>
That's a small city <eob> across the Mississippi River <eol> from St. Louis, Missouri. <eob>
I have lived in and around St. <eol> Louis my entire life. <eob>
When Michael Brown, Jr., <eob> an ordinary teenager, <eob> was gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri -- <eob> another suburb, but north <eol> of St. Louis -- <eob> I remember thinking, <eob> he ain't the first, <eob> and he won't be the last young kid <eol> to lose his life to law enforcement. <eob>
But see, his death was different. <eob>
When Mike was killed, <eob> I remember the powers <eol> that be trying to use fear as a weapon. <eob>
The police response <eol> to a community in mourning was to use force <eob> to impose fear: <eob> fear of militarized police, <eob> imprisonment, <eob> fines. <eob>
The media even tried to make <eol> us afraid of each other <eob> by the way they spun the story. <eob>
And all of these things <eol> have worked in the past. <eob>
But like I said, this time <eol> it was different. <eob>
Michael Brown's death <eol> and the subsequent treatment of the community <eob> led to a string of protests <eol> in and around Ferguson and St. Louis. <eob> When I got out to those protests <eol> about the fourth or fifth day, <eob> it was not out of courage; <eob> it was out of guilt. <eob>
See, I'm black. <eob>
I don't know if y'all noticed that. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes <eol> away from Ferguson, <eob> and not go see. <eob>
So I got off my ass to go check it out. <eob>
When I got out there, <eob> I found something surprising. <eob>
I found anger; there was a lot of that. <eob>
But what I found more of was love. <eob>
People with love for themselves. <eob>
Love for their community. <eob>
And it was beautiful -- <eob> until the police showed up. <eob>
Then a new emotion was interjected <eol> into the conversation: <eob> fear. <eob>
Now, I'm not going to lie; <eob> when I saw those armored vehicles, <eob> and all that gear <eob> and all those guns <eob> and all those police <eob> I was terrified -- <eob> personally. <eob>
And when I looked around that crowd, <eob> I saw a lot of people <eol> that had the same thing going on. <eob>
But I also saw people <eol> with something else inside of them. <eob> That was courage. <eob> See, those people yelled, <eob> and they screamed, <eob> and they were not about <eol> to back down from the police. <eob>
They were past that point. <eob>
And then I could feel <eol> something in me changing, <eob> so I yelled and I screamed, <eob> and I noticed that everybody around me <eol> was doing the same thing. <eob>
And there was nothing like that feeling. <eob>
So I decided I wanted to do <eol> something more. <eob>
I went home, I thought: <eol> I'm an artist. I make shit. <eob> So I started making things <eol> specific to the protest, <eob> things that would be weapons <eol> in a spiritual war, <eob> things that would give people voice <eob> and things that would fortify them <eol> for the road ahead. <eob>
I did a project where I took <eol> pictures of the hands of protesters <eob> and put them up and down the boarded-up buildings <eob> and community shops. <eob>
My goal was to raise awareness <eol> and to raise the morale. <eob>
And I think, for a minute at least, <eob> it did just that. <eob>
Then I thought, I want to uplift <eol> the stories of these people <eob> I was watching being courageous <eol> in the moment. <eob>
And myself and my friend, <eob> and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan <eob> did just that with our documentary, <eob> "Whose Streets?" <eob>
I kind of became a conduit <eob> for all of this courage <eol> that was given to me. <eob>
And I think that's part <eol> of our job as artists. <eob>
I think we should be conveyors <eol> of courage in the work that we do. <eob>
And I think that we are the wall <eol> between the normal folks <eob> and the people that use their power <eol> to spread fear and hate, <eob> especially in times like these. <eob>
So I'm going to ask you. <eob> Y'all the movers and the shakers, <eob> you know, the thought leaders: <eob> What are you gonna do <eob> with the gifts that you've been given <eob> to break us from the fear <eol> the binds us every day? <eob>
Because, see, I'm afraid every day. <eob>
I can't remember a time when I wasn't. <eob>
But once I figured out <eol> that fear was not put in me to cripple me, <eob> it was there to protect me, <eob> and once I figured out <eol> how to use that fear, <eob> I found my power. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hi everyone. <eob> So, I'm going to take us back to 2007. <eob>
I'd just spent about six months <eol> working on album <eob> that I'd poured my heart and my soul into, <eob> and it was getting about three plays <eol> per day on Myspace at the time, <eob> and I was getting more and more depressed <eol> when I started noticing these other people <eob> who were playing guitar and singing <eob> and putting videos on this new site called YouTube, <eob> and they were getting 300,000 views. <eob>
So I decided I'm going to start <eol> making some Youtube videos. <eob>
And one day they featured <eol> a video of my band on the homepage, <eob> which was amazing — we got a bunch of new fans. <eob>
We also got a bunch of people <eob> who, I guess, just didn't really like the music or something — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> It's OK because people <eol> started coming to our shows, <eob> and we started touring, <eob> and we came out with a record. <eob>
And when I checked our bank account balance <eob> after our first monthly iTunes payout, <eob> we had 22,000 bucks in it, <eob> which was amazing because at the time <eol> I was living at my dad's house, <eob> trying to make a living <eol> as a musician by uploading videos to the internet <eob> which literally zero people respected in 2009 — <eob> even the people who were uploading <eol> videos to the internet. <eob>
And so for the next four years, <eob> I uploaded more and more videos to the Internet, <eob> and they got better and better, <eob> and we made enough money <eol> through brand deals <eob> and commercials and iTunes sales <eob> to buy a house. <eob>
And we built a recording studio. <eob>
But there was one big problem: <eob> making money as a creative person <eol> in 2013 was super weird. <eob>
First of all, the business models <eol> were changing all the time. <eob>
So our 58,000 dollars <eol> of annual iTunes download income <eob> was about to be replaced by about 6,000 dollars of streaming income. <eob>
Steams paid less than downloads. <eob>
And then as more and more creators <eol> started popping up online, <eob> there was just more competition <eol> for these five-figure brand deals <eob> that had kept the band <eol> afloat for years. <eob>
And to top it all off, our videos themselves -- <eob> the creative stuff that we made <eol> that our fans loved and appreciated -- <eob> that were actually contributing value to the world, <eob> those videos were generating <eol> almost zero dollars of income for us. <eob>
This is an actual snapshot <eol> of my YouTube dashboard <eob> from a 28-day period <eob> that shows one million views <eob> and 166 dollars <eol> of ad earnings for those views. <eob>
The whole machine in 2013 <eob> that took art online and outputted money <eob> was totally nonfunctional. <eob>
It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper, <eob> or an institution, <eob> or an independent creator. <eob>
A monthly web comic <eol> with 20,000 monthly readers -- <eob> 20,000 monthly readers -- <eob> gets paid a couple hundred bucks <eol> in ad revenue. <eob>
This is 20,000 people. <eob>
Like, in what world is this not enough? <eob>
I don't understand. <eob>
What systems have we built <eol> where this is insufficient <eob> for a person to make a living? <eob>
So, I actually have a theory about this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I think it's been a weird 100 years. <eob> (Applause) <eob> About 100 years ago, <eob> humans figured out <eol> how to record sound onto a wax cylinder. <eob>
That was the beginning of the phonograph. <eob>
Right around the same time, <eob> we figured out how to record light <eol> onto a piece of photographic paper, <eob> celluloid -- the beginning <eol> of film and television. <eob>
For the first time, <eol> you could store art on a thing, <eob> which was amazing. <eob>
Art used to be completely ephemeral, <eob> so if you missed the symphony, <eol> you just didn't get to hear the orchestra. <eob>
which was amazing. <eob> But now, for the first time, <eob> you could store the orchestra's performance <eol> on a physical object, <eob> and like, listen to it later, <eob>
It was so amazing in fact, <eob> that for the next 100 years, <eol> between 1900 and 2000, <eob> humans built just billions <eol> and billions of dollars of infrastructure <eob> to essentially help artists do two things. <eob>
First, put their art on a thing, <eob> and second, get that thing <eol> around the world <eob> to the people who wanted the art. <eob>
So, so much industry <eol> is devoted to these two problems. <eob> Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies, <eob> and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms, <eol> and CD jewel case manufacturers, <eob> all devoted to these two problems. <eob>
And then we all know what happened. <eob>
10 years ago, the internet matures <eob> and we get Spotify and Facebook and YouTube <eob> and iTunes and Google search, <eob> and a hundred years of infrastructure <eob> and supply chains <eol> and distribution systems <eob> and monetization schemes <eob> are completely bypassed -- <eob> in a decade. <eob>
After 100 years of designing these things, <eob> it's no wonder that it's just totally broken <eol> for creative people right now. <eob>
It's no wonder that the monetization <eol> part of the chain doesn't work <eob> given this new context. <eob>
But what gets me super excited <eol> to be a creator right now, <eob> to be alive today and be <eol> a creative person right now, <eob> is realizing that we're only 10 years <eol> into figuring out this new machine -- <eob> to figuring out the next 100 years <eol> of infrastructure for our creators. <eob>
And you can tell we're only 10 years in. <eob>
There's a lot of trial and error, <eol> some really good ideas forming, <eob> a lot of experimentation. <eob>
We're figuring out what works <eol> and what doesn't. <eob> Like Twitch streamers. Who's heard of Twitch? <eob>
Twitch streamers are making three <eol> to five thousand bucks a month <eob> streaming gaming content. <eob>
The big ones are making <eol> over 100,000 dollars a year. <eob>
There's a site called YouNow, <eob> it's an app. <eob>
It allows musicians and vloggers to get <eol> paid in digital goods from fans. <eob>
So, I'm also working on the problem. <eob>
Four years ago I started <eol> a company called Patreon <eob> with a friend of mine. <eob>
We're 80 people <eol> now working on this problem. <eob>
It's basically a membership platform <eob> that makes it really easy <eol> for creators to get paid -- <eob> every month from their fans <eol> to earn a living. <eob>
For a creator, it's like having a salary <eol> for being a creative person. <eob>
And this is one of our creators. <eob>
They're called "Kinda Funny." <eob> They have about 220,000 subscribers on YouTube. <eob>
And when they upload a video, <eob> it gets somewhere around 15,000 views <eol> to 100,000 views. <eob>
I want you to check yourselves right now. <eob>
I think when we hear numbers like that, <eol> when we hear "15,000 views," <eob> and we see content like this, <eob> we just snap categorize it <eol> as being not as legitimate <eob> as a morning show <eol> that you'd hear on the radio <eob> or a talk show that you'd see on NBC or something <eob> But when "Kinda Funny" launched on Patreon, <eob> within a few weeks, they were making 31,000 dollars per month <eob> for this show. <eob>
It took off so fast that they decided <eol> to expand their programming <eob> and add new shows, <eob> and now they launched <eol> a second Patreon page -- <eob> they're making an additional <eol> 21,000 dollars per month. <eob>
And they're scaling what's <eol> essentially becoming a media company, <eob> financing the whole thing through membership. <eob>
OK, here's another example. <eob>
This is Derek Bodner, <eob> a sports journalist <eol> who used to write for Philadelphia Magazine <eob> until a few months ago <eol> when the magazine cut out all sports coverage. <eob>
Now he writes articles and publishes them <eol> on his own website -- <eob> he's still covering sports, <eol> but for himself. <eob>
And he's making 4,800 bucks <eol> a month from 1,700 patrons, <eob> financing it through membership. <eob>
This is Crash Course -- <eob> free educational content for the world. <eob>
This show is actually <eol> on the PBS digital network -- <eob> 29,000 dollars per month. <eob>
This is a duo sailing around the world, <eob> getting paid every month <eol> for documenting their travels <eob> from 1,400 patrons. <eob>
This is a podcast, "Chapo Trap House", making -- <eob> actually, since I screenshotted this, <eob> they're making an additional <eol> 2,000 dollars per month, <eob> so they're now making 56,000 dollars per month <eol> for their podcast. <eob>
And Patreon's not the only one working <eol> on the problem. <eob>
Even Google's starting to work on this. <eob>
A couple years ago, <eol> they launched Fan Funding; <eob> more recently, they launched <eol> Super Chat <eob> as a way for creators to monetize <eol> live streaming. <eob>
Newspapers are starting <eol> to experiment with membership. <eob>
New York Times has a membership program; <eob> The Guardian has over 200,000 paying subscribers <eob> to its membership program. <eob>
There's this bubbling soup <eol> of ideas and experiments <eob> and progress right now, <eob> and it's pointing in the direction <eol> of getting creators paid. <eob> And it's working. <eob> It's not, like, perfect yet, <eob> but it's really working. <eob>
So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators <eol> on the platform making salaries -- <eob> getting paid every month for putting art online, <eob> for being a creative person. <eob>
The next hundred years <eol> of infrastructure is on the way <eob> and it's going to be different <eol> this time because of this -- <eob> because of the direct connection <eol> between the person who makes the thing <eob> and the person <eol> who likes the thing. <eob>
About seven or eight years ago, <eob> I went to a cocktail party. <eob>
This is when the band <eol> had hit our first machine, <eob> so things were really cranking. <eob>
We had just made <eol> about 400,000 dollars in one year <eob> through iTunes sales <eol> and brand deals and stuff like that. <eob>
And this guy comes <eol> up to me and says, <eob> "Hey, Jack, what do you do?" <eob> I said, "I'm a musician." <eob> And he just sobered up immediately, <eob> and he stuck out his hand, <eob> put a hand on my shoulder, <eob> and in a real earnest, very nice voice he was like, <eob> "I hope you make it someday." <eob> (Laughter) And... <eob> I have so many moments like that logged <eol> in my memory. <eob>
I just cringe thinking of that. <eob>
It's so embarrassing to just not feel <eol> valued as a creative person. <eob>
But as a species, <eob> we are leaving that cocktail party behind. <eob>
We're leaving that culture, <eob> we're out of there. <eob>
We're going to get so good <eol> at paying creators, <eob> within 10 years, <eob> kids graduating high school <eol> and college are going to think of being a creator <eob> as just being an option -- <eob> I could be a doctor, <eol> I could be a lawyer, <eob> I could be a podcaster, I could have a web comic. <eob>
It's just going to be something you can do. <eob> We're figuring it out. <eob> It's going to be a viable <eol> and sustainable and respected profession. <eob>
Creators are going to come out <eol> the other end of this weird 100 years, <eob> this century-long journey, <eob> with an awesome new machine. <eob>
And they're going to be paid, <eol> and they're going to be valued. <eob> Thanks, everybody. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> I think it went pretty well. <eob>
I want artists who saw <eol> that to not give up -- <eob> to know that we're getting there. <eob>
It's not there yet, <eob> but in a couple years, <eob> there will be so many systems <eol> and tools for them <eob> to just make a living online, <eob> and if they've got a podcast <eol> that's starting to take off, <eob> but they're not able to make money <eol> on it yet, <eob> that's happening <eob> and they're going to be paid. <eob> It's happening. <eob>
So, let me add to the complexity <eob> of the situation we find ourselves in. <eob>
At the same time that we're solving <eol> for climate change, <eob> we're going to be building cities <eol> for three billion people. <eob> That's a doubling <eol> of the urban environment. <eob>
If we don't get that right, <eob> I'm not sure all the climate solutions <eol> in the world will save mankind, <eob> because so much depends <eol> on how we shape our cities: <eob> not just environmental impacts, <eob> but our social well-being, <eob> our economic vitality, <eob> our sense of community and connectedness. <eob>
Fundamentally, the way we shape <eol> cities is a manifestation <eob> of the kind of humanity we bring to bear. <eob>
And so getting it right is, I think, <eob> the order of the day. <eob>
And to a certain degree, getting it <eol> right can help us solve climate change, <eob> because in the end, <eob> it's our behavior that seems to be <eol> driving the problem. <eob>
The problem isn't free-floating, <eob> and it isn't just ExxonMobil and oil companies. <eob>
It's us; how we live. <eob> How we live. <eob>
There's a villain in this story. <eob>
It's called sprawl, and I'll be upfront about that. <eob>
But it's not just the kind of sprawl you think of, <eol> or many people think of, <eob> as low-density development <eob> out at the periphery of the metropolitan area. <eob>
Actually, I think sprawl can happen <eol> anywhere, at any density. <eob>
The key attribute <eol> is that it isolates people. <eob>
It segregates people <eol> into economic enclaves <eob> and land-use enclaves. <eob>
It separates them from nature. <eob>
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization, <eob> the interaction, <eob> that make cities great places <eob> and that make society thrive. <eob>
So the antidote to sprawl is really <eol> what we all need to be thinking about, <eob> especially when we're taking on this <eol> massive construction project. <eob>
So let me take you through one exercise. <eob> We developed the model <eol> for the state of California <eob> so they could get on <eol> with reducing carbon emissions. <eob>
We did a whole series of scenarios <eol> for how the state could grow, <eob> and this is just one overly simplified one. <eob>
We mixed different development prototypes <eob> and said they're going to carry us <eol> through the year 2050, <eob> 10 million new crew in our state of California. <eob>
And one was sprawl. <eob>
It's just more of the same: <eol> shopping malls, subdivisions, <eob> office parks. <eob>
The other one was dominated by, <eol> not everybody moving to the city, <eob> but just compact development, <eob> what we used to think of as streetcar suburbs, <eob> walkable neighborhoods, <eob> low-rise, but integrated, <eol> mixed-used environments. <eob>
And the results are astounding. <eob>
They're astounding not just for the scale <eol> of the difference <eob> of this one shift in our city-making habit <eob> but also because each one represents a special interest group, <eob> a special interest group that used to advocate <eol> for their concerns <eob> one at a time. <eob>
They did not see the, <eol> what I call, "co-benefits" of urban form <eob> that allows them to join with others. <eob>
So, land consumption: <eob> environmentalists are really concerned <eol> about this, <eob> so are farmers; <eob> there's a whole range of people, <eob> and, of course, neighborhood groups <eol> that want open space nearby. <eob>
The sprawl version of California <eob> almost doubles the urban physical footprint. <eob>
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings, <eob> because in California, our biggest carbon <eol> emission comes from cars, <eob> and cities that don't depend on cars as much <eob> obviously create huge savings. <eob>
Vehicle miles traveled: <eol> that's what I was just talking about. <eob>
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles <eol> per household per year, <eob> from somewhere in the mid-26,000 per household, <eob> has a huge impact not just <eol> on air quality and carbon <eob> but also on the household pocketbook. <eob>
It's very expensive to drive that much, <eob> and as we've seen, <eob> the middle class is struggling to hold on. <eob>
Health care: we were talking about how do you fix <eol> it once we broke it -- <eob> clean the air. <eob>
Why not just stop polluting? <eob>
Why not just use our feet and bikes more? <eob>
And that's a function <eol> of the kinds of cities that we shape. <eob>
Household costs: <eob> 2008 was a mark in time, <eob> not of just the financial <eol> industry running amok. <eob>
It was that we were trying to sell <eol> too many of the wrong kind of housing: <eob> large lot, single family, distant, <eob> too expensive for the average <eol> middle-class family to afford <eob> and, quite frankly, <eol> not a good fit to their lifestyle anymore. <eob>
But in order to move inventory, <eob> you can discount the financing <eol> and get it sold. <eob>
I think that's a lot of what happened. <eob>
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars -- <eob> remember, in California <eol> the median is 50,000 -- <eob> this is a big element. <eob>
That's just cars and utility costs. <eob>
So the affordable housing advocates, <eol> who often sit off in their silos <eob> separate from the environmentalists, <eol> separate from the politicians, <eob> everybody fighting with everyone, <eob> now begin to see common cause, <eob> and I think the common cause <eol> is what really brings about the change. <eob>
Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts, <eob> has now decided to transform itself <eob> into a more transit-oriented environment. <eob>
As a matter of fact, since '08, <eob> they've voted in 400 billion dollars <eol> of bonds for transit <eob> and zero dollars for new highways. <eob> What a transformation: <eob> LA becomes a city of walkers and transit, <eob> not a city of cars. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How does it happen? <eob> You take the least desirable land, the strip, <eob> you add where there's space, transit <eob> and then you infill mixed-use development, <eob> you satisfy new housing demands <eob> and you make the existing neighborhoods <eob> all around it more complex, <eob> more interesting, more walkable. <eob>
Here's another kind of sprawl: <eob> China, high-density sprawl, what you think <eol> of as an oxymoron, <eob> but the same problems, everything <eol> isolated in superblocks, <eob> and of course this amazing smog <eol> that was just spoken to. <eob>
Twelve percent of GDP in China <eol> now is spent <eob> on the health impacts of that. <eob>
The history, of course, <eol> of Chinese cities is robust. <eob>
It's like any other place. <eob>
Community was all about small, local shops <eob> and local services and walking, <eol> interacting with your neighbors. <eob>
It may sound utopian, but it's not. <eob>
It's actually what people really want. <eob>
The new superblocks -- <eob> these are blocks <eol> that would have 5,000 units in them, <eob> and they're gated as well, <eol> because nobody knows anybody else. <eob>
And of course, there isn't even a sidewalk, <eol> no ground floor shops -- <eob> a very sterile environment. <eob>
I found this one case here <eol> in one of the superblocks <eob> where people had illicitly set up shops in their garages <eob> so that they could have <eol> that kind of local service economy. <eob>
The desire of people <eol> to get it right is there. <eob>
We just have to get the planners <eol> on board and the politicians. <eob>
All right. Some technical planning stuff. <eob> Chongqing is a city of 30 million people. <eob>
It's almost as big as California. <eob>
This is a small growth area. <eob>
They wanted us to test <eol> the alternative to sprawl <eob> in several cities across China. <eob>
This is for four-and-a-half <eol> million people. <eob>
What the takeaway from this image is, <eob> every one of those circles <eol> is a walking radius <eob> around a transit station -- <eob> massive investment in metro and BRT, <eob> and a distribution that allows everybody <eob> to work within walking <eol> distance of that. <eob>
The red area, this is a blow-up. <eob>
All of a sudden, our principles <eol> called for green space <eob> preserving the important <eol> ecological features. <eob>
And then those other streets <eol> in there are auto-free streets. <eob>
So instead of bulldozing, <eol> leveling the site <eob> and building right up to the river, <eob> this green edge was something <eol> that really wasn't normative in China <eob> until these set of practices <eob> began experimentation there. <eob>
The urban fabric, small blocks, <eob> maybe 500 families per block. <eob>
They know each other. <eob>
The street perimeter has shops <eob> so there's local destinations. <eob>
And the streets themselves become smaller, <eob> because there are more of them. <eob>
Very simple, <eob> straightforward urban design. <eob>
Now, here you have something <eol> I dearly love. <eob>
Think of the logic. <eob>
If only a third <eol> of the people have cars, <eob> why do we give 100 percent <eol> of our streets to cars? <eob>
What if we gave 70 percent <eol> of the streets <eob> to car-free, to everybody else, <eob> so that the transit could move well for them, <eob> so that they could walk, <eol> so they could bike? <eob>
Why not have -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
geographic equity <eob> in our circulation system? <eob>
And quite frankly, cities <eol> would function better. <eob>
No matter what they do, <eob> no matter how many ring roads <eol> they build in Beijing, <eob> they just can't overcome <eol> complete gridlock. <eob>
So this is an auto-free street, <eol> mixed use along the edge. <eob>
It has transit running down the middle. <eob>
I'm happy to make that transit <eol> autonomous vehicles, <eob> but maybe I'll have a chance <eol> to talk about that later. <eob>
So there are seven principles <eol> that have now been adopted <eob> by the highest levels <eol> in the Chinese government, <eob> and they're moving to implement them. <eob>
And they're simple, <eob> and they are globally, <eol> I think, universal principles. <eob>
One is to preserve <eol> the natural environment, the history <eob> and the critical agriculture. <eob>
Second is mix. <eob> Mixed use is popular, <eol> but when I say mixed, <eob> I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups <eob> as well as mixed-land use. <eob>
Walk. <eob> There's no great city <eol> that you don't enjoy walking in. <eob>
You don't go there. <eob>
The places you go on vacation <eol> are places you can walk. <eob>
Why not make it everywhere? <eob>
Bike is the most efficient means <eol> of transportation we know. <eob>
China has now adopted policies <eol> that put six meters of bike lane <eob> on every street. <eob>
They're serious about getting back <eol> to their biking history. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Complicated planner-ese here: <eob> connect. <eob>
It's a street network <eol> that allows many routes <eob> instead of singular routes <eob> and provides many kinds of streets <eol> instead of just one. <eob>
Ride. <eob> We have to invest more in transit. <eob>
There's no silver bullet. <eob>
Autonomous vehicles <eol> are not going to solve this for us. <eob>
As a matter of fact, they're going to generate <eol> more traffic, more VMT, <eob> than the alternative. <eob>
And focus. <eob> We have a hierarchy of the city <eol> based on transit <eob> rather than the old armature of freeways. <eob>
It's a big paradigm shift, <eob> but those two things <eol> have to get reconnected <eob> in ways that really shape <eol> the structure of the city. <eob>
So I'm very hopeful. <eob>
In California, the United States, <eol> China -- these changes are well accepted. <eob>
I'm hopeful for two reasons. <eob>
One is, most people get it. <eob>
They understand intrinsically <eob> what a great city can and should be. <eob>
The second is that the kind <eol> of analysis we can bring to bear now <eob> allows people to connect the dots, <eob> allows people to shape political coalitions <eob> that didn't exist in the past. <eob>
That allows them to bring into being <eol> the kinds of communities we all need. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: So, OK: autonomous driving, <eol> self-driving cars. <eob>
A lot of people here <eol> are very excited about them. <eob>
What are your concerns <eol> or issues about them? <eob>
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think <eol> there's almost too much hype here. <eob>
First is, everybody says we're going <eol> to get rid of a lot of cars. <eob>
What they don't say <eol> is you're going to get a lot more vehicle miles. <eob>
You're going to get a lot more cars <eol> moving on streets. <eob>
There will be more congestion. <eob>
CA: Because they're so appealing -- <eob> you can drive while reading or sleeping. <eob>
PC: Well, a couple of reasons. <eob>
One is, if they're privately owned, <eol> people will travel greater distances. <eob>
It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl. <eob>
If you can work on your way to work, <eob> you can live in more remote locations. <eob>
It'll revitalize sprawl <eob> in a way that I'm deeply frightened. <eob>
Taxis: <eob> about 50 percent of the surveys say <eol> that people won't share them. <eob>
If they don't share them, <eob> you can end up with a 90 percent increase <eol> in vehicle miles traveled. <eob>
If you share them, <eob> you're still at around a 30 percent <eol> increase in VMT. <eob>
CA: Sharing them, meaning <eol> having multiple people riding at once <eob> in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing? <eob>
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share <eol> without a steering wheel. <eob>
The reality is, the efficiency of vehicles -- <eol> you can do it <eob> with or without a steering wheel, <eol> it doesn't matter. <eob>
They claim they're the only ones <eol> that are going to be efficient electric, <eob> but that's not true. <eob>
But the real bottom line is that walking, <eol> biking and transit <eob> are the way cities and communities thrive. <eob>
And putting people <eol> in their private bubbles, <eob> whether they have a steering wheel <eol> or not, <eob> is the wrong direction. <eob>
And quite frankly, <eob> the image of an AV on its way <eol> to McDonald's to pick up a pack <eob> without its owner, <eob> just being sent off on these <eol> kind of random errands <eob> is really frightening to me. <eob>
CA: Well, thank you for that, <eol> and I have to say, the images you showed <eob> of those mixed-use <eol> streets were really inspiring, really beautiful. <eob>
PC: <eob> Thank you. <eob> CA: Thank you for your work. <eob>
So, raise your hand if you've seen <eol> somebody in your city <eob> standing on a corner, <eol> holding a sign like this. <eob>
I think we all have. <eob>
If you're being honest, <eob> at least one time, have you wondered <eol> if they mean it? <eob>
If we offered them a job, <eol> would they really take it? <eob>
And what would that job mean <eol> to them in their lives? <eob>
Well, this is a story <eol> about what happened in my city <eob> when we decided to find out, <eob> when we decided to think differently <eol> about panhandling, <eob> and lift people up <eol> through the dignity of work. <eob>
We call it, "There's a Better Way." <eob> We call it There's a Better Way <eob> because I believe there's a better way <eol> to get the money you need <eob> than panhandling <eol> on the corner. <eob>
I believe there's a better way <eol> to help your brothers and sisters in need <eob> than handing a few dollars <eol> out the car window. <eob>
We know there's dignity in work. <eob>
We also know that people are much more likely <eol> to invest in themselves <eob> if they believe that their community <eol> is willing to invest in them first. <eob>
And because we're all wired <eol> to be kind and compassionate, <eob> it always feels good to hand <eol> a couple of dollars to someone <eob> that is in need. <eob>
But if you talk to panhandlers, <eol> many of them will tell you <eob> that your few dollars don't necessarily <eol> go towards feeding the body, <eob> they go towards feeding an addiction. <eob>
There's a better way. <eob>
My name is Richard Berry, <eob> and I have one of the best jobs <eol> in the world. <eob>
I get to be the mayor <eol> of a great American city, <eob> Albuquerque, New Mexico. <eob>
I was at lunch on July 17, <eol> 2015, in my great American city, <eob> and on my way back to city hall, <eob> I saw this gentleman standing on a corner. <eob>
As you can see, he's holding a sign, <eob> and his sign says he wants a job. <eob>
But if you look closer at the picture, <eob> you'll see he's standing <eol> underneath a blue sign, <eob> and that sign says, if you need help, <eol> if you need food or shelter <eob> or you'd like to donate, <eob> please call 311, our community service number. <eob>
So why is this guy standing <eol> underneath my sign with his sign? <eob>
Well, we wondered if anybody <eol> would call that 311 sign, <eob> and as it turns out, they did -- <eob> 11,000 times people called. <eob>
I put those up in about 30 intersections. <eob>
And we did connect them <eol> with food and shelter and services. <eob>
But yet he's still standing under my sign <eob> with a sign that says he wants a job. <eob>
It's simple: he wants a job. <eob>
So I decided to do <eol> something rare in government. <eob>
I decided to make the solution <eol> simpler rather than more complicated. <eob>
I went back to my office, <eol> I gathered my staff around <eob> and I said, "We're going <eol> to take this man at his word, <eob> and others like him. <eob>
The man says he wants a job, <eol> we're going to give him a job, <eob> and we're going to make our city an even better <eol> place in the meantime." <eob> You see, Albuquerque <eol> is a beautiful place. <eob>
We're a mile high, <eob> the Sandia Mountains <eol> on the east, <eob> the Rio Grande runs through the center of the city; <eob> we're the home of the Albuquerque <eol> International Balloon Fiesta. <eob>
On a day like today, <eob> you could literally ski <eol> this morning and golf this afternoon. <eob>
But there's always something to do -- <eob> always weeds to pull, litter to pick up. <eob>
If you're going to have <eol> an initiative like this in your city, <eob> you have to ask yourself two questions. <eob>
First one is: Is there anything left <eol> to do in your city? <eob>
And if the answer is no, <eob> would you please give me <eol> your mayor's phone number, <eob> because I need some advice. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> But the second question <eol> you have to ask is this: <eob> Are your solutions to panhandling working? <eob>
If you're like Albuquerque, <eob> and you're taking the punitive approach <eol> like we used to, <eob> handing out tickets to panhandlers <eol> or those who give them money, <eob> I'm going to suggest that <eol> your solutions aren't working, <eob> and I know you're not getting to the root <eol> of your problem in your city. <eob>
So if you have something to do <eob> and you need people that <eol> need something to do, <eob> there's a better way. <eob>
And the good news is, <eol> it's not that complicated. <eob>
This a 2006 Dodge van. <eob>
It was in my motor pool <eol> not doing anything. <eob>
We put some new tires on it, <eol> wrapped it with a logo. <eob>
This van now goes out to street corners <eol> where our panhandlers are -- <eob> we go to them. <eob>
We stop the van, we get out, <eob> we ask them if they would like a day's work <eob> rather than panhandling for the day. <eob>
And if you wondered if they really mean it -- <eob> it takes us about an hour <eol> to fill this van up in the morning, <eob> because almost everybody we ask <eol> takes a job for the day. <eob>
But you need more than just a van. <eob>
You need a super-fantastic human being <eol> to drive that van. <eob>
And my super-fantastic human being, <eol> his name is Will. <eob>
This is him in the yellow vest. <eob>
Will works at our local nonprofit partner. <eob> He works with the homeless every day. <eob>
The panhandlers trust him, <eob> he believes in them, <eob> he hustles. <eob>
I like to say, "Where there's a Will, <eol> there's a way." <eob> So if you're going to do <eol> the Better Way campaign in your city, <eob> you need to find yourself a Will, <eob> because he's really one of the keys <eol> to making this successful <eob> in the city of Albuquerque. <eob>
You also need a great nonprofit partner. <eob>
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center. <eob>
They've been in our community <eol> for over 30 years. <eob>
They provide counseling, food, shelter, <eob> and if they don't provide it, <eob> they know somebody in our city that does. <eob>
But they do something much more <eol> for me as the mayor. <eob> They provide agility. <eob> You see, it takes me two weeks, <eob> maybe two months sometimes, <eob> to onboard an employee <eol> with the city of Albuquerque. <eob>
So you could imagine -- <eob> my old Dodge van, <eob> my super-fantastic human being, Will, <eob> a great local nonprofit partner -- <eob> they drive to the corner, <eol> there's a panhandler, <eob> they say, "Would you like to work <eol> for the day?" <eob> The panhandler says, "Yes," <eob> a great local nonprofit <eob>
I'll be back in six weeks <eol> to pick you up. "(Laughter) <eob>
It wouldn't work. <eob> It's really important <eol> that we have that agility in our program. <eob>
And they do the paperwork, <eob> they do the insurance, <eob> they do all of the other forms <eol> that I can't do quickly. <eob>
We pay our panhandlers <eol> nine dollars an hour. <eob>
We feed them once at the jobsite. <eob>
At the end of the day, <eob> our old Dodge van takes them <eol> right back to St. Martin's, <eob> and they get connected with counseling services. <eob>
So far, <eob> with the pilot program <eol> and a couple days a week, <eob> and a fantastic human being <eol> and a Dodge van, <eob> we've cleaned up 400 city blocks <eob> in the city of Albuquerque. <eob>
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds <eol> of trash, weeds and litter. <eob>
I don't know if you've ever weighed <eol> a tumbleweed, <eob> but they don't weigh much, <eob> so you can imagine the volume <eol> of material that we've picked up. <eob>
My city has 6,000 employees, <eob> and none better than my solid <eol> waste department. <eob>
We send our trucks out <eol> at the end of the day, <eob> they help the panhandlers <eol> put into the truck <eob> the material they've picked up during the day, <eob> and we take it to the landfill. <eob>
I'm lucky that I have city employees <eob> that are willing to work side by side <eol> with our panhandlers. <eob>
They're lifting up our city <eol> while lifting up their lives. <eob>
And like anything else -- listen, <eol> it takes resources. <eob>
But the good news is it doesn't take much. <eob>
We started with an old van, <eob> a super-fantastic human being, <eob> a great local nonprofit <eob> and $50,000. <eob>
But we also had to have community trust. <eob>
And fortunately, we had built that up <eol> in years prior to Better Way. <eob>
We have a program called "Albuquerque Heading Home," <eob> a Housing First model <eol> where we house the chronically homeless, <eob> and when I told my community <eol> we wanted to do that differently, <eob> I said there's a smart way to do the right thing. <eob>
We have now housed 650 chronically homeless, <eol> medically vulnerable -- <eob> frankly, most likely to die <eol> on the streets in our city. <eob>
We commissioned our university, <eol> they studied it. <eob>
We could tell the taxpayers, <eol> we can save you 31.6 percent <eob> over the cost of leaving someone <eol> to struggle for survival on the streets. <eob>
We've now saved over five million dollars <eol> while housing 650 people. <eob>
So we had that community trust, <eob> but we had to have a little bit more <eol> of an honest conversation also <eob> as a community, <eob> because we had to get people to understand <eob> that when they hand those five <eol> dollars out the window, <eob> they might actually be minimizing <eol> their opportunity <eob> to help the person in need, and here's why: <eob> that five dollars might go to buying some fast food today -- <eob> a lot of times it goes <eol> to buying drugs and alcohol. <eob>
That same five dollars, <eob> if you gave it to one of our shelters, <eob> could feed seven people today. <eob>
And if you gave it to one of our local food <eol> banks or food pantries, <eob> we could actually feed 20 people <eol> with that money. <eob>
People ask, "Well, Albuquerque is 600,000 people — million, metro — <eob> this wouldn't work in our city, <eol> we're too big, we're too small." <eob> I disagree; if you have one panhandler <eol> on one city block, <eob> you can do this. <eob>
you can do this. <eob> If you live in a city <eol> of eight-and-half million people, <eob>
It doesn't matter what you do. <eob>
It's not the work that you do, <eol> it's the dignity of the work. <eob>
You could do anything. <eob>
So I think any city could do this. <eob>
And people say to me, <eob> "Mayor, that's just a little too simple. <eob>
It can't work that way." <eob> But I tell you what, friends: <eob> when you go to a street corner <eob> and you engage with a panhandler <eol> with dignity and respect, <eob> maybe for the first time in years, <eol> maybe in their life, <eob> and you tell them that you believe in them <eob> and that this is their city as much as it's your city, <eob> and that you actually need their help <eol> to make our place better, <eob> and you understand that this isn't the answer <eol> to all their problems, <eob> but at least it's a start, <eob> an amazing thing happens. <eob>
When they get out on the jobsite <eol> and they start working together, <eob> you start seeing amazing things happen. <eob>
They see teamwork; they see the fact <eol> that they can make a difference. <eob>
And at the end of the day, <eob> when they get back to St. <eol> Martin's in that old Dodge van, <eob> they're much more likely to sign up <eol> for whatever services they need -- <eob> substance abuse, mental health <eol> counseling, you name it. <eob>
So far <eob> with our pilot program, <eob> we've offered about 1,700 days of day work. <eob>
We've connected 216 people <eol> to permanent employment opportunities. <eob>
Twenty people actually qualified <eol> for our Housing First model, <eob> Heading Home, <eob> and they've been housed. <eob>
And over 150 people have been connected <eob> to mental health substance abuse services <eob> through There's a Better Way. <eob>
This is me just two weeks ago, <eob> at St. Martin's, <eob> doing our point-in-time survey <eob> that we do every two years. <eob>
I'm interviewing a gentleman <eol> who's homeless, like we do, <eob> getting his information, figuring out <eol> where he's from, <eob> how he got there, <eob> what we can do to help him. <eob>
And you notice he's holding the same sign <eol> that the guy was holding in 2015, <eob> same sign I walked out with here today. <eob>
So you have to ask yourself: <eol> Is it really making a difference? <eob>
Absolutely it's making a difference. <eob>
Albuquerque is now one <eol> of the national leaders <eob> in combating some <eol> of the most stubborn and persistent social issues <eob> that we have. <eob>
Combined with Albuquerque <eob> Heading Home, <eob> the Better Way program, <eob> Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered homelessness <eol> in our city <eob> by 80 percent last year. <eob>
Since I took over as mayor, <eob> we've been able to reduce <eol> the chronic homeless population in our city <eob> by 40 percent. <eob>
And by HUD's definition, <eob> we've gotten to functional zero, <eob> which means we've literally <eol> ended veteran homelessness <eob> in the city of Albuquerque, <eob> by being intentional. <eob> (Applause) <eob> So I'm happy to report that other cities <eol> are hearing about this, <eob> other mayors are calling us — <eob> Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas — <eob> and are now starting to implement programs <eob> where they bring the dignity of work to the equation. <eob>
And I can't wait to learn from them. <eob>
I can't wait to see <eol> what their experiment looks like, <eob> what their pilot project looks like, <eob> so we can start taking a collective <eol> approach nationally <eob> through the dignity of work. <eob>
And I want to commend them -- <eob> the mayors, their communities, <eol> their nonprofits -- <eob> for the work that they're doing. <eob>
So who's next? <eob> Are you and your city ready to step up? <eob>
Are you ready to think differently <eol> about these persistent social issues? <eob>
through the dignity of work. <eob> Are you ready to lift people <eol> up in your community <eob> and make your city profoundly better in many ways? <eob>
Well, if you are, my friends, I promise <eol> you there is a better way. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
I'm here to offer you a new way <eol> to think about my field, <eob> artificial intelligence. <eob>
I think the purpose of AI <eob> is to empower humans <eol> with machine intelligence. <eob>
And as machines get smarter, <eob> we get smarter. <eob>
I call this "humanistic AI" — <eob> artificial intelligence <eob> designed to meet human needs <eob> by collaborating and augmenting people. <eob>
Now, today I'm happy to see <eob> that the idea of an intelligent assistant <eob> is mainstream. <eob>
It's the well-accepted metaphor <eol> for the interface between humans and AI. <eob>
And the one I helped create <eol> is called Siri. <eob>
You know Siri. <eob> Siri is the thing that knows your intent <eob> and helps you do it for you, <eob> helps you get things done. <eob>
But what you might not know <eol> is that we designed Siri <eob> as humanistic AI, <eob> to augment people <eol> with a conversational interface <eob> that made it possible for them <eol> to use mobile computing, <eob> regardless of who they were <eol> and their abilities. <eob>
Now for most of us, <eob> the impact of this technology <eob> is to make things a little bit easier to use. <eob>
But for my friend Daniel, <eob> the impact of the AI <eol> in these systems is a life changer. <eob>
You see, Daniel <eol> is a really social guy, <eob> and he's blind and quadriplegic, <eob> which makes it hard to use those devices <eol> that we all take for granted. <eob>
The last time I was <eol> at his house, his brother said, <eob> "Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready. <eob>
He's on the phone <eol> with a woman he met online." <eob> I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?" <eob> Well, Daniel uses Siri <eol> to manage his own social life -- <eob> his email, text and phone -- <eob> without depending on his caregivers. <eob>
This is kind of interesting, right? <eob>
The irony here is great. <eob>
Here's the man whose relationship with AI <eob> helps him have relationships <eol> with genuine human beings. <eob>
And this is humanistic AI. <eob>
Another example with life-changing <eol> consequences <eob> is diagnosing cancer. <eob>
When a doctor suspects cancer, <eob> they take a sample and send it <eol> to a pathologist, <eob> who looks at it under a microscope. <eob>
Now, pathologists look at hundreds of slides <eob> and millions of cells every day. <eob>
So to support this task, <eob> some researchers made an AI classifier. <eob>
Now, the classifier says, "Is this cancer <eol> or is this not cancer?" <eob> looking at the pictures. <eob>
The classifier was pretty good, <eob> but not as good as the person, <eob> who got it right most of the time. <eob>
But when they combine the ability <eol> of the machine and the human together, <eob> accuracy went to 99.5 percent. <eob>
Adding that AI to a partnership <eol> eliminated 85 percent of the errors <eob> that the human pathologist <eol> would have made working alone. <eob>
That's a lot of cancer that would have <eol> otherwise gone untreated. <eob>
Now, for the curious, it turns out <eob> that the human was better <eol> at rejecting false positives, <eob> and the machine was better at recognizing <eol> those hard-to-spot cases. <eob>
But the lesson here isn't <eol> about which agent is better <eob> at this image-classification task. <eob>
Those things are changing every day. <eob>
The lesson here <eob> is that by combining the abilities <eol> of the human and machine, <eob> it created a partnership <eol> that had superhuman performance. <eob>
And that is humanistic AI. <eob>
Now let's look at another example <eob> with turbocharging performance. <eob> This is design. <eob> Now, let's say you're an engineer. <eob>
You want to design <eol> a new frame for a drone. <eob>
You get out your favorite <eol> software tools, CAD tools, <eob> and you enter the form and the materials, <eol> and then you analyze performance. <eob>
That gives you one design. <eob>
If you give those same tools to an AI, <eob> it can generate thousands of designs. <eob>
This video by Autodesk is amazing. <eob>
This is real stuff. <eob>
So this transforms how we do design. <eob>
The human engineer now <eob> says what the design should achieve, <eob> and the machine says, <eob> "Here's the possibilities." <eob> Now in her job, the engineer's job <eob> is to pick the one that best meets <eol> the goals of the design, <eob> which she knows as a human better than anyone else, <eob> using human judgment and expertise. <eob>
In this case, the winning form <eob> looks kind of like something <eol> nature would have designed, <eob> minus a few million years of evolution <eob> and all that unnecessary fur. <eob>
Now let's see where this idea of humanistic <eol> AI might lead us <eob> if we follow it into the speculative beyond. <eob>
What's a kind of augmentation <eol> that we would all like to have? <eob>
Well, how about cognitive enhancement? <eob>
Instead of asking, <eob> "How smart can we make our machines?" <eob> let's ask <eob> "How smart can our machines make us?" <eob> I mean, take memory for example. <eob>
Memory is the foundation <eol> of human intelligence. <eob>
But human memory is famously flawed. <eob>
We're great at telling stories, <eob> but not getting the details right. <eob>
And our memories -- they decay over time. <eob>
I mean, like, where did the '60s go, <eol> and can I go there, too? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But what if you could have a memory that <eol> was as good as computer memory, <eob> and was about your life? <eob>
What if you could remember <eol> every person you ever met, <eob> how to pronounce their name, <eob> their family details, their favorite sports, <eob> the last conversation you had with them? <eob>
If you had this memory all your life, <eob> you could have the AI look <eol> at all the interactions <eob> you had with people over time <eob> and help you reflect <eol> on the long arc of your relationships. <eob>
What if you could have the AI read <eol> everything you've ever read <eob> and listen to every song <eol> you've ever heard? <eob>
From the tiniest clue, <eol> it could help you retrieve <eob> anything you've ever seen <eol> or heard before. <eob>
Imagine what that would do <eol> for the ability to make new connections <eob> and form new ideas. <eob>
And what about our bodies? <eob> What if we could remember <eol> the consequences of every food we eat, <eob> every pill we take, <eob> every all-nighter we pull? <eob>
We could do our own science on our own data <eob> about what makes us feel <eol> good and stay healthy. <eob>
And imagine how this could revolutionize <eob> the way we manage allergies <eol> and chronic disease. <eob>
I believe that AI will make personal <eol> memory enhancement a reality. <eob>
I can't say when or what form factors are involved, <eob> but I think it's inevitable, <eob> because the very things <eol> that make AI successful today -- <eob> the availability of comprehensive data <eob> and the ability for machines <eol> to make sense of that data -- <eob> can be applied to the data of our lives. <eob>
And those data are here today, <eol> available for all of us, <eob> because we lead digitally mediated lives, <eob> in mobile and online. <eob>
In my view, a personal memory <eol> is a private memory. <eob>
We get to choose what is and <eol> is not recalled and retained. <eob>
It's absolutely essential <eol> that this be kept very secure. <eob>
Now for most of us, <eob> the impact of augmented personal memory <eob> will be a more improved mental gain, <eob> maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace. <eob>
But for the millions who suffer <eol> from Alzheimer's and dementia, <eob> the difference that augmented <eol> memory could make <eob> is a difference between a life of isolation <eob> and a life of dignity and connection. <eob>
We are in the middle of a renaissance in <eob> artificial intelligence <eob> right now. <eob> I mean, in just the past few years, <eob> we're beginning to see solutions <eol> to AI problems <eob> that we have struggled <eol> with literally for decades: <eob> speech understanding, text understanding, <eob> image understanding. <eob>
We have a choice in how we use <eol> this powerful technology. <eob> We can choose to use AI to automate <eol> and compete with us, <eob> or we can use AI to augment <eol> and collaborate with us, <eob> to overcome our cognitive limitations <eob> and to help us do what we want to do, <eob> only better. <eob>
we get smarter. <eob> And as we discover new ways <eol> to give machines intelligence, <eob> we can distribute <eol> that intelligence <eob> to all of the AI assistants in the world, <eob> and therefore to every person, <eol> regardless of circumstance. <eob> And that is why, <eob> every time a machine gets smarter, <eob>
That is an AI worth spreading. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here's an intriguing fact. <eob> In the developed world, <eob> everywhere, women live an average <eol> of six to eight years longer than men do. <eob>
Six to eight years longer. <eob>
That's, like, a huge gap. <eob>
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article <eob> showing that men in rich countries <eob> are twice as likely to die as women are <eob> at any age. <eob>
But there is one place in the world <eob> where men live as long as women. <eob>
It's a remote, mountainous zone, <eob> a blue zone, <eob> where super longevity <eob> is common to both sexes. <eob>
This is the blue zone in Sardinia, <eob> an Italian island in the Mediterranean, <eob> between Corsica and Tunisia, <eob> where there are six times <eol> as many centenarians <eob> as on the Italian mainland, <eob> less than 200 miles away. <eob>
There are 10 times as many centenarians <eob> as there are in North America. <eob>
It's the only place <eob> where men live as long as women. <eob>
But why? <eob> My curiosity was piqued. <eob>
I decided to research the science <eol> and the habits of the place, <eob> and I started with the genetic profile. <eob>
I discovered soon enough <eob> that genes account for just 25 <eol> percent of their longevity. <eob>
The other 75 percent is lifestyle. <eob>
So what does it take to live <eol> to 100 or beyond? <eob> What are they doing right? <eob>
What you're looking at <eol> is an aerial view of Villagrande. <eob>
It's a village <eol> at the epicenter of the blue zone <eob> where I went to investigate this, <eob> and as you can see, architectural beauty <eol> is not its main virtue, <eob> density is: <eob> tightly spaced houses, <eob> interwoven alleys and streets. <eob>
It means that the villagers' lives <eol> constantly intersect. <eob>
And as I walked through the village, <eob> I could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes <eol> watching me <eob> from behind doorways and curtains, <eob> from behind shutters. <eob>
Because like all ancient villages, <eob> Villagrande couldn't have survived <eob> without this structure, without its walls, <eol> without its cathedral, <eob> without its village square, <eob> because defense and social cohesion <eol> defined its design. <eob>
Urban priorities changed as we moved <eol> towards the industrial revolution <eob> because infectious disease <eol> became the risk of the day. <eob> But what about now? <eob> Now, social isolation is the public <eol> health risk of our time. <eob>
Now, a third of the population says <eob> they have two or fewer people to lean on. <eob>
But let's go to Villagrande now as a contrast <eob> to meet some centenarians. <eob>
Meet Giuseppe Murinu. He's 102, a supercentenarian <eob> and a lifelong resident <eol> of the village of Villagrande. <eob>
He was a gregarious man. <eob>
He loved to recount stories <eob> such as how he lived like a bird <eob> from what he could find on the forest floor <eob> during not one but two world wars, <eob> how he and his wife, <eol> who also lived past 100, <eob> raised six children <eol> in a small, homey kitchen <eob> where I interviewed him. <eob>
Here he is with his sons <eol> Angelo and Domenico, <eob> both in their 70s and looking <eol> after their father, <eob> and who were quite frankly <eol> very suspicious of me and my daughter <eob> who came along with me <eol> on this research trip, <eob> because the flip side of social cohesion <eob> is a wariness of strangers <eol> and outsiders. <eob>
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. <eob>
He was a happy-go-lucky guy, <eob> very outgoing with a positive outlook. <eob>
And I wondered: so is that what it takes <eol> to live to be 100 or beyond, <eob> thinking positively? <eob> Actually, no. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, <eob> the grumpiest person I have ever met. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he put a lie to the notion <eob> that you have to be positive <eol> to live a long life. <eob>
And there is evidence for this. <eob>
When I asked him why he lived so long, <eob> he kind of looked at me <eol> under hooded eyelids and he growled, <eob> "Nobody has to know <eol> my secrets." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But despite being a sourpuss, <eob> the niece who lived with him <eol> and looked after him <eob> called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." <eob> And she respected him <eol> and loved him, <eob> and she told me, when I questioned <eol> this obvious loss of her freedom, <eob> "You just don't understand, do you? <eob>
Looking after this man is a pleasure. <eob>
It's a huge privilege for me. <eob>
This is my heritage." <eob> And indeed, wherever I went <eol> to interview these centenarians, <eob> I found a kitchen party. <eob>
Here's Giovanni <eol> with his two nieces, <eob> Maria above him <eob> and beside him his great-niece Sara, <eob> who came when I was there <eol> to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. <eob>
And I quickly discovered by being there <eob> that in the blue zone, as people age, <eob> and indeed across their lifespans, <eob> they're always surrounded <eol> by extended family, by friends, <eob> by neighbors, the priest, the barkeeper, the grocer. <eob>
People are always there or dropping by. <eob>
They are never left <eol> to live solitary lives. <eob>
This is unlike the rest of the developed world, <eob> where as George Burns quipped, <eob> "Happiness is having a large, <eol> loving, caring family in another city." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, so far we've only met men, <eob> long-living men, but I met women too, <eob> and here you see Zia Teresa. <eob> She, at over 100, taught me <eol> how to make the local specialty, <eob> which is called culurgiones, <eob> which are these large pasta pockets <eob> like ravioli about this size, <eob> this size, <eob> and they're filled with high-fat ricotta and mint <eob> and drenched in tomato sauce. <eob>
And she showed me how to make <eol> just the right crimp <eob> so they wouldn't open, <eob> and she makes them with her daughters every Sunday <eob> and distributes them by the dozens <eol> to neighbors and friends. <eob>
And that's when I discovered <eol> a low-fat, gluten-free diet <eob> is not what it takes to live <eol> to 100 in the blue zone. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, these centenarians' stories along <eol> with the science that underpins them <eob> prompted me to ask myself <eol> some questions too, <eob> such as, when am I going to die and how can I put that day off? <eob>
And as you will see, <eol> the answer is not what we expect. <eob>
Julianne Holt-Lunstad <eol> is a researcher at Brigham Young University <eob> and she addressed this very question <eob> in a series of studies <eob> of tens of thousands of middle aged people <eob> much like this audience here. <eob>
And she looked at every aspect <eol> of their lifestyle: <eob> their diet, their exercise, <eob> their marital status, <eob> how often they went to the doctor, <eob> whether they smoked or drank, etc. <eob> She recorded all of this <eob> and then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years <eob> to see who would still be breathing. <eob>
And of the people left standing, <eob> what reduced their chances <eol> of dying the most? <eob> That was her question. <eob>
So let's now look at her data <eol> in summary, <eob> going from the least powerful <eol> predictor to the strongest. <eob> OK? <eob> So clean air, which is great, <eob> it doesn't predict how long <eol> you will live. <eob>
Whether you have your hypertension treated <eob> is good. <eob>
Still not a strong predictor. <eob>
Whether you're lean or overweight, <eol> you can stop feeling guilty about this, <eob> because it's only in third place. <eob>
How much exercise you get is next, <eob> still only a moderate predictor. <eob>
Whether you've had a cardiac event <eol> and you're in rehab and exercising, <eob> getting higher now. <eob>
Whether you've had a flu vaccine. <eob>
Did anybody here know <eob> that having a flu vaccine protects you <eol> more than doing exercise? <eob>
Whether you were drinking and quit, <eob> or whether you're <eol> a moderate drinker, <eob> whether you don't smoke, <eol> or if you did, whether you quit, <eob> and getting towards the top predictors <eob> are two features <eol> of your social life. <eob>
First, your close relationships. <eob>
These are the people <eol> that you can call on for a loan <eob> if you need money suddenly, <eob> who will call the doctor <eol> if you're not feeling well <eob> or who will take you to the hospital, <eob> or who will sit with you if you're having <eol> an existential crisis, <eob> if you're in despair. <eob>
Those people, that little clutch of people <eob> are a strong predictor, <eol> if you have them, of how long you'll live. <eob>
And then something that surprised me, <eob> something that's called <eol> social integration. <eob>
This means how much you interact with people <eob> as you move through your day. <eob>
How many people do you talk to? <eob>
And these mean both your weak <eol> and your strong bonds, <eob> so not just the people <eol> you're really close to, <eob> who mean a lot to you, <eob> but, like, do you talk to the guy <eol> who every day makes you your coffee? <eob> Do you talk to the postman? <eob>
Do you talk to the woman who walks <eol> by your house every day with her dog? <eob> Do you play bridge or poker, <eol> have a book club? <eob>
Those interactions are one <eol> of the strongest predictors <eob> of how long you'll live. <eob>
Now, this leads me to the next question: <eob> if we now spend more time online <eol> than on any other activity, <eob> including sleeping, <eob> we're now up to 11 hours a day, <eob> one hour more than last year, by the way, <eob> does it make a difference? <eob>
Why distinguish between interacting in person <eob> and interacting via social media? <eob>
Is it the same thing as being there <eob> if you're in contact constantly <eol> with your kids through text, for example? <eob>
Well, the short answer <eol> to the question is no, <eob> it's not the same thing. <eob>
Face-to-face contact releases <eol> a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, <eob> and like a vaccine, they protect <eol> you now in the present <eob> and well into the future. <eob>
So simply making eye contact with somebody, <eob> shaking hands, <eol> giving somebody a high-five <eob> is enough to release oxytocin, <eob> which increases your level of trust <eob> and it lowers your cortisol levels. <eob>
So it lowers your stress. <eob>
And dopamine is generated, <eol> which gives us a little high <eob> and it kills pain. <eob>
It's like a naturally produced morphine. <eob>
Now, all of this passes <eol> under our conscious radar, <eob> which is why we conflate online activity <eol> with the real thing. <eob>
But we do have evidence now, fresh evidence, <eob> that there is a difference. <eob>
So let's look at some of the neuroscience. <eob>
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist <eol> at the University of Maryland, <eob> tried to map the difference <eob> between what goes on in our brains <eol> when we interact in person <eob> versus when we're watching <eol> something that's static. <eob>
And what she did was she <eol> compared the brain function <eob> of two groups of people, <eob> those interacting live with her <eob> or with one of her research associates <eob> in a dynamic conversation, <eob> and she compared that to the brain <eol> activity of people <eob> who were watching her talk <eol> about the same subject <eob> but in a canned video, like on YouTube. <eob>
And by the way, if you want to know <eob> how she fit two people in <eol> an MRI scanner at the same time, <eob> talk to me later. <eob>
So what's the difference? <eob> This is your brain <eol> on real social interaction. <eob>
What you're seeing <eol> is the difference in brain activity <eob> between interacting <eol> in person and taking in static content. <eob>
In orange, you see the brain areas <eol> that are associated with attention, <eob> social intelligence -- <eob> that means anticipating <eol> what somebody else is thinking <eob> and feeling and planning -- <eob> and emotional reward. <eob>
And these areas become much more engaged <eob> when we're interacting <eol> with a live partner. <eob>
Now, these richer brain signatures <eob> might be why recruiters <eol> from Fortune 500 companies <eob> evaluating candidates <eob> thought that the candidates were smarter <eob> when they heard their voices <eob> compared to when they just read <eol> their pitches in a text, for example, <eob> or an email or a letter. <eob>
Now, our voices and body language <eol> convey a rich signal. <eob>
It shows that we're thinking, feeling, <eob> sentient human beings <eob> who are much more than an algorithm. <eob>
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley <eob> at the University of Chicago Business School <eob> is quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing. <eob>
If somebody hears your voice, <eob> they think you're smarter. <eob>
I mean, that's quite a simple thing. <eob>
Now, to return to the beginning, <eob> why do women live longer than men? <eob>
And one major reason is that women <eol> are more likely <eob> to prioritize and groom their face-to-face relationships <eob> over their lifespans. <eob>
Fresh evidence shows <eob> that these in-person friendships <eob> create a biological force <eol> field against disease and decline. <eob>
And it's not just true of humans <eob> but their primate relations, <eol> our primate relations as well. <eob>
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work <eol> shows that female baboons <eob> who have a core of female friends <eob> show lower levels of stress <eol> via their cortisol levels, <eob> they live longer and they have more <eol> surviving offspring. <eob>
At least three stable relationships. <eob>
That was the magic number. <eob> Think about it. <eob> I hope you guys have three. <eob>
The power of such face-to-face contact <eob> is really why there are <eol> the lowest rates of dementia <eob> among people who are socially engaged. <eob>
It's why women who have breast cancer <eob> are four times more likely <eol> to survive their disease than loners are. <eob>
Why men who've had a stroke <eol> who meet regularly to play poker <eob> or to have coffee <eob> or to play old-timer's hockey — <eob> I'm Canadian, after all — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
are better protected <eol> by that social contact <eob> than they are by medication. <eob>
Why men who've had a stroke <eol> who meet regularly -- <eob> this is something very powerful <eol> they can do. <eob>
This face-to-face contact <eol> provides stunning benefits, <eob> yet now almost a quarter of the population <eol> says they have no one to talk to. <eob>
We can do something about this. <eob>
Like Sardinian villagers, <eob> it's a biological imperative <eol> to know we belong, <eob> and not just the women among us. <eob>
Building in-person interaction <eol> into our cities, into our workplaces, <eob> into our agendas <eob> bolsters the immune system, <eob> sends feel-good hormones <eol> surging through the bloodstream and brain <eob> and helps us live longer. <eob>
I call this building your village, <eob> and building it and sustaining it <eol> is a matter of life and death. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Helen Walters: Susan, come back. <eob>
I have a question for you. <eob>
I'm wondering if there's a middle path. <eob>
So you talk about the neurotransmitters <eol> connecting when in face-to-face, <eob> but what about digital technology? <eob>
We've seen enormous improvements <eol> in digital technology <eob> like FaceTime, things like that. <eob> Does that work too? <eob>
I mean, I see my nephew. <eob>
He plays Minecraft and he's yelling <eol> at his friends. <eob>
It seems like he's connecting pretty well. <eob> Is that useful? Is that helpful? <eob>
Susan Pinker: Some of the data <eol> are just emerging. <eob>
The data are so fresh <eol> that the digital revolution happened <eob> and the health data trailed behind. <eob>
So we're just learning, <eob> but I would say there are some improvements <eob> that we could make in the technology. <eob>
For example, the camera <eol> on your laptop is at the top of the screen, <eob> so for example, when <eol> you're looking into the screen, <eob> you're not actually making eye contact. <eob>
So something as simple <eol> as even just looking into the camera <eob> can increase those neurotransmitters, <eob> or maybe changing the position of the camera. <eob>
So it's not identical, but I think we are getting <eol> closer with the technology. <eob>
HW: Great. <eob> Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
SP: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What's one thing that every person <eol> in this room is going to become? <eob> Older. <eob> And most of us are scared <eol> stiff at the prospect. <eob>
How does that word make you feel? <eob>
I used to feel the same way. <eob>
What was I most worried about? <eob>
Ending up drooling <eol> in some grim institutional hallway. <eob>
And then I learned <eol> that only four percent of older Americans <eob> are living in nursing homes, <eob> and the percentage is dropping. <eob>
What else was I worried about? <eob> Dementia. <eob> Turns out that most of us <eol> can think just fine to the end. <eob>
Dementia rates are dropping, too. <eob>
The real epidemic is anxiety <eol> over memory loss. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I also figured that old people were depressed <eob> because they were old <eol> and they were going to die soon. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It turns out that the longer people live, <eob> the less they fear dying, <eob> and that people are happiest at the beginnings <eol> and the end of their lives. <eob>
It's called the U-curve of happiness, <eob> and it's been borne out by dozens of studies <eol> around the world. <eob>
You don't have to be a Buddhist <eol> or a billionaire. <eob>
The curve is a function of the way <eol> aging itself affects the brain. <eob>
So I started feeling a lot better <eol> about getting older, <eob> and I started obsessing about why so few people know these things. <eob>
The reason is ageism: <eob> discrimination and stereotyping <eol> on the basis of age. <eob>
We experience it anytime someone assumes <eol> we're too old for something, <eob> instead of finding out who we are <eol> and what we're capable of, <eob> or too young. <eob>
Ageism cuts both ways. <eob>
All -isms are socially <eol> constructed ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia -- <eob> and that means we make them up, <eob> and they can change over time. <eob>
All these prejudices pit us <eol> against each other <eob> to maintain the status quo, <eob> like auto workers in the US competing <eol> against auto workers in Mexico <eob> instead of organizing <eol> for better wages. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We know it's not OK to allocate resources <eol> by race or by sex. <eob>
Why should it be OK to weigh the needs <eol> of the young against the old? <eob>
All prejudice relies on "othering" -- <eol> seeing a group of people <eob> as other than ourselves: <eob> other race, other religion, other nationality. <eob>
The strange thing about ageism: <eob> that other is us. <eob>
Ageism feeds on denial -- <eol> our reluctance to acknowledge <eob> that we are going to become that older person. <eob>
It's denial <eol> when we try to pass for younger <eob> or when we believe <eol> in anti-aging products, <eob> or when we feel like our bodies <eol> are betraying us, <eob> simply because they are changing. <eob>
Why on earth do we stop celebrating <eol> the ability to adapt and grow <eob> as we move through life? <eob>
Why should aging well mean <eol> struggling to look and move <eob> like younger versions of ourselves? <eob>
It's embarrassing to be called out as older <eob> until we quit being embarrassed about it, <eob> and it's not healthy to go through life <eol> dreading our futures. <eob>
The sooner we get off this <eol> hamster wheel of age denial, <eob> the better off we are. <eob>
Stereotypes are always a mistake, of course, <eob> but especially when it comes to age, <eob> because the longer we live, <eob> the more different from one another we become. <eob> Right? Think about it. <eob> And yet, we tend to think <eol> of everyone in a retirement home <eob> as the same age: old -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
when they can span four decades. <eob>
Can you imagine thinking <eol> that way about a group of people <eob> between the ages of 20 and 60? <eob>
When you get to a party, do you head <eol> for people your own age? <eob>
Have you ever grumbled <eol> about entitled millennials? <eob>
Have you ever rejected a haircut <eol> or a relationship or an outing <eob> because it's not age-appropriate? <eob>
For adults, there's no such thing. <eob>
All these behaviors are ageist. <eob>
We all do them, <eob> and we can't challenge bias unless <eol> we're aware of it. <eob>
Nobody's born ageist, <eob> but it starts at early childhood, <eob> around the same time attitudes <eol> towards race and gender start to form, <eob> because negative messages about late life bombard us <eob> from the media and popular culture at every turn. <eob> Right? Wrinkles are ugly. <eob> Old people are pathetic. <eob>
It's sad to be old. <eob>
Look at Hollywood. <eob> A survey of recent Best Picture nominations <eob> found that only 12 percent <eol> of speaking or named characters <eob> were age 60 and up, <eob> and many of them were portrayed <eol> as impaired. <eob>
Older people can be <eol> the most ageist of all, <eob> because we've had a lifetime <eol> to internalize these messages <eob> and we've never thought <eol> to challenge them. <eob>
I had to acknowledge it <eob> and stop colluding. <eob> "Senior moment" quips, for example: <eob> I stopped making them when it dawned on me <eob> that when I lost the car keys <eol> in high school, <eob> I didn't call it a "junior moment." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I stopped blaming my sore knee <eol> on being 64. <eob>
My other knee doesn't hurt, <eob> and it's just as old. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We are all worried about some aspect <eol> of getting older, <eob> whether running out of money, <eob> getting sick, ending up alone, <eob> and those fears are legitimate <eol> and real. <eob>
But what never dawns on most of us <eob> is that the experience <eol> of reaching old age <eob> can be better or worse depending on the culture <eob> in which it takes place. <eob>
It is not having a vagina <eol> that makes life harder for women. <eob> It's sexism. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's not loving a man <eol> that makes life harder for gay guys. <eob> It's homophobia. <eob> And it is not the passage of time <eol> that makes getting older <eob> so much harder than it has to be. <eob> It is ageism. <eob> When labels are hard to read <eob> or there's no handrail <eob> or we can't open the damn jar, <eob> we blame ourselves, <eob> our failure to age successfully, <eob> instead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful <eob> and the discrimination <eol> that makes those barriers acceptable. <eob>
You can't make money off satisfaction, <eob> but shame and fear create markets, <eob> and capitalism always needs new markets. <eob>
Who says wrinkles are ugly? <eob>
The multi-billion-dollar <eol> skin care industry. <eob>
Who says perimenopause <eol> and low T and mild cognitive impairment <eob> are medical conditions? <eob>
The trillion-dollar <eol> pharmaceutical industry. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
The more clearly we see these forces at work, <eob> the easier it is to come up <eol> with alternative, more positive <eob> and more accurate narratives. <eob>
Aging is not a problem to be fixed <eol> or a disease to be cured. <eob>
It is a natural, powerful, lifelong process <eol> that unites us all. <eob>
Changing the culture is a tall order, <eol> I know that, but culture is fluid. <eob>
Look at how much the position of women <eol> has changed in my lifetime <eob> or the incredible strides <eol> that the gay rights movement <eob> has made in just a few decades, right? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Look at gender. <eob> We used to think of it as a binary, <eol> male or female, <eob> and now we understand <eol> it's a spectrum. <eob>
It is high time <eol> to ditch the old-young binary, too. <eob>
There is no line in the sand <eol> between old and young, <eob> after which it's all downhill. <eob>
And the longer we wait <eol> to challenge that idea, <eob> the more damage it does <eol> to ourselves and our place in the world, <eob> like in the workforce, <eol> where age discrimination is rampant. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, engineers are getting <eol> Botoxed and hair-plugged <eob> before key interviews -- <eob> and these are skilled white men in their 30s, <eob> so imagine the effects further down the food chain. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The personal and economic consequences <eol> are devastating. <eob>
Not one stereotype about older workers <eol> holds up under scrutiny. <eob>
Companies aren't adaptable <eol> and creative because their employees are young; <eob> they're adaptable and creative despite it. <eob> Companies -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We know that diverse companies aren't just better <eol> places to work; <eob> they work better. <eob>
And just like race and sex, age <eol> is a criterion for diversity. <eob>
A growing body of fascinating research <eob> shows that attitudes towards aging <eob> affect how our minds <eol> and bodies function at the cellular level. <eob>
When we talk to older people like <eol> this (Speaks more loudly) <eob> or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" -- <eob> it's called elderspeak -- <eob> they appear to instantly age, <eob> walking and talking less competently. <eob>
People with more positive <eol> feelings towards aging <eob> walk faster, <eob> they do better on memory tests, <eob> they heal quicker, and they live longer. <eob>
Even with brains full of <eol> plaques and tangles, <eob> some people stayed sharp to the end. <eob>
What did they have in common? <eob>
A sense of purpose. <eob>
And what's the biggest obstacle to having <eol> a sense of purpose in late life? <eob>
A culture that tells us that getting <eol> older means shuffling offstage. <eob>
That's why the World Health Organization <eol> is developing <eob> a global anti-ageism initiative <eob> to extend not just life span <eol> but health span. <eob>
Women experience the double whammy <eob> of ageism and sexism, <eob> so we experience aging differently. <eob>
There's a double standard <eol> at work here -- shocker -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
the notion that aging enhances <eol> men and devalues women. <eob>
Women reinforce this double standard <eol> when we compete to stay young, <eob> another punishing and losing proposition. <eob>
Does any woman in this room really believe <eob> that she is a lesser version -- <eob> less interesting, less fun in bed, <eol> less valuable -- <eob> than the woman she once was? <eob>
This discrimination affects our health, <eob> our well-being and our income, <eob> and the effects add up over time. <eob>
They are further compounded <eol> by race and by class, <eob> which is why, everywhere in the world, <eob> the poorest of the poor <eol> are old women of color. <eob>
What's the takeaway from that map? <eob>
By 2050, one out of five of us, <eob> almost two billion people, <eob> will be age 60 and up. <eob>
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark <eol> of human progress. <eob>
All these older people represent <eol> a vast unprecedented and untapped market. <eob>
And yet, capitalism and urbanization <eol> have propelled age bias <eob> into every corner of the globe, <eob> from Switzerland, where elders <eol> fare the best, <eob> to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom <eol> of the Global AgeWatch Index. <eob>
Half of the world's countries <eol> aren't mentioned on that list <eob> because we don't bother to collect data <eol> on millions of people <eob> because they're no longer young. <eob>
Almost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world <eob> say they have trouble <eol> accessing healthcare. <eob>
Almost three-quarters say <eol> their income doesn't cover basic services <eob> like food, water, electricity, <eol> and decent housing. <eob>
Is this the world we want our children, <eol> who may well live to be a hundred, <eob> to inherit? <eob>
Everyone -- all ages, all genders, <eol> all nationalities -- <eob> is old or future-old, <eob> and unless we put an end to it, ageism <eol> will oppress us all. <eob>
And that makes it a perfect target <eol> for collective advocacy. <eob>
Why add another -ism to the list <eol> when so many, racism in particular, <eob> call out for action? <eob>
Here's the thing: <eob> we don't have to choose. <eob>
When we make the world <eol> a better place to grow old in, <eob> we make it a better place <eol> in which to be from somewhere else, <eob> to have a disability, <eob> to be queer, to be non-rich, <eol> to be non-white. <eob>
And when we show up at all ages <eol> for whatever cause matters most to us -- <eob> save the whales, save the democracy -- <eob> we not only make that effort more effective, <eob> we dismantle ageism in the process. <eob>
Longevity is here to stay. <eob> A movement to end ageism is underway. <eob>
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me. <eob>
(Applause and cheers) <eob>
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it! <eob>
The philosopher Plato once said, <eob> "Music gives a soul to the universe, <eob> wings to the mind, <eob> flight to the imagination <eob> and life to everything." <eob> Music has always been <eol> a big part of my life. <eob>
To create and to perform music <eob> connects you to people <eol> countries and lifetimes away. <eob>
It connects you to the people <eol> you're playing with, <eob> to your audience <eob> and to yourself. <eob>
When I'm happy, when I'm sad, <eob> when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, <eob> I listen to and I create music. <eob>
When I was younger, I played piano; <eob> later, I took up guitar. <eob>
And as I started high school, <eob> music became a part of my identity. <eob>
I was in every band, <eob> I was involved <eol> with every musical fine arts event. <eob> Music surrounded me. <eob> It made me who I was, <eob> and it gave me a place to belong. <eob>
Now, I've always had this thing <eol> with rhythms. <eob>
I remember being young, <eob> I would walk down <eol> the hallways of my school <eob> and I would tap rhythms <eol> to myself on my leg with my hands, <eob> or tapping my teeth. <eob>
It was a nervous habit, <eob> and I was always nervous. <eob>
I think I liked the repetition <eol> of the rhythm -- <eob> it was calming. <eob>
Then in high school, <eob> I started music theory, <eob> and it was the best class I've ever taken. <eob>
We were learning about music -- <eob> things I didn't know, <eol> like theory and history. <eob>
It was a class where we basically <eol> just listened to a song, <eob> talked about what it meant to us <eob> and analyzed it, <eob> and figured out <eol> what made it tick. <eob>
Every Wednesday, we did something <eol> called "rhythmic dictation," <eob> and I was pretty good at it. <eob>
Our teacher would give us <eol> an amount of measures <eob> and a time signature, <eob> and then he would speak <eol> a rhythm to us <eob> and we would have to write it down <eol> with the proper rests and notes. <eob>
Like this: <eob> ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta, <eob> ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a. <eob> And I loved it. <eob> The simplicity of the rhythm -- <eob> a basic two- to four- measure line -- <eob> and yet each of them almost told a story, <eob> like they had so much potential, <eob> and all you had to do was add a melody. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
Rhythms set a foundation <eol> for melodies and harmonies to play on top of. <eob>
It gives structure and stability. <eob>
Now, music has these parts -- <eob> rhythm, melody and harmony -- <eob> just like our lives. <eob>
Where music has rhythm, <eob> we have routines and habits -- <eob> things that help us to remember <eol> what to do and to stay on track, <eob> and to just keep going. <eob>
And you may not notice it, <eob> but it's always there. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
And it may seem simple, <eob> it may seem dull by itself, <eob> but it gives tempo and heartbeat. <eob>
And then things in your life add on to it, <eob> giving texture -- <eob> that's your friends and your family, <eob> and anything that creates a harmonic <eol> structure in your life <eob> and in your song, <eob> like harmonies, <eob> cadences <eob> and anything that makes it polyphonic. <eob>
And they create beautiful <eol> chords and patterns. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
And then there's you. <eob>
You play on top of everything else, <eob> on top of the rhythms and the beat <eob> because you're the melody. <eob>
And things may change and develop, <eob> but no matter what we do, <eob> we're still the same people. <eob>
Throughout a song melodies develop, <eob> but it's still the same song. <eob>
No matter what you do, <eob> the rhythms are still there: <eob> the tempo and the heartbeat ... <eob> until I left, <eob> and I went to college <eob> and everything disappeared. <eob>
When I first arrived at university, <eob> I felt lost. <eob>
And don't get me wrong -- sometimes <eol> I loved it and it was great, <eob> but other times, <eob> I felt like I had been left alone <eob> to fend for myself. <eob>
It's like I had been taken out <eol> of my natural environment, <eob> and put somewhere new, <eob> where the rhythms <eol> and the harmonies <eob> and the form had gone away, <eob> and it was just me -- <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
silence and my melody. <eob> And even that began to waver, <eob> because I didn't know what I was doing. <eob>
I didn't have any <eol> chords to structure myself, <eob> or a rhythm <eob> or a beat to know the tempo. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
And then I began to hear <eol> all these other sounds. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
And they were off-time <eob> and off-key. <eob>
And the more I was around them, <eob> the more my melody started <eol> to sound like theirs. <eob>
And slowly I began to lose myself, <eob> like I was being washed away. <eob>
But then the next moment -- <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
I could hear it. <eob> And I could feel it. <eob> And it was me. <eob> And I was here. <eob> And it was different, <eob> but not worse off. <eob>
Just changed a little. <eob>
Music is my way of coping <eol> with the changes in my life. <eob>
There's a beautiful connection <eol> between music and life. <eob>
It can bind us to reality <eob> at the same time it allows us <eol> to escape it. <eob>
Music is something <eol> that lives inside of you. <eob>
You create it and you're created by it. <eob>
Our lives are not only conducted by music, <eob> they're also composed of it. <eob>
So this may seem like a bit of a stretch, <eob> but hear me out: <eob> music is a fundamental part of what we are <eob> and of everything around us. <eob>
Now, music is my passion, <eob> but physics also used to be <eol> an interest of mine. <eob>
And the more I learned, <eob> the more I saw connections <eol> between the two -- <eob> especially regarding string theory. <eob>
I know this is only one of many theories, <eob> but it spoke to me. <eob>
So, one aspect of string theory, <eol> at its simplest form, is this: <eob> matter is made up of atoms, <eob> which are made up of protons <eol> and neutrons and electrons, <eob> which are made up of quark. <eob>
And here's where the string part comes in. <eob>
This quark is supposedly <eol> made up of little coiled strings, <eob> and it's the vibrations of these strings <eol> that make everything what it is. <eob>
Michio Kaku once explained this <eob> in a lecture called, <eol> "The Universe in a Nutshell," <eob> where he says, <eob> "String theory is the simple idea <eob> that the four forces of the universe -- <eob> gravity, the electromagnetic force, <eol> and the two strong forces -- <eob> can be viewed as music. <eob>
The music of tiny little rubber bands." <eob> In this lecture, he goes on <eol> to explain physics <eob> as the laws of harmony <eol> between these strings; <eob> chemistry, as the melodies <eol> you can play on these strings; <eob> and he states that the universe <eol> is a "symphony of strings." <eob> These strings dictate the universe; <eob> they make up everything we see <eol> and everything we know. <eob>
They're musical notes, <eob> but they make us what we are <eol> and they hold us together. <eob>
So you see, <eob> everything is music. <eob>
(Guitar) <eob>
When I look at the world, <eob> I see music all around us. <eob>
When I look at myself, <eob> I see music. <eob>
And my life has been defined by music. <eob>
I found myself through music. <eob>
Music is everywhere, <eob> and it is in everything. <eob>
And it changes and it builds <eob> and it diminishes. <eob>
But it's always there, <eob> supporting us, <eob> connecting us to each other <eob> and showing us the beauty of the universe. <eob>
So if you ever feel lost, <eob> stop and listen for your song. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Algorithms are everywhere. <eob> They sort and separate the winners <eol> from the losers. <eob>
The winners get the job <eob> or a good credit card offer. <eob>
The losers don't even get an interview <eob> or they pay more for insurance. <eob>
We're being scored with secret formulas <eol> that we don't understand <eob> that often don't have systems of appeal. <eob>
That begs the question: <eob> What if the algorithms are wrong? <eob>
To build an algorithm you need two things: <eob> you need data, what happened <eol> in the past, <eob> and a definition of success, <eob> the thing you're looking <eol> for and often hoping for. <eob>
You train an algorithm by looking, figuring out. <eob> The algorithm figures <eol> out what is associated with success. <eob> What situation leads to success? <eob>
Actually, everyone uses algorithms. <eob>
They just don't formalize them <eol> in written code. <eob>
Let me give you an example. <eob> I use an algorithm every day <eol> to make a meal for my family. <eob>
The data I use <eob> is the ingredients in my kitchen, <eob> the time I have, <eob> the ambition I have, <eob> and I curate that data. <eob>
I don't count those little packages <eol> of ramen noodles as food. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
My definition of success is: <eob> a meal is successful if my kids <eol> eat vegetables. <eob>
It's very different from if my youngest son <eol> were in charge. <eob>
He'd say success is if he gets <eol> to eat lots of Nutella. <eob>
But I get to choose success. <eob>
I am in charge. My opinion matters. <eob> That's the first rule of algorithms. <eob>
Algorithms are opinions embedded in code. <eob>
It's really different from what you think <eol> most people think of algorithms. <eob>
They think algorithms are objective <eol> and true and scientific. <eob>
That's a marketing trick. <eob>
It's also a marketing trick <eob> to intimidate you with algorithms, <eob> to make you trust and fear algorithms <eob> because you trust and fear mathematics. <eob>
A lot can go wrong <eol> when we put blind faith in big data. <eob>
This is Kiri Soares. She's a high school principal in Brooklyn. <eob>
In 2011, she told me her teachers <eol> were being scored <eob> with a complex, secret algorithm <eob> called the "value-added model." <eob> I told her, "Well, figure out what the formula <eol> is, show it to me. <eob>
I'm going to explain it to you." <eob> She said, "Well, I tried to get the formula, <eob> but my Department of Education <eol> contact told me it was math <eob> and I wouldn't understand it." <eob>
It gets worse. <eob> The New York Post filed a Freedom <eol> of Information Act request, <eob> got all the teachers' names <eol> and all their scores <eob> and they published them as an act <eol> of teacher-shaming. <eob>
When I tried to get the formulas, <eol> the source code, through the same means, <eob> I was told I couldn't. <eob> I was denied. <eob> I later found out <eob> that nobody in New York City <eol> had access to that formula. <eob>
No one understood it. <eob>
Then someone really smart got involved, <eol> Gary Rubinstein. <eob>
He found 665 teachers from that New York Post data <eob> that actually had two scores. <eob>
That could happen if they were teaching <eob> seventh grade math and eighth grade math. <eob>
He decided to plot them. <eob>
Each dot represents a teacher. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What is that? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That should never have been used <eol> for individual assessment. <eob>
It's almost a random number generator. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But it was. <eob> This is Sarah Wysocki. <eob> She got fired, along with 205 other teachers, <eob> from the Washington, DC school district, <eob> even though she had great recommendations <eol> from her principal <eob> and the parents of her kids. <eob>
I know what a lot of you guys are thinking, <eob> especially the data scientists, <eol> the AI experts here. <eob>
You're thinking, "Well, I would never <eol> make an algorithm that inconsistent." <eob> But algorithms can go wrong, <eob> even have deeply destructive effects <eol> with good intentions. <eob>
And whereas an airplane <eol> that's designed badly <eob> crashes to the earth <eol> and everyone sees it, <eob> an algorithm designed badly <eob> can go on for a long time, <eol> silently wreaking havoc. <eob>
This is Roger Ailes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He founded Fox News in 1996. <eob>
More than 20 women complained <eol> about sexual harassment. <eob> They said they weren't allowed <eol> to succeed at Fox News. <eob>
He was ousted last year, <eol> but we've seen recently <eob> that the problems have persisted. <eob>
That begs the question: <eob> What should Fox News do <eol> to turn over another leaf? <eob>
Well, what if they replaced <eol> their hiring process <eob> with a machine-learning algorithm? <eob>
That sounds good, right? <eob> Think about it. <eob> The data, what would the data be? <eob>
A reasonable choice would be the last <eol> 21 years of applications to Fox News. <eob> Reasonable. <eob> What about the definition of success? <eob>
Reasonable choice would be, <eob> well, who is successful at Fox News? <eob>
I guess someone who, say, stayed <eol> there for four years <eob> and was promoted at least once. <eob> Sounds reasonable. <eob> And then the algorithm <eol> would be trained. <eob>
It would be trained to look for people <eol> to learn what led to success, <eob> what kind of applications historically <eol> led to success <eob> by that definition. <eob>
Now think about what would happen <eob> if we applied that to a current <eol> pool of applicants. <eob>
It would filter out women <eob> because they do not look like people <eol> who were successful in the past. <eob>
Algorithms don't make things fair <eob> if you just blithely, <eol> blindly apply algorithms. <eob>
They don't make things fair. <eob>
They repeat our past practices, <eob> our patterns. <eob>
They automate the status quo. <eob>
That would be great if we had <eol> a perfect world, <eob> but we don't. <eob>
And I'll add that most companies <eol> don't have embarrassing lawsuits, <eob> but the data scientists in those companies <eob> are told to follow the data, <eob> to focus on accuracy. <eob>
Think about what that means. <eob> Because we all have bias, <eol> it means they could be codifying sexism <eob> or any other kind of bigotry. <eob>
Thought experiment, <eob> because I like them: <eob> an entirely segregated society -- <eob> racially segregated, <eol> all towns, all neighborhoods <eob> and where we send the police <eol> only to the minority neighborhoods <eob> to look for crime. <eob>
The arrest data would be very biased. <eob>
What if, on top of that, <eol> we found the data scientists <eob> and paid the data scientists <eol> to predict where the next crime would occur? <eob> Minority neighborhood. <eob> Or to predict who the next criminal would be? <eob> A minority. <eob> The data scientists would brag about how great <eol> and how accurate <eob> their model would be, <eob> and they'd be right. <eob>
Now, reality isn't that drastic, <eol> but we do have severe segregations <eob> in many cities and towns, <eob> and we have plenty of evidence <eob> of biased policing and justice system data. <eob>
And we actually do predict hotspots, <eob> places where crimes will occur. <eob> And we do predict, in fact, <eol> the individual criminality, <eob> the criminality of individuals. <eob>
The news organization ProPublica recently looked into <eob> one of those "recidivism risk" algorithms, <eob> as they're called, <eob> being used in Florida during sentencing <eol> by judges. <eob>
Bernard, on the left, the black man, <eol> was scored a 10 out of 10. <eob>
Dylan, on the right, 3 out of 10. <eob>
10 out of 10, high risk. <eol> 3 out of 10, low risk. <eob>
They were both brought <eol> in for drug possession. <eob>
They both had records, <eob> but Dylan had a felony <eob> but Bernard didn't. <eob>
This matters, because <eol> the higher score you are, <eob> the more likely you're being given <eol> a longer sentence. <eob>
What's going on? <eob> Data laundering. <eob> It's a process by which technologists <eol> hide ugly truths <eob> inside black box algorithms <eob> and call them objective; <eob> call them meritocratic. <eob>
When they're secret, important <eol> and destructive, <eob> I've coined a term for these algorithms: <eob> "weapons of math destruction." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
They're everywhere, <eol> and it's not a mistake. <eob>
These are private companies building <eol> private algorithms <eob> for private ends. <eob>
Even the ones I talked about <eol> for teachers and the public police, <eob> those were built by private companies <eob> and sold to the government <eol> institutions. <eob>
They call it their "secret sauce" -- <eob> that's why they can't tell us about it. <eob>
It's also private power. <eob>
They are profiting for wielding <eol> the authority of the inscrutable. <eob>
Now you might think, <eol> since all this stuff is private <eob> and there's competition, <eob> maybe the free market <eol> will solve this problem. <eob> It won't. <eob> There's a lot of money <eol> to be made in unfairness. <eob>
Also, we're not economic rational agents. <eob>
We all are biased. <eob>
We're all racist and bigoted <eol> in ways that we wish we weren't, <eob> in ways that we don't even know. <eob>
We know this, though, in aggregate, <eob> because sociologists have consistently <eol> demonstrated this <eob> with these experiments they build, <eob> where they send a bunch <eol> of applications to jobs out, <eob> equally qualified <eol> but some have white-sounding names <eob> and some have black-sounding names, <eob> and it's always disappointing, the results -- always. <eob>
So we are the ones that are biased, <eob> and we are injecting those biases <eol> into the algorithms <eob> by choosing what data to collect, <eob> like I chose not to think <eol> about ramen noodles -- <eob> I decided it was irrelevant. <eob>
But by trusting the data that's actually <eol> picking up on past practices <eob> and by choosing <eol> the definition of success, <eob> how can we expect the algorithms <eol> to emerge unscathed? <eob> We can't. We have to check them. <eob>
We have to check them for fairness. <eob>
The good news is, <eol> we can check them for fairness. <eob>
Algorithms can be interrogated, <eob> and they will tell us <eol> the truth every time. <eob>
And we can fix them. <eol> We can make them better. <eob>
I call this an algorithmic audit, <eob> and I'll walk you through it. <eob>
First, data integrity check. <eob>
For the recidivism risk algorithm <eol> I talked about, <eob> a data integrity check would mean <eol> we'd have to come to terms with the fact <eob> that in the US, whites and blacks smoke <eol> pot at the same rate <eob> but blacks are far more likely to be arrested -- <eob> four or five times more likely, <eol> depending on the area. <eob>
What is that <eob> bias looking like <eol> in other crime categories, <eob> and how do we account for it? <eob>
Second, we should think <eol> about the definition of success, <eob> audit that. <eob>
Remember — with the hiring algorithm? <eob>
We talked about it. <eob> Someone who stays for four years <eol> and is promoted once? <eob>
Well, that is a successful employee, <eob> but it's also an employee <eol> that is supported by their culture. <eob>
That said, also it can be quite biased. <eob>
We need to separate those two things. <eob>
We should look to the blind <eol> orchestra audition <eob> as an example. <eob>
That's where the people auditioning <eol> are behind a sheet. <eob>
What I want to think about there <eob> is the people who are listening <eol> have decided what's important <eob> and they've decided <eol> what's not important, <eob> and they're not getting distracted by that. <eob>
When the blind orchestra <eol> auditions started, <eob> the number of women in orchestras <eol> went up by a factor of five. <eob>
Next, we have to consider accuracy. <eob>
This is where the value-added model <eol> for teachers would fail immediately. <eob>
No algorithm is perfect, of course, <eob> so we have to consider <eol> the errors of every algorithm. <eob>
How often are there errors, <eol> and for whom does this model fail? <eob>
What is the cost of that failure? <eob>
And finally, we have to consider <eob> the long-term effects of algorithms, <eob> the feedback loops that are engendering. <eob>
That sounds abstract, <eob> but imagine if Facebook engineers <eol> had considered that <eob> before they decided to show us <eol> only things that our friends had posted. <eob>
I have two more messages, one for the data <eol> scientists out there. <eob>
Data scientists: we should not <eol> be the arbiters of truth. <eob>
We should be translators <eol> of ethical discussions that happen <eob> in larger society. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And the rest of you, <eob> the non-data scientists: <eob> this is not a math test. <eob>
This is a political fight. <eob>
We need to demand accountability <eol> for our algorithmic overlords. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The era of blind faith <eol> in big data must end. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Are you tired of going to work <eob> and making money for other people? <eob>
And who are those people anyways? <eob>
Those people that make <eol> money from your work. <eob>
Well, they're capitalists. <eob>
They have capital, <eob> and they use your labor <eol> to make more capital. <eob>
and making money for other people? <eob> So if you're tired of going to work <eob> then you're probably like me -- <eob> just tired of capitalism. <eob>
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I own a small business -- <eob> Rco Tires in Compton. <eob>
A few years ago, <eol> when I read Van Jones, <eob> and he wrote, "Let's make green collar jobs in the hood," <eob> I took him really seriously. <eob>
So I cofounded, own and operate <eol> a tire recycling company, <eob> and I'm really proud of what we've done. <eob>
So far, we've recycled <eol> a hundred million pounds of rubber. <eob>
That's 21 million gallons <eol> of oil diverted from landfills <eob> into new products. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
We also employ about 15 guys -- <eob> mostly people of color, <eob> most of whom are felons, <eob> and we pay above the minimum wage, <eob> and we are now proud members of the United <eol> Steelworkers Union. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now. <eob>
It's a privately held company <eol> with community-minded ownership, <eob> but I would like it to become one. <eob>
I would like for them to fire the boss -- <eob> that's me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I'm going to tell you why, <eob> but first, let me tell you <eol> how we got started. <eob>
So a lot of people ask, <eob> "How did Rco come to be?" <eob> And I have to be really honest. <eob> I leveraged my white privilege. <eob>
So, here's how white privilege <eol> worked for me and Rco. <eob>
My white grandmother was born on her <eol> family's plantation <eob> in Arkansas in 1918. <eob>
She traveled with her white father west, <eob> following the oil boom. <eob>
And he held various union oil jobs -- <eob> jobs which would have never been <eol> given to my black great-grandfather, <eob> had he lived here at the time. <eob>
Granny became a hairdresser <eob> and then got a loan with her husband <eob> who built their home in West Los Angeles -- <eob> a loan which would never have been given <eol> to a black family at the time. <eob>
And after my grandfather passed away, <eob> my granny was able <eol> to keep that house <eob> because she had his pension <eol> and his health care <eob> from a state job which he held, <eob> which again, would have never been <eol> given to a black man <eob> before the anti-discrimination act <eol> of the 1960s. <eob>
So, you fast-forward 30 years, <eob> and I graduate, <eob> and I want to start my own business <eob> with a pile of debt and a credit card, <eob> and no experience in the tire industry. <eob>
But I had what most people didn't have. <eob> I had a clean, safe, free place to live. <eob>
I moved in with my grandmother, <eob> and I was able to rent <eol> our first warehouse, <eob> buy our first truck, <eob> pay our first employees, <eob> because I didn't have to worry <eol> about paying myself, <eob> because I didn't need to feed myself, <eob> because I am the direct beneficiary of generations <eol> of white privilege. <eob>
Now, telling the story <eol> of white privilege is important <eob> because very often people say, <eob> "Oh, we want more companies like yours. <eob>
We want more Rco's, <eob> we want more black-owned businesses, <eob> female-led, triple bottom line, <eob> Ban the Box, <eob> green manufacturing companies," right? <eob> But the question we have to ask <eol> is, where is the wealth? <eob> Where is the money? <eob> Where's the capital in our communities <eob> to build the types of businesses that we want? <eob>
And in telling a story <eol> of the white side of my family, <eob> I needed a dozen ways <eob> where blacks were excluded from the economy, <eob> whereas the white side of my family <eol> was able to gain access and traction, <eob> and build wealth ... <eob> Primarily because racism <eol> and capitalism are best homies, but -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but what that means <eol> is that when we ask ourselves, <eob> "Why are our communities broke?" -- <eob> Like, we're not just broke <eol> because we're broke; <eob> we're broke for a reason. <eob>
Historical context really does matter. <eob>
But our history <eol> tells another story as well. <eob>
There's this incredible book <eol> called "Collective Courage," <eob> which is the story of how thousands <eol> of African Americans <eob> have been able to build <eol> businesses and schools, <eob> hospitals, farming cooperatives, <eob> banks, financial institutions -- <eob> entire communities and sovereign economies, <eob> without a lot of capital. <eob>
And they did it by working together <eob> and leveraging their community assets <eob> and trusting each other <eob> and putting solidarity first -- <eob> not just profits by any means necessary. <eob>
And they didn't have to wait <eol> around for celebrities and athletes <eob> to bring their money back to the hood. <eob>
However, if you are a celebrity <eol> or an athlete, <eob> and you're listening to this, <eob> please feel free to bring your money. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But they did it through <eol> cooperative economics, <eob> because they knew <eob> that capitalism was never going <eol> to finance black liberation. <eob>
So, there are so many great examples in this book, <eob> and I suggest that everybody just read it <eob> because it answers the question <eol> I asked earlier, <eob> which was where are we going <eol> to get the wealth <eob> to build the types of business <eol> that we want. <eob>
And the answer is going to have <eol> to be cooperative economics. <eob>
There's a lot of different versions <eol> of cooperativism. <eob>
What I'm talking about today <eol> is worker ownership. <eob>
You may not have heard <eol> of worker ownership, <eob> but it's been an incredible tool <eob> for black economic liberation <eol> for a century, <eob> and it's also working <eol> all over the world right now. <eob>
You may have heard <eol> of Black Wall Street <eob> or maybe the Zapatistas, <eob> but I'll give you an example <eol> that's a little bit closer to home. <eob>
Right now, today, in South Bronx, <eob> is the country's largest <eol> worker-owned company. <eob>
It's called Cooperative Home Care Associates, <eob> and it was founded by black and Latinx home care workers <eob> who are now able to pay themselves living wages, <eob> they have full-time hours, <eob> they have benefits and a pension, <eob> through their membership as a unit of SEIU. <eob>
And these women owners now receive <eol> a dividend back on their ownership <eob> every year that the company <eol> has been profitable, <eob> which has been most years. <eob>
So they're able to really enjoy <eol> the fruits of their labor <eob> because they fired the boss. <eob>
They don't have any big investors. <eob> They don't have fat-cat CEOs <eob> or absentee owners taking the profit <eol> out of the company. <eob>
They each pay in about 1,000 dollars <eol> over time <eob> in order to gain ownership, <eob> and now they own their job. <eob>
Now, there's hundreds of more <eol> examples of companies like this <eob> springing up all across the country. <eob>
And I'm so inspired by what they're doing, <eob> because it really represents an alternative <eob> to the type of economy we have now, <eob> which exploits all of us. <eob>
It also represents an alternative <eob> to waiting around <eol> for big investors to bring chain stores, <eob> or big-box stores to our communities, <eob> because honestly, those types of developments, <eob> they steal resources <eol> from our communities. <eob>
They put our mom-and-pop <eol> shops out of business, <eob> they make our entrepreneurs <eol> into wage workers, <eob> and they take money <eol> out of our pocket <eob> and send it to their shareholders. <eob>
So, I was so inspired by all these <eol> stories of resistance and resilience <eob> that I got together with a few people here <eol> in Los Angeles, <eob> and we created LUCI. <eob>
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles <eol> Union Cooperative Initiative, <eob> and our objective is to create <eol> more worker-owned businesses <eob> here in Los Angeles. <eob>
So far, in the last year, <eol> we've created two: <eob> Pacific Electric, an electrical company, <eob> and Vermont Gage Carwash, <eob> which is right here in South-Central, <eob> some of you guys <eol> might be familiar with it. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> This long-time carwash is now owned <eol> and operated by its 20 workers, <eob> all of whom are union members as well. <eob>
So you might be wondering <eol> why the focus on union-worker ownership, <eob> but there's a lot of good reasons <eob> why the labor movement is a natural ally <eol> to the worker-ownership movement. <eob>
To build these companies <eol> that we want in our community, <eob> we need a few things. <eob>
We're going to need money, <eol> people and training. <eob>
Unions have all of those things. <eob>
America's working class has been <eol> paying union dues for decades, <eob> and with it, our unions have been building <eob> dignified, decent, and democratic workplaces for us. <eob>
However, union jobs are <eol> on the steep decline, <eob> and it's time for us <eol> to start calling on our unions <eob> to really bring all of their financial <eol> and political capital <eob> to bear in the creation of new, <eol> union, living-wage jobs <eob> in our communities. <eob>
Also, union halls <eol> are full of union members <eob> who understand the importance of solidarity <eob> and the power of collective action. <eob>
These are the types of folks <eol> that want more union businesses to exist, <eob> so let's build them with them. <eob>
Learning from our unions, <eob> learning from our past, <eob> learning from our peers, <eob> are all going to be <eol> very important to our success, <eob> which is why I'd like to leave you <eol> with one last example <eob> and a vision for the future ... <eob> and that vision is Mondragon, Spain. <eob>
Mondragon, Spain is a community <eol> built entirely around worker cooperatives. <eob>
There's 260-plus businesses here, <eob> manufacturing everything from bicycles <eol> to washing machines to transformers. <eob>
And this group of businesses <eol> now employs 80,000 people <eob> and earns more than 12 billion <eol> euros in revenue every year. <eob>
And all of the companies there are owned <eol> by the people that work in them. <eob>
They've also built universities <eol> and hospitals and financial institutions. <eob>
I mean, imagine if we could build something <eol> like this in South-Central. <eob>
The late mayor of Jackson <eol> had a similar idea. <eob>
He wanted to turn his entire city <eol> into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy, <eob> calling his ambitious <eol> plan "Jackson Rising." <eob>
And when I look at Mondragon, <eob> I see really what working-class <eol> people can do for ourselves <eob> when we work together <eob> and make decisions for ourselves <eol> and each other <eob> and our communities. <eob>
And what's really incredible <eol> about Mondragon <eob> is that while we are dreaming about them, <eob> they are dreaming about us. <eob>
This community in Spain has decided <eol> to launch an international initiative <eob> to create more communities like it <eol> all over the world, <eob> by linking up with unions, <eob> by supporting organizations <eol> like LUCI, <eob> and by educating folks <eol> about the worker-ownership model. <eob>
Now, here's what you can do <eol> to be a part of it. <eob>
If you're a union member, <eol> go to your union meetings, <eob> and make sure that your union <eol> has a worker-ownership initiative, <eob> and become a part of it. <eob>
If you're an entrepreneur, <eob> if you have a small business, <eob> or you're interested in starting one, <eob> then link up with LUCI or another organization like us <eob> to help you get started <eol> on the cooperative model. <eob>
If you're a politician, <eob> or you work for one, <eob> or you just like talking to them, <eob> please get the city, state, federal <eol> and county legislation passed <eob> that we need in order to fund <eol> and support worker-owned businesses. <eob>
And for everybody else, <eob> learn about our history, <eol> learn about our models, <eob> and seek us out so can support us, <eob> you can buy from us, invest in us, lend to us and join us, <eob> because it's really going <eol> to take all of us <eob> in order to build the more just <eol> and sustainable and resilient economy <eob> that we want for ourselves and our children. <eob>
And with that, <eob> I would like to leave you <eol> with a quote from Arundhati Roy, <eob> and she writes ... <eob> "Our strategy <eol> should not be only to confront Empire, <eob> but to lay siege to it. <eob>
To deprive it of oxygen. <eob> To mock it. <eob> To shame it. <eob> With our art, <eob> our literature, <eob> our music, <eob> our brilliance, <eob> our joy, <eob> our sheer relentlessness -- <eob> and our ability to tell our own stories. <eob>
Not the stories that we're being <eol> brainwashed to believe. <eob>
The corporate revolution will collapse <eob> if we refuse to buy what they're selling -- <eob> their ideas, <eob> their version of history, <eob> their wars, <eob> their weapons, <eob> their sense of inevitability. <eob>
Because know this: <eob> They be few and we be many. <eob>
They need us more than we need them. <eob>
Another world is not only possible, <eob> she's on her way. <eob>
And on a quiet day, <eob> I can hear her breathing." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
These are some photos of me volunteering <eol> in a Cambodian orphanage <eob> in 2006. <eob>
When these photos were taken, <eob> I thought I was doing a really good thing <eob> and that I was really helping those kids. <eob>
I had a lot to learn. <eob>
It all started for me when I was 19 years old <eob> and went backpacking <eol> through Southeast Asia. <eob>
When I reached Cambodia, <eob> I felt uncomfortable being on holiday <eol> surrounded by so much poverty <eob> and wanted to do something to give back. <eob>
So I visited some orphanages <eol> and donated some clothes and books <eob> and some money <eob> to help the kids that I met. <eob>
But one of the orphanages <eol> I visited was desperately poor. <eob>
I had never encountered poverty <eol> like that before in my life. <eob>
They didn't have funds for enough food, <eob> clean water <eob> or medical treatment, <eob> and the sad little faces on those kids <eob> were heartbreaking. <eob>
So I was compelled to do <eol> something more to help. <eob>
I fund-raised in Australia <eol> and returned to Cambodia the following year <eob> to volunteer at the orphanage for a few months. <eob>
I taught English and bought <eol> water filters and food <eob> and took all of the kids to the dentist <eol> for the first time in their lives. <eob>
But over the course of the next year, <eob> I came to discover <eol> that this orphanage that I had been supporting <eob> was terribly corrupt. <eob>
The director had been embezzling <eol> every cent donated to the orphanage, <eob> and in my absence, the children <eol> were suffering such gross neglect <eob> that they were forced to catch mice <eol> to feed themselves. <eob>
I also found out later <eob> that the director had been physically <eol> and sexually abusing the kids. <eob>
I couldn't bring myself <eol> to turn my back on children <eob> who I had come to know and care about <eob> and return to my life in Australia. <eob>
So I worked with a local team <eol> and the local authorities <eob> to set up a new orphanage <eol> and rescue the kids <eob> to give them a safe new home. <eob>
But this is where my story <eol> takes another unexpected turn. <eob>
As I adjusted to my new life <eol> running an orphanage in Cambodia, <eob> (Khmer) I learned <eol> to speak Khmer fluently, <eob> which means that I learned to speak <eol> the Khmer language fluently. <eob>
And when I could communicate <eol> properly with the kids, <eob> I began to uncover some strange things. <eob>
Most of the children we had removed <eol> from the orphanage <eob> were not, in fact, orphans at all. <eob>
They had parents, <eob> and the few that were orphaned <eol> had other living relatives, <eob> like grandparents and aunties and uncles <eob> and other siblings. <eob>
So why were these children <eol> living in an orphanage <eob> when they weren't orphans? <eob>
Since 2005, the number of orphanages <eol> in Cambodia <eob> has risen by 75 percent, <eob> and the number of children <eol> living in Cambodian orphanages <eob> has nearly doubled, <eob> despite the fact <eob> that the vast majority of children <eol> living in these orphanages <eob> are not orphans in the traditional sense. <eob>
They're children from poor families. <eob>
So if the vast majority of children <eol> living in orphanages <eob> are not orphans, <eob> then the term "orphanage" <eob> is really just a euphemistic name <eol> for a residential care institution. <eob>
These institutions go by other names <eol> as well, <eob> like "shelters," "safe houses," <eol> "children's homes," "children's villages," <eob> even "boarding schools." <eob>
And this problem is not <eol> just confined to Cambodia. <eob>
This map shows some of the countries <eol> that have seen a dramatic increase <eob> in the numbers of residential care institutions <eob> and the numbers of children <eol> being institutionalized. <eob>
In Uganda, for example, <eob> the number of children living <eol> in institutions <eob> has increased by more than 1,600 percent <eol> since 1992. <eob>
And the problems posed by putting kids <eol> into institutions <eob> don't just pertain to the corrupt <eol> and abusive institutions <eob> like the one that I rescued <eol> the kids from. <eob>
The problems are with all forms <eol> of residential care. <eob>
Over 60 years of international research <eol> has shown us <eob> that children who grow <eol> up in institutions, <eob> even the very best institutions, <eob> are at serious risk <eol> of developing mental illnesses, <eob> attachment disorders, <eob> growth and speech delays, <eob> and many will struggle <eol> with an inability to reintegrate <eob> back into society later in life <eob> and form healthy relationships as adults. <eob>
These kids grow up <eol> without any model of family <eob> or of what good parenting <eol> looks like, <eob> so they then can struggle <eol> to parent their own children. <eob>
So if you institutionalize <eol> large numbers of children, <eob> it will affect not only <eol> this generation, <eob> but also the generations to come. <eob>
We've learned these lessons <eol> before in Australia. <eob>
It's what happened to our "Stolen Generations," <eob> the indigenous children <eol> who were removed from their families <eob> with the belief that we could <eol> do a better job <eob> of raising their children. <eob>
Just imagine for a moment <eob> what residential care <eol> would be like for a child. <eob>
Firstly, you have a constant <eol> rotation of caregivers, <eob> with somebody new coming on <eol> to the shift every eight hours. <eob>
And then on top of that you have <eol> a steady stream of visitors <eob> and volunteers coming in, <eob> showering you in the love <eol> and affection you're craving <eob> and then leaving again, <eob> evoking all of those feelings <eol> of abandonment, <eob> and proving again and again <eob> that you are not worthy of being loved. <eob>
We don't have orphanages <eol> in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore, <eob> and for a very good reason: <eob> one study has shown <eol> that young adults raised in institutions <eob> are 10 times more likely <eol> to fall into sex work than their peers, <eob> 40 times more likely <eol> to have a criminal record, <eob> and 500 times more likely <eob> to take their own lives. <eob>
There are an estimated eight million <eol> children around the world <eob> living in institutions <eol> like orphanages, <eob> despite the fact <eob> that around 80 percent of them <eob> are not orphans. <eob>
Most have families <eol> who could be caring for them <eob> if they had the right support. <eob>
But for me, <eob> the most shocking thing <eol> of all to realize <eob> is what's contributing to this boom <eob> in the unnecessary institutionalization <eol> of so many children: <eob> it's us -- <eob> the tourists, the volunteers <eob> and the donors. <eob>
It's the well-meaning support <eol> from people like me back in 2006, <eob> who visit these children <eol> and volunteer and donate, <eob> who are unwittingly fueling an industry <eol> that exploits children <eob> and tears families apart. <eob>
It's really no coincidence <eol> that these institutions are largely set up <eob> in areas where tourists <eol> can most easily be lured in <eob> to visit and volunteer in exchange <eol> for donations. <eob>
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal, <eob> over 90 percent of them <eol> are located in the most popular tourist hotspots. <eob>
The cold, hard truth is, <eob> the more money that floods <eol> in in support of these institutions, <eob> the more institutions open <eob> and the more children <eol> are removed from their families <eob> to fill their beds. <eob>
It's just the laws of supply and demand. <eob>
I had to learn <eol> all of these lessons the hard way, <eob> after I had already set up an orphanage <eol> in Cambodia. <eob>
I had to eat a big piece <eol> of humble pie to admit <eob> that I had made a mistake <eob> and inadvertently become <eol> a part of the problem. <eob>
I had been an orphanage tourist, <eob> a voluntourist. <eob>
I then set up my own orphanage <eol> and facilitated orphanage tourism <eob> in order to generate funds <eol> for my orphanage, <eob> before I knew better. <eob>
What I came to learn <eob> is that no matter how good my orphanage was, <eob> it was never going to give <eol> those kids what they really needed: <eob> their families. <eob>
I know that it can feel incredibly depressing <eob> to learn that helping vulnerable <eol> children and overcoming poverty <eob> is not as simple as we've all been <eol> led to believe it should be. <eob>
But thankfully, there is a solution. <eob>
These problems are reversible <eol> and preventable, <eob> and when we know better, <eob> we can do better. <eob>
The organization that I run today, <eob> the Cambodian Children's Trust, <eob> is no longer an orphanage. <eob>
In 2012, we changed the model <eol> in favor of family-based care. <eob>
I now lead an amazing team <eol> of Cambodian social workers, <eob> nurses and teachers. <eob>
Together, we work within communities <eob> to untangle a complex web <eol> of social issues <eob> and help Cambodian families escape poverty. <eob>
Our primary focus is on preventing <eol> some of the most vulnerable families <eob> in our community <eob> from being separated <eol> in the first place. <eob>
But in cases where it's not possible <eob> for a child to live <eol> with its biological family, <eob> we support them in foster care. <eob>
Family-based care is always better <eob> than placing a child in an institution. <eob>
Do you remember <eol> that first photo that I showed you before? <eob>
See that girl who is just about <eol> to catch the ball? <eob>
Her name is Torn <eob> She's a strong, brave and fiercely <eol> intelligent girl. <eob>
But <eob> in 2006, <eob> when I first met her <eob> living in that corrupt <eol> and abusive orphanage, <eob> she had never been to school. <eob>
She was suffering terrible neglect, <eob> and she yearned desperately <eob> for the warmth and love of her mother. <eob>
But this is a photo of Torn <eol> today with her family. <eob>
Her mother now has a secure job, <eob> her siblings are doing well in high school <eob> and she is just about <eol> to finish her nursing degree at university. <eob>
For Torn's family -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
for Torn's family, <eob> the cycle of poverty has been broken. <eob>
The family-based care model <eol> that we have developed at CCT <eob> has been so successful, <eob> that it's now being put forward <eol> by UNICEF Cambodia <eob> and the Cambodian government <eob> as a national solution <eol> to keep children in families. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> And one of the best -- <eob>
And one of the best ways <eol> that you can help to solve this problem <eob> is by giving these eight million <eol> children a voice <eob> and become an advocate <eol> for family-based care. <eob>
If we work together to raise awareness, <eob> we can make sure the world knows <eob> that we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization <eob> of vulnerable children. <eob>
How do we achieve that? <eob>
By redirecting our support <eol> and our donations <eob> away from orphanages <eol> and residential care institutions <eob> towards organizations that are committed <eol> to keeping children in families. <eob>
I believe we can make <eol> this happen in our lifetime, <eob> and as a result, we will see <eol> developing communities thrive <eob> and ensure that vulnerable children <eol> everywhere <eob> have what all children need and deserve: <eob> a family. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Before I get to bulk <eol> of what I have to say, <eob> I feel compelled <eol> just to mention a couple of things about myself. <eob>
I am not some mystical, <eob> spiritual sort of person. <eob>
I'm a science writer. <eob>
I studied physics in college. <eob>
I used to be a science <eol> correspondent for NPR. <eob>
OK, that said: <eob> in the course of working <eol> on a story for NPR, <eob> I got some advice from an astronomer <eob> that challenged my outlook, <eob> and frankly, changed my life. <eob>
You see, the story was about an eclipse, <eob> a partial solar eclipse <eol> that was set to cross the country <eob> in May of 1994. <eob>
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him, <eob> and he explained what was going <eol> to happen and how to view it, <eob> but he emphasized that, <eol> as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is, <eob> a much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different. <eob>
In a total eclipse, <eol> for all of two or three minutes, <eob> the moon completely blocks <eol> the face of the sun, <eob> creating what he described as the most <eol> awe-inspiring spectacle <eob> in all of nature. <eob>
And so the advice he gave me was this: <eob> "Before you die," he said, <eob> "you owe it to yourself to experience <eol> a total solar eclipse." <eob>
Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable <eob> hearing that from someone <eol> I didn't know very well; <eob> it felt sort of intimate. <eob>
But it got my attention, <eol> and so I did some research. <eob>
Now the thing about total eclipses is, <eob> if you wait for one to come to you, <eob> you're going to be waiting a long time. <eob>
Any given point on earth <eol> experiences a total eclipse <eob> about once every 400 years. <eob>
But if you're willing to travel, <eol> you don't have to wait that long. <eob>
And so I learned <eol> that a few years later, in 1998, <eob> a total eclipse was going <eol> to cross the Caribbean. <eob>
Now, a total eclipse <eol> is visible only along a narrow path, <eob> about a hundred miles wide, <eob> and that's where the moon's shadow falls. <eob>
It's called the "path of totality." <eob> And in February 1998, <eob> the path of totality was going to cross Aruba. <eob>
So I talked to my husband, <eol> and we thought: February? Aruba? <eob> Sounded like a good idea anyway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we headed south, <eob> to enjoy the sun and to see <eol> what would happen <eob> when the sun briefly went away. <eob>
Well, the day of the eclipse found us <eol> and many other people <eob> out behind the Hyatt Regency, <eob> on the beach, <eob> waiting for the show to begin. <eob>
And we wore eclipse glasses <eol> with cardboard frames <eob> and really dark lenses that enabled us <eol> to look at the sun safely. <eob>
A total eclipse begins <eol> as a partial eclipse, <eob> as the moon very slowly <eol> makes its way in front of the sun. <eob>
So first it looked the sun <eol> had a little notch in its edge, <eob> and then that notch grew larger and larger, <eob> turning the sun into a crescent. <eob>
And it was all very interesting, <eol> but I wouldn't say it was spectacular. <eob>
I mean, the day remained bright. <eob>
If I hadn't known <eol> what was going on overhead, <eob> I wouldn't have noticed <eol> anything unusual. <eob>
Well, about 10 minutes <eol> before the total solar eclipse was set to begin, <eob> weird things started to happen. <eob>
A cool wind kicked up. <eob>
Daylight looked odd, <eol> and shadows became very strange; <eob> they looked bizarrely sharp, <eob> as if someone had turned up <eol> the contrast knob on the TV. <eob>
Then I looked offshore, and I noticed <eol> running lights on boats, <eob> so clearly it was getting dark, <eob> although I hadn't realized it. <eob>
Well soon, it was obvious <eol> it was getting dark. <eob>
It felt like my eyesight was failing. <eob>
And then all of a sudden, <eob> the lights went out. <eob>
Well, at that, <eob> a cheer erupted from the beach, <eob> and I took off my eclipse glasses, <eob> because at this point <eol> during the total eclipse, <eob> it was safe to look at the sun <eol> with the naked eye. <eob>
And I glanced upward, <eob> and I was just dumbstruck. <eob> Now, consider that, at this point, <eol> I was in my mid-30s. <eob>
I had lived on earth long enough to know <eol> what the sky looks like. <eob> I mean -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies <eob> and starry skies and angry skies <eob> and pink skies at sunrise. <eob>
But here was a sky I had never seen. <eob>
First, there were the colors. <eob>
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey, <eob> like twilight. <eob>
But on the horizon it was orange, <eob> like sunset, <eob> 360 degrees. <eob>
And up above, in the twilight, <eob> bright stars and planets had come out. <eob>
So there was Jupiter <eob> and there was Mercury <eob> and there was Venus. <eob>
They were all in a line. <eob>
And there, along this line, <eob> was this thing, <eob> this glorious, bewildering thing. <eob>
It looked like a wreath woven <eol> from silvery thread, <eob> and it just hung out there in space, shimmering. <eob>
That was the sun's outer atmosphere, <eob> the solar corona. <eob>
And pictures just don't do it justice. <eob>
It's not just a ring <eol> or halo around the sun; <eob> it's finely textured, like it's made <eol> out of strands of silk. <eob>
And although it looked nothing <eol> like our sun, <eob> of course, I knew that's what it was. <eob>
So there was the sun, <eol> and there were the planets, <eob> and I could see how <eol> the planets revolve around the sun. <eob>
It's like I had left our solar system <eob> and was standing on some alien world, <eob> looking back at creation. <eob>
And for the first time in my life, <eob> I just felt viscerally <eol> connected to the universe <eob> in all of its immensity. <eob>
Time stopped, <eob> or it just kind of felt nonexistent, <eob> and what I beheld with my eyes -- <eob> I didn't just see it, <eob> it felt like a vision. <eob>
And I stood there in this nirvana <eob> for all of 174 seconds -- <eol> less than three minutes -- <eob> when all of a sudden, it was over. <eob>
The sun burst out, <eob> the blue sky returned, <eob> the stars and the planets <eol> and the corona were gone. <eob>
The world returned to normal. <eob>
But I had changed. <eob>
And that's how I became an umbraphile -- <eob> an eclipse chaser. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, this is how I spend <eol> my time and hard-earned money. <eob>
Every couple of years, I head off <eol> to wherever the moon's shadow will fall <eob> to experience another couple minutes <eob> of cosmic bliss, <eob> and to share the experience with others: <eob> with friends in Australia, <eob> with an entire city in Germany. <eob>
In 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands <eob> who filled the streets and the rooftops <eol> and cheered in unison <eob> as <eob> the solar corona <eob> emerged. <eob>
And over time, I've become something else: <eob> an eclipse evangelist. <eob>
I see it as my job <eob> to pay forward the advice <eol> that I received all those years ago. <eob>
"you owe it to yourself <eol> to experience a total solar eclipse." <eob> And so let me tell you: <eob> before you die, <eob>
It is the ultimate experience of awe. <eob>
Now, that word, "awesome," <eol> has grown so overused <eob> that it's lost its original meaning. <eob>
True awe, a sense of wonder <eol> and insignificance <eob> in the face of something enormous and grand, <eob> is rare in our lives. <eob>
But when you experience it, it's powerful. <eob>
Awe dissolves the ego. <eob>
It makes us feel connected. <eob>
Indeed, it promotes empathy and generosity. <eob>
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome <eol> than a total solar eclipse. <eob>
Unfortunately, few Americans have seen one, <eob> because it's been 38 years <eob> since one last touched <eol> the continental United States <eob> and 99 years since one last crossed <eol> the breadth of the nation. <eob>
But that is about to change. <eob>
Over the next 35 years, <eob> five total solar eclipses <eol> will visit the continental United States, <eob> and three of them will be especially grand. <eob>
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
the moon's shadow will race <eol> from Oregon to South Carolina. <eob>
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow <eol> heads north from Texas to Maine. <eob> In 2045, on August 12, <eob> the path cuts from California to Florida. <eob>
I say: <eob> What if we made these holidays? <eob> What if we -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if we all stood together, <eob> as many people as possible, <eob> in the shadow of the moon? <eob>
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe <eol> would help heal our divisions, <eob> get us to treat each other <eol> just a bit more humanely. <eob>
Now, admittedly, some folks <eol> consider my evangelizing a little out there; <eob> my obsession, eccentric. <eob>
I mean, why focus so much attention <eol> on something so brief? <eob>
Why cross the globe -- <eol> or state lines, for that matter -- <eob> for something that lasts three minutes? <eob>
As I said: <eob> I am not a spiritual person. <eob>
I don't believe in God. <eob>
I wish I did. <eob>
But when I think of my own mortality -- <eob> and I do, a lot -- <eob> when I think of everyone I have lost, <eob> my mother in particular, <eob> what soothes me <eob> is that moment of awe I had in Aruba. <eob>
I picture myself on that beach, <eob> looking at that sky, <eob> and I remember how I felt. <eob>
My existence may be temporary, <eob> but that's OK because, my gosh, <eob> look at what I'm a part of. <eob>
And so this is a lesson I've learned, <eob> and it's one that applies to life in general: <eob> duration of experience <eol> does not equal impact. <eob>
One weekend, one conversation -- <eol> hell, one glance -- <eob> can change everything. <eob>
Cherish those moments <eol> of deep connection with other people, <eob> with the natural world, <eob> and make them a priority. <eob>
Yes, I chase eclipses. <eob>
You might chase something else. <eob>
But it's not about the 174 seconds. <eob>
It's about how they change <eob> the years that come after. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us. <eob>
AI researchers have always said <eob> that we humans do not need to worry, <eob> because only menial jobs <eol> will be taken over by machines. <eob> Is that really true? <eob> They have also said that AI <eol> will create new jobs, <eob> so those who lose their jobs <eol> will find a new one. <eob> Of course. <eob> But the real question is: <eob> How many of those who may lose their jobs to AI <eob> will be able to land a new one, <eob> especially when AI is smart enough to learn better <eol> than most of us? <eob>
Let me ask you a question: <eob> How many of you think <eob> that AI will pass <eol> the entrance examination of a top university by 2020? <eob> Oh, so many. OK. <eob> So some of you may say, <eol> "Of course, yes!" <eob> Now singularity is the issue. <eob>
And some others may say, "Maybe, <eob> because AI already won <eol> against a top Go player." <eob> And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh." <eob> That means we do not know <eol> the answer yet, right? <eob>
So that was the reason <eol> why I started Todai Robot Project, <eob> making an AI which passes <eol> the entrance examination <eob> of the University of Tokyo, <eob> the top university in Japan. <eob>
This is our Todai Robot. <eob> And, of course, the brain of the robot <eol> is working in the remote server. <eob>
It is now writing a 600-word essay <eob> on maritime trade in the 17th century. <eob>
How does that sound? <eob>
Why did I take the entrance exam as its benchmark? <eob>
Because I thought we had to study <eol> the performance of AI <eob> in comparison to humans, <eob> especially on the skills and expertise <eob> which are believed to be acquired <eol> only by humans <eob> and only through education. <eob>
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo, <eob> you have to pass two different <eol> types of exams. <eob>
The first one is a national standardized test <eob> in multiple-choice style. <eob>
You have to take seven subjects <eob> and achieve a high score — <eob> I would say like an 85 percent <eol> or more accuracy rate — <eob> to be allowed to take the second stage <eol> written test <eob> prepared by Todai. <eob>
So let me first explain <eol> how modern AI works, <eob> taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge <eol> as an example. <eob>
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" <eol> question: <eob> "Mozart's last symphony <eol> shares its name with this planet." <eob> Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!" <eol> question always asks, <eob> always ends with "this" something: <eob> "this" planet, "this" country, <eob> "this" rock musician, and so on. <eob> In other words, "Jeopardy!" <eol> doesn't ask many different types of questions, <eob> but a single type, <eob> which we call "factoid questions." <eob>
By the way, do you know the answer? <eob>
If you do not know the answer <eol> and if you want to know the answer, <eob> what would you do? <eob>
You Google, right? <eob> Of course. <eob> Why not? <eob> But you have to pick appropriate keywords <eob> like "Mozart," "last" and "symphony" to search. <eob>
The machine basically does the same. <eob>
Then this Wikipedia page <eol> will be ranked top. <eob>
Then the machine reads the page. <eob> No, uh-uh. <eob>
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs, <eob> including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot, <eob> is able to read. <eob>
But they are very good <eol> at searching and optimizing. <eob>
It will recognize <eob> that the keywords "Mozart," "last" <eol> and "symphony" <eob> are appearing <eol> heavily around here. <eob>
So if it can find a word which is a planet <eob> and which is co-occurring <eol> with these keywords, <eob> that must be the answer. <eob>
This is how Watson finds the answer <eol> "Jupiter," in this case. <eob>
Our Todai Robot works similarly, <eol> but a bit smarter <eob> in answering history yes-no questions, <eob> like, "'Charlemagne repelled <eol> the Magyars.' Is this sentence true or false?" <eob> Our robot starts producing <eol> a factoid question, <eob> like: "Charlemagne repelled [this person type]" by itself. <eob>
Then, "Avars" but not "Magyars" <eol> is ranked top. <eob>
This sentence is likely to be false. <eob>
Our robot does not read, <eol> does not understand, <eob> but it is statistically correct in many cases. <eob>
For the second stage written test, <eob> it is required to write a 600-word essay like this one: <eob>
[Discuss the rise and fall <eol> of the maritime trade <eob> in East and Southeast Asia <eol> in the 17th century ...] <eob>
and as I have shown earlier, <eob> our robot took the sentences <eol> from the textbooks and Wikipedia, <eob> combined them together, <eob> and optimized it to produce an essay <eob> without understanding a thing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay <eob> than most of the students. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How about mathematics? <eob> A fully automatic math-solving machine <eob> has been a dream <eob> since the birth of the word <eol> "artificial intelligence," <eob> but it has stayed at the level <eol> of arithmetic for a long, long time. <eob>
Last year, we finally succeeded <eol> in developing a system <eob> which solved pre-university-level problems <eol> from end to end, <eob> like this one. <eob>
This is the original problem written in Japanese, <eob> and we had to teach it 2,000 <eol> mathematical axioms <eob> and 8,000 Japanese words <eob> to make it accept the problems <eol> written in natural language. <eob>
And it is now translating <eol> the original problems <eob> into machine-readable formulas. <eob>
Weird, but it is now ready <eol> to solve it, I think. <eob> Go and solve it. <eob> Yes! It is now executing <eol> symbolic computation. <eob>
Even more weird, <eob> but probably this is the most fun <eol> part for the machine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now it outputs a perfect answer, <eob> though its proof is impossible to read, <eol> even for mathematicians. <eob>
Anyway, last year our robot <eol> was among the top one percent <eob> in the second stage written <eol> exam in mathematics. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So, did it enter Todai? <eob>
No, not as I expected. <eob> Why? <eob> Because it doesn't understand any meaning. <eob>
Let me show you a typical error <eol> it made in the English test. <eob>
Two people are talking. <eob> For us, who can understand <eol> the situation -- <eob>
[1. "We walked for a long time." 2. <eol> "We're almost there." <eob> 3. "Your shoes look expensive." 4. <eol> "Your shoelace is untied."] <eob>
it is obvious number four <eol> is the correct answer, right? <eob>
But Todai Robot chose number two, <eob> even after learning 15 billion English sentences <eob> using deep learning technologies. <eob>
OK, so now you might understand <eol> what I said: <eob> modern AIs do not read, <eob> do not understand. <eob>
They only disguise as if they do. <eob>
This is the distribution graph <eob> of half a million students <eol> who took the same exam as Todai Robot. <eob>
Now our Todai Robot is among <eol> the top 20 percent, <eob> and it was capable to pass <eob> more than 60 percent <eol> of the universities in Japan -- <eob> but not Todai. <eob>
But see how it is beyond the volume zone <eob> of to-be white-collar workers. <eob>
You might think I was delighted. <eob>
After all, my robot was surpassing <eol> students everywhere. <eob>
Instead, I was alarmed. <eob>
How on earth could this unintelligent <eol> machine outperform students -- <eob> our children? <eob> Right? <eob> I decided to investigate what was going on <eol> in the human world. <eob>
I took hundreds of sentences <eol> from high school textbooks <eob> and made easy multiple-choice quizzes, <eob> and asked thousands of high school <eol> students to answer. <eob>
Here is an example: <eob>
[Buddhism spread to ... , Christianity <eol> to ... and Oceania, <eob> and Islam to ...] <eob>
Of course, <eob> the original problems <eol> are written in Japanese, <eob> their mother tongue. <eob>
[ ______ has spread to Oceania. <eob> 1. Hinduism 2. Christianity 3. Islam 4. Buddhism ] <eob>
Obviously, Christianity is the answer, <eol> isn't it? <eob> It's written! <eob> And Todai Robot chose <eol> the correct answer, too. <eob>
But one-third of junior <eol> high school students <eob> failed to answer this question. <eob>
Do you think it is only the case in Japan? <eob>
I do not think so, <eob> because Japan is always ranked <eol> among the top in OECD PISA tests, <eob> measuring 15-year-old <eol> students' performance in mathematics, <eob> science and reading <eob> every three years. <eob>
We have been believing <eob> that everybody can learn <eob> and learn well, <eob> as long as we provide <eol> good learning materials <eob> free on the web <eob> so that they can access <eol> through the internet. <eob>
But such wonderful materials <eol> may benefit only those who can read well, <eob> and the percentage <eol> of those who can read well <eob> may be much less than we expected. <eob>
How we humans will coexist with AI <eob> is something we have to think <eol> about carefully, <eob> based on solid evidence. <eob>
At the same time, we have <eol> to think in a hurry <eob> because time is running out. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you. <eob>
Noriko Arai: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully give us <eol> a sense of how AIs think, <eob> what they can do amazingly <eob> and what they can't do. <eob>
But -- do I read you right, <eob> that you think we really need <eol> quite an urgent revolution in education <eob> to help kids do the things <eol> that humans can do better than AIs? <eob>
NA: Yes, yes, yes. <eob>
Because we humans can understand <eol> the meaning. <eob>
That is something which is very, <eol> very lacking in AI. <eob>
But most of the students <eol> just pack the knowledge <eob> without understanding the meaning <eol> of the knowledge, <eob> so that is not knowledge, <eol> that is just memorizing, <eob> and AI can do the same thing. <eob>
So we have to think about <eol> a new type of education. <eob>
CA: A shift from knowledge, <eol> rote knowledge, to meaning. <eob>
NA: Mm-hmm. <eob>
CA: Well, there's a challenge <eol> for the educators. <eob> Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
NA: <eob> Thank you <eob> very much. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's Christmas Eve, 1968. <eob>
The Apollo 8 spacecraft <eol> has successfully completed <eob> its first three orbits around the moon. <eob>
Launched from Cape Canaveral three days before, <eob> this is the first time <eob> that humans have ever traveled <eol> beyond low Earth orbit. <eob>
On the vessel's fourth pass, <eob> the Earth slowly comes into view <eob> and reveals itself above <eol> the Moon's horizon. <eob>
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically <eol> asks his crewmates where their camera is, <eob> grabs the Hasselblad, <eol> points it towards the window, <eob> presses the shutter, <eob> and takes one of the most important <eol> photographs of all time: <eob> "Earthrise." <eob>
When the crew was safely <eol> home a few days later, <eob> they were asked about the mission. <eob>
Anders famously replied, <eob> "We went to the moon, <eob> but we actually discovered Earth." <eob>
What did he and his fellow crewmates feel <eob> in this incredible moment? <eob>
In a study released just this past year, <eob> a team of researchers <eol> at the University of Pennsylvania <eob> examined the testimonies <eol> of hundreds of astronauts <eob> who had the opportunity <eol> to view the Earth from space. <eob>
Their analysis uncovered three common feelings: <eob> first, a greater appreciation <eol> for Earth's beauty; <eob> second, an increased sense of connection <eol> to all other living beings; <eob> and third, an unexpected, <eol> often overwhelming sense of emotion. <eob>
The researchers believe <eol> that seeing the Earth from a great distance <eob> provokes someone <eol> to develop new cognitive frameworks <eob> to understand what they are seeing. <eob>
They believe these astronauts <eol> were forever changed <eob> by this new view, <eob> this new perspective, <eob> this new visual truth. <eob>
This feeling is commonly referred <eol> to as the "overview effect." <eob>
Only 558 people have ever been <eol> to outer space. <eob>
558 people had the opportunity <eob> to gaze down in awe, <eob> to wonder at our planet <eob> floating in an infinite sea of darkness. <eob>
But what if that number were bigger? <eob>
Three years ago, <eol> I set off on my own mission: <eob> to see if I could bring <eol> this feeling of overwhelming scale and beauty <eob> to many more people <eob> just by using one small computer <eob> in my small New York City apartment. <eob>
It was then, in 2013, that <eol> I launched "Daily Overview." <eob> Every day, I have used satellite imagery <eob> to create one expansive overhead <eol> view of our planet. <eob>
More than 1,000 of these images <eol> have been created thus far, <eob> and more than 600,000 people <eob> tune in for this daily dose <eol> of perspectives. <eob>
I create the imagery by curating photos <eol> from the massive archive <eob> of a satellite company called Digital Globe. <eob>
They operate a constellation <eol> of five satellites, <eob> each roughly the size <eol> of an ambulance, <eob> that is constantly taking <eol> pictures of the Earth <eob> as they orbit at 28,000 kilometers per hour. <eob>
Now, what does this mean? <eob>
Each of these satellites <eol> is equipped with a camera <eob> that has a focal length <eol> of 16 meters, <eob> so that's roughly 290 times greater <eob> than a DSLR camera <eol> equipped with a standard 55 millimeter lens. <eob>
So if were able to attach <eol> one of their satellites <eob> to the roof of this theater in Oxford, <eob> we could take a picture of a football, <eob> clearly, on the pitch <eol> at the stadium in Amsterdam. <eob>
That's 450 kilometers away. <eob>
That's incredibly powerful technology. <eob>
And I decided at the beginning of this project <eob> that I would use <eol> that incredible technology <eob> to focus on the places <eob> where humans have impacted the planet. <eob>
As a species, we dig and scrape <eol> the Earth for resources, <eob> we produce energy, <eob> we raise animals and cultivate <eol> crops for food, <eob> we build cities, we move around, <eob> we create waste. <eob>
And in the process of doing <eol> all of these things, <eob> we shape landscapes <eol> and seascapes <eob> and cityscapes with increasing <eol> control and impunity. <eob>
So with that in mind, <eob> I would like to share a few of my <eol> overviews with you now. <eob>
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers <eob> waiting outside <eol> the entry to the port of Singapore. <eob>
This facility is the second-busiest in the world <eol> by terms of total tonnage, <eob> accounting for one-fifth <eol> of the world's shipping containers <eob> and one half of the annual supply <eob> of crude oil. <eob>
If you look closely at this <eol> overview, you'll see a lot of little specks. <eob>
Those are actually cows at a feedlot <eob> in Summerfield, Texas, <eol> in the United States. <eob>
So once cows reach <eol> a particular weight, <eob> roughly 300 kilograms, <eob> they are moved here and placed <eol> on a specialized diet. <eob>
Over the next three to four months, <eol> the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms <eob> before they are shipped off to slaughter. <eob>
You're also probably wondering <eol> about this glowing pool at the top there. <eob>
That gets its color from a unique combination <eol> of manure, chemicals <eob> and a particular type of algae <eol> that grows in the stagnant water. <eob>
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine <eob> in the Pilbara region <eol> of Western Australia, <eob> a beautiful yet scary scar <eol> on the face of the Earth. <eob>
Of the world's mined iron ore, <eob> 98 percent is used to make steel <eob> and is therefore a major component <eol> in the construction of buildings, <eob> automobiles or appliances <eol> such as your dishwasher or refrigerator. <eob>
This is a solar concentrator <eol> in Seville, Spain. <eob>
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors <eob> which are arrayed in concentric circles <eol> around an 140-meter-tall tower <eob> at its center. <eob>
At the top of the tower, <eob> there is a capsule <eol> of molten salt <eob> that gets heated by the beams <eol> of light reflected upwards <eob> from the mirrors below. <eob>
From there, the salt circulates <eol> to a storage tank underground, <eob> where it produces steam, <eob> which spins turbines <eob> and generates enough electricity <eol> to power 70,000 homes <eob> and offsets 30,000 tons <eol> of carbon dioxide emissions every year. <eob>
This overview shows deforestation <eol> in Santa Cruz, Bolivia <eob> immediately adjacent to untouched tracts of rainforest. <eob>
Deforestation in the country <eol> has primarily been driven <eob> by the expansion of mechanized agriculture <eob> and cattle ranching, <eob> so as the country tries <eol> to meet the demand of its growing population <eob> and feed them, <eob> the sacrificial destruction <eol> of its rainforest <eob> has taken place to do so. <eob>
It is estimated that the country lost <eol> 4.5 million acres of rainforest <eob> in one decade alone <eob> from 2000 until 2010. <eob>
This is the Eixample district <eol> in Barcelona, Spain. <eob>
So the overview perspective <eol> can be incredibly helpful <eob> to help us understand how cities function <eob> and how we can devise smarter solutions <eol> for urban planning, <eob> and this will become only more relevant <eob> as it is expected that 4.9 billion <eol> people will live in cities around the world <eob> by the year 2030. <eob>
This area of Barcelona is characterized <eol> by its strict grid pattern, <eob> apartments with communal courtyards <eob> and these octagonal intersections <eob> which allow for more sunlight, <eol> better ventilation <eob> and additional parking at street level. <eob>
And here we see that grid pattern <eol> but under much different circumstances. <eob>
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp <eol> in northern Kenya, <eob> the largest such facility <eol> of its kind in the world. <eob>
To cope with the influx of refugees <eol> who are fleeing Somalia, <eob> where there is famine and conflict, <eob> the UN has built this area <eol> gridded out at left <eob> called the LFO extension <eob> to house more and more refugees <eob> who are arriving and occupying these white dots, <eob> which are actually tents <eob> which will slowly fill up the area over time. <eob>
So if you have one of these overviews, <eob> you have a moment in time. <eob>
If we have two overviews, however, <eob> we are able to tell stories <eol> about changes in time. <eob>
I call that feature <eol> of the project "Juxtapose," <eob> and we'll share a few examples <eol> of it with you now. <eob>
So the tulip fields in Netherlands <eol> bloom every year in April. <eob>
So we take an image captured <eol> in March a few weeks before <eob> and contrast it to one taken a few weeks later. <eob>
We're able to watch the flowers <eol> bloom in this magnificent cascade of color. <eob>
It is estimated that the Dutch produce <eol> 4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year. <eob>
In 2015, two dams collapsed <eob> at an iron ore mine <eol> in southeastern Brazil, <eob> causing one of the worst environmental <eol> disasters <eob> in the history of the country. <eob>
It is estimated that 62 million cubic meters of waste <eob> were released when the dams broke, <eob> destroying numerous villages in the process, <eob> including Bento Rodrigues, <eol> seen here before ... <eob> and after the flood. <eob>
Ultimately, 19 people <eol> were killed in this disaster. <eob>
Half a million people did not have access <eol> to clean drinking water <eob> for an extended period of time, <eob> and the waste soon entered <eol> into the Doce River, <eob> extended for 650 kilometers <eob> all the way into the sea, <eob> killing unknowable amounts <eol> of plant and animal life along the way. <eob>
And lastly, here is a story <eol> related to the crisis in Syria, <eob> a conflict which has claimed the lives of hundreds <eol> of thousands of people <eob> and displaced millions. <eob>
So this patch of desert is seen <eol> in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011, <eob> the year the conflict started, <eob> and when we compare it to an image <eol> captured just this year in 2017, <eob> we see the construction <eol> of the Zaatari refugee camp. <eob>
So just as the astronauts <eol> of Apollo 8 <eob> watched the Earth rising above the lunar landscape <eol> for the first time, <eob> there is no way that you could have imagined <eob> what the places I just showed you <eol> look like from outer space. <eob>
And while you may enjoy the aesthetics of an image, <eob> once you learn exactly what it <eol> is you're seeing, <eob> you may struggle with the fact <eol> that you still like it. <eob>
And that's the tension <eol> I want to create with my work, <eob> because I believe it is that contemplation, <eob> that internal dialogue <eob> that will lead to greater <eol> interest in our planet <eob> and more awareness <eol> of what we're doing to it. <eob>
I believe that viewing the Earth <eol> from the overview perspective <eob> is more important now than ever before. <eob>
Through the incredible technology <eol> of these high-flying cameras, <eob> we can see, monitor and expose <eob> the unprecedented impact <eol> that we are having. <eob>
And whether we are scientists <eob> or engineers or policymakers <eob> or investors or artists, <eob> if we can adopt a more expansive perspective, <eob> embrace the truth of what is going on <eob> and contemplate the long-term health of our planet, <eob> we will create a better <eob> and safer and smarter future <eob> for our one and only home. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Why do people deliberately <eol> destroy cultural heritage? <eob>
By doing so, <eob> do they believe they're erasing <eol> our history? <eob> Our cultural memory? <eob> It's true that we are losing <eol> cultural heritage to erosion <eob> and natural disasters, <eob> but this is something <eol> that is simply difficult to avoid. <eob>
I'm here to show you today <eol> how we can use pictures -- <eob> your pictures -- <eob> to reclaim the history that is being lost <eob> using innovative technology <eob> and the effort of volunteers. <eob>
In the early 20th century, <eob> archaeologists discovered hundreds <eol> of statues and artifacts <eob> at the ancient city of Hatra, <eob> in northern Iraq. <eob>
Statues like this <eol> one were found in fragments, <eob> some of them missing their heads or arms, <eob> yet the clothing that they are wearing <eob> and their pose <eob> can still tell us their story. <eob>
For example, <eob> we believe <eol> that by wearing a knee-length tunic <eob> and open bare feet, <eob> this was representative of a priest. <eob>
However, with a closer look <eol> at this particular piece, <eob> we can see that this tunic being worn <eol> was elaborately decorated, <eob> which has led many researchers to believe <eob> this was actually a statue <eol> of a king performing his religious functions. <eob>
When the Mosul Cultural Museum <eol> opened in 1952 <eob> in northern Iraq, <eob> this statue, as well as others, <eob> were placed there to preserve <eol> them for future generations. <eob>
Following the US-led invasion <eol> of Iraq in 2003, <eob> a few statues and artifacts <eol> were relocated to Baghdad, <eob> but this statue remained. <eob>
Then in February <eol> of last year, a video was released, <eob> and it instantly went viral. <eob>
Maybe some of you remember seeing it. <eob> Here's a short clip. <eob>
(Video) (Singing in Arabic) <eob>
(Singing ends) <eob>
Not a very pleasant sight, right? <eob> Did you notice anything familiar <eol> in the video? <eob> There it is. <eob> There is that very statue, <eob> as it was toppled over, <eob> breaking into pieces. <eob>
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video, <eob> we were shocked. <eob>
Since we are archaeologists <eob> using innovative technology <eob> for digital preservation, <eob> an idea sprung to mind. <eob>
Maybe we can crowdsource the images <eol> that were taken of these artifacts <eob> before they were destroyed, <eob> to create digital reconstructions. <eob>
If we can do that, <eob> maybe we can put them <eol> into a virtual museum <eob> to tell that story. <eob>
And so two weeks <eol> after we saw this video, <eob> we started the project called Project Mosul. <eob>
Remember the pictures <eol> of the statue I showed you before? <eob>
This is actually the crowdsourced <eol> reconstruction of it <eob> before it was destroyed. <eob>
Now, many of you may be wondering, <eob> how exactly does this work? <eob>
Well, the key to this technology <eol> is called photogrammetry, <eob> and it was invented here, in Germany. <eob>
It is the technology that allows us <eol> to use two-dimensional images <eob> taken of the same object <eol> from different angles <eob> to create a 3D model. <eob>
I know you may be thinking this sounds <eol> like magic -- but it's not. <eob> Let me show you how it works. <eob>
Here are two crowdsourced <eol> images of the same statue. <eob>
What the computer can do <eob> is it can detect similar features <eol> between the photographs -- <eob> similar features of the object. <eob>
Then, by using multiple photos, <eob> in this case, it can begin to reconstruct <eol> the object in 3D. <eob>
In this case, <eob> you have the position of the cameras <eol> when each image was taken, <eob> shown in blue. <eob>
Now, this is a partial <eol> reconstruction, I admit, <eob> but why would I say partial? <eob>
Well, simply because <eol> the statue was positioned against a wall. <eob>
We don't have photographs <eol> taken of it from the back. <eob>
If I wanted to complete a full digital <eol> reconstruction of this statue, <eob> I would need a proper camera, <eob> tripods, proper lighting, <eob> but we simply can't do that <eol> with crowdsourced images. <eob>
Think about it: <eob> How many of you, when you visit a museum, <eob> take photographs <eol> of all parts of the statue, <eob> even the back side of it? <eob>
Well, maybe if some of you find Michelange <eol>lo's David interesting, <eob> I guess -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the thing is, <eob> if we can find more images of this object, <eob> we can improve the 3D model. <eob>
When we started the project, <eob> we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind. <eob>
We figured we may get a few images, <eob> some people interested, <eob> make one or two virtual <eol> reconstructions, <eob> but we had no idea that we had sparked <eol> something that would grow so quickly. <eob>
Before we knew it, <eob> we realized it was obvious: <eob> we could apply this same idea <eol> to lost heritage anywhere. <eob>
And so, we decided to change <eol> the name of the project to Rekrei. <eob>
Then, in the summer of last year, <eob> "The Economist" <eol> magazine's media lab reached out to us. <eob>
They asked us, <eob> "Hey, would you like us <eol> to build a virtual museum <eob> to put the reconstructions <eol> back inside, <eob> to tell the story?" <eob> Can you imagine us saying no? <eob> Of course not. <eob> We said yes! <eob> We were so excited. <eob>
This was exactly the initial <eol> dream of that project. <eob>
And so now, <eob> any of you can experience <eol> RecoVR Mosul on your phone, <eob> using Google Cardboard <eob> or a tablet or even <eol> YouTube 360. <eob>
Here is a screenshot <eol> from the virtual museum. <eob>
And there it is ... <eob> the partial reconstruction <eol> of the statue, <eob> as well as the Lion of Mosul, <eob> the first reconstruction <eol> completed by our project. <eob>
Although the video doesn't explicitly show <eol> the Lion of Mosul being destroyed, <eob> we have many other examples <eol> of large artifacts being destroyed <eob> that were simply too large <eol> to have been stolen. <eob>
For example, <eob> the Gate of Nimrud <eob> in northern Iraq. <eob>
This is a digital <eol> reconstruction from before, <eob> and this is actually during the destruction. <eob>
Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria: <eob> before... <eob> and after. <eob>
Although virtual reconstructions <eol> are primarily the main focus <eob> of our project, <eob> some people have been asking <eol> the question: <eob> Can we print them in 3D? <eob>
We believe 3D printing <eol> doesn't offer a straightforward solution <eob> to lost heritage. <eob>
Once an object is destroyed, <eob> it's gone. <eob>
But 3D printing does offer an addition <eob> to tell that story. <eob>
For example, <eob> I can show you here... <eob> There is the statue from Hatra <eob> and the Lion of Mosul. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Now, if you look closely, <eob> you'll notice that there are some parts <eol> that have been printed in color, <eob> and some parts that are in white or gray. <eob>
This part was added simply <eol> to hold the statues up. <eob>
This works the same way <eol> if you visit a museum, <eob> and a statue is found <eol> in fragments; <eob> it's put together for the people to see it. <eob>
This makes sense, right? <eob>
However, we're much more interested <eob> in what virtual reality <eol> has to offer for lost heritage. <eob>
Here is an example of one of the tower tombs <eob> that was destroyed in Palmyra. <eob> Using Sketchfab's online viewer, <eob> we can show that we have reconstructed <eol> three parts of the exterior of the tomb, <eob> but we also have photos of the inside, <eob> so we're beginning to create <eol> a reconstruction of the wall <eob> and the ceiling. <eob>
Archaeologists worked there for many, many years, <eob> so we also have architectural drawing plans <eol> of this lost heritage. <eob>
Unfortunately, we are not only losing cultural <eol> heritage to areas of conflict <eob> and at war -- <eob> we're also losing it <eol> to natural disasters. <eob>
This is a 3D model of Durbar Square <eol> in Kathmandu, <eob> before the earthquake that occurred <eol> last April... <eob> and this is after. <eob>
You may be thinking, <eob> you didn't create these 3D models <eol> with only tourist photographs, <eob> and that's true. <eob>
But what this represents <eob> is the ability for large, <eol> public organizations and private industry <eob> to come together for initiatives like ours. <eob>
And so one of the major challenges <eob> of our project, <eob> really, <eob> is to find photographs <eol> that were taken before something happens, right? <eob>
Well, the internet is basically a database <eol> with millions of images, right? <eob> Exactly. <eob> So we have begun to develop a tool <eob> that allows us to extract images <eol> from websites like Flickr, <eob> based on their geotags, <eob> to complete reconstructions. <eob>
Because we're not only losing cultural heritage <eol> to natural disasters and in war, <eob> but we're also losing it <eol> to something else. <eob> Any idea, just looking <eol> at these two pictures? <eob>
Maybe it's a little difficult to remember, <eob> but only a few weeks ago, <eob> this was the example of human destruction <eol> by human stupidity. <eob>
Because a tourist in Lisbon wanted <eol> to climb onto this statue <eob> and take a selfie with it -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and pulled it down with him. <eob>
So we're already finding photographs <eob> to complete a digital <eol> reconstruction of this. <eob>
We need to remember <eob> that the destruction of cultural heritage <eol> isn't a recent phenomenon. <eob>
In the 16th century, <eob> European priests <eol> and explorers burned thousands of Maya books in the Americas, <eob> of which we only have a handful left. <eob>
Fast-forward to 2001, <eob> when the Taliban blew up <eol> the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan. <eob>
You see, <eob> cultural heritage is about our shared <eol> global history. <eob>
It helps us connect with our ancestors <eol> and their stories, <eob> but we're losing pieces of it <eol> every day to natural disasters <eob> and in areas of conflict. <eob>
Of course, the loss of human life <eol> is the most heartbreaking loss ... <eob> but cultural heritage offers us a way <eol> to preserve the memory of the people <eob> for future generations. <eob>
We need your help <eob> to reclaim the history that is being lost. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Will you join us? <eob>
Do you remember these glow-in-the-dark little stars <eob> which you had on the ceiling <eol> when you were a boy or a girl? <eob> Yes? <eob> It is light. <eob> It is pure light. <eob>
I think I stared at them way too long <eob> when I was a five-year-old, you know? <eob>
It's so beautiful: <eob> no energy bill, no maintenance. <eob> It is there. <eob>
So two years ago, <eol> we went back to the lab, <eob> making it more durable, more light-emitting, <eob> with the experts. <eob>
And at the same time, we got <eol> a request from this guy — <eob> Van Gogh, the famous Van Gogh Foundation — <eob> who wanted to celebrate his 125th anniversary <eol> in the Netherlands. <eob>
And they came to me and asked, <eob> "Can you make a place <eol> where he feels more alive again <eob> in the Netherlands?" <eob> And I liked that question a lot, <eob> so in way, <eob> we sort of started to connect <eol> these two different worlds. <eob>
This is how my brain works, <eob> by the way. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I would love to keep on doing <eol> this for an hour, <eob> but OK — <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And this is the result that we made: <eob> a bicycle path which charges <eol> at daytime via the sun <eob> and glows at night, up to eight hours. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
... hinting towards a future <eol> which should be energy friendly <eob> and linking up the local grounds <eob> as Van Gogh literally walked <eol> and lived there in 1883. <eob>
And you can go there every night <eol> for free, no ticket needed. <eob>
People experience the beauty of cycling <eol> through the starry night, <eob> thinking about green energy and safety. <eob>
I want to create places <eol> where people feel connected again. <eob>
And it was somehow great <eol> to make these projects happen <eob> with the industry, with the infrastructure companies. <eob>
So when these sheikhs of Qatar started to call: <eob> "How much for 10 kilometers?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, really, that's a weird call <eol> you're going to get. <eob>
But it's fascinating <eob> that this is not just a sort of one-off, <eol> nice-to-have special. <eob>
I think this kind of creative thinking, <eol> these kinds of connections -- <eob> it's the new economy. <eob>
The World Economic Forum, the think <eol> tank in Geneva, <eob> did an interview with a lot <eol> of smart people <eob> all around the world, <eob> asking, "What are the top 10 skills <eol> you and I need to become successful?" <eob> And what is interesting, what you see here: <eob> it's not about money <eob> or being really good in C++, <eob> although these are great skills <eol> to have, I have to admit. <eob>
But look at number three, creativity; <eob> number two, critical thinking; <eob> number one, complex problem-solving -- <eob> all the things a robot or a computer <eol> is really bad at. <eob>
And this makes me very optimistic, <eol> very hopeful for the new world, <eob> that as we will live in <eol> this hyper-technological world, <eob> our human skills -- <eob> our desire for empathy, <eob> our desire for curiosity, <eob> our desire for beauty -- <eob> will be more appreciated again, <eob> and we will live in a world where creativity is our true capital. <eob>
And a creative process like that -- <eob> I don't know how it works for you, <eob> but in my brain, it always <eol> starts with a question: <eob> Why? <eob>
Why does a jellyfish emit light? <eob> Or a firefly? <eob> Or why do be accept pollution? <eob>
This is from my room <eol> in Beijing three years ago. <eob>
Left image is a good day -- Saturday. <eob>
I can see the cars <eol> and the people, the birds; <eob> life is OK in a dense urban city. <eob>
And on the right image — <eob> holy moly. <eob>
Pollution -- complete layers. <eob>
I couldn't even see <eol> the other side of the city. <eob>
And this image made me really sad. <eob>
This is not the bright future <eol> we envision here at TED -- <eob> this is the horror. <eob>
We live five to six years shorter; <eob> children have lung cancer <eol> when they're six years old. <eob>
And so in a weird, beautiful way, <eob> I, at that moment, <eol> became inspired by Beijing smog. <eob>
And the governments <eob> all around the world <eob> are fighting their war on smog, <eob> but I wanted to make something <eol> within the now. <eob>
So we decided to build <eol> the largest smog vacuum cleaner <eob> in the world. <eob>
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it <eob> and then releases it. <eob>
And we built the first one. <eob>
So it sucks up 30,000 cubic meters per hour, <eob> cleans it on the nano level -- <eol> the PM2.5, PM10 particles -- <eob> using very little electricity, <eob> and then releases the clean air, <eob> so we have parks, playgrounds, <eol> which are 55 to 75 percent more clean <eob> than the rest of the city. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Yes! <eob>
And every month or so, <eob> it opens like a spaceship -- <eob> like a Marilyn Monroe with the -- <eol> well, you know what. <eob> Anyway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this ... <eob> this is the stuff we are capturing. <eob>
This is Beijing smog. <eob> This is in our lungs right now. <eob>
If you live next to a highway, <eol> it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day. <eob> Are we insane? <eob> When did we say yes to that? <eob>
And we had buckets <eol> of this disgusting material <eob> in our studio, <eob> and on a Monday morning, <eol> we were discussing, we were like, <eob> "Shit, what should we do with it? <eob>
Should we throw it away? <eol> "Like," Help! <eob> "And then we realized: no, no, no, no, no — <eob> waste should not exist. <eob>
Waste for the one should be <eol> food for the other. <eob> So, here, maybe show it around. <eob>
Do not put this in your coffee. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And we realized that 42 percent <eol> is made out of carbon, <eob> and carbon, of course, <eol> under high pressure, <eob> you get... <eob> diamonds. <eob>
So, inspired by that, <eol> we compress it for 30 minutes -- <eob> (Cracking sound) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so by sharing — yeah, really! <eob>
(Applause) <eob> And so by sharing a ring, <eob> you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air <eob> to the city the tower is in. <eob>
I have one here -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A little floating cube. <eob> I will give one to you. <eob>
I'm not going to propose, don't worry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Are we good? <eob> You can show it around. <eob>
And we put this online — Kickstarter <eol> campaign, crowdfunding. <eob>
And people started to preorder it, <eob> but more importantly, <eol> they started to prepay it. <eob>
So the finance we made with the jewelry <eol> helped us to realize, <eob> to build the first tower. <eob>
And that's powerful. <eob> So the waste the activator, <eol> it was the enabler. <eob>
Also, the feedback from the community -- <eob> this is a wedding couple from India, <eob> where he proposed to her <eol> with the smog-free ring <eob> as a sign of true beauty, <eob> as a sign of hope. <eob>
And she said yes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I love this image so much for a lot <eol> of different reasons. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And right now, the project <eol> is touring through China, <eob> actually with the support of China's central government. <eob>
So the first goal is to create <eol> local clean-air parks, <eob> and that works already quite well -- <eob> 55, 75 percent more clean. <eob>
And at the same time, <eob> we team up with the NGOs, <eob> with the governors, <eob> with the students, <eob> with the tech people, <eob> to say, "Hey, what do we need to do <eol> to make a whole city smog-free?" <eob> It's about the dream of clean air. <eob> We do workshops. New ideas pop up. <eob>
These are smog-free bicycles <eol> which -- I'm Dutch, yes? -- <eob> I have this "bicycle DNA" <eol> inside of me somewhere. <eob>
And so it sucks up polluted air, <eob> it cleans it and releases it, <eob> in the fight against the car, <eob> in the celebration of the bicycle. <eob>
Yes? <eob> And so right now, we're working <eol> on a sort of "package deal," so to speak, <eob> where we say, "Smog-free towers, <eol> smog-free rings." <eob> We go to the mayors <eol> or the governors of this world, <eob> and say, "We can guarantee a short-term <eol> reduction of pollution <eob> between 20 and 40 percent. <eob> Please sign here right now." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
So it's all about connecting new technology <eol> with creative thinking. <eob>
And if you start thinking about that, <eob> there is so much you can imagine, <eob> so much more you can do. <eob>
We worked on dance floors <eol> which produce electricity <eob> when you dance on them. <eob>
We did the design for that -- 2008. <eob>
So it moves eight or nine millimeters, <eob> produces 25 watts. <eob>
The electricity that we generate <eol> is used for the lighting or the DJ booth. <eob>
So some of the sustainability <eol> is about doing more, <eob> not about doing less. <eob>
But also on a larger scale, <eob> the Netherlands, where I'm from, <eol> we live below sea level. <eob>
So because of these beauties -- <eob> the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers, <eol> built by hand in 1932 -- <eob> we live with the water, <eob> we fight with the water, <eob> we try to find harmony, <eob> but sometimes we forget. <eob>
And therefore, we made "Waterlicht," <eob> a combination of LEDs and lenses, <eob> which show how high the water level <eol> would be -- <eob> global change -- <eob> if we stop. <eob>
If, today, we all go home <eol> and we say, <eob> "Oh, whatever, somebody else will do it for us," <eob> or we'll wait for government <eol> or whomever. <eob>
You know, we're not going to do that. <eob> It goes wrong. <eob> And we placed this in public spaces <eob> all around the world. <eob>
Thousands of people showed up. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> You're too nice, you're too nice. <eol> That's not good for a designer. <eob>
So thousands of people showed up, <eob> and some, actually, were scared. <eob> And they left; they experienced <eol> the floods in 1953. <eob>
And others were mesmerized. <eob>
Can we make floating cities? <eob>
Can we generate electricity <eol> from the change in tides? <eob>
So I think it's so important <eol> to make experiences -- <eob> collective experiences -- <eob> where people feel connected <eol> with a vision, with a future <eob> and trigger what is possible. <eob>
At the same time, <eob> you know, these kinds of things -- <eol> they're not easy, yes? <eob>
It's a struggle. <eob>
And what I experienced in my life <eob> is that a lot of people say <eol> they want innovation, <eob> and they want the next and the new, the future. <eob> But the moment you present a new idea, <eob> there's this weird tendency <eol> to reply to every new idea <eob> starting with two words. <eob> Which are? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Audience guesses) <eob> No, not "How much?" It's more annoying. <eob>
What is it, guys? <eob>
Or you're really blessed people? <eob>
That's really good. <eob> "Yes, but." Very good. <eob> "Yes, but: it's too expensive, <eol> it's too cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow, <eob> it's too beautiful, it's too ugly, <eol> it cannot be done, it already exists." <eob> I heard everything about the same project <eob> in the same week. <eob> And I got really, really annoyed. <eob>
I got a bit of gray hair, <eol> started to dress in black like a true architect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And one morning I woke up <eol> and I said, "Daan, stop. <eob> This is dragging you down. <eob> You have to do something with this. <eob>
You have to use it <eol> as an ingredient, as a component." <eob> And so we decided to build, <eob> to realize the famous <eol> "Yes, but" chair. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this is an existing chair <eol> by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design. <eob> But we gave it a little "update," <eob> a little "hack," so to speak. <eob>
We placed a little voice-recognition <eol> element right here. <eob>
So the moment you sit on that chair, <eob> and you say those two horrible, <eob> creative-destructive, <eol> annoying little words -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
you get a short — <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
but pretty intense <eob> little shock <eol> on the back side of your bottom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> and that works; yeah, that works. <eob>
Some clients have left us, <eol> they got really mad. <eob>
Fortunately, the good ones have stayed. <eob>
And, of course, <eol> we also apply it to ourselves. <eob>
But ladies and gentlemen, let's not be afraid. <eob> Let's be curious, yes? <eob> And, you know, walking <eol> through TED in these days <eob> and hearing the other speakers <eob> and feeling the energy of the crowd, <eob> I was remembering this quote <eol> of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan, <eob> who once famously said, <eob> "On spacecraft earth, <eob> there are no passengers. <eob>
We are all crew. <eob> "And I think this so beautiful. <eob>
This is so beautiful! <eob>
We're not just consumers; we're makers: <eob> we make decisions, <eob> we make new inventions, <eob> we make new dreams. <eob>
And I think <eob> if we start implementing that kind <eol> of thinking even more <eob> within today, <eob> there's still a whole new world <eol> to be explored. <eob>
All right, thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So in 2011, I altered my name <eob> so that I could participate in Far Right <eol> youth camp in Hungary. <eob>
I was doing a PhD looking <eol> at youth political socialization -- <eob> why young people <eol> were developing political ideologies <eob> in a post-communist setting, <eob> and I saw that a lot of young people <eol> I was talking to <eob> were joining the Far Right, <eob> and this was astounding to me. <eob>
So I wanted to enroll <eol> in this youth camp <eob> to get a better understanding <eol> of why people were joining. <eob>
So a colleague enrolled me, <eob> and my last name sounds <eol> a little bit too Jewish. <eob>
So Erin got turned into Iréna, <eob> and Saltman got turned into Sós, <eob> which means "salty" in Hungarian. <eob>
And in Hungarian, your last name goes first, <eob> so my James Bond name turned <eol> into "Salty Irena," <eob> which is not something <eol> I would have naturally chosen for myself. <eob>
But going to this camp, <eob> I was further shocked to realize <eol> that it was actually really fun. <eob>
They talked very little about politics. <eob>
It was mostly learning <eol> how to ride horses, <eob> shooting a bow <eol> and arrow, <eob> live music at night, <eob> free food and alcohol, <eob> also some air-gun target practice <eob> using mainstream politicians' faces <eol> as targets. <eob>
And this seemed like a very, <eol> actually, friendly, inclusive group <eob> until you started talking <eol> or mentioning anything to do with the Roma population, <eob> Jewish people or immigrants, <eob> and then the discourse would become <eol> very hate-based very quickly. <eob>
So it led me into my work now, <eob> where we pose the question, <eob> "Why do people join violent extremist movements, <eob> and how do we effectively counter <eol> these processes?" <eob> In the aftermath <eol> of horrible atrocities and attacks <eob> in places like Belgium, France, <eol> but all over the world, <eob> sometimes it's easier <eol> for us to think, <eob> "Well, these must be sociopaths, <eob> these must be naturally violent individuals. <eob>
They must have something wrong <eol> with their upbringing." <eob> And what's really tragic <eob> is that oftentimes <eol> there's no one profile. <eob>
Many people come from educated backgrounds, <eob> different socioeconomic backgrounds, <eob> men and women, different ages, <eob> some with families, some single. <eob> So why? What is this allure? <eob>
And this is what I want <eol> to talk you through, <eob> as well as how do we challenge <eol> this in a modern era? <eob>
We do know, through research, <eob> that there are quite a number <eol> of different things <eob> that affect somebody's process <eol> of radicalization, <eob> and we categorize these <eol> into push and pull factors. <eob>
And these are pretty much similar <eol> for Far Right, neo-Nazi groups <eob> all the way to Islamist extremist <eol> and terrorist groups. <eob>
And push factors are basically <eol> what makes you vulnerable <eob> to a process of radicalization, <eob> to joining a violent extremist group. <eob>
And these can be a lot of different things, <eob> but roughly, a sense of alienation, a sense of isolation, <eob> questioning your own identity, <eob> but also feeling that your in-group <eol> is under attack, <eob> and your in group might be based <eol> on a nationality or an ethnicity <eob> or a religion, <eob> and feeling that larger powers <eol> around you are doing nothing to help. <eob>
Now, push factors alone do not <eol> make you a violent extremist, <eob> because if that were the fact, <eob> those same factors would go towards a group <eol> like the Roma population, <eob> and they're not a violently mobilized group. <eob>
So we have to look at the pull factors. <eob>
What are these violent extremist <eol> organizations offering <eob> that other groups are not offering? <eob>
And actually, this is usually <eol> very positive things, <eob> very seemingly empowering things, <eob> such as brotherhood and sisterhood <eob> and a sense of belonging, <eob> as well as giving somebody <eol> a spiritual purpose, <eob> a divine purpose <eol> to build a utopian society <eob> if their goals can be met, <eob> but also a sense of empowerment <eol> and adventure. <eob>
When we look at foreign terrorist fighters, <eob> we see young men with the wind <eol> in their hair <eob> out in the desert and women <eol> going to join them <eob> to have nuptials out <eol> in the sunset. <eob>
It's very romantic, and you become a hero. <eob>
For both men and women, <eol> that's the propaganda being given. <eob>
So what extremist groups are very good at <eob> is taking a very complicated, <eol> confusing, nuanced world <eob> and simplifying that world <eol> into black and white, <eob> good and evil. <eob>
And you become what is good, <eob> challenging what is evil. <eob>
So I want to talk a little bit <eol> about ISIS, Daesh, <eob> because they have been a game changer in how we look at these processes, <eob> and through a lot of the material <eol> and their tactics. <eob>
They're very much a modern movement. <eob>
One of the aspects <eol> is the internet and the usage of social media, <eob> as we've all seen in headlines tweeting <eol> and videos of beheadings. <eob>
But the internet alone <eol> does not radicalize you. <eob>
The internet is a tool. <eob>
You don't go online shopping for shoes <eob> and accidentally become a jihadist. <eob>
However, what the Internet <eol> does do is it is a catalyst. <eob>
It provides tools and scale and rapidity <eob> that doesn't exist elsewhere. <eob>
And with ISIS, all of a sudden, <eob> this idea of a cloaked, dark figure of a jihadist changed for us. <eob>
All of a sudden, we were <eol> in their kitchens. <eob>
We saw what they were eating for dinner. <eob> They were tweeting. <eob> We had foreign terrorist fighters tweeting <eol> in their own languages. <eob>
We had women going out there <eol> talking about their wedding day, <eob> about the births of their children. <eob>
We had gaming culture, <eol> all of a sudden, <eob> and references to Grand Theft Auto being made. <eob>
So all of a sudden, they were homey. <eob> They became human. <eob> And the problem is that trying to counter it, <eob> lots of governments and social media companies <eob> just tried to censor. <eob>
How do we get rid of terrorist content? <eob>
And it became a cat-and-mouse game <eob> where we would see accounts <eol> taken down and they'd just come back up, <eob> and an arrogance around somebody <eol> having a 25th account <eob> and material that was disseminated everywhere. <eob>
But we also saw a dangerous trend -- <eob> violent extremists know the rules <eol> and regulations of social media, too. <eob>
So we would see a banal <eol> conversation with a recruiter <eob> start on a mainstream platform, <eob> and at the point at which that conversation <eob> was going to become illegal, <eob> they would jump to a smaller, <eol> less regulated, <eob> more encrypted platform. <eob>
So all of a sudden, we couldn't track <eol> where that conversation went. <eob>
So this is a problem with censorship, <eob> which is why we need to develop <eol> alternatives to censorship. <eob>
ISIS is also a game-changer <eol> because it's state-building. <eob>
It's not just recruiting combatants; <eob> it's trying to build a state. <eob>
And what that means is all of a sudden, <eob> your recruitment model is much more broad. <eob>
You're not just trying to get fighters -- <eob> now you need architects, engineers, <eol> accountants, hackers and women. <eob>
We've actually seen a huge increase <eol> of women going <eob> in the last 24, <eol> but especially 12 months. <eob>
Some countries, one in four of the people <eol> going over to join <eob> are now women. <eob>
And so, this really changes <eob> who we're trying to counter <eol> this process with. <eob>
Now, not all doom and gloom. <eob>
So the rest I'd like to talk <eol> about some of the positive things <eob> and the new innovation in trying <eol> to prevent and counter violent extremism. <eob>
Preventing is very <eol> different than countering, <eob> and actually, you can think <eol> of it in medical terms. <eob>
So preventative medicine is, <eob> how do we make it so you <eol> are naturally resilient <eob> to this process of radicalization, <eob> whereas that is going to be different <eob> if somebody is already <eol> showing a symptom or a sign <eob> of belonging to a violent extremist ideology. <eob>
And so in preventative measures, <eob> we're talking more about <eol> really broad groups of people <eob> and exposure to ideas <eob> to make them resilient. <eob>
Whereas it's very different <eob> if somebody is starting to question <eol> and agree with certain things online, <eob> and it's also very different if somebody already <eol> has a swastika tattoo <eob> and is very much embedded <eol> within a group. <eob>
How do you reach them? <eob>
So I'd like to go through three examples <eol> of each one of those levels <eob> and talk you through <eob> what some of the new ways of engaging <eol> with people are becoming. <eob>
One is "Extreme Dialogue," <eob> and it's an educational program <eol> that we helped develop. <eob>
This one is from Canada, <eob> and it's meant to create dialogues <eol> within a classroom setting, <eob> using storytelling, <eob> because violent extremism can <eol> be very hard to try to explain, <eob> especially to younger individuals. <eob>
So we have a network <eol> of former extremists and survivors of extremism <eob> that tell their stories through video <eol> and create question-giving to classrooms, <eob> to start a conversation about the topic. <eob>
These two examples show Christianne, <eob> who lost her son, <eob> who radicalized and died <eol> fighting for ISIS, <eob> and Daniel is a former neo-Nazi <eob> who was an extremely violent neo-Nazi, <eob> and they pose questions about their lives <eol> and where they're at and regret, <eob> and force a classroom to have a dialogue around it. <eob>
Now, looking at that middle range <eol> of individuals, <eob> actually, we need a lot <eol> of civil society voices. <eob>
How do you interact with people <eol> that are looking for information online, <eob> that are starting to toy <eol> with an ideology, <eob> that are doing those searching identity <eol> questions? <eob>
How do we provide alternatives for that? <eob>
And that's when we combine <eol> large groups of civil society voices <eob> with creatives, techies, app developers, artists, comedians, <eob> and we can create really specified content <eob> and actually, online, disseminate it <eol> to very strategic audiences. <eob>
So one example would be creating <eol> a satirical video <eob> which makes fun of Islamophobia, <eob> and targeting it to 15- to 20-year-olds online <eob> that have an interest in white power <eol> music <eob> and live specifically in Manchester. <eob>
We can use these marketing tools <eol> to be very specific, <eob> so that we know when somebody's viewing, <eol> watching <eob> and engaging with that content, <eob> it's not just the average person, <eol> it's not me or you -- <eob> it's a very specific audience <eol> that we are looking to engage with. <eob>
Even more downstream, we developed <eol> a pilot program called "One to One," <eob> where we took former extremists <eob> and we had them reach out directly <eol> to a group of labeled neofascists <eob> as well as Islamist extremists, <eob> and put direct messages through Facebook Messenger into their inbox, saying, <eob> "Hey, I see where you're going. <eob>
I've been there. <eob>
If you want to talk, I'm here." <eob> Now, we kind of expected death threats <eol> from this sort of interaction. <eob>
It's a little alarming <eol> to have a former neo-Nazi say, "Hey, how are you?" <eob> But actually, we found <eol> that around 60 percent <eob> of the people reached out to responded, <eob> and of that, around another 60 percent <eol> had sustained engagement, <eob> meaning that they were having conversations <eob> with the hardest people to reach <eol> about what they were going through, <eob> planting seeds of doubt <eob> and giving them alternatives for talking <eol> about these subjects, <eob> and that's really important. <eob>
So what we're trying to do <eob> is actually bring <eol> unlikely sectors to the table. <eob>
We have amazing activists all over the world, <eob> but oftentimes, their messages <eol> are not strategic <eob> or they don't actually reach <eol> the audiences they want to reach. <eob>
So we work with networks <eol> of former extremists. <eob> We work with networks of young people <eol> in different parts of the world. <eob>
And we work with them to bring <eol> the tech sector to the table <eob> with artists and creatives <eol> and marketing expertise <eob> so that we can actually have <eol> a more robust and challenging of extremism <eob> that works together. <eob>
So I would say <eol> that if you are in the audience <eob> and you happen <eol> to be a graphic designer, <eob> a poet, a marketing expert, <eob> somebody that works in PR, <eob> a comedian -- <eob> you might not think <eol> that this is your sector, <eob> but actually, the skills <eol> that you have right now <eob> might be exactly what is needed <eob> to help challenge extremism effectively. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, my mother's a pediatrician, <eob> and when I was young, <eol> she'd tell the craziest stories <eob> that combined science with her <eol> overactive imagination. <eob>
One of the stories she told <eol> was that if you eat a lot of salt, <eob> all of the blood rushes up your legs, <eob> through your body, <eob> and shoots out <eol> the top of your head, <eob> killing you instantly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She called it "high blood pressure." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This was my first experience <eol> with science fiction, <eob> and I loved it. <eob>
So when I started to write my own <eol> science fiction and fantasy, <eob> I was surprised <eol> that it was considered un-African. <eob>
So naturally, I asked, what is African? <eob>
And this is what I know so far: <eob> Africa is important. <eob>
Africa is the future. <eob> It is, though. <eob> And Africa is a serious place <eol> where only serious things happen. <eob>
So when I present my work somewhere, <eol> someone will always ask, <eob> "What's so important about it? <eob>
How does it deal with real African issues <eob> like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?" <eob> And it doesn't. <eob>
My work is about Nairobi pop bands <eol> that want to go to space <eob> or about seven-foot-tall robots <eob> that fall in love. <eob>
It's nothing incredibly important. <eob>
It's just fun, fierce and frivolous, <eob> as frivolous as bubble gum -- <eob> "AfroBubbleGum." <eob>
So I'm not saying that agenda <eol> art isn't important; <eob> I'm the chairperson of a charity <eob> that deals with films and theaters <eol> that write about HIV and radicalization <eob> and female genital mutilation. <eob>
It's vital and important art, <eob> but it cannot be the only art <eol> that comes out of the continent. <eob>
We have to tell more stories <eob> that are vibrant. <eob>
The danger of the single story <eol> is still being realized. <eob>
And maybe it's because of the funding. <eob>
A lot of art is still dependent <eol> on developmental aid. <eob>
So art becomes a tool for agenda. <eob>
Or maybe it's because we've only seen <eol> one image of ourselves for so long <eob> that that's all we know how to create. <eob>
Whatever the reason, we need a new way, <eob> and AfroBubbleGum is one approach. <eob>
It's the advocacy of art for art's sake. <eob>
It's the advocacy of art <eol> that is not policy-driven <eob> or agenda-driven <eob> or based on education, <eob> just for the sake of imagination: <eob> AfroBubbleGum art. <eob>
And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists. <eob>
We have to judge our work <eol> for its potential poverty porn pitfalls. <eob>
We have to have tests <eol> that are similar to the Bechdel test, <eob> and ask questions like: <eob> Are two or more Africans <eol> in this piece of fiction healthy? <eob>
Are those same Africans financially <eol> stable and not in need of saving? <eob>
Are they having fun and enjoying life? <eob>
And if we can answer yes to two <eol> or more of these questions, <eob> then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And fun is political, <eob> because imagine <eol> if we have images of Africans who were vibrant <eob> and loving and thriving <eob> and living a beautiful, vibrant life. <eob>
What would we think of ourselves then? <eob>
Would we think that maybe <eol> we're worthy of more happiness? <eob>
Would we think of our shared humanity <eol> through our shared joy? <eob>
I think of these things when I create. <eob>
I think of the people and the places <eol> that give me immeasurable joy, <eob> and I work to represent them. <eob>
And that's why I write stories <eob> about futuristic girls <eol> that risk everything to save plants <eob> or to race camels <eob> or even just to dance, <eob> to honor fun, <eob> because my world is mostly happy. <eob>
And I know happiness is a privilege <eol> in this current splintered world <eob> where remaining hopeful requires diligence. <eob>
But maybe, if you join me <eol> in creating, curating and commissioning <eob> more <eob> AfroBubbleGum art, <eob> there might be hope for a different <eol> view of the world, <eob> a happy Africa view <eob> where children <eol> are strangely traumatized <eob> by their mother's dark sense of humor, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but also they're claiming fun, <eol> fierce and frivolous art <eob> in the name of all things <eol> unseriously African. <eob>
Because we're AfroBubbleGumists <eob> and there's so many more <eol> of us than you can imagine. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Someday, we may have robots <eol> as smart as people, <eob> artificial intelligence, AI. <eob>
How could that happen? <eob>
One route is that we'll just keep <eol> accumulating better software, <eob> like we've been doing for 70 years. <eob>
At past rates of progress, <eol> that may take centuries. <eob>
Some say it'll happen a lot faster <eob> as we discover grand new powerful <eol> theories of intelligence. <eob> I'm skeptical. <eob>
But a third scenario <eob> is what I'm going to talk about today. <eob>
The idea is to port the software <eol> from the human brain. <eob>
To do this, we're going to need <eol> three technologies to be good enough, <eob> and none of them are there yet. <eob>
First, we're going to need lots <eol> of cheap, fast, parallel computers. <eob>
Second, we're going to need <eol> to scan individual human brains <eob> in fine spatial and chemical detail, <eob> to see exactly what cells are where, <eol> connected to what, of what type. <eob>
And third, we're going <eol> to need computer models <eob> of how each kind of brain cell works -- <eob> taking input signals, <eol> changing interval state <eob> and sending output signals. <eob>
If we have good enough models <eol> of all the kinds of brain cells <eob> and a good enough model of the brain, <eob> we can put it together to make <eol> a good enough model of an entire brain, <eob> and that model would have <eol> the same input-output behavior as the original. <eob>
So if you talk to it, it might talk back. <eob>
If you ask it to do things, <eol> it might do them. <eob>
And if we could do that, <eol> everything would change. <eob>
People have been talking <eol> about this idea for decades, <eob> under the name of "uploads." <eob> I'm going to call them "ems." <eob> When they talk about it, they say, <eob> "Is this even possible? <eob>
If you made one, would it be conscious? <eob>
Or is it just an empty machine? <eob>
If you made one of me, <eol> is that me or someone else?" <eob> These are all fascinating questions <eol> that I'm going to ignore ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
because I see a neglected question: <eob> What would actually happen? <eob>
I became obsessed with this question. <eob>
I spent four years trying to analyze it, <eob> using standard academic tools, <eol> to guess what would happen, <eob> and I'm here to tell you what I found. <eob>
But be warned -- <eob> I'm not offering inspiration, <eol> I'm offering analysis. <eob>
I see my job as telling you <eol> what's most likely to happen <eob> if we did the least to avoid it. <eob>
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed <eol> by something I tell you here, <eob> you're just not paying attention. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, the first thing I can tell you <eob> is that ems spend most of their life <eol> in virtual reality. <eob>
This is what you might look like <eol> if you were using virtual reality. <eob> And this is what you might see: <eob> sunlight glinting off of water, <eol> you might hear gulls flying above, <eob> you might even feel the wind <eol> on your cheeks or smell seawater, <eob> with advanced hardware. <eob>
Now, if you were to spend <eol> a lot of time here, <eob> you might want a dashboard <eob> where you could do things like make a phone call, <eob> move to a new virtual world, <eob> check your bank account. <eob>
Now, while this is what you would <eol> look like in virtual reality, <eob> this is what an em would look <eol> like in virtual reality. <eob>
It's computer hardware <eol> sitting in a server rack somewhere. <eob>
But still, it could see <eol> and experience the same thing. <eob>
But some things are different for ems. <eob>
First, while you'll probably always <eol> notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real, <eob> to an em, it can feel as real to them <eol> as this room feels to you now <eob> or as anything ever feels. <eob>
And ems also have <eol> some more action possibilities. <eob>
For example, your mind just always <eol> runs at the same speed, <eob> but an em can add more <eol> or less computer hardware to run faster or slower, <eob> and therefore, if the world <eol> around them seems to be going too fast, <eob> they can just speed up their mind, <eob> and the world around them <eol> would seem to slow down. <eob>
In addition, an em can make <eol> a copy of itself at that moment. <eob>
This copy would remember <eol> everything the same, <eob> and if it starts out with the same speed, <eol> looking at the same speed, <eob> it might even need to be told, <eol> "You are the copy." <eob> And em could make archive copies, <eob> and with enough archives, <eob> an em can be immortal -- <eob> in principle, though not usually in practice. <eob>
And an em can move its brain, <eol> the computer that represents its brain, <eob> from one physical location to another. <eob>
Ems can actually move around the world <eol> at the speed of light, <eob> and by moving to a new location, <eob> they can interact more quickly <eol> with ems near that new location. <eob>
So far, I've been talking <eol> about what ems can do. <eob>
What do ems choose to do? <eob>
To understand that, <eol> we'll need to understand three key facts. <eob>
First, ems by definition <eol> do what the human they emulate would do <eob> in the same situation. <eob>
So their lives and behavior <eol> are very human. <eob>
They're mainly different <eol> because they're living in a different world. <eob>
Second, ems need <eol> real resources to survive. <eob>
You need food and shelter or you'll die. <eob>
Also, ems need computer hardware, <eol> energy, cooling, or they can't exist. <eob>
For every subjective minute <eol> that an em experiences, <eob> someone, usually that em, <eol> had to work to pay for it. <eob>
Third, ems are poor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The em population can grow quicker <eol> than the em economy, <eob> so that means wages fall down <eol> to em subsistence levels. <eob>
That means ems have to be <eol> working most of the time. <eob>
So that means this <eol> is what ems usually see: <eob> beautiful and luxurious, <eol> but desks -- <eob> they're working most of the time. <eob>
Now, a subsistence wage scenario, <eol> you might think, is exotic and strange, <eob> but it's actually the usual case <eol> in human history, <eob> and it's how pretty much all wild animals <eol> have ever lived, <eob> so we know what humans do in this situation. <eob>
Humans basically do what it takes to survive, <eob> and this is what lets me say <eol> so much about the em world. <eob>
When creatures are rich, like you, <eob> you have to know a lot about what they want <eob> to figure out what they do. <eob>
When creatures are poor, <eob> you know that they mostly do <eol> what it takes to survive. <eob>
So we've been talking about the em world <eol> from the point of view of the ems -- <eob> now, let's step back and look <eol> at their whole world. <eob>
First, the em world <eol> grows much faster than ours, <eob> roughly a hundred times faster. <eob>
So the amount of change <eol> we would experience in a century or two, <eob> they would experience in a year or two. <eob>
And I'm not really willing <eol> to project this age much beyond that, <eob> because plausibly by then something else will happen, <eol> I don't know what. <eob>
Second, the typical emulation <eol> runs even faster, <eob> roughly a thousand times human speed. <eob>
So for them, they experience thousands <eol> of years in this year or two, <eob> and for them, the world around them <eol> is actually changing more slowly <eob> than your world seems to change for you. <eob>
Third, ems are crammed together in <eol> a small number of very dense cities. <eob>
This is not only how they see themselves <eol> in virtual reality, <eob> it's also how they actually are physically crammed together. <eob>
So at em speeds, physical travel <eol> feels really painfully slow, <eob> so most em cities are self-sufficient, <eob> most war is cyber war, <eob> and most of the rest of the earth <eol> away from the em cities <eob> is left to the humans, <eol> because the ems really aren't that interested in it. <eob>
Speaking of humans, <eob> you were wanting to hear about that. <eob>
Humans must retire, at once, for good. <eob>
They just can't compete. <eob>
Now, humans start out owning all <eol> of the capital in this world. <eob>
The economy grows very fast, <eol> their wealth grows very fast. <eob>
Humans get rich, collectively. <eob>
As you may know, most humans <eol> today don't actually own that much <eob> besides their ability to work, <eob> so between now and then, <eol> they need to acquire sufficient assets, <eob> insurance or sharing arrangements, <eob> or they may starve. <eob>
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, you might wonder, <eob> why would ems let humans exist? <eob>
Why not kill them, take their stuff? <eob>
But notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today, <eob> and we don't kill them <eol> and take their stuff. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In part, that's because it would disrupt <eol> the institutions we share with them. <eob>
Other groups would wonder <eol> who's next, <eob> so plausibly, ems may well let humans retire <eol> in peace during the age of em. <eob>
You should worry more that the age <eol> of em only lasts a year or two <eob> and you don't know what happens next. <eob>
Ems are very much like humans, <eob> but they are not like the typical human. <eob>
The typical em is a copy <eol> of the few hundred most productive humans. <eob>
So in fact, they are as elite, <eol> compared to the typical human, <eob> as the typical billionaire, <eol> Nobel Prize winner, <eob> Olympic gold medalist, head of state. <eob>
Ems look on humans perhaps <eol> with nostalgia and gratitude, <eob> but not so much respect, <eob> which is, if you think about it, <eol> how you think about your ancestors. <eob>
We know many things about how humans <eol> differ in terms of productivity. <eob>
We can just use those <eol> to predict features of ems -- <eob> for example, they tend to be smart, <eol> conscientious, hard-working, <eob> married, religious, middle-aged. <eob>
These are features of ems. <eob>
Em world also contains enormous variety. <eob>
Not only does it continue on with most <eol> of the kinds of variety that humans do, <eob> including variety of industry and profession, <eob> they also have many new kinds of variety, <eob> and one of the most important <eol> is mind speed. <eob>
Ems can plausibly go from human speed <eob> up to a million times <eol> faster than human speed, <eob> and down to a billion times <eol> slower than human speed. <eob>
Faster ems tend to have markers <eol> of high status. <eob>
They embody more wealth. They win arguments. <eob> They sit at premium locations. <eob>
Slower ems are mostly retirees, <eob> and they are like the ghosts <eol> of our literature. <eob>
If you recall, ghosts <eol> are all around us -- <eob> you can interact with them <eol> if you pay the price. <eob>
But they don't know much, <eol> they can't influence much, <eob> and they're obsessed with the past, <eol> so what's the point? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Ems also have more variety <eol> in the structure of their lives. <eob>
This is your life: you start <eol> and you end, really simple. <eob> This is the life of an em, <eob> who every day splits off <eol> some short-term copies <eob> to do short-term tasks and then end. <eob>
We'll talk more about <eol> those short term versions in a moment, <eob> but they are much more efficient <eob> because they don't have <eol> to rest for the next day. <eob>
This em is more opportunistic. <eob>
They make more copies of themselves <eol> when there's more demand for that. <eob>
They don't know which way <eol> the future's going. <eob>
This is an em designer, <eob> who conceives of a large system <eob> and then breaks recursively into copies <eol> who elaborate that, <eob> so ems can implement larger, <eol> more coherent designs. <eob>
This an emulation plumber <eob> who remembers that every day, <eol> for the last 20 years, <eob> they only ever worked two hours a day, <eol> a life of leisure. <eob>
But what really happened is, <eol> every day they had a thousand copies, <eob> each of whom did a two-hour <eol> plumbing job, <eob> and only one of them went <eol> on to the next day. <eob>
Objectively, they're working well <eol> over 99 percent of the time. <eob>
Subjectively, <eol> they remember a life of leisure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This, again, is you. <eol> You start and you end. <eob>
This could be you if at the start of party, <eob> you took a drug that meant you <eol> would not remember that party <eob> ever after that day. <eob>
Some people do this, I'm told. <eob>
Toward the end of the party, <eob> will you say to yourself, <eol> "I'm about to die, this is terrible. <eob>
That person tomorrow isn't me, <eol> because they won't remember what I do. <eob> "Or you could say," <eol> I will go on tomorrow. <eob>
I just won't remember what I did. <eob> "This is an em who splits off <eol> a short-term copy <eob> to do a short-term task and then end. <eob>
They have the same two attitude <eol> possibilities. <eob>
They can say, "I'm a new short-term <eol> creature with a short life. I hate this." <eob> Or "I'm a part of a larger creature <eol> who won't remember this part." <eob> I predict they'll have that second attitude, <eob> not because it's philosophically correct, <eol> but because it helps them get along. <eob>
Today, if the president <eol> says we must invade Iraq, <eob> and you say, "Why?" <eob> and they say, "State secret," <eob> you're not sure if you can trust them, <eob> but for ems, a copy of the president <eol> and a copy of you can go inside a safe, <eob> explain all their secret reasons, <eob> and then one bit comes out <eol> from your copy to yourself, <eob> telling you if you were convinced. <eob>
So now you can know <eol> there is a good reason. <eob>
I know you guys are all eager <eol> to evaluate this world. <eob> You're eager to decide <eol> if you love it or hate it. <eob>
But think: your ancestors <eol> from thousands of years ago <eob> would have loved <eol> or hated your world <eob> based on the first few things <eol> they heard about it, <eob> because your world is really just weird. <eob>
So before judging a strange future world, <eol> you should really learn a lot about it, <eob> maybe read a whole book about it, <eob> and then, if you don't like it, work to change it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Whether you like it or not, <eob> radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making <eol> is coming at you fast, <eob> and it's going to change your life. <eob>
That's because it's now easy to take algorithms <eob> and embed them <eol> into computers <eob> and gather all that data <eol> that you're leaving on yourself <eob> all over the place, <eob> and know what you're like, <eob> and then direct the computers <eol> to interact with you <eob> in ways that are better <eol> than most people can. <eob>
Well, that might sound scary. <eob>
I've been doing this for a long time <eol> and I have found it to be wonderful. <eob>
My objective has been to have meaningful work <eob> and meaningful relationships <eol> with the people I work with, <eob> and I've learned that I couldn't have that <eob> unless I had that radical transparency <eol> and that algorithmic decision-making. <eob>
I want to show you why that is, <eob> I want to show you how it works. <eob>
And I warn you that some of the things <eol> that I'm going to show you <eob> probably are a little bit shocking. <eob>
Since I was a kid, I've had <eol> a terrible rote memory. <eob> And I didn't like following instructions, <eob> I was no good at following instructions. <eob>
But I loved to figure out <eol> how things worked for myself. <eob>
When I was 12, <eob> I hated school but I fell in love <eol> with trading the markets. <eob>
I caddied at the time, <eob> earned about five dollars a bag. <eob> And I took my caddying money, <eol> and I put it in the stock market. <eob>
And that was just because <eol> the stock market was hot at the time. <eob>
And the first company I bought <eob> was a company by the name <eol> of Northeast Airlines. <eob>
Northeast Airlines <eol> was the only company I heard of <eob> that was selling for less <eol> than five dollars a share. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I figured I could buy more shares, <eob> and if it went up, I'd make more money. <eob> So, it was a dumb strategy, right? <eob>
But I tripled my money, <eob> and I tripled my money <eol> because I got lucky. <eob>
The company was about to go bankrupt, <eob> but some other company acquired it, <eob> and I tripled my money. <eob>
And I was hooked. <eob>
And I thought, "This game is easy." <eob> With time, <eob> I learned this game is anything but easy. <eob>
In order to be an effective investor, <eob> one has to bet against the consensus <eob> and be right. <eob>
And it's not easy to bet <eol> against the consensus <eob> and be right. <eob>
One has to bet against the consensus <eob> and be right <eob> because the consensus is built <eol> into the price. <eob>
And in order to be an entrepreneur, <eob> a successful entrepreneur, <eob> one has to bet against the consensus <eob> and be right. <eob>
I had to be an entrepreneur <eol> and an investor -- <eob> and what goes along with that <eol> is making a lot of painful mistakes. <eob>
So I made a lot of painful mistakes, <eob> and with time, <eob> my attitude about those <eol> mistakes began to change. <eob>
I began to think of them as puzzles. <eob>
That if I could solve the puzzles, <eob> they would give me gems. <eob>
And the puzzles were: <eob> What would I do differently in the future <eol> so I wouldn't make that painful mistake? <eob>
And the gems were principles <eob> that I would then write down <eol> so I would remember them <eob> that would help me in the future. <eob>
And because I wrote them down so clearly, <eob> I could then -- <eob> eventually discovered -- <eob> I could then embed them into algorithms. <eob> And those algorithms would be <eol> embedded in computers, <eob> and the computers would make decisions along with me; <eob> and so in parallel, <eol> we would make these decisions. <eob>
And I could see how those decisions <eol> then compared with my own decisions, <eob> and I could see that those decisions <eol> were a lot better. <eob>
And that was because <eol> the computer could make decisions much faster, <eob> it could process a lot more information <eob> and it can process decisions much more -- <eob> less emotionally. <eob>
So it radically improved <eol> my decision-making. <eob>
Eight years after I started Bridgewater, <eob> I had my greatest failure, <eob> my greatest mistake. <eob>
It was late 1970s, <eob> I was 34 years old, <eob> and I had calculated that American banks <eob> had lent much more money <eol> to emerging countries <eob> than those countries were going <eol> to be able to pay back <eob> and that we would have <eol> the greatest debt crisis <eob> since the Great Depression. <eob>
And with it, an economic crisis <eob> and a big bear market in stocks. <eob>
It was a controversial view at the time. <eob>
People thought it was kind <eol> of a crazy point of view. <eob>
But in August 1982, <eob> Mexico defaulted on its debt, <eob> and a number of other countries followed. <eob>
And we had the greatest debt crisis <eob> since the Great Depression. <eob>
And because I had anticipated that, <eob> I was asked to testify to Congress <eol> and appear on "Wall Street Week," <eob> which was the show of the time. <eob>
Just to give you a flavor of that, <eol> I've got a clip here, <eob> and you'll see me in there. <eob>
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell, <eob> it's a great pleasure <eol> and a great honor to be able to appear before you <eob> in examination with what is going <eol> wrong with our economy. <eob>
The economy is now flat -- <eob> teetering on the brink of failure. <eob>
Martin Zweig: You were recently quoted <eol> in an article. <eob>
You said, "I can say this <eol> with absolute certainty <eob> because I know how markets work." <eob>
Ray Dalio: I can say <eol> with absolute certainty <eob> that if you look at the liquidity base <eob> in the corporations <eol> and the world as a whole, <eob> that there's such reduced level <eol> of liquidity <eob> that you can't return <eol> to an era of stagflation." <eob>
I look at that now, I think, <eol> "What an arrogant jerk!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong. <eob>
I mean, while the debt crisis happened, <eob> the stock market and the economy <eol> went up rather than going down, <eob> and I lost so much money <eol> for myself and for my clients <eob> that I had to shut down my operation <eol> pretty much, <eob> I had to let almost everybody go. <eob>
And these were like extended family, <eob> I was heartbroken. <eob>
And I had lost so much money <eob> that I had to borrow <eol> 4,000 dollars from my dad <eob> to help to pay my family bills. <eob>
It was one of the most painful <eol> experiences of my life ... <eob> but it turned out to be one <eol> of the greatest experiences of my life <eob> because it changed my attitude <eol> about decision-making. <eob>
Rather than thinking, "I'm right," <eob> I started to ask myself, <eob> "How do I know I'm right?" <eob> I gained a humility that I needed <eob> in order to balance my audacity. <eob>
I wanted to find the smartest people <eol> who would disagree with me <eob> to try to understand their perspective <eob> or to have them stress test my perspective. <eob>
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy. <eob>
In other words, <eob> not an autocracy in which I would lead <eol> and others would follow <eob> and not a democracy in which everybody's <eol> points of view were equally valued, <eob> but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy <eol> in which the best ideas would win out. <eob>
And in order to do that, <eob> I realized that we would need <eol> radical truthfulness <eob> and radical transparency. <eob>
What I mean by radical truthfulness <eob> and radical transparency <eob> is people needed to say <eol> what they really believed <eob> and to see everything. <eob>
And we literally tape almost all conversations <eob> and let everybody see everything, <eob> because if we didn't do that, <eob> we couldn't really have <eol> an idea meritocracy. <eob>
In order to have an idea meritocracy, <eob> we have let people speak <eol> and say what they want. <eob>
Just to give you an example, <eob> this is an email <eol> from Jim Haskel -- <eob> somebody who works for me -- <eob> and this was available <eol> to everybody in the company. <eob> "Ray, you deserve a 'D-' <eob> for your performance today in the meeting ... <eob> you did not prepare at all well <eob> because there is no way <eol> you could have been that disorganized." <eob> Isn't that great? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's great. <eob> It's great because, first of all, <eol> I needed feedback like that. <eob>
I need feedback like that. <eob>
And it's great because if I don't let Jim, and people like Jim, <eob> to express their points of view, <eob> our relationship wouldn't be the same. <eob>
And if I didn't make that public <eol> for everybody to see, <eob> we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy. <eob>
So for that last 25 years <eol> that's how we've been operating. <eob>
We've been operating with this radical <eol> transparency <eob> and then collecting these principles, <eob> largely from making mistakes, <eob> and then embedding those principles <eol> into algorithms. <eob>
And then those algorithms provide -- <eob> we're following the algorithms <eob> in parallel with our thinking. <eob>
That has been how we've run <eol> the investment business, <eob> and it's how we also deal <eol> with the people management. <eob>
In order to give you a glimmer <eol> into what this looks like, <eob> I'd like to take you into a meeting <eob> and introduce you to a tool <eol> of ours called the "Dot Collector" <eob> that helps us do this. <eob>
A week after the US election, <eob> our research team held a meeting <eob> to discuss what a Trump presidency <eol> would mean for the US economy. <eob>
Naturally, people had <eol> different opinions on the matter <eob> and how we were approaching the discussion. <eob> The "Dot Collector" collects these views. <eob>
It has a list of a few dozen attributes, <eob> so whenever somebody thinks <eol> something about another person's thinking, <eob> it's easy for them to convey their assessment; <eob> they simply note the attribute <eol> and provide a rating from one to 10. <eob>
For example, as the meeting began, <eob> a researcher named Jen rated me a three — <eob> in other words, badly — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> for not showing a good balance <eol> of open-mindedness and assertiveness. <eob>
As the meeting transpired, <eob> Jen's assessments of people <eol> added up like this. <eob>
Others in the room <eol> have different opinions. <eob> That's normal. <eob> Different people are always <eol> going to have different opinions. <eob>
And who knows who's right? <eob>
Let's look at just what people thought <eol> about how I was doing. <eob>
Some people thought <eol> I did well, <eob> others, poorly. <eob> With each of these views, <eob> we can explore the thinking <eol> behind the numbers. <eob>
Here's what Jen and Larry said. <eob>
Note that everyone gets to express their thinking, <eob> including their critical thinking, <eob> regardless of their position <eol> in the company. <eob>
Jen, who's 24 years old <eol> and right out of college, <eob> can tell me, the CEO, <eol> that I'm approaching things terribly. <eob>
This tool helps people both express <eol> their opinions <eob> and then separate themselves <eol> from their opinions <eob> to see things from a higher level. <eob>
When Jen and others shift <eol> their attentions from inputting their own opinions <eob> to looking down on the whole screen, <eob> their perspective changes. <eob>
They see their own opinions as just one of many <eob> and naturally start asking themselves, <eob> "How do I know my opinion is right?" <eob> That shift in perspective <eol> is like going from seeing in one dimension <eob> to seeing in multiple dimensions. <eob> And it shifts the conversation <eol> from arguing over our opinions <eob> to figuring out objective criteria <eol> for determining which opinions are best. <eob>
Behind the "Dot Collector" <eol> is a computer that is watching. <eob> It watches what all these people are thinking <eob> and it correlates <eol> that with how they think. <eob>
And it communicates advice back to each of them <eol> based on that. <eob>
Then it draws the data <eol> from all the meetings <eob> to create a pointilist painting <eol> of what people are like <eob> and how they think. <eob>
And it does that guided by algorithms. <eob>
Knowing what people are like helps <eol> to match them better with their jobs. <eob>
For example, <eob> a creative thinker who is unreliable <eob> might be matched up with someone <eol> who's reliable but not creative. <eob>
Knowing what people are like also <eol> allows us to decide <eob> what responsibilities to give them <eob> and to weigh our decisions <eol> based on people's merits. <eob>
We call it their believability. <eob>
Here's an example of a vote that we took <eob> where the majority of people <eol> felt one way ... <eob> but when we weighed the views <eol> based on people's merits, <eob> the answer was completely different. <eob>
This process allows us <eol> to make decisions not based on democracy, <eob> not based on autocracy, <eob> but based on algorithms that take people's believability <eol> into consideration. <eob>
Yup, we really do this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We do it because it eliminates <eob> what I believe to be one of the greatest <eol> tragedies of mankind, <eob> and that is people arrogantly, <eob> naïvely holding opinions in their minds that are wrong, <eob> and acting on them, <eob> and not putting them out there <eol> to stress test them. <eob>
And that's a tragedy. <eob>
And we do it because it elevates ourselves <eol> above our own opinions <eob> so that we start to see things <eol> through everybody's eyes, <eob> and we see things collectively. <eob>
Collective decision-making is so much better <eol> than individual decision-making <eob> if it's done well. <eob>
It's been the secret sauce <eol> behind our success. <eob>
It's why we've made more money <eol> for our clients <eob> than any other hedge fund in existence <eob> and made money 23 out <eol> of the last 26 years. <eob>
So what's the problem <eol> with being radically truthful <eob> and radically transparent with each other? <eob>
People say it's emotionally difficult. <eob>
Critics say it's a formula <eol> for a brutal work environment. <eob>
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do <eol> with how are brains are prewired. <eob>
There's a part of our brain that would like <eol> to know our mistakes <eob> and like to look at our weaknesses <eol> so we could do better. <eob>
I'm told that that's the prefrontal cortex. <eob>
And then there's a part of our brain <eol> which views all of this as attacks. <eob>
I'm told that that's the amygdala. <eob>
In other words, <eob> there are two you's inside you: <eob> there's an emotional you <eob> and there's an intellectual you, <eob> and often they're at odds, <eob> and often they work against you. <eob>
It's been our experience <eol> that we can win this battle. <eob>
We win it as a group. <eob>
It takes about 18 months typically <eob> to find that most people prefer operating this way, <eob> with this radical transparency <eob> than to be operating in a more opaque environment. <eob>
There's not politics, <eol> there's not the brutality of -- <eob> you know, all of that hidden, <eol> behind-the-scenes -- <eob> there's an idea meritocracy <eol> where people can speak up. <eob> And that's been great. <eob> It's given us more effective work, <eob> and it's given us more effective relationships. <eob>
But it's not for everybody. <eob>
We found something like 25 <eol> or 30 percent of the population <eob> it's just not for. <eob>
And by the way, <eob> when I say radical transparency, <eob> I'm not saying transparency about everything. <eob>
I mean, you don't have to tell somebody <eol> that their bald spot is growing <eob> or their baby's ugly. <eob>
So, I'm just talking about -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
talking about the important things. <eob> So -- <eob>
So when you leave this room, <eob> I'd like you to observe yourself <eol> in conversations with others. <eob>
Imagine if you knew <eol> what they were really thinking, <eob> and imagine if you knew <eol> what they were really like ... <eob> and imagine if they knew what you were really thinking <eob> and what were really like. <eob>
It would certainly clear things up a lot <eob> and make your operations <eol> together more effective. <eob>
I think it will improve <eol> your relationships. <eob>
Now imagine that you can have algorithms <eob> that will help you gather <eol> all of that information <eob> and even help you make decisions <eol> in an idea-meritocratic way. <eob>
This sort of radical transparency <eol> is coming at you <eob> and it is going to affect your life. <eob>
And in my opinion, <eob> it's going to be wonderful. <eob>
So I hope it is as wonderful for you <eob> as it is for me. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I want to start this talk <eol> by showing y'all a photo, <eob> and it's a photo many of you <eol> have probably seen before. <eob>
So I want you all to take a moment <eob> and look at this photo, <eob> and really reflect on some <eol> of the things that come to mind, <eob> and what are some of those things, <eol> those words. <eob>
Now, I'm going to ask you all <eol> to look at me. <eob>
What words come to mind <eol> when you look at me? <eob>
What separates that man up there <eob> from me? <eob>
The man in that photo is named David Kirby <eob> and it was taken in 1990 <eol> as he was dying from AIDS-related illness, <eob> and it was subsequently published <eol> in "Life Magazine." <eob> The only real thing separating me <eol> from Kirby <eob> is about 30 years of medical advancements <eol> in the way that we treat HIV and AIDS. <eob>
So what I want to ask next is this: <eob> If we have made such exponential progress <eob> in combatting HIV, <eob> why haven't our perceptions <eol> of those with the virus evolved alongside? <eob>
Why does HIV elicit this reaction <eol> from us when it's so easily managed? <eob>
When did the stigmatization even occur, <eob> and why hasn't it subsided? <eob>
And these are not easy questions to answer. <eob>
They're the congealing <eol> of so many different factors and ideas. <eob>
Powerful images, like this <eol> one of Kirby, <eob> these were the faces of the AIDS <eol> crisis in the '80s and '90s, <eob> and at the time the crisis <eol> had a very obvious impact <eob> on an already stigmatized group of people, <eob> and that was gay men. <eob>
So what the general straight public <eol> saw was this very awful thing <eob> happening to a group of people <eol> who were already on the fringes of society. <eob>
The media at the time began to use <eol> the two almost interchangeably -- <eob> gay and AIDS -- <eob> and at the 1984 Republican National Convention, <eob> one of the speakers joked that gay stood <eol> for: "Got AIDS yet?" <eob> And that was the mindset at the time. <eob>
But as we started to understand the virus more <eob> and how it was transmitted, <eob> we realized that that risk had increased <eol> its territory. <eob>
The highly profiled case of Ryan <eol> White in 1985, <eob> who was a 13-year-old hemophiliac <eob> who had contracted HIV <eol> from a contaminated blood treatment, <eob> and this marked the most profound <eol> shift in America's perception of HIV. <eob>
No longer was it restricted <eol> to these dark corners of society, <eob> to queers and drug users, <eob> but now it was affecting people <eob> that society deemed worthy of their empathy, <eob> to children. <eob>
But that permeating fear <eol> and that perception, it still lingers. <eob>
And I want a show of hands <eol> for these next few questions. <eob>
How many of you in here <eol> were aware that with treatment, <eob> those with HIV not only fend off AIDS completely, <eob> but they live full and normal lives? <eob>
Y'all are educated. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How many of you are aware <eol> that with treatment, <eob> those with HIV <eol> can reach an undetectable status, <eob> and that makes them virtually uninfectious? <eob> Much less. <eob> How many of you were aware <eol> of the pre- and postexposure treatments <eob> that are available <eol> that reduce the risk of transmission <eob> by over 90 percent? <eob>
See, these are incredible advancements <eol> that we have made in fighting HIV, <eob> yet they have not managed <eol> to dent the perception <eob> that most Americans have of the virus <eol> and those living with it. <eob>
And I don't want you to think <eol> I'm downplaying the danger of this virus, <eob> and I am not ignorant of the harrowing past <eol> of the AIDS epidemic. <eob>
I am trying to convey that there <eol> is hope for those infected <eob> and HIV is not the death sentence <eol> it was in the '80s. <eob>
And now you may ask, and I asked this question <eol> myself initially: <eob> Where are the stories? <eob>
Where are these people living with HIV? <eob>
Why haven't they been vocal? <eob>
How can I believe these successes, <eol> or these statistics, <eob> without seeing the successes? <eob>
And this is actually a very easy question <eol> for me to answer. <eob>
Fear, stigma and shame: <eob> these keep those living with HIV <eol> in the closet, so to speak. <eob>
Our sexual histories are as personal <eol> to us as our medical histories, <eob> and when you overlap the two, <eob> you can find yourself in <eol> a very sensitive space. <eob>
The fear of how others perceive us <eol> when we're honest <eob> keeps us from doing many things in life, <eob> and this is the case <eol> for the HIV-positive population. <eob>
To face social scrutiny and ridicule <eol> is the price that we pay for transparency, <eob> and why become a martyr <eob> when you can effectively pass <eol> as someone without HIV? <eob>
After all, there are no physical indications <eol> you have the virus. <eob>
There's no sign that you wear. <eob>
There is safety in assimilation, <eob> and there is safety in invisibility. <eob>
I'm here to throw back that veil <eol> and share my story. <eob>
So in the fall of 2014, <eol> I was a sophomore in college <eob> and like most college students, <eol> I was sexually active, <eob> and I generally took precautions <eol> to minimize the risk that sex carries. <eob>
Now, I say generally, <eol> because I wasn't always safe. <eob>
It only takes a single misstep <eol> before we're flat on the ground, <eob> and my misstep is pretty obvious. <eob>
I had unprotected sex, <eol> and I didn't think much of it. <eob>
Fast-forward about three weeks, <eob> and it felt like I'd been trampled by a herd of wildebeest. <eob>
The aches in my body were like nothing <eol> I have felt before or since. <eob>
I would get these bouts of fever <eol> and chill. <eob>
I would reel with nausea, <eol> and it was difficult to walk. <eob>
Being a biology student, <eol> I had some prior exposure to disease, <eob> and being a fairly informed gay man, <eol> I had read a bit on HIV, <eob> so to me, it clicked <eol> that this was seroconversion, <eob> or as it's sometimes called, <eol> acute HIV infection. <eob>
And this is the body's reaction <eob> in producing antibodies <eol> to the HIV antigen. <eob>
It's important to note that not everybody <eol> goes through this phase of sickness, <eob> but I was one of the lucky ones who did. <eob>
And I was lucky as in, <eol> there were these physical symptoms <eob> that let me know, hey, something is wrong, <eob> and it let me detect the virus <eol> pretty early. <eob>
So just to clarify, <eol> just to hit the nail on head, <eob> I got tested on campus. <eob>
And they said they would call me <eol> the next morning with the results, <eob> and they called me, <eob> but they asked me to come in <eol> and speak to the doctor on staff. <eob>
And the reaction I received from her <eol> wasn't what I was expecting. <eob>
She reassured me what I already knew, <eol> that this wasn't a death sentence, <eob> and she even offered to put me <eol> in contact with her brother, <eob> who had been living with HIV since the early '90s. <eob>
I declined her offer, <eol> but I was deeply touched. <eob>
I was expecting to be reprimanded. <eob>
I was expecting pity and disappointment, <eob> and I was shown compassion <eol> and human warmth, <eob> and I'm forever grateful for that first exchange. <eob>
So obviously for a few weeks, <eol> I was a physical mess. <eob>
Emotionally, mentally, I was doing OK. <eob>
I was taking it well. <eob>
But my body was ravaged, <eob> and those close to me, <eol> they weren't oblivious. <eob>
So I sat my roommates down, <eob> and I let them know <eol> I'd been diagnosed with HIV, <eob> that I was about to receive treatment, <eol> and I didn't want them to worry. <eob>
And I remember the look on their faces. <eob>
They were holding each other <eol> on the couch and they were crying, <eob> and I consoled them. <eob>
I consoled them about my own bad news, <eob> but it was heartwarming to see that they cared. <eob>
But from that night, I noticed a shift <eob> in the way that I was treated at home. <eob>
My roommates wouldn't touch anything of mine, <eob> and they wouldn't eat anything <eol> I had cooked. <eob>
Now, in South Louisiana, <eob> we all know that you don't refuse food. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I'm a damn good cook, <eol> so don't think that passed me by. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But from these first silent hints, <eol> their aversion got gradually more obvious <eob> and more offensive. <eob>
I was asked to move my toothbrush <eol> from the bathroom, <eob> I was asked to not share towels, <eob> and I was even asked to wash <eol> my clothes on a hotter setting. <eob>
This wasn't head lice, y'all. <eob>
This wasn't scabies. This was HIV. <eob> It can be transmitted through blood, <eob> sexual fluids like semen or vaginal fluids <eob> and breast milk. <eob>
Since I wasn't sleeping with my roommates, <eob> I wasn't breastfeeding them -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and we weren't reenacting "Twilight," <eob> I was of no risk to them <eob> and I made this aware to them, <eob> but still, this discomfort, it continued, <eob> until eventually I was asked to move out. <eob>
And I was asked to move out <eob> because one of my roommates had shared <eol> my status with her parents. <eob>
She shared my personal <eol> medical information to strangers. <eob>
And now I'm doing that in a roomful <eol> of 300 of y'all, <eob> but at the time, this was not something <eol> I was comfortable with, <eob> and they expressed their discomfort <eol> with their daughter living with me. <eob>
So being gay, raised <eol> in a religious household <eob> and living in the South, <eob> discrimination wasn't new to me. <eob>
But this form was, <eob> and it was tremendously disappointing <eob> because it came from such <eol> an unlikely source. <eob>
Not only were these college-educated people, <eob> not only were they other members <eol> of the LGBT community, <eob> but they were also my friends. <eob> So I did. I moved out at the end <eol> of the semester. <eob>
But it wasn't to appease them. <eob>
It was out of respect for myself. <eob>
I wasn't going to subject myself to people <eob> who were unwilling to remedy <eol> their ignorance, <eob> and I wasn't going to let something <eol> that was now a part of me <eob> ever be used as a tool against me. <eob>
So I opted for transparency <eol> about my status, <eob> always being visible. <eob>
And this is what I like to call <eol> being the everyday advocate. <eob>
The point of this transparency, <eol> the point of this everyday advocacy, <eob> was to dispel ignorance, <eob> and ignorance is a very scary word. <eob>
We don't want to be seen as ignorant, <eob> and we definitely don't want <eol> to be called it. <eob>
But ignorance is not synonymous <eol> with stupid. <eob>
It's not the inability to learn. <eob>
It's the state you're in before you learn. <eob>
So when I saw someone coming <eol> from a place of ignorance, <eob> I saw an opportunity for them to learn. <eob>
And hopefully, if I could spread <eol> some education, <eob> then I could mitigate situations for others <eob> like I had experienced <eol> with my roommates <eob> and save someone else down the line <eol> that humiliation. <eob>
So the reactions I received haven't been <eol> all positive. <eob>
Here in the South, <eob> we have a lot stigma due <eol> to religious pressures, <eob> our lack of a comprehensive sex education <eob> and our general conservative outlook on anything sexual. <eob>
We view this as a gay disease. <eob>
Globally, most new HIV infections <eol> occur between heterosexual partners, <eob> and here in the States, <eol> women, especially women of color, <eob> are at an increased risk. <eob>
This is not a gay disease. <eob>
It never has been. <eob>
It's a disease <eol> we should all be concerned with. <eob>
So initially, I felt limited. <eob>
I wanted to expand my scope <eol> and reach beyond what was around me. <eob>
So naturally, <eob> I turned to the dark underworld <eol> of online dating apps, <eob> to apps like Grindr, <eob> and for those of you <eol> who are unfamiliar, <eob> these are dating apps <eol> targeted towards gay men. <eob>
You can upload a profile and a picture <eob> and it will show you available guys <eol> within a radius. <eob>
Y'all have probably heard of Tinder. <eob>
Grindr has been around for a lot longer, <eob> since it was much harder <eol> to meet your future gay husband <eob> at church or the grocery store, <eob> or whatever straight people did <eob> before they found out they could date <eol> on their phones. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So on Grindr, if you liked <eol> what you saw or read, <eob> you could send someone a message, <eol> you can meet up, you can do other things. <eob>
So on my profile, I obviously stated <eol> that I had HIV, <eob> I was undetectable, and I welcomed questions <eol> about my status. <eob>
And I received a lot of questions <eob> and a lot of comments, <eol> both positive and negative. <eob>
And I want to start with the negative, <eob> just to frame some of this ignorance <eol> that I've mentioned before. <eob>
And most of these negative comments <eol> were passing remarks or assumptions. <eob>
They would assume things about my sex life <eol> or my sex habits. <eob> They would assume I put myself <eol> or others at risk. <eob>
But very often I would just be met <eol> with these passing ignorant remarks. <eob>
In the gay community, it's common <eol> to hear the word "clean" <eob> when you're referring to someone <eol> who is HIV negative. <eob>
Of course the flip side to that <eol> is being unclean, or dirty, <eob> when you do have HIV. <eob>
Now, I'm not sensitive <eob> and I'm only truly dirty <eol> after a day in the field, <eob> but this is damaging language. <eob>
This is a community-driven stigma <eob> that keeps many gay men <eol> from disclosing their status, <eob> and it keeps those newly diagnosed <eob> from seeking support <eol> within their own community, <eob> and I find that truly distressing. <eob>
But thankfully, the positive responses <eol> have been a lot more numerous, <eob> and they came from guys <eol> who were curious. <eob>
And they were curious <eol> about the risks of transmission, <eob> or what exactly "undetectable" meant, <eob> or where they could get tested, <eob> or some guys would ask me <eol> about my experiences, <eob> and I could share my story with them. <eob>
But most importantly, <eob> I would get approached by guys <eol> who were newly diagnosed with HIV <eob> and they were scared, <eol> and they were alone, <eob> and they didn't know what step <eol> to take next. <eob>
They didn't want to tell their family, <eob> they didn't want to tell their friends <eob> and they felt damaged, <eol> and they felt dirty. <eob>
And I did whatever I could <eol> to immediately calm them, <eob> and then I would put them <eol> in contact with AcadianaCares, <eob> which is a wonderful resource <eol> we have in our community <eob> for those with HIV. <eob>
And I'd put them in contact <eol> with people I knew personally <eob> so that they could not only have <eol> this safe space to feel human again, <eob> but so they could also have <eol> the resources they needed <eob> in affording their treatment. <eob>
And this was by far the most humbling aspect <eob> of my transparency, <eob> that I could have some positive impact <eol> on those who were suffering like I did, <eob> that I could help those <eol> who were in the dark, <eob> because I had been there, and it wasn't <eol> a good place to be. <eob>
These guys came from all different backgrounds, <eob> and many of them weren't as informed as I had been, <eob> and they were coming to me <eol> from a place of fear. <eob>
Some of these people I knew personally, <eob> or they knew of me, <eob> but many more, they were anonymous. <eob>
They were these blank profiles <eol> who were too afraid to show their faces <eob> after what they had told me. <eob>
And on the topic of transparency, <eob> I want to leave y'all with a few thoughts. <eob>
I found that with whatever risk <eol> or gamble I took <eob> in putting my face out there, <eob> it was well worth any negative comment, <eob> any flak I received, <eob> because I felt I was able to make <eol> this real and this tangible impact. <eob>
And it showed me that our efforts resound, <eob> that we can alter <eol> the lives that we encounter for the good, <eob> and they in turn can take that momentum <eol> and push it even further. <eob>
And if any of you or anyone <eol> you know is dealing with HIV, <eob> or if you want to see <eol> what resources you have in your community, <eob> or just educate yourself more on the disease, <eob> here are some wonderful national sites <eol> that you can access <eob> and you are more than welcome <eol> to find me after this talk <eob> and ask me anything you'd like. <eob>
We've all heard the phrase "to see <eol> the forest through the trees," <eob> so I implore all of you here to really see <eol> the human through the disease. <eob>
It's a very easy thing <eol> to see numbers and statistics <eob> and only see the perceived dangers. <eob>
It's a much harder thing to see <eol> all the faces behind those numbers. <eob>
So when you find yourself <eol> thinking those things, those words, <eob> what you might have thought <eol> looking at David Kirby, <eob> I ask you instead, <eob> think son, <eob> or think brother, <eob> think friend <eob> and most importantly, think human. <eob>
Seek education when faced with ignorance, <eob> and always be mindful, <eob> and always be compassionate. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I used to think <eob> the whole purpose of life <eol> was pursuing happiness. <eob>
Everyone said the path <eol> to happiness was success, <eob> so I searched for that ideal job, <eob> that perfect boyfriend, <eol> that beautiful apartment. <eob>
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, <eob> I felt anxious and adrift. <eob>
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- <eol> they struggled with this, too. <eob>
Eventually, I decided to go <eol> to graduate school for positive psychology <eob> to learn what truly makes people happy. <eob>
But what I discovered <eol> there changed my life. <eob>
The data showed that chasing happiness <eol> can make people unhappy. <eob>
And what really struck me was this: <eob> the suicide rate <eol> has been rising around the world, <eob> and it recently reached <eol> a 30-year high in America. <eob>
Even though life <eol> is getting objectively better <eob> by nearly every conceivable standard, <eob> more people feel hopeless, <eob> depressed and alone. <eob>
There's an emptiness gnawing away at people, <eob> and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it. <eob>
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder: <eob> Is this all there is? <eob>
And according to the research, <eol> what predicts this despair <eob> is not a lack of happiness. <eob>
It's a lack of something else, <eob> a lack of having meaning in life. <eob>
But that raised some questions for me. <eob>
Is there more to life than being happy? <eob>
And what's the difference between being happy <eob> and having meaning in life? <eob>
Many psychologists define happiness <eol> as a state of comfort and ease, <eob> feeling good in the moment. <eob>
Meaning, though, is deeper. <eob>
The renowned psychologist <eol> Martin Seligman says <eob> meaning comes from belonging <eol> to and serving something beyond yourself <eob> and from developing the best within you. <eob>
Our culture is obsessed with happiness, <eob> but I came to see that seeking meaning <eol> is the more fulfilling path. <eob>
And the studies show <eol> that people who have meaning in life, <eob> they're more resilient, <eob> they do better in school and at work, <eob> and they even live longer. <eob>
So this all made me wonder: <eob> How can we each live more meaningfully? <eob>
To find out, I spent five years interviewing <eol> hundreds of people <eob> and reading through thousands <eol> of pages of psychology, <eob> neuroscience and philosophy. <eob>
Bringing it all together, <eob> I found that there are what I call <eol> four pillars of a meaningful life. <eob>
And we can each create lives of meaning <eob> by building some or all of these <eol> pillars in our lives. <eob>
The first pillar is belonging. <eob>
Belonging comes <eol> from being in relationships <eob> where you're valued <eol> for who you are intrinsically <eob> and where you value others as well. <eob>
But some groups and relationships <eol> deliver a cheap form of belonging; <eob> you're valued for what you believe, <eob> for who you hate, <eob> not for who you are. <eob>
True belonging springs from love. <eob>
It lives in moments among individuals, <eob> and it's a choice -- <eol> you can choose to cultivate belonging with others. <eob>
Here's an example. <eob> Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper <eob> from the same street vendor in New York. <eob>
They don't just conduct <eol> a transaction, though. <eob>
They take a moment to slow down, talk, <eob> and treat each other like humans. <eob>
But one time, Jonathan <eol> didn't have the right change, <eob> and the vendor said, <eob> "Don't worry about it." <eob> But Jonathan insisted on paying, <eob> so he went to the store and bought <eol> something he didn't need <eob> to make change. <eob>
But when he gave the money to the vendor, <eob> the vendor drew back. <eob> He was hurt. <eob> He was trying to do something kind, <eob> but Jonathan had rejected him. <eob>
I think we all reject people <eol> in small ways like this without realizing it. <eob> I do. <eob> I'll walk by someone I know <eol> and barely acknowledge them. <eob>
I'll check my phone <eol> when someone's talking to me. <eob>
These acts devalue others. <eob>
They make them feel invisible <eol> and unworthy. <eob>
But when you lead with love, <eol> you create a bond <eob> that lifts each of you up. <eob>
For many people, belonging is <eol> the most essential source of meaning, <eob> those bonds to family and friends. <eob>
For others, the key to meaning <eol> is the second pillar: purpose. <eob>
Now, finding your purpose <eol> is not the same thing <eob> as finding that job that makes you happy. <eob>
Purpose is less about what you want <eol> than about what you give. <eob>
A hospital custodian told me her <eol> purpose is healing sick people. <eob>
Many parents tell me, <eob> "My purpose is raising my children." <eob> The key to purpose is using <eol> your strengths to serve others. <eob>
Of course, for many of us, <eol> that happens through work. <eob>
That's how we contribute and feel needed. <eob>
But that also means <eol> that issues like disengagement at work, <eob> unemployment, <eob> low labor force participation -- <eob> these aren't just economic problems, <eol> they're existential ones, too. <eob>
Without something worthwhile to do, <eob> people flounder. <eob>
Of course, you don't have <eol> to find purpose at work, <eob> but purpose gives you something to live for, <eob> some "why" that drives you forward. <eob>
The third pillar of meaning <eol> is also about stepping beyond yourself, <eob> but in a completely different way: <eob> transcendence. <eob>
Transcendent states <eol> are those rare moments <eob> when you're lifted above the hustle <eol> and bustle of daily life, <eob> your sense of self fades away, <eob> and you feel connected <eol> to a higher reality. <eob>
For one person I talked to, transcendence <eol> came from seeing art. <eob> For another person, it was at church. <eob>
For me, I'm a writer, <eol> and it happens through writing. <eob>
Sometimes I get so in the zone <eol> that I lose all sense of time and place. <eob>
These transcendent experiences <eol> can change you. <eob>
One study had students <eol> look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees <eob> for one minute. <eob>
But afterwards they felt <eol> less self-centered, <eob> and they even behaved more generously <eob> when given the chance to help someone. <eob>
Belonging, purpose, <eob> transcendence. <eob>
Now, the fourth pillar <eol> of meaning, I've found, <eob> tends to surprise people. <eob>
The fourth pillar is storytelling, <eob> the story you tell yourself about yourself. <eob>
Creating a narrative from the events <eol> of your life brings clarity. <eob>
It helps you understand <eol> how you became you. <eob>
But we don't always realize <eol> that we're the authors of our stories <eob> and can change the way <eol> we're telling them. <eob>
Your life isn't just a list of events. <eob>
You can edit, interpret <eol> and retell your story, <eob> even as you're constrained by the facts. <eob>
I met a young man named Emeka, <eol> who'd been paralyzed playing football. <eob>
After his injury, Emeka told himself, <eob> "My life was great playing football, <eob> but now look at me." <eob> People who tell stories like this — <eob> "My life was good. <eob>
Now it's bad. "— <eob> tend to be more anxious and depressed. <eob>
And that was Emeka for a while. <eob>
But with time, he started <eol> to weave a different story. <eob>
His new story was, <eob> "Before my injury, <eol> my life was purposeless. <eob>
I partied a lot and was <eol> a pretty selfish guy. <eob>
But my injury made me realize <eol> I could be a better man." <eob> That edit to his story <eol> changed Emeka's life. <eob>
After telling the new story to himself, <eob> Emeka started mentoring kids, <eob> and he discovered what his purpose was: <eob> serving others. <eob>
The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this <eol> a "redemptive story," <eob> where the bad is redeemed by the good. <eob>
People leading meaningful lives, <eol> he's found, <eob> tend to tell stories about their lives <eob> defined by redemption, growth and love. <eob>
But what makes people <eol> change their stories? <eob>
Some people get help from a therapist, <eob> but you can do it <eol> on your own, too, <eob> just by reflecting <eol> on your life thoughtfully, <eob> how your defining experiences shaped you, <eob> what you lost, what you gained. <eob>
That's what Emeka did. <eob>
You won't change your story overnight; <eob> it could take years and be painful. <eob>
After all, we've all suffered, <eol> and we all struggle. <eob>
But embracing those painful memories <eol> can lead to new insights and wisdom, <eob> to finding that good that sustains you. <eob>
Belonging, purpose, transcendence, <eob> storytelling: <eob> those are the four pillars of meaning. <eob>
When I was younger, <eob> I was lucky enough to be surrounded <eol> by all of the pillars. <eob>
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse <eol> from our home in Montreal. <eob>
Sufism is a spiritual practice <eol> associated with the whirling dervishes <eob> and the poet Rumi. <eob>
Twice a week, Sufis <eol> would come to our home <eob> to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories. <eob>
Their practice also involved <eol> serving all of creation <eob> through small acts of love, <eob> which meant being kind even when people wronged you. <eob>
But it gave them a purpose: <eol> to rein in the ego. <eob>
Eventually, I left home for college <eob> and without the daily grounding <eol> of Sufism in my life, <eob> I felt unmoored. <eob>
And I started searching for those things <eol> that make life worth living. <eob>
That's what set me on this journey. <eob>
Looking back, I now realize <eob> that the Sufi house <eol> had a real culture of meaning. <eob>
The pillars were part of the architecture, <eob> and the presence of the pillars <eol> helped us all live more deeply. <eob>
Of course, the same principle applies <eob> in other strong communities as well -- <eob> good ones and bad ones. <eob>
Gangs, cults: <eob> these are cultures of meaning <eol> that use the pillars <eob> and give people something <eol> to live and die for. <eob>
But that's exactly why we as a society <eob> must offer better alternatives. <eob>
We need to build these pillars <eol> within our families and our institutions <eob> to help people become their best selves. <eob>
But living a meaningful life takes work. <eob>
It's an ongoing process. <eob>
As each day goes by, <eol> we're constantly creating our lives, <eob> adding to our story. <eob>
And sometimes we can get off track. <eob>
Whenever that happens to me, <eob> I remember a powerful experience <eol> I had with my father. <eob>
Several months after I graduated from college, <eob> my dad had a massive heart attack <eol> that should have killed him. <eob>
He survived, and when I asked him <eol> what was going through his mind <eob> as he faced death, <eob> he said all he could think <eol> about was needing to live <eob> so he could be there <eol> for my brother and me, <eob> and this gave him the will <eol> to fight for life. <eob>
When he went under anesthesia <eol> for emergency surgery, <eob> instead of counting backwards <eol> from 10, <eob> he repeated our names like a mantra. <eob>
He wanted our names to be <eol> the last words he spoke on earth <eob> if he died. <eob>
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi. <eob>
It's a humble life, <eob> but a good life. <eob>
Lying there facing death, <eol> he had a reason to live: <eob> love. <eob>
His sense of belonging within his family, <eob> his purpose as a dad, <eob> his transcendent meditation, <eol> repeating our names -- <eob> these, he says, are the reasons <eol> why he survived. <eob>
That's the story he tells himself. <eob>
That's the power of meaning. <eob>
Happiness comes and goes. <eob>
But when life is really good <eob> and when things are really bad, <eob> having meaning gives you <eol> something to hold on to. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As you heard, I'm a physicist. <eob> And I think the way we talk <eol> about physics needs a little modification. <eob>
I am from just down the road here; <eol> I don't live here anymore. <eob>
But coming from round here means <eol> that I have a northern nana, <eob> my mum's mom. <eob>
And Nana is very bright; <eol> she hasn't had much formal education, <eob> but she's sharp. <eob>
And when I was a second-year undergraduate <eol> studying physics at Cambridge, <eob> I remember spending an afternoon <eol> at Nana's house in Urmston <eob> studying quantum mechanics. <eob>
And I had these folders open in front of me <eob> with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- <eol> let's be honest. <eob>
And Nana came along, <eol> and she looked at this folder, <eob> and she said, "What's that?" <eob> I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana." <eob> And I tried to explain something <eol> about what was on the page. <eob>
It was to do with the nucleus <eol> and Einstein A and B coefficients. <eob>
And Nana looked very impressed. <eob>
And then she said, "Oh. <eob>
What can you do when you know that?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I think I said something about computers, <eob> because it was all <eol> I could think of at the time. <eob>
But you can broaden that question out, <eol> because it's a very good question — <eob> "What can you do when you know that?" <eob> when "that" is physics? <eob> And I've come to realize <eol> that when we talk about physics in society <eob> and our sort of image of it, <eob> we don't include the things <eol> that we can do when we know that. <eob>
Our perception of what physics <eol> is needs a bit of a shift. <eob>
Not only does it need a bit of a shift, <eob> but sharing this different perspective <eol> matters for our society, <eob> and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist <eol> and I'm biased <eob> and I think we're the most important <eol> people in the world. <eob> Honest. <eob>
So, the image of physics -- <eol> we've got an image problem, let's be honest -- <eob> it hasn't moved on much from this. <eob>
This is a very famous photograph <eol> that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927. <eob>
This is when the great minds <eol> of physics were grappling <eob> with the nature of determinism <eob> and what it means only to have a probability <eob> that a particle might be somewhere, <eob> and whether any of it was real. <eob>
And it was all very difficult. <eob>
And you'll notice they're all <eol> very stern-looking men in suits. <eob>
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying, <eol> "Marie Antoinette," <eob> which would be a turn-up for the books -- <eob> Marie Curie, third from the left <eol> on the bottom there, <eob> she was allowed in, <eol> but had to dress like everybody else. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, this is what physics is like -- <eol> there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics, <eob> these are to do with waves and particles. <eob>
That is an artist's impression <eol> of two black holes colliding, <eob> which makes it look worth watching, <eol> to be honest. <eob>
I'm glad I didn't have to write <eol> the risk assessment <eob> for whatever was going on there. <eob>
The point is: this is the image <eol> of physics, right? <eob>
It's weird and difficult, <eob> done by slightly strange people <eol> dressed in a slightly strange way. <eob>
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else <eob> and fundamentally, why should I care? <eob>
And the problem with that <eol> is that I'm a physicist, <eob> and I study this. <eob>
This -- this is my job, right? <eob>
I study the interface between the atmosphere <eol> and the ocean. <eob>
The atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive, <eob> and the thin layer <eol> that joins them together <eob> is really important, <eob> because that's where things go <eol> from one huge reservoir to the other. <eob>
You can see that the sea surface -- <eol> that was me who took this video -- <eob> the average height of those waves <eol> by the way, was 10 meters. <eob>
So this is definitely physics happening here -- <eob> there's lots of things -- this is definitely physics. <eob>
And yet it's not included <eol> in our cultural perception of physics, <eob> and that bothers me. <eob>
So what is included <eol> in our cultural perception of physics? <eob>
Because I'm a physicist, <eol> there has to be a graph, right? <eob> That's allowed. <eob> We've got time along the bottom here, <eol> from very fast things there, <eob> to things that take <eol> a long time over here. <eob>
Small things at the bottom, <eol> big things up there. <eob>
So, our current cultural image of physics <eol> looks like this. <eob>
There's quantum mechanics <eol> down in that corner, <eob> it's very small, it's very weird, <eob> it happens very quickly, <eob> and it's a long way <eol> down in the general ... <eob> on the scale of anything <eol> that matters for everyday life. <eob>
And then there's cosmology, <eol> which is up there; <eob> very large, very far away, <eob> also very weird. <eob>
And if you go to some places <eob> like black holes in the beginning <eol> of the universe, <eob> we know that these are frontiers <eol> in physics, right? <eob>
There's lots of work being done <eol> to discover new physics <eob> in these places. <eob>
But the thing is, you will notice there's <eol> a very large gap in the middle. <eob>
And in that gap, there are many things. <eob>
There are planets and toasts <eol> and volcanoes and clouds <eob> and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins <eob> and all sorts of things <eol> that make up our everyday life. <eob>
And these are also run by physics, <eol> you'd be surprised — <eob> there is physics in the middle, <eol> it's just that nobody talks about it. <eob>
And the thing about all of these <eol> is that they all run <eob> on a relatively small <eol> number of physical laws, <eob> things like Newton's laws of motion, <eob> thermodynamics, <eob> some rotational dynamics. <eob>
The physics in the middle applies <eol> over a huge range, <eob> from very, very small things <eol> to very, very big things. <eob>
You have to try very hard <eol> to get outside of this. <eob>
And there is also a frontier <eol> in research physics here, <eob> it's just that nobody talks about it. <eob>
This is the world of the complex. <eob>
When these laws work together, <eol> they bring about <eob> the beautiful, messy, complex world <eol> we live in. <eob>
Fundamentally, this is the bit <eol> that really matters to me <eob> on an everyday basis. <eob>
And this is the bit <eol> that we don't talk about. <eob>
There's plenty of physics <eol> research going on here. <eob>
But because it doesn't involve pointing at stars, <eob> people for some reason <eol> think it's not that. <eob>
Now, the cool thing about this <eol> is that there are so many things <eob> in this middle bit, <eob> all following the same physical laws, <eob> that we can see those laws at work <eob> almost all the time around us. <eob>
I've got a little video here. <eob>
So the game is, one of these eggs <eol> is raw and one of them has been boiled. <eob>
I want you to tell me which one is which. <eob> Which one's raw? <eob>
(Audience responds) <eob>
The one on the left -- yes! <eob>
And even though you might not <eol> have tried that, you all knew. <eob>
The reason for that is, <eol> you set them spinning, <eob> and when you stop the cooked egg, <eol> the one that's completely solid, <eob> you stop the entire egg. <eob>
When you stop the other one, <eol> you only stop the shell; <eob> the liquid inside is still rotating <eol> because nothing's made it stop. <eob>
And then it pushes the shell round again, <eol> so the egg starts to rotate again. <eob>
This is brilliant, right? <eob>
It's a demonstration of something in physics <eob> that we call the law of conservation of angular momentum, <eob> which basically says that if you set something <eol> spinning <eob> about a fixed axis, <eob> that it will keep spinning unless you <eol> do something to stop it. <eob>
And that's really fundamental <eol> in how the universe works. <eob>
And it's not just eggs <eol> that it applies to, <eob> although it's really useful <eol> if you're the sort of person -- <eob> and apparently, these people do exist -- <eob> who will boil eggs <eol> and then put them back in the fridge. <eob> Who does that? Don't admit to it -- it's OK. We won't judge you. <eob> But it's also got much broader applicabilities. <eob>
This is the Hubble Space Telescope. <eob>
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very <eol> tiny part of the sky. <eob>
Hubble has been floating in <eol> free space for 25 years, <eob> not touching anything. <eob>
And yet it can point to a tiny region of sky. <eob>
For 11 and a half days, <eol> it did it in sections, <eob> accurately enough to take <eol> amazing images like this. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> How does something that is <eob> not touching anything <eob> know where it is? <eob>
The answer is that right <eol> in the middle of it, it has something <eob> that, to my great disappointment, <eol> isn't a raw egg, <eob> but basically does the same job. <eob>
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning, <eob> and because of the law <eol> of conservation of angular momentum, <eob> they keep spinning with the same axis, <eol> indefinitely. <eob>
Hubble kind of rotates around them, <eol> and so it can orient itself. <eob>
So the same little physical law <eol> we can play with in the kitchen and use, <eob> also explains what makes possible some <eol> of the most advanced technology <eob> of our time. <eob>
So this is the fun bit of physics, <eol> that you learn these patterns <eob> and then you can apply them <eol> again and again and again. <eob>
And it's really rewarding when you spot <eol> them in new places. <eob>
This is the fun of physics. <eob>
I have shown that egg video <eol> to an audience full of businesspeople once <eob> and they were all dressed up very smartly <eol> and trying to impress their bosses. <eob>
And I was running out of time, <eol> so I showed the egg video and then said, <eob> "Well, you can work it out, <eol> and ask me afterwards to check." <eob> Then I left the stage. <eob>
And I had, literally, <eob> middle-aged grown <eol> men tugging on my sleeve afterwards, <eob> saying, "Is it this? <eob>
Is it this? <eob> "And when I said," <eol> Yes. "They went," Yes! <eob> " <eob>
The joy that you get from spot <eol>ting these patterns <eob> doesn't go away when you're an adult. <eob>
And that's really important, <eob> because physics is all about patterns, <eob> and a small number of patterns <eol> give you access <eob> to almost all of the physics <eol> in our everyday world. <eob>
The thing that's best about this <eol> is it involves playing with toys. <eob>
Things like the egg shouldn't <eol> be dismissed as the mundane little things <eob> that we just give the kids <eol> to play with on a Saturday afternoon <eob> to keep them quiet. <eob>
This is the stuff that actually really matters, <eob> because this is the laws <eol> of the universe and it applies to eggs <eob> and toast falling butter-side <eol> down and all sorts of other things, <eob> just as much as it applies <eol> to modern technology <eob> and anything else that's going <eol> on in the world. <eob>
So I think we should play <eol> with these patterns. <eob>
Basically, there are a small number of concepts <eob> that you can become familiar <eol> with using things in your kitchen, <eob> that are really useful for life <eol> in the outside world. <eob>
If you want to learn about <eob> thermodynamics, <eob> a duck is a good place to start, <eob> for example, why their feet don't get cold. <eob>
Once you've got a bit <eol> of thermodynamics with the duck, <eob> you can also explain fridges. <eob>
Magnets that you can play <eol> with in your kitchen <eob> get you to wind turbines <eol> and modern energy generation. <eob>
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, <eol> which is always a good thing to play with. <eob>
If you're at a boring party, fish some raisins <eol> out of the bar snacks, <eob> put them in some lemonade. <eob>
It's got three consequences. <eob>
First thing is, it's quite good <eol> to watch; try it. <eob>
Secondly, it sends the boring people away. <eob>
Thirdly, it brings <eol> the interesting people to you. <eob>
You win on all fronts. <eob>
And then there's spin and gas laws <eol> and viscosity. <eob>
There's these little patterns, and they're <eol> right around us everywhere. <eob>
And it's fundamentally democratic, right? <eob>
Everybody has access to the same physics; <eol> you don't need a big, posh lab. <eob>
When I wrote the book, <eol> I had the chapter on spin. <eob> I had written a bit about <eol> toast falling butter-side down. <eob>
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine <eol> who's not a scientist, <eob> for him to read and tell me what he thought, <eob> and he took the chapter away. <eob>
He was working overseas. <eob>
I got this text message back <eol> from him a couple of weeks later, <eob> and it said, "I'm at breakfast <eol> in a posh hotel in Switzerland, <eob> and I really want to push <eol> toast off the table, <eob> because I don't believe what you wrote." <eob> And that was the good bit -- <eol> he doesn't have to. <eob>
He can push the toast off the table <eol> and try it for himself. <eob>
And so there's two important things <eol> to know about science: <eob> the fundamental laws <eol> we've learned through experience and experimentation, <eob> work. <eob>
The day we drop an apple and it goes up, <eob> then we'll have a debate about gravity. <eob>
Up to that point, we basically know <eol> how gravity works, <eob> and we can learn the framework. <eob>
Then there's the process <eol> of experimentation: <eob> having confidence in things, <eol> trying things out, <eob> critical thinking -- how we move science forward -- <eob> and you can learn both of those things <eob> by playing with toys <eol> in the everyday world. <eob>
And it's really important, <eob> because there's all this talk <eol> about technology, <eob> we've heard talks <eol> about quantum computing <eob> and all these mysterious, <eol> far-off things. <eob>
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies <eol> that are about this size, <eob> we still walk about, sit on chairs <eol> that are about this size, <eob> we still live in the physical world. <eob>
And being familiar with these concepts <eol> means we're not helpless. <eob>
And I think it's really important <eol> that we're not helpless, <eob> that society feels it can look at things, <eob> because this isn't about knowing <eol> all the answers. <eob> It's about having the framework <eol> so you can ask the right questions. <eob>
And by playing with these fundamental <eol> little things in everyday life, <eob> we gain the confidence <eol> to ask the right questions. <eob>
So, there's a bigger thing. <eob>
In answer to Nana's question <eob> about what can you do when you know that -- <eob> because there's lots of stuff <eol> in the everyday world <eob> that you can do when you know that, <eob> especially if you've got eggs <eol> in the fridge -- <eob> there's a much deeper answer. <eob>
And so there's all the fun <eol> and the curiosity <eob> that you could have playing with toys. <eob>
By the way -- why should kids <eol> have all the fun, right? <eob>
All of us can have fun playing with toys, <eob> and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it. <eob>
You can blame me, it's fine. <eob>
So when it comes to reasons <eol> for studying physics, for example, <eob> here is the best reason <eol> I can think of: <eob> I think that each of us <eol> has three life-support systems. <eob>
We've got our own body, we've got a planet <eob> and we've got our civilization. <eob>
Each of those is an independent <eol> life-support system, <eob> keeping us alive in its own way. <eob>
And they all run <eol> on the fundamental physical laws <eob> that you can learn in the kitchen <eol> with eggs and teacups and lemonade, <eob> and everything else you can play with. <eob>
This is the reason, for example, <eob> why something like climate change <eol> is such a serious problem, <eob> because It's two of these life-support systems, <eob> our planet and our civilization, <eob> kind of butting up against each other; <eob> they're in conflict, and we need <eol> to negotiate that boundary. <eob>
And the fundamental physical laws <eol> that we can learn <eob> that are the way the world <eol> around us works, <eob> are the tools at the basis of everything; <eob> they're the foundation. <eob>
There's lots of things <eol> to know about in life, <eob> but knowing the foundations <eol> is going to get you a long way. <eob>
And I think this, if you're not interested <eol> in having fun with physics <eob> or anything like that — strange, but apparently, these people exist — <eob> you surely are interested <eol> in keeping yourself alive <eob> and in how our life-support systems <eob> work. <eob>
The framework for physics is remarkably constant; <eob> it's the same in lots and lots <eol> of things that we measure. <eob>
It's not going to change anytime soon. <eob>
They might discover some new quantum mechanics, <eob> but apples right here <eol> are still going to fall down. <eob>
So, the question is <eob> — <eob> I get asked sometimes: <eol> How do you start? <eob>
What's the place to start <eob> if you're interested in the physical world, <eol> in not being helpless, <eob> and in finding some toys to play with? <eob>
Here is my suggestion to you: <eob> the place to start <eol> is that moment — and adults do this — <eob> you're drifting along somewhere, <eob> and you spot something and your brain <eol> goes, "Oh, that's weird." <eob> And then your consciousness goes, <eol> "You're an adult. <eob>
Keep going. <eob> "And that's the point — hold that thought — <eob> that bit where your brain went," <eol> Oh, that's a bit odd, <eob> "because there's something <eol> there to play with, <eob> and it's worth you playing with it, <eob> so that's the place to start. <eob>
But if you don't have any <eol> of those little moments <eob> on your way home from this event, <eob> here are some things to start with. <eob>
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; <eol> highly entertaining. <eob>
Watch a coffee spill dry. <eob>
I know that sounds a little bit like <eol> watching paint dry, <eob> but it does do quite weird things; <eol> it's worth watching. <eob>
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties <eol> if there are teacups around. <eob>
There are so many things you can do <eol> to play with teacups, it's brilliant. <eob>
The most obvious one is to get <eol> a teacup, get a spoon, <eob> tap the teacup around <eol> the rim and listen, <eob> and you will hear something strange. <eob>
And the other thing is, <eol> push your toast off the table <eob> because you can, and you'll learn stuff from it. <eob>
And if you're feeling really ambitious, <eob> try and push it off in such a way <eol> that it doesn't fall butter-side down, <eob> which is possible. <eob>
The point of all of this is that, <eob> first of all, we should all play with toys. <eob>
We shouldn't be afraid <eol> to investigate the physical world for ourselves <eob> with the tools around us, <eob> because we all have access to them. <eob>
It matters, because if we want to understand society, <eob> if we want to be good citizens, <eob> we need to understand the framework <eol> on which everything else must be based. <eob>
Playing with toys is great. <eob>
Understanding how to keep our life-support systems <eol> going is great. <eob>
But fundamentally, <eol> the thing that we need to change <eob> in the way that we talk <eol> about physics, <eob> is we need to understand <eob> that physics isn't out there <eol> with weird people <eob> and strange hieroglyphics <eob> for somebody else in a posh lab. <eob>
Physics is right here; it's for us, <eol> and we can all play with it. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,] <eob> [of true Ogbogbo Clan,] <eob> [whose wealth and resources surpass <eol> all that Europe ever had,] <eob> [whose altar is filled with gold.] <eob>
This chant is called the oríkì. <eob>
My grandmother used to sing it to me <eol> when I was a child in Nigeria. <eob>
See, an oríkì is the song of praise of the Yoruba people, <eob> and this particularly speaks of treasures <eol> that the West does not have. <eob>
Mama -- that's what I call my grandmother -- <eob> told me many stories <eol> about Yoruba mythology. <eob>
You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group <eol> from the southwestern part of Nigeria, <eob> and I was always fascinated by these stories. <eob>
I was always intrigued. <eob>
And Yoruba culture has inspired my <eol> art since I was a child. <eob>
You see, African art is not just what you <eol> buy at Harlem markets in New York. <eob>
Every artist has a name, <eob> and every artist has a story. <eob> This is my story. <eob>
See, mama had tattoos <eol> on her arms and her legs. <eob>
As a child, I thought <eol> she was born with them, <eob> with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols. <eob>
And then she told me <eob> that they were actually symbols <eol> from the Yoruba mythology. <eob>
I never knew how this was going <eol> to influence the artist that I am today. <eob>
You see, as a young child, <eol> I saw art everywhere. <eob>
I remember the house we lived <eol> in in Ilorin, in Stadium Road. <eob>
We had marble floors, <eob> and you know, I would look at the marble floors, <eob> and I would see all sorts of patterns <eol> and designs in it, <eob> and I thought everybody could see them. <eob>
So I would call my brother, <eol> and I would be like, <eob> "Ikeolu, come and see this marble design, <eol> see this pattern, see this mask." <eob> And he would tell me, "Laolu, <eol> I don't see anything." <eob> So I would use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor. <eob>
And then when my mom noticed, <eol> she got really upset. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But that didn't stop me. <eob>
I switched from ink to chalk, <eob> because I got in trouble <eol> a lot with my teachers and my parents. <eob>
So I remember my mom said, "Laolu, <eol> we are Christians. <eob>
Why don't you draw like other people? <eob>
Why don't you draw landscapes <eol> or maybe you draw chairs or furniture, <eob> or maybe even draw Jesus?" <eob>
You know, I could paint the whole house <eol> if I had a chance, <eob> but when I grew up, I knew being <eol> an artist was not an option, <eob> so I wanted to be the person <eol> my parents wanted me to be, <eob> so I went to law school. <eob>
Of course, that's my dad there. <eob>
He was so proud that day. <eob>
And this was what my notebooks <eol> looked like in law school. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course I would miss classes, <eob> and I would make up excuses <eol> why I wasn't going to class. <eob>
But when I started working <eol> at the Human Rights Commission <eob> as a human rights attorney, <eob> my mind was elsewhere. <eob>
I saw a very tough reality. <eob>
I worked with children <eob> who had to choose between getting <eol> an education <eob> and actually being forced into marriage. <eob>
I was so frustrated <eol> seeing all the injustice around me, <eob> and my only outlet was art, <eob> so I started painting. <eob>
This piece is called "Dreamscape." <eob> So when you zoom into this piece, <eob> you're going to see a girl child <eob> and the accidental birth, <eob> the fact that our future is controlled <eol> by where we are born. <eob>
Now, the next one you see <eol> a man and a man holding hands, <eob> a woman and a woman holding hands. <eob>
You see, in Nigeria, <eol> same-sex relationship is criminalized. <eob>
You can actually get 14 years for that. <eob>
With my art, I like to tell stories. <eob>
Through my art, I like <eol> to start a conversation. <eob>
So in this one, <eol> you see the map of Africa, <eob> you see the questions, you see crying, <eob> and there you see syringes <eol> plugged into Africa <eob> and the natural resources <eol> being drained out. <eob>
So I asked myself, where does it go? <eob>
Who benefits from all of this? <eob>
You see, with my art, <eob> the way I weave my art <eol> around the patterns, the masks, the stories, <eob> and the way I use my lines, <eob> it's all from the Yoruba culture. <eob>
So in 2013, I made a big gamble. <eob>
I quit my job and I moved <eol> to New York City to practice art full time. <eob>
Of course, my parents were like, <eob> "Oh, [it's just a phase.] He'll come back." <eob> But life as an artist in New York <eol> was not easy, <eob> because I was broke, <eob> no money, no gallery <eol> agents, no representation, <eob> so no gallery would show my work. <eob>
So I thought to myself, I need to survive. <eob>
So I started painting on clothes <eol> to make a living. <eob>
I started painting on shoes. <eob>
I started customizing things for people. <eob>
And then soon I realized the power, <eob> because people were <eol> so proud to wear their stories. <eob>
So I started painting on everything. <eob>
I painted on guitars, <eob> I started doing murals, <eob> anything I could find my hand on I painted, <eob> and everything became my canvas. <eob>
So one day, I was just <eol> going on my Instagram feed, <eob> and I saw this picture. <eob> It was Reign. She took a picture <eol> standing in front my art, <eob> and the moment I saw that photo, <eob> something happened <eol> in that moment. <eob>
I could actually see my artwork go into her <eol> and come out of her literally, <eob> and that's how I started painting <eol> on human bodies. <eob>
As a child I saw art <eol> on the marble floors, <eob> I saw art on walls, <eob> but now I see art on people's faces <eol> and people's bodies. <eob>
I remember my grandmother, <eob> and I realized that most of my creative instincts <eob> were actually based on my childhood memories <eob> and the art on my grandmother's skin. <eob>
Now I look at all the people I painted, <eol> and I think to myself, like, <eob> what would it look like if we all walked around <eob> like gods and goddesses <eol> from Yoruba mythology? <eob> And boom, that's how The Sacred Art <eol> of the Ori was born. <eob>
You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology <eob> means your soul, it means your essence, <eol> it means your instincts. <eob>
And I realized that only when <eol> you tap into your Ori, <eob> then you can actually move mountains. <eob>
So there's something so immediate <eol> about painting on human bodies. <eob>
It's like art in motion. <eob>
It's like a 3D experience. <eob>
So one day, I was just <eol> doing my regular work in Brooklyn, <eob> and I got an email that said, <eob> "Hi, I'm a big fan of your work. <eob>
Would you like to paint <eol> for my music video? <eob>
Signed, Beyoncé." <eob> Like, Beyoncé emailed me. <eob>
I was like, what? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I was like, what, <eob> how did she even know me? <eob>
I thought this can't be true. Of course <eol> I thought it was a scam. <eob> The Nigerian in me was like, nah. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But incredibly enough, <eol> it was real, it was true, <eob> and things happened really fast. <eob>
You see, Beyoncé wanted to pay <eol> homage to New Orleans, <eob> and my art reminded her <eol> of her creole origins. <eob>
So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course, <eob> boom, everything just went <eol> from zero to 100 real fast. <eob>
People featured me in magazines, <eob> interviews. <eob>
People stopped me in the street. <eob>
People knew my name, like -- <eob> And sometimes I had to step back <eob> and just chill, and, like, <eol> take everything in. <eob>
You know, as artists, <eol> we work so hard all our lives <eob> for our art to be recognized, <eob> and for this I feel blessed. <eob>
However, the attorney in me <eol> is still there, <eob> so I use my art to fight <eol> for what I believe in. <eob>
My Yoruba heritage is always there. <eob>
I'd like to share with you tonight some <eol> of my art in motion. <eob>
Please, welcome with me on stage. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign. <eob>
These are the first two people <eol> I ever painted in my life, <eob> and I spent the past day <eol> painting on them. <eob>
Tonight, they represent my hopes <eol> and my fears. <eob>
Now, I put my fears on the back. <eob> I put my hopes in front. <eob>
What are my hopes? <eob>
I hope that people know <eob> that Africa is not just one huge, <eol> nameless continent <eob> that is all the same. <eob>
I also hope that people know <eob> that in Nigeria, we have over 350 <eol> ethnic groups and languages, <eob> and I am just one artist <eol> from one of them. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I also hope that you know <eol> that I hope I will be able to change <eob> the way people talk <eol> about African art on the continent and here, <eob> and I hope you know that African art <eob> is not just what you buy <eol> at Harlem markets in New York <eob> and that every piece of art <eol> you see has a story, <eob> and every artist has a name. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm Chetan Bhatt <eob> and when I give my name, <eol> I'm often asked, "Where are you from?" <eob> And I normally say London. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But of course, I know <eol> what they're really asking, <eob> so I say something like, <eob> "Well, my grandparents and my mum <eol> were born in India, <eob> my dad and I were born in Kenya, <eob> and I was brought up in London. <eob>
And then they've got me mapped. <eob> "Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian. <eob>
I've worked with one of those. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And from my name they probably <eol> assume that I'm a Hindu. <eob>
And this sort of fixes me for them. <eob>
But what about the Christians <eob> and the Muslims and the atheists <eob> that I grew up with? <eob>
Or the socialists and the liberals, <eob> even the occasional Tory? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Indeed, all kinds of women and men -- <eob> vegetable sellers, factory workers, cooks, car mechanics -- <eob> living in my working class area, <eob> in some profoundly important way, <eob> they are also a part of me <eob> and are here with me. <eob>
Maybe that's why I find it hard <eol> to respond to questions about identity <eob> and about origin. <eob>
And it's not just a sort of teenage refusal <eol> to be labeled. <eob>
It's about our own most identities, <eob> the ones that we put our hands up to, <eob> the ones that we cheer for, <eob> the ones that we fight for, <eob> the ones that we love or hate. <eob>
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves <eob> as well as others. <eob>
And it's about identities <eol> we just assume that we have <eob> without thinking too much about them. <eob>
But our responses to questions <eol> of identity and origin <eob> have substantial social and political importance. <eob>
We see the wars, the rages <eol> of identity going on all around us. <eob>
We see violent religious, national <eol> and ethnic disputes. <eob>
And often the conflict <eol> is based on old stories of identity <eob> and belonging <eob> and origins. <eob>
And these identities <eol> are based on myths, <eob> typically about ancient, <eol> primordial origins. <eob>
And these could be about Adam and Eve <eob> or about the supremacy <eol> of a caste or gender <eob> or about the vitality <eol> of a supposed race <eob> or about the past glories <eol> of an empire or civilization <eob> or about a piece of land <eob> that some imagined deity <eol> has gifted. <eob>
Now, people say <eob> that origin stories and identity <eol> myths make us feel secure. <eob>
What's wrong with that? <eob>
They give us a sense of belonging. <eob>
Identity is your cultural clothing, <eob> and it can make you feel <eol> warm and fuzzy inside. <eob> But does it really? <eob> Do we really need identity <eol> myths to feel safe? <eob>
Because I see religious, national, <eol> ethnic disputes <eob> as adding to human misery. <eob>
Can I dare you <eob> to refuse every origin myth <eob> that claims you? <eob>
What if we reject every single <eol> primordial origin myth <eob> and develop a deeper sense <eol> of personhood, <eob> one responsible to humanity <eol> as a whole <eob> rather than to a particular tribe, <eob> a radically different idea of humanity <eob> that exposes how origin <eol> myths mystify, <eob> disguise global power, <eob> rapacious exploitation, <eob> poverty, the worldwide oppression of women and girls, <eob> and of course massive, accelerating inequalities? <eob>
Now, origin myths are closely linked to tradition, <eob> and the word tradition points <eol> to something old <eob> and permanent, almost natural, <eob> and people assume tradition is just history, <eob> simply the past condensed into a nice story. <eob>
But let's not confuse <eol> tradition with history. <eob>
The two are often in severe conflict. <eob>
Origin stories are usually recently <eol> created fictions of ancient belonging, <eob> and they're absurd <eob> given the complexity of humanity <eob> and our vastly interconnected, <eol> even if very unequal world. <eob>
And today we see claims to tradition <eob> that claim to be ancient <eob> changing rapidly in front of our eyes. <eob>
I was brought up <eol> in the 1970s near Wembley <eob> with Asian, English, Caribbean, <eol> Irish families living in our street, <eob> and the neo-Nazi National Front <eol> was massive then <eob> with regular marches <eol> and attacks on us <eob> and a permanent threat <eob> and often a frequent reality <eol> of violence against us <eob> on the streets, in our homes, <eob> typically by neo-Nazis <eol> and other racists. <eob>
And I remember during a general election <eol> a leaflet came through our letter box <eob> with a picture of the National Front <eol> candidate for our area. <eob>
And the picture <eob> was of our next-door neighbor. <eob>
He threatened to shoot me once when <eol> I played in the garden as a kid, <eob> and many weekends, shaven-headed <eol> National Front activists <eob> arrived at his house <eob> and emerged with scores of placards <eob> screaming that they wanted us <eol> to go back home. <eob>
But today he's one of my mum's best mates. <eob>
He's a very lovely, <eol> gentle and kind man, <eob> and at some point in his political <eol> journey out of fascism <eob> he embraced a broader idea of humanity. <eob>
There was a Hindu family <eol> that we got to know well -- <eob> and you have to understand <eol> that life in our street <eob> was a little bit like the setting <eol> for an Asian soap opera. <eob>
Everyone knew everyone else's business, <eob> even if they didn't want it <eol> to be known by anyone at all. <eob>
You really had no choice in this matter. <eob>
But in this family, <eol> there was a quiet little boy <eob> who went to the same school as I did, <eob> and after I left school, <eol> I didn't hear much more about him, <eob> except that he'd gone off to India. <eob>
Now around 2000, <eob> I remember seeing this short book. <eob>
The book was unusual <eob> because it was written <eol> by a British supporter of Al Qaeda, <eob> and in it the author calls for attacks in Britain. <eob>
This is in 1999, <eob> so 9 / 11 and the invasion of Iraq <eol> was still in the future, <eob> and he helped scout New York <eol> bombing targets. <eob>
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb <eol> to use on the London Underground, <eob> and he plotted a massive bombing campaign <eol> in London's shopping areas. <eob>
He's a very high-risk security <eol> prisoner in the UK <eob> and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain. <eob>
The author of that book <eob> was the very same quiet little boy <eob> who went to my school. <eob>
So a Hindu boy from Britain <eob> became an Al Qaeda fighter <eob> and a most-wanted international terrorist, <eob> and he rejected what people <eol> would call his Hindu or Indian or British identity, <eob> and he became someone else. <eob>
He refused to be who he was. <eob>
He recreated himself, <eob> and this kind of journey <eol> is very common <eob> for young men and women <eob> who become involved in Al Qaeda or Islamic State <eob> or other transnational armed groups. <eob>
Al Qaeda's media spokesman <eol> is a white American <eob> from a Jewish and Catholic mixed background, <eob> and neither he nor the boy from my school <eob> were from Muslim backgrounds. <eob>
There's no point in asking them <eol> where are they from. <eob>
A more important question <eol> is where they're going. <eob>
And I would also put it to you <eob> that exactly the same journey occurs <eol> for those young men and women <eob> who were brought up in Muslim family backgrounds. <eob>
Most of those who join Al Qaeda <eob> and other Salafi jihadi groups from Europe, <eol> Asia, North America, <eob> even in many cases the Middle East <eob> are those who have comprehensively <eol> rejected their backgrounds <eob> to become, in essence, new people. <eob>
They spend an enormous amount <eol> of time attacking their parents' backgrounds <eob> as profane, impure, blasphemous, <eob> the wrong type of Islam, <eob> and their vision instead <eob> is a fantastical view of cosmic apocalypse. <eob>
It's a born again vision. <eob>
Discard your past, your society, <eol> your family and friends <eob> since they're all impure. <eob>
Instead, become someone else, <eob> your true self, <eob> your authentic self. <eob>
Now, this isn't about a return <eol> to the past. <eob> It's about using a forgery <eol> of the past <eob> to envision an appalling future <eol> which begins today at year zero. <eob>
This is why over 80 percent <eol> of the victims of Al Qaeda and Islamic State <eob> are people from Muslim backgrounds. <eob>
The first act by Salafi jihadi groups <eol> when they take over an area <eob> is to destroy existing Muslim institutions <eob> including mosques, shrines, preachers, practices. <eob>
Their main purpose is to control <eol> and punish people internally, <eob> to dictate the spaces <eol> that women may go, <eob> their clothing, family relations, <eob> beliefs, even the minute detail <eol> of how one prays. <eob>
And you get the impression in the news <eob> that they are after us in the West, <eob> but they are actually mainly <eol> after people from other Muslim backgrounds. <eob>
In their view, no other Muslim <eol> can ever be pure enough, <eob> so ordinary beliefs and practices <eol> that have existed for centuries <eob> are attacked as impure <eob> by teenagers from Birmingham or London <eob> who know nothing <eob> about the histories <eol> that they so joyously obliterate. <eob>
Now here, their claim to tradition <eol> is at war with history, <eob> but they're nevertheless <eol> very certain about their purity <eob> and about the impurity of others. <eob>
Purity, <eob> certainty, <eob> the return to authentic tradition, <eob> the quest for these can lead <eol> to lethal visions <eob> of perfect societies <eol> and perfected people. <eob>
This is what the main <eol> Hindu fundamentalist organization in India <eob> looks like today at its mass rally. <eob>
Maybe it reminds you of the 1930s <eol> in Italy or Germany, <eob> and the movement's roots <eol> are indeed in fascism. <eob>
It was a member of the same <eol> Hindu fundamentalist movement <eob> who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi. <eob>
Hindu fundamentalists today view <eol> this murderer as a national hero, <eob> and they want to put up statues <eol> of him throughout India. <eob>
They've been involved for decades <eob> in large-scale mass violence <eol> against minorities. <eob>
They ban books, art, films. <eob>
They attack romantic couples <eol> on Valentine's Day, <eob> Christians on Christmas Day. <eob>
They don't like others talking critically <eob> about what they see <eol> as their ancient culture <eob> or using its images <eob> or caricaturing it <eob> or drawing cartoons about it. <eob>
But the people making <eol> the strongest possible claims <eob> about ancient, timeless Hindu religion <eob> are dressed in brown shorts <eol> and white shirts <eob> while claiming, oddly, <eob> to be the original Aryan race, <eob> just like the violent Salafi jihadis <eob> who make their claims about <eol> their primordial religion <eob> while dressed in black military uniforms <eob> and wearing balaclavas. <eob>
These people are manufacturing pure, <eol> pristine identities of conviction <eob> and of certainty. <eob>
Fundamentalists see religion and culture <eol> as their sole property, a property. <eob>
But religions and cultures are processes. <eob>
They're not things. They're impermanent. They're messy. They're impure. <eob> Look at any religion <eol> and you'll see disputes and arguments <eob> going all the way down. <eob>
Any criticism of religion in any form <eob> has to therefore be <eob> part of the expansive sense of humanity <eob> we should aspire to. <eob>
I respect your right to have <eol> and to express your religion <eob> or your culture or your opinion, <eob> but I don't necessarily <eol> have to respect the content. <eob>
I might like some of it. <eob> I might like how an old church <eol> looks, for example, <eob> but this isn't the same thing. <eob>
Similarly, I have a human right <eob> to say something that you may find offensive, <eob> but you do not have a human right <eol> not to be offended. <eob>
In a genuine democracy, <eol> we're constantly offended <eob> since people express <eol> different views all the time. <eob>
They also change their views, <eob> so their views are impermanent. <eob>
You cannot fix someone's political views <eob> based on their religious <eol> or national or cultural background. <eob>
Now, these points about religious purity <eob> also apply to nationalism and to racism. <eob>
I'm always puzzled <eob> to have pride in your national <eol> or ethnic identity, <eob> pride in the accident of birth from a warm <eol> and cozy womb, <eob> belief in your superiority <eol> because of the accident of birth. <eob>
These people have very firm ideas <eob> about what belongs <eol> and what doesn't belong <eob> inside the cozy national cultures <eol> that they imagine. <eob>
And I'm going to caricature a bit <eol> here, but only a little bit. <eob>
I want you to imagine the supporter <eol> of some Little Englander <eob> or British nationalist political party, <eob> and he's sitting at home <eob> and he's screaming about foreigners <eob> invading his country <eob> while watching Fox News, <eob> an American cable channel <eob> owned by an Australian <eob> on his South Korean television set <eob> which was bought by his Spanish credit card <eob> which is paid off monthly by his high-street British bank <eob> which has its headquarters in Hong Kong. <eob>
He supports a British football team <eol> owned by a Russian. <eob>
His favorite brand of fish and chips <eob> is owned by a Swedish <eol> venture capitalist firm. <eob>
The church he sometimes goes to <eob> has its creed decided <eol> in meetings in Ghana. <eob>
His Union Jack underpants <eob> were made in India. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
And they're laundered regularly <eob> by a very nice Polish lady. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is no pure ethnicity, national culture, <eob> and the ethical choices <eol> we have today <eob> are far wider than being forced to choose <eob> between racist right and religious right visions, <eob> dismal visions of culture. <eob>
Now, culture isn't just about language, <eol> food, clothing and music, <eob> but gender relations, ancient monuments, <eob> a heritage of sacred texts. <eob>
But culture can also be <eol> what has been decided to be culture <eob> by those who have a political stake <eob> in pounding culture into the shape <eol> of a prison. <eob>
Big political identity <eol> claims are elite bids for power. <eob>
They're not answers to social <eol> or economic or political injustices. <eob>
They often obscure them. <eob>
And what about the large number <eol> of people across the globe <eob> who can't point to a monument <eol> from their past, <eob> who don't possess <eol> a sacred written text, <eob> who can't hark back <eob> to the past glories <eol> of a civilization or empire? <eob>
Are these people less a part of humanity? <eob>
What about you, <eob> now, listening to this? <eob>
What about you <eob> and your identity, <eob> because you stitch your experiences <eol> and your thoughts into a continuous person <eob> moving forward in time. <eob>
And this is what you are when you say, <eob> "I," "am," or "me." <eob> But this also includes all of your hopes and dreams, <eob> all of the you's that could have been, <eob> and it includes all the other people <eob> and the things that are in the biography <eol> of who you are. <eob>
They, the others, <eob> are also a part of you, <eob> moving forward with you. <eob>
Your authentic self, <eol> if such a thing exists, <eob> is a complex, messy <eol> and uncertain self, <eob> and that is a very good thing. <eob>
Why not value those impurities <eol> and uncertainties? <eob>
Maybe clinging to pure identities <eol> is a sign of immaturity, <eob> and ethnic, nationalist <eol> and religious traditions are bad for you. <eob>
Why not be skeptical about every primordial origin claim <eob> made on your behalf? <eob>
Why not reject the identity <eol> myths that call on you to belong, <eob> that politicians <eol> and community leaders, <eob> so-called community leaders, <eob> place on you? <eob>
If we don't need origin stories <eol> and fixed identities, <eob> we can challenge ourselves to think creatively <eob> about each other and our future. <eob>
And here culture always <eol> takes care of itself. <eob>
I'm not worried about culture. <eob>
Cultures are creative, dynamic processes, <eob> not imposed laws and boundaries. <eob>
This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd, <eob> a very senior Muslim judge <eol> and thinker in Cordoba in the 12th century, <eob> and his writings were considered <eol> deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil. <eob>
Long after he died, <eob> followers of his work were ruthlessly <eol> hunted down, <eob> banished and killed over several centuries <eob> by the most powerful religious institution <eol> of the medieval period. <eob>
That institution <eol> was the Roman Catholic Church. <eob> Why? <eob> Because ibn Rushd said <eol> that something true in religion <eob> may conflict with something <eob> that your reason finds <eol> to be true on earth, <eob> but the latter is still true. <eob>
There are two distinct worlds of truth, <eob> one based on our reason and evidence, <eol> and one that is divine, <eob> and the state, political power, social law <eol> are in the realm of reason. <eob>
Religious life is a different realm. <eob>
They should be kept separated. <eob>
Social and political life <eol> should be governed by our reason, <eob> not by religion. <eob>
And you can see why the church <eol> was upset by his writings, <eob> as indeed were some Muslims <eol> during his lifetime, <eob> because he gives us a strong <eol> statement of secularism <eob> of a kind which is normal <eol> in Europe today. <eob>
Now, history plays many tricks on us. <eob>
It undermines our fixed truths <eob> and what we believe to be <eol> our culture and their culture. <eob>
Ibn Rushd, someone <eol> who happens to be a Muslim, <eob> is considered one of the key influences <eob> in the introduction and spread <eol> of secularism in Europe. <eob>
So against religious, nationalist <eol> and racial purists of all kinds, <eob> can you make his story <eol> a part of your own, <eob> not because he happened <eol> to be a Muslim, <eob> not because he happened <eol> to be an Arab, <eob> but because he was a human being <eob> with some very good ideas <eob> that shook his world <eob> and ours. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When someone mentions Cuba, <eob> what do you think about? <eob>
Classic, classic cars? <eob> Perhaps good cigars? <eob> Maybe you think of a famous baseball player. <eob>
What about when somebody <eol> mentions North Korea? <eob>
You think about those missile tests, <eob> maybe their notorious leader <eob> or his good friend, Dennis Rodman. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
One thing that likely <eol> doesn't come to mind <eob> is a vision of a country, <eob> an open economy, <eob> whose citizens have access <eol> to a wide range of affordable consumer products. <eob>
I'm not here to argue how these countries <eol> got to where they are today. <eob>
I simply want to use them <eol> as an example of countries and citizens <eob> who have been affected, negatively affected, <eob> by a trade policy that restricts imports <eob> and protects local industries. <eob>
Recently we've heard a number of countries <eob> talk about restricting imports <eob> and protecting their local, <eol> domestic industries. <eob>
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite, <eob> but what it really is is protectionism. <eob>
We heard a lot about this <eol> during the 2016 presidential election. <eob>
We heard about it <eol> during the Brexit debates <eob> and most recently <eol> during the French elections. <eob>
In fact, it's been a really important topic <eob> being talked about around the world, <eob> and many aspiring political leaders <eob> are running on platforms <eol> positioning protectionism as a good thing. <eob>
Now, I could see <eol> why they think protectionism is good, <eob> because sometimes it seems like trade <eol> is unfair. <eob>
Some have blamed trade <eob> for some of the problems <eol> we've been having here at home in the US. <eob>
For years we've been hearing <eob> about the loss of high-paying <eol> US manufacturing jobs. <eob>
Many think that manufacturing <eol> is declining in the US <eob> because companies are moving <eol> their operations offshore <eob> to markets with lower-cost labor <eob> like China, Mexico and Vietnam. <eob>
They also think trade agreements <eol> sometimes are unfair, <eob> like NAFTA <eob> and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, <eob> because these trade agreements <eol> allow companies <eob> to reimport those cheaply <eol> produced goods back into the US <eob> and other countries from where the jobs were taken. <eob>
So it kind of feels like the exporters win <eob> and the importers lose. <eob>
Now, the reality is <eob> output in the manufacturing <eol> sector in the US <eob> is actually growing, <eob> but we are losing jobs. <eob>
We're losing lots of them. <eob>
In fact, from 2000 to 2010, <eob> 5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost. <eob>
But they're not being lost <eol> for the reasons you might think. <eob>
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio <eob> didn't lose his jobs at the factory <eob> to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico. <eob> No. <eob> Mike lost his job to a machine. <eob>
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs <eob> have been eliminated <eol> because we've made improvements <eob> in our own productivity through automation. <eob>
So that means that one out <eol> of 10 lost manufacturing jobs <eob> was due to offshoring. <eob>
No. <eob> Now, this is not just a US phenomenon. <eob> In fact, automation is spreading <eol> to every production line <eob> in every country around the world. <eob>
But look, I get it: <eob> if you just lost your job <eob> and then you read in the newspaper <eob> that your old company just struck <eol> up a deal with China, <eob> it's easy to think you were just replaced <eob> in a one-for-one deal. <eob>
When I hear stories like this, <eol> I think that what people picture <eob> is that trade happens between <eol> only two countries. <eob>
Manufacturers in one country <eob> produce products and they export them <eob> to consumers in other countries, <eob> and it feels like the manufacturing <eol> countries win <eob> and the importing countries lose. <eob>
Well, reality's a little bit different. <eob>
I'm a supply chain professional, <eob> and I live and work in Mexico. <eob>
And I work in the middle <eob> of a highly connected <eol> network of manufacturers <eob> all collaborating <eol> from around the world <eob> to produce many of the products <eol> we use today. <eob>
What I see <eob> from my front-row seat in Mexico City <eob> actually looks more like this. <eob>
And this is a more accurate depiction <eol> of what trade really looks like. <eob>
I've had the pleasure <eol> of being able to see <eob> how many different products <eol> are manufactured, <eob> from golf clubs to laptop computers <eob> to internet servers, automobiles <eob> and even airplanes. <eob>
And believe me, none of it happens <eol> in a straight line. <eob> Let me give you an example. <eob>
A few months ago, I was touring the manufacturing plant <eob> of a multinational aerospace company <eob> in Querétaro, Mexico, <eob> and the VP of logistics points out <eol> a completed tail assembly. <eob>
It turns out the tail assemblies <eol> are assembled from panels <eob> that are manufactured in France, <eob> and they're assembled in Mexico <eob> using components imported from the US. <eob>
When those tail assemblies are done, <eob> they're exported via truck to Canada <eob> to their primary assembly plant <eob> where they come together <eob> with thousands of other parts, <eob> like the wings and the seats <eob> and the little shades <eol> over the little windows, <eob> all coming in to become <eol> a part of a new airplane. <eob> Think about it. <eob> These new airplanes, <eob> before they even take their first flight, <eob> they have more stamps in their passports <eob> than Angelina Jolie. <eob>
Now, this approach to processing <eol> goes on all around the world <eob> to manufacture many of the products <eob> we use every day, <eob> from skin cream to airplanes. <eob>
When you go home tonight, <eol> take a look in your house. <eob>
You might be surprised <eol> to find a label that looks like this one: <eob> "Manufactured in the USA <eol> from US and foreign parts." <eob>
Economist Michael Porter <eob> described what's going on here best. <eob>
Many decades ago, he said that it's <eol> most beneficial for a country <eob> to focus on producing the products <eol> it can produce most efficiently <eob> and trading for the rest. <eob>
So what he's talking about here <eol> is shared production, <eob> and efficiency is the name of the game. <eob>
You've probably seen an example of this <eob> at home or at work. <eob>
Let's take a look at an example. <eob> Think about how your house was built <eob> or your kitchen renovated. <eob>
Typically, there's a general contractor <eob> who is responsible for coordinating the efforts <eob> of all the different contractors: <eob> an architect to draw the plans, <eob> an earth-moving company <eol> to dig the foundation, <eob> a plumber, a carpenter and so on. <eob> So why doesn't the general contractor <eob> pick just one company <eob> to do all the work, <eob> like, say, the architect? <eob>
Because this is silly. <eob>
The general contractor selects experts <eob> because it takes years <eob> to learn and master <eob> how to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house <eol> or renovate a kitchen, <eob> some of them requiring <eol> special training. <eob>
Think about it. <eob> Would you want your architect <eol> to install your toilet? <eob> Of course not. <eob>
So let's apply this process <eol> to the corporate world. <eob>
Companies today focus on manufacturing <eob> what they produce best and most efficiently, <eob> and they trade for everything else. <eob>
So this means they rely <eob> on a global, interconnected, <eol> interdependent network of manufacturers <eob> to produce these products. <eob>
In fact, that network is so interconnected <eob> it's almost impossible <eob> to dismantle and produce products <eol> in just one country. <eob>
Let's take a look <eol> at the interconnected web <eob> we saw a few moments ago, <eob> and let's focus on just one strand <eob> between the US and Mexico. <eob>
The Wilson Institute <eol> says that shared production represents <eob> 40 percent of the half a trillion dollars <eol> in trade <eob> between the US and Mexico. <eob>
That's about 200 billion dollars, <eob> or the same as the GDP for Portugal. <eob>
So let's just imagine <eob> that the US decides to impose <eob> a 20 percent border tax <eol> on all imports from Mexico. <eob> OK, fine. <eob> But do you think Mexico <eol> is just going to stand by and let that happen? <eob> No. No way. <eob> So in retaliation, they impose a similar tax <eob> on all goods being imported from the US, <eob> and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues, <eob> and 20 percent -- just imagine <eol> that 20 percent duties <eob> are added to every good, product, product component <eob> crossing back and forth across the border, <eob> and you could be looking at more than a 40 percent increase in duties, <eob> or 80 billion dollars. <eob>
Now, don't kid yourself, <eob> these costs are going to be passed along <eob> to you and to me. <eob>
Now, let's think about what impact <eol> that might have on some of the products, <eob> or the prices of the products, <eol> that we buy every day. <eob>
So if a 30 percent increase in duties <eol> were actually passed along, <eob> we would be looking at some pretty important <eol> increases in prices. <eob>
A Lincoln MKZ would go from 37,000 dollars <eol> to 48,000. <eob>
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV <eob> would go from 898 dollars <eol> to 1,167 dollars. <eob>
And the price of a 16-ounce jar <eol> of CVS skin moisturizer <eob> would go from 13 dollars <eol> to 17 dollars. <eob>
between the US and Mexico. <eob> Now, remember, this is only looking <eol> at one strand of the production chain <eob> so multiply this out <eol> across all of the strands. <eob>
The impact could be considerable. <eob>
Now, just think about this: <eob> even if we were able <eol> to dismantle this network <eob> and produce products in just one country, <eob> which by the way is easier <eol> said than done, <eob> we would still only be saving <eol> or protecting <eob> one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs. <eob>
That's right, because remember, <eob> most of those jobs, 87 percent, <eob> were lost due to improvements <eol> in our own productivity. <eob>
And unfortunately, those jobs, <eol> they're gone for good. <eob>
So the real question is, <eob> does it make sense for us <eol> to drive up prices <eob> to the point where many of us <eol> can't afford the basic goods <eob> we use every day <eob> for the purpose <eol> of saving a job <eob> that might be eliminated <eol> in a couple of years anyway? <eob>
The reality is that shared production <eob> allows us to manufacture <eol> higher quality products <eob> at lower costs. <eob>
It's that simple. <eob>
It allows us to get more <eob> out of the limited resources <eol> and expertise we have <eob> and at the same time benefit <eol> from lower prices. <eob>
It's really important to remember <eob> that for shared production <eol> to be effective, <eob> it relies on efficient cross-border movement <eol> of raw materials, <eob> components and finished products. <eob>
So remember this: <eob> the next time you're hearing <eol> somebody try to sell you on the idea <eob> that protectionism is a good deal, <eob> it's just not. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Where does the end begin? <eob> Well, for me, it all began <eol> with this little fellow. <eob>
This adorable organism -- <eob> well, I think it's adorable -- <eob> is called Tetrahymena <eol> and it's a single-celled creature. <eob>
It's also been known as pond scum. <eob>
So that's right, my career <eol> started with pond scum. <eob>
Now, it was no surprise <eol> I became a scientist. <eob>
Growing up far away from here, <eob> as a little girl I was deadly curious <eob> about everything alive. <eob>
I used to pick up lethally poisonous stinging <eol> jellyfish and sing to them. <eob>
And so starting my career, <eob> I was deadly curious about fundamental mysteries <eob> of the most basic building blocks of life, <eob> and I was fortunate to live in a society <eol> where that curiosity was valued. <eob>
Now, for me, this little pond scum critter Tetrahymena <eob> was a great way to study <eol> the fundamental mystery <eob> I was most curious about: <eob> those bundles of DNA <eol> in our cells called chromosomes. <eob>
And it was because I was curious <eol> about the very ends of chromosomes, <eob> known as telomeres. <eob>
Now, when I started my quest, <eob> all we knew was that they helped <eol> protect the ends of chromosomes. <eob>
It was important when cells divide. <eob>
It was really important, <eob> but I wanted to find out what telomeres consisted of, <eob> and for that, I needed a lot of them. <eob>
And it so happens <eol> that cute little Tetrahymena <eob> has a lot of short linear chromosomes, <eob> around 20,000, <eob> so lots of telomeres. <eob>
And I discovered that telomeres consisted <eol> of special segments <eob> of noncoding DNA <eol> right at the very ends of chromosomes. <eob>
But here's a problem. <eob>
Now, we all start life as a single cell. <eob>
It multiples to two. Two becomes <eol> four. Four becomes eight, <eob> and on and on to form <eol> the 200 million billion cells <eob> that make up our adult body. <eob>
And some of those cells <eol> have to divide thousands of times. <eob>
In fact, even as I stand here before you, <eob> all throughout my body, cells are furiously replenishing <eob> to, well, keep me standing here before you. <eob>
So every time a cell divides, all of its DNA <eol> has to be copied, <eob> all of the coding DNA <eol> inside of those chromosomes, <eob> because that carries <eol> the vital operating instructions <eob> that keep our cells <eol> in good working order, <eob> so my heart cells <eol> can keep a steady beat, <eob> which I assure you <eol> they're not doing right now, <eob> and my immune cells <eob> can fight off bacteria and viruses, <eob> and our brain cells <eol> can save the memory of our first kiss <eob> and keep on learning throughout life. <eob>
But there is a glitch in the way DNA <eol> is copied. <eob>
It is just one of those facts of life. <eob>
Every time the cell divides <eol> and the DNA is copied, <eob> some of that DNA from the ends <eol> gets worn down and shortened, <eob> some of that telomere DNA. <eob>
And think about it <eob> like the protective caps <eol> at the ends of your shoelace. <eob>
And those keep the shoelace, <eol> or the chromosome, from fraying, <eob> and when that tip gets too short, it falls off, <eob> and that worn down telomere sends <eol> a signal to the cells. <eob> "The DNA is no longer being protected." <eob> It sends a signal. Time to die. <eob> So, end of story. <eob>
Well, sorry, not so fast. <eob>
It can't be the end of the story, <eob> because life hasn't died off <eol> the face of the earth. <eob>
So I was curious: <eob> if such wear and tear is inevitable, <eob> how on earth does Mother Nature make sure <eob> we can keep our chromosomes intact? <eob>
Now, remember that little pond <eol> scum critter Tetrahymena? <eob>
The craziest thing was, Tetrahymena cells <eol> never got old and died. <eob>
Their telomeres weren't shortening <eol> as time marched on. <eob>
Sometimes they even got longer. <eob>
Something else was at work, <eob> and believe me, that something <eol> was not in any textbook. <eob>
So working in my lab <eol> with my extraordinary student Carol Greider -- <eob> and Carol and I shared <eol> the Nobel Prize for this work -- <eob> we began running experiments <eob> and we discovered cells do have something else. <eob>
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme <eob> that could replenish, <eol> make longer, telomeres, <eob> and we named it telomerase. <eob>
And when we removed our pond scum's telomerase, <eob> their telomeres ran down and they died. <eob>
So it was thanks to their <eol> plentiful telomerase <eob> that our pond scum critters never got old. <eob>
OK, now, that's an incredibly <eol> hopeful message <eob> for us humans to be receiving <eol> from pond scum, <eob> because it turns out <eob> that as we humans age, <eol> our telomeres do shorten, <eob> and remarkably, <eol> that shortening is aging us. <eob>
Generally speaking, <eol> the longer your telomeres, <eob> the better off you are. <eob>
It's the overshortening <eol> of telomeres <eob> that leads us to feel <eol> and see signs of aging. <eob>
My skin cells start to die <eob> and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles. <eob>
Hair pigment cells die. <eob> You start to see gray. <eob>
Immune system cells die. <eob>
You increase your risks <eol> of getting sick. <eob> In fact, the cumulative <eol> research from the last 20 years <eob> has made clear that telomere attrition <eob> is contributing to our risks <eol> of getting cardiovascular diseases, <eob> Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes, <eob> the very conditions many of us die of. <eob>
And so we have to think about this. <eob> What is going on? <eob> This attrition, <eob> we look and we feel older, yeah. <eob>
Our telomeres are losing the war <eol> of attrition faster. <eob>
And those of us who feel <eol> youthful longer, <eob> it turns out our telomeres <eol> are staying longer <eob> for longer periods of time, <eob> extending our feelings of youthfulness <eob> and reducing the risks <eol> of all we most dread <eob> as the birthdays go by. <eob>
OK, <eob> seems like a no-brainer. <eob>
Now, if my telomeres are connected <eob> to how quickly I'm going to feel <eol> and get old, <eob> if my telomeres can be renewed <eol> by my telomerase, <eob> then all I have to do to reverse <eol> the signs and symptoms of aging <eob> is figure out where to buy <eol> that Costco-sized bottle <eob> of grade A organic fair trade telomerase, right? <eob> Great! Problem solved. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Not so fast, I'm sorry. <eob>
Alas, that's not the case. <eob> OK. And why? <eob> It's because human genetics has taught us <eob> that when it comes to our telomerase, <eob> we humans live on a knife edge. <eob>
OK, <eob> simply put, <eob> yes, nudging up telomerase <eol> does decrease the risks of some diseases, <eob> but it also increases the risks <eol> of certain and rather nasty cancers. <eob>
So even if you could buy that Costco-sized bottle <eol> of telomerase, <eob> and there are many websites marketing such dubious products, <eob> the problem is you could nudge up your risks <eol> of cancers. <eob>
And we don't want that. <eob>
Now, don't worry, <eob> and because, while I think it's kind <eol> of funny that right now, <eob> you know, many of us may be thinking, well, <eol> I'd rather be like pond scum. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is something for us humans <eob> in the story of telomeres <eol> and their maintenance. <eob>
But I want to get one thing clear. <eob>
It isn't about enormously <eol> extending human lifespan <eob> or immortality. <eob>
It's about health span. <eob>
Now, health span is the number of years of your life <eob> when you're free of disease, <eol> you're healthy, you're productive, <eob> you're zestfully enjoying life. <eob>
Disease span, the opposite of health span, <eob> is the time of your life spent feeling old <eol> and sick and dying. <eob>
OK, <eob> So the real question becomes, <eob> OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase, <eob> do I have control over my telomeres' length <eob> and hence my well-being, my health, <eob> without those downsides <eol> of cancer risks? <eob>
So, it's the year 2000. <eob>
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing little teeny <eol> tiny telomeres <eob> very happily for many years, <eob> when into my lab walks a psychologist <eol> named Elissa Epel. <eob>
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects <eol> of severe, chronic psychological stress <eob> on our mind's and our body's health. <eob>
And there she was standing in my lab, <eob> which ironically overlooked <eol> the entrance to a mortuary, and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And she had a life-and-death question for me. <eob> "What happens to telomeres in people <eol> who are chronically stressed?" <eob> she asked me. <eob>
You see, she'd been studying caregivers, <eob> and specifically mothers of children <eol> with a chronic condition, <eob> be it gut disorder, be it autism, <eol> you name it -- <eob> a group obviously under enormous <eol> and prolonged psychological stress. <eob>
I have to say, her question <eob> changed me profoundly. <eob>
See, all this time I had been <eol> thinking of telomeres <eob> as those miniscule <eol> molecular structures that they are, <eob> and the genes that control telomeres. <eob>
And when Elissa asked me <eol> about studying caregivers, <eob> I suddenly saw telomeres <eol> in a whole new light. <eob>
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes <eob> into the lives of the real people <eol> we were studying. <eob>
And I'm a mom myself, <eob> and at that moment, <eob> I was struck by the image of these women <eob> dealing with a child with a condition <eob> very difficult to deal with, often without help. <eob>
And such women, simply, <eob> often look worn down. <eob>
So was it possible their telomeres <eol> were worn down as well? <eob>
So our collective curiosity went <eol> into overdrive. <eob>
Elissa selected for our first study a group <eol> of such caregiving mothers, <eob> and we wanted to ask: <eol> What's the length of their telomeres <eob> compared with the number of years <eol> that they have been caregiving <eob> for their child with a chronic condition? <eob>
So four years go by <eob> and the day comes when all the results are in, <eob> and Elissa looked down <eol> at our first scatterplot <eob> and literally gasped, <eob> because there was a pattern to the data, <eob> and it was the exact gradient <eol> that we most feared might exist. <eob>
It was right there on the page. <eob>
The longer, the more years that is, <eob> the mother had been <eol> in this caregiving situation, <eob> no matter her age, <eob> the shorter were her telomeres. <eob>
And the more she perceived <eob> her situation as being more stressful, <eob> the lower was her telomerase and <eob> the shorter were her telomeres. <eob>
So we had discovered <eol> something unheard of: <eob> the more chronic stress you are under, <eol> the shorter your telomeres, <eob> meaning the more likely you were to fall victim <eol> to an early disease span <eob> and perhaps untimely death. <eob>
Our findings meant <eol> that people's life events <eob> and the way we respond <eol> to these events <eob> can change how you maintain your telomeres. <eob>
So telomere length wasn't just a matter <eol> of age counted in years. <eob>
Elissa's question to me, <eob> back when she first came to my lab, indeed <eol> had been a life-and-death question. <eob>
Now, luckily, hidden <eol> in that data there was hope. <eob>
We noticed that some mothers, <eob> despite having been carefully caring <eol> for their children for many years, <eob> had been able to maintain <eol> their telomeres. <eob>
So studying these women closely revealed <eol> that they were resilient to stress. <eob>
Somehow they were able <eol> to experience their circumstances <eob> not as a threat day in and day out <eob> but as a challenge, <eob> and this has led to a very important <eol> insight for all of us: <eob> we have control <eol> over the way we age <eob> all the way down into our cells. <eob>
OK, <eob> now our initial curiosity <eol> became infectious. <eob>
Thousands of scientists <eol> from different fields <eob> added their expertise to telomere research, <eob> and the findings have poured in. <eob>
It's up to over 10,000 <eol> scientific papers and counting. <eob>
So several studies rapidly confirmed <eol> our initial finding <eob> that yes, chronic stress is bad <eol> for telomeres. <eob>
And now many are revealing <eob> that we have more control <eol> over this particular aging process <eob> than any of us could ever have imagined. <eob>
A few examples: <eob> a study from the University of California, Los Angeles <eob> of people who are caring for a relative with dementia, long-term, <eob> and looked at their caregiver's telomere maintenance capacity <eob> and found that it was improved <eob> by them practicing a form of meditation <eob> for as little as 12 minutes a day for two months. <eob> Attitude matters. <eob> If you're habitually a negative thinker, <eob> you typically see a stressful situation with a threat stress response, <eob> meaning if your boss wants to see you, <eob> you automatically think, "I'm about to be fired," <eob> and your blood vessels constrict, <eob> and your level of the stress hormone cortisol creeps up, <eob> and then it stays up, <eob> and over time, that persistently high level of the cortisol <eob> actually damps down your telomerase. <eob>
Not good for your telomeres. <eob>
On the other hand, <eob> if you typically see something stressful <eol> as a challenge to be tackled, <eob> then blood flows to your heart and to your brain, <eob> and you experience a brief but energizing <eol> spike of cortisol. <eob>
And thanks to that habitual <eol> "bring it on" attitude, <eob> your telomeres do just fine. <eob>
So... <eob> What is all of this telling us? <eob>
Your telomeres do just fine. <eob>
You really do have power <eol> to change what is happening <eob> to your own telomeres. <eob>
But our curiosity just got <eol> more and more intense, <eob> because we started to wonder, <eob> what about factors <eol> outside our own skin? <eob>
Could they impact our telomere <eol> maintenance as well? <eob>
You know, we humans <eol> are intensely social beings. <eob>
Was it even possible that our telomeres <eol> were social as well? <eob>
And the results have been startling. <eob>
As early as childhood, <eob> emotional neglect, exposure to violence, <eob> bullying and racism <eob> all impact your telomeres, and the effects <eol> are long-term. <eob>
Can you imagine the impact on children <eob> of living years in a war zone? <eob>
People who can't trust their neighbors <eob> and who don't feel safe <eol> in their neighborhoods <eob> consistently have shorter telomeres. <eob>
So your home address <eol> matters for telomeres as well. <eob>
On the flip side, <eob> tight-knit communities, <eol> being in a marriage long-term, <eob> and lifelong friendships, even, <eob> all improve telomere maintenance. <eob>
So what is all this telling us? <eob>
It's telling us that I have <eol> the power to impact my own telomeres, <eob> and I also have the power to impact yours. <eob>
Telomere science has told us <eol> just how interconnected we all are. <eob>
But I'm still curious. <eob> I do wonder <eob> what legacy all of us <eob> will leave for the next generation? <eob>
Will we invest <eob> in the next young woman or man <eob> peering through a microscope <eol> at the next little critter, <eob> the next bit of pond scum, <eob> curious about a question <eol> we don't even know today is a question? <eob>
It could be a great question <eol> that could impact all the world. <eob>
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you. <eob>
Now that you know how to protect <eol> your telomeres, <eob> are you curious what are you going to do <eob> with all those decades of brimming <eol> good health? <eob>
And now that you know <eol> you could impact the telomeres of others, <eob> are you curious <eob> how will you make a difference? <eob>
And now that you know the power <eol> of curiosity to change the world, <eob> how will you make sure <eol> that the world invests in curiosity <eob> for the sake of the generations <eol> that will come after us? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars <eob> taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013. <eob>
Mars is a very cold planet, <eob> flooded with high levels of UV radiation <eob> and extremely dry. <eob>
In fact, Mars is considered to be <eol> too dry for life as we know it. <eob>
I'm an astrobiologist. <eob> I try to understand <eol> the origin of life on Earth <eob> and the possibilities of finding life <eob> elsewhere in the universe. <eob>
People sometimes ask me, <eob> how can you be an astrobiologist <eob> if you don't have your own spaceship? <eob>
Well, what I do is that I study life <eob> in those environments on Earth <eob> that most closely resemble <eol> other interesting places in the universe. <eob>
All life on Earth requires water, <eob> so in my case I focus <eol> on the intimate relationship <eob> between water and life <eob> in order to understand <eob> if we could find life in a planet <eol> as dry as Mars. <eob>
But since I do not have <eol> the 2.5 billion dollars <eob> to send my own robot to Mars, <eob> I study the most Martian <eol> place on Earth, <eob> the Atacama Desert. <eob>
Located in northern Chile, <eob> it is the oldest and driest desert on Earth. <eob>
To give you an idea <eol> of how dry it is, <eob> consider here in Vancouver it rains <eol> over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year. <eob>
In the Atacama, there are places <eol> with no reported rains <eob> in the last 400 years. <eob>
How do I know this? <eob> Well, because I was born <eol> and raised in the Atacama -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I had a unique advantage <eob> when I started studying this desert. <eob>
So let me tell you guys <eol> a few fantastic examples <eob> he has found <eob> on how life has adapted to live <eol> with almost no water at all. <eob>
One of my first findings <eol> was in the entrance of a cave <eob> facing the Pacific Ocean. <eob>
In this place, we reported <eol> a new type of microalgae <eob> that grew only on top of the spiderwebs <eol> that covered the cave entrance. <eob>
Have you ever seen a spiderweb early in the morning? <eob>
It's covered with dew, <eob> so this microalgae learned that in order <eol> to carry photosynthesis <eob> in the coast of the driest desert on Earth, <eob> they could use the spiderwebs. <eob>
So here they may access <eol> the water from the fogs <eob> that regularly cover these areas in the morning. <eob>
In another cave, we found a different <eol> type of microalgae. <eob>
This one is able to use ocean <eol> mist as a source of water, <eob> and strikingly lives in the very bottom <eol> of a cave, <eob> so it has adapted to live with less than 0.1 percent <eob> of the amount of light <eol> that regular plants need. <eob>
These type of findings <eol> suggest to me that on Mars, <eob> we may find even photosynthetic life inside caves. <eob>
And by the way, that's me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, for almost 15 years this region <eol> of Yungay, discovered by NASA, <eob> was thought to be <eol> the driest place of this desert, <eob> but I knew that it was not. <eob> How? You already know the answer. <eob>
Because I was born and raised <eol> in this desert. <eob>
So I remembered that I usually <eol> see fogs in Yungay, <eob> so after setting sensors <eol> in a number of places, <eob> where I remember never seeing fogs or clouds, <eob> I reported four other sites <eol> much drier than Yungay, <eob> with this one, María Elena South, <eob> being the truly driest place on Earth, <eob> as dry as Mars, <eob> and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride <eob> from the small mining town where I was born. <eob>
Now, in this search, we were trying <eol> to actually find the dry limit <eob> for life on Earth, <eob> a place so dry that nothing <eol> was able to survive in it. <eob>
But even here, well hidden underground, <eob> we found a number of different microorganisms, <eob> which suggested to me that similarly <eol> dry places, like Mars, <eob> may be inhabited. <eob>
We even have some preliminary evidences <eob> that these microorganisms <eol> may still be active <eob> in the desiccated state, <eob> like walking mummies all around us, <eob> and that they may be using UV radiation as a source of energy. <eob>
If confirmed, this would have <eol> a huge impact on our definition of life, <eob> on how we look for life <eob> elsewhere in the universe. <eob>
Due to its clear skies, by 2020, <eob> 60 percent of the biggest telescopes on Earth <eob> will be located in the Atacama, <eob> and while everyone else <eol> will be looking among the stars <eob> to answer the question, <eol> "Are we alone?" <eob> I will be looking down to the ground <eob> searching for this same answer <eob> in my own backyard. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In my early days as a graduate student, <eob> I went on a snorkeling trip <eol> off the coast of the Bahamas. <eob>
I'd actually never swum <eol> in the ocean before, <eob> so it was a bit terrifying. <eob>
What I remember the most is, <eol> as I put my head in the water <eob> and I was trying really hard to breathe <eol> through the snorkel, <eob> this huge group of striped <eol> yellow and black fish <eob> came straight at me ... <eob> and I just froze. <eob>
And then, as if it had suddenly <eol> changed its mind, <eob> came towards me and then swerved to the right <eob> and went right around me. <eob>
It was absolutely mesmerizing. <eob>
Maybe many of you have had <eol> this experience. <eob>
Of course, there's the color <eol> and the beauty of it, <eob> but there was also just the sheer <eol> oneness of it, <eob> as if it wasn't hundreds of fish <eob> but a single entity <eol> with a single collective mind <eob> that was making decisions. <eob>
When I look back, I think <eol> that experience really ended up determining <eob> what I've worked on <eol> for most of my career. <eob>
I'm a computer scientist, <eob> and the field that I work <eol> in is artificial intelligence. <eob>
And a key theme in AI <eob> is being able to understand intelligence <eol> by creating our own computational systems <eob> that display intelligence the way <eol> we see it in nature. <eob>
Now, most popular views of AI, of course, <eol> come from science fiction and the movies, <eob> and I'm personally <eol> a big Star Wars fan. <eob>
But that tends to be a very <eol> human-centric view of intelligence. <eob>
When you think of a fish school, <eob> or when I think <eol> of a flock of starlings, <eob> that feels like a really different <eol> kind of intelligence. <eob>
For starters, any one fish <eol> is just so tiny <eob> compared to the sheer size <eol> of the collective, <eob> so it seems that any one individual <eob> would have a really limited and myopic view <eol> of what's going on, <eob> and intelligence isn't really <eol> about the individual <eob> but somehow a property of the group itself. <eob>
Secondly, and the thing <eol> that I still find most remarkable, <eob> is that we know that there are no leaders <eol> supervising this fish school. <eob>
Instead, this incredible collective mind behavior <eob> is emerging purely from the interactions <eol> of one fish and another. <eob>
Somehow, there are these interactions <eol> or rules of engagement <eob> between neighboring fish <eob> that make it all work out. <eob>
So the question for AI then becomes, <eob> what are those rules of engagement <eol> that lead to this kind of intelligence, <eob> and of course, can we create our own? <eob>
And that's the primary thing that I work <eol> on with my team in my lab. <eob>
We work on it through theory, <eob> looking at abstract rule systems <eob> and thinking about the mathematics behind it. <eob>
We also do it through biology, <eol> working closely with experimentalists. <eob>
But mostly, we do it through robotics, <eob> where we try to create <eol> our own collective systems <eob> that can do the kinds of things <eol> that we see in nature, <eob> or at least try to. <eob>
One of our first robotic <eol> quests along this line <eob> was to create our very own colony <eol> of a thousand robots. <eob>
So very simple robots, <eob> but they could be programmed <eol> to exhibit collective intelligence, <eob> and that's what we were able to do. <eob>
So this is what a single robot looks like. <eob>
It's quite small, about the size <eol> of a quarter, <eob> and you can program how it moves, <eob> but it can also wirelessly <eol> communicate with other robots, <eob> and it can measure distances from them. <eob>
And so now we can start <eol> to program exactly an interaction, <eob> a rule of engagement <eol> between neighbors. <eob>
And once we have this system, <eob> we can start to program <eol> many different kinds of rules of engagement <eob> that you would see in nature. <eob>
So for example, spontaneous synchronization, <eob> how audiences are clapping <eol> and suddenly start all clapping together, <eob> the fireflies flashing together. <eob>
We can program rules <eol> for pattern formation, <eob> how cells in a tissue <eob> determine what role <eol> they're going to take on <eob> and set the patterns of our bodies. <eob>
We can program rules for migration, <eob> and in this way, we're really learning <eol> from nature's rules. <eob>
But we can also take it a step further. <eob>
We can actually take these rules <eol> that we've learned from nature <eob> and combine them and create <eol> entirely new collective behaviors <eob> of our very own. <eob>
So for example, <eob> imagine that you had two different <eol> kinds of rules. <eob>
So your first rule is a motion rule <eob> where a moving robot can move <eol> around other stationary robots. <eob>
And your second rule is a pattern rule <eob> where a robot takes on a color <eol> based on its two nearest neighbors. <eob>
So if I start with a blob of robots <eol> in a little pattern seed, <eob> it turns out that these two rules <eol> are sufficient for the group <eob> to be able to self-assemble <eol> a simple line pattern. <eob>
And if I have more complicated pattern rules, <eob> and I design error correction rules, <eob> we can actually create really, <eol> really complicated self assemblies, <eob> and here's what that looks like. <eob>
So here, you're going <eol> to see a thousand robots <eob> that are working together <eol> to self-assemble the letter K. <eob> The K is on its side. <eob>
And the important thing <eol> is that no one is in charge. <eob>
So any single robot is only talking <eol> to a small number of robots nearby it, <eob> and it's using its motion rule <eol> to move around the half-built structure <eob> just looking for a place to fit in <eol> based on its pattern rules. <eob>
And even though no robot <eol> is doing anything perfectly, <eob> the rules are such that we can get <eol> the collective to do its goal <eob> robustly together. <eob>
And the illusion becomes <eol> almost so perfect, you know -- <eob> you just start to not even notice <eol> that they're individual robots at all, <eob> and it becomes a single entity, <eob> kind of like the school of fish. <eob>
So these are robots and rules <eol> in two dimensions, <eob> but we can also think about robots <eol> and rules in three dimensions. <eob>
So what if we could create robots <eol> that could build together? <eob>
And here, we can take inspiration <eol> from social insects. <eob>
So if you think about mound-building termites <eob> or you think about army ants, <eob> they create incredible, complex <eol> nest structures out of mud <eob> and even out of their own bodies. <eob>
And like the system I showed you before, <eob> these insects actually also have pattern rules <eob> that help them determine what to build, <eob> but the pattern can be <eol> made out of other insects, <eob> or it could be <eol> made out of mud. <eob>
And we can use that same idea <eol> to create rules for robots. <eob>
So here, you're going to see <eol> some simulated robots. <eob>
So the simulated robot <eol> has a motion rule, <eob> which is how it traverses through the structure, <eob> looking for a place to fit in, <eob> and it has pattern rules <eol> where it looks at groups of blocks <eob> to decide whether to place a block. <eob>
And with the right motion rules <eol> and the right pattern rules, <eob> we can actually get the robots <eol> to build whatever we want. <eob>
And of course, everybody <eol> wants their own tower. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So once we have these rules, <eob> we can start to create the robot bodies <eol> that go with these rules. <eob>
So here, you see a robot <eol> that can climb over blocks, <eob> but it can also lift and move these blocks <eob> and it can start to edit the very structure <eol> that it's on. <eob>
But with these rules, <eob> this is really only one kind of robot body <eol> that you could imagine. <eob>
You could imagine <eol> many different kinds of robot bodies. <eob>
So if you think about robots <eol> that maybe could move sandbags <eob> and could help build levees, <eob> or we could think of robots <eol> that built out of soft materials <eob> and worked together to shore up a collapsed building -- <eob> so just the same kind of rules <eol> in different kinds of bodies. <eob>
Or if, like my group, <eol> you are completely obsessed with army ants, <eob> then maybe one day we can make robots <eol> that can climb over literally anything <eob> including other members of their tribe, <eob> and self-assemble <eol> things out of their own bodies. <eob>
Once you understand the rules, <eob> just many different kinds <eol> of robot visions become possible. <eob>
And coming back to the snorkeling trip, <eob> we actually understand a great deal <eol> about the rules that fish schools use. <eob>
So if we can invent the bodies <eol> to go with that, <eob> then maybe there is a future <eob> where I and my group will get to snorkel with a fish school <eol> of our own creation. <eob>
Each of these systems that I showed you <eob> brings us closer to having <eol> the mathematical and the conceptual tools <eob> to create our own versions of collective power, <eob> and this can enable many different kinds <eol> of future applications, <eob> whether you think about robots <eol> that build flood barriers <eob> or you think about robotic bee colonies <eol> that could pollinate crops <eob> or underwater schools of robots <eol> that monitor coral reefs, <eob> or if we reach for the stars <eol> and we thinking about programming <eob> constellations of satellites. <eob>
In each of these systems, <eob> being able to understand <eol> how to design the rules of engagement <eob> and being able to create good collective behavior <eob> becomes a key to realizing these visions. <eob>
So, so far I've talked about rules <eol> for insects and for fish <eob> and for robots, <eob> but what about the rules that apply <eol> to our own human collective? <eob>
And the last thought <eol> that I'd like to leave you with <eob> is that science is of course itself <eob> an incredible manifestation <eol> of collective intelligence, <eob> but unlike the beautiful fish schools <eol> that I study, <eob> I feel we still have a much longer <eol> evolutionary path to walk. <eob>
So in addition to working on improving <eol> the science of robot collectives, <eob> I also work on creating robots <eol> and thinking about rules <eob> that will improve our own scientific collective. <eob>
There's this saying that I love: <eob> who does science determines <eol> what science gets done. <eob>
Imagine a society <eob> where we had rules of engagement <eob> where every child grew up believing <eol> that they could stand here <eob> and be a technologist of the future, <eob> or where every adult <eob> believed that they had the ability not just <eol> to understand but to change <eob> how science and technology impacts <eol> their everyday lives. <eob>
What would that society look like? <eob>
I believe that we can do that. <eob>
I believe that we can choose our rules, <eob> and we engineer not just robots <eob> but we can engineer our own <eol> human collective, <eob> and if we do and when we do, <eol> it will be beautiful. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Back home, my friends call me nicknames, <eob> such as "The Giant Clam Girl," <eob> "Clam Queen," <eob> or, "The Mother of Clams." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is because every time I see them, <eob> I talk nonstop about giant clams all day, <eob> every day. <eob>
Giant clams are these massive <eol> and colorful shelled marine animals, <eob> the largest of its kind. <eob> Just look at this shell. <eob> The biggest recorded individual <eol> was four-and-a-half-feet long <eob> and weighed about 550 pounds. <eob>
That is almost as heavy <eol> as three baby elephants. <eob>
South Pacific legends once described <eol> giant clams as man-eaters <eob> that would lie in wait on the seabed to trap unsuspecting divers. <eob>
A story goes that a diver <eol> had lost his legs <eob> while trying to retrieve a pearl <eol> from a giant clam. <eob>
I thought, "Really?" <eob> So out of curiosity, <eob> I did an experiment using myself as bait. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I carefully placed my hand <eol> into the clam's mouth and waited. <eob>
Hmm ... <eob> I still have my hand. <eob>
It seems that these gentle giants <eol> would rather retreat <eob> and protect their fleshy bodies <eob> than feed on me. <eob>
So much for those killer clam myths! <eob>
Unfortunately, the reality is, <eob> we are the giant clams' biggest threat. <eob>
Considered a delicacy throughout the Western <eol> Pacific and Indian Oceans, <eob> giant clams have been traditionally <eol> fished as seafood. <eob>
Fishermen are particularly interested <eol> in their adductor muscles, <eob> which are organs that hold <eol> the two shells together like a hinge. <eob>
Just for their muscles, <eob> giant clams were almost <eol> hunted to extinction <eob> between the 1960s and 1980s. <eob>
Clamshells are also popular <eol> in the ornamental trade <eob> as jewelry and for display. <eob>
In the South China Sea, <eob> fishermen went out of their way <eol> to collect fossilized clamshells <eob> by digging through large <eol> areas of coral reefs. <eob>
These were later carved and sold <eol> as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China. <eob>
Giant clams, dead or alive, <eol> are not safe from us. <eob>
It's a "clamity!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
With the spotlight on more charism <eol>atic marine animals <eob> such as the whales and coral reefs, <eob> it is easy to forget that other marine life <eol> needs our help, too. <eob>
My fascination with giant clams <eol> got me started on conservation research <eob> to fill in the knowledge gaps <eol> on their ecology and behavior. <eob>
One of the discoveries <eol> that we made was that giant clams could walk <eob> across the seafloor. <eob>
Yes, you heard me right: <eob> they can walk. <eob>
To find out, <eob> we placed numerous baby clams on a grid. <eob>
Now watch what happens over 24 hours. <eob>
We think that walking is important <eol> for getting away from predators <eob> and finding mates for breeding. <eob>
While it can hard to imagine <eol> any movement in these enormous animals, <eob> giant clams up to 400 pounds <eol> can still walk, <eob> they just move slower. <eob>
During my PhD, I discovered more secrets <eol> about the giant clams. <eob>
But there was something <eol> missing in my work. <eob>
I found myself asking, <eob> "Why should people care <eol> about conserving giant clams?" -- <eob> other than myself, of course. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It turns out that giant clams <eol> have a giant impact on coral reefs. <eob>
These multitasking clams <eol> are reef builders, <eob> food factories, <eob> shelters for shrimps and crabs <eob> and water filters, <eob> all rolled into one. <eob>
In a nutshell, <eob> giant clams play a major <eol> contributing role <eob> as residents of their own reef home, <eob> and just having them <eol> around keeps the reef healthy. <eob>
And because they can live <eol> up to 100 years old, <eob> giant clams make vital <eol> indicators of coral reef health. <eob>
So when giant clams start <eol> to disappear from coral reefs, <eob> their absence can serve <eol> as an alarm bell <eob> for scientists to start paying attention, <eob> similar to the canary <eol> in a coal mine. <eob>
But giant clams are endangered. <eob>
The largest clam in the world <eol> is facing the threat of extinction, <eob> with more than 50 percent of the wild population <eol> severely depleted. <eob>
And the ecological benefits <eol> of having giant clams on coral reefs <eob> are likely to continue only if populations are healthy, <eob> making their conservation paramount. <eob>
So I stand here today to give a voice <eol> to the giant clams, <eob> because I care a whole lot <eol> for these amazing animals, <eob> and they deserve to be cared for. <eob>
It is time for the giant clams <eol> to step out of their shells, <eob> and show the world that they, too, <eol> can be the heroes of the oceans. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Cities are like siblings in <eol> a large polygamous family. <eob>
Each one has a unique personality <eol> and is headed in a distinct direction. <eob>
But they all have somewhat shared origins. <eob>
Sometimes I think postcolonial cities <eol> are like the children <eob> of the two least-favorite wives, <eob> who are constantly being asked, <eob> "Ah, why can't you be more like your sister?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The "why" of cities is largely <eol> the same, no matter where they are: <eob> an advantageous location <eol> that makes trade and administration possible; <eob> the potential for scalable opportunities <eob> for the skilled and unskilled alike; <eob> a popular willingness to be in constant flux <eob> and, of course, resilience. <eob>
The "how" of cities, however, <eol> is a whole other story. <eob> How are they run? <eob> How do they grow? <eob> How do they decide who belongs <eol> and who doesn't? <eob>
Lagos is my home. <eob> You can always find the Nigerians <eob> by following the noise and the dancing, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Like any major city, <eol> that place is a lot of things, <eob> many of which are highly contradictory. <eob>
Our public transportation doesn't quite work, <eob> so we have these privately <eol> owned bright yellow buses <eob> that regularly cause accidents. <eob>
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained <eol> and often flooded roads. <eob>
Street evangelism is only slightly <eol> less ubiquitous <eob> than street harassment. <eob>
Sex workers sometimes have <eol> two degrees, a bank job <eob> and a prominent role in church. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
On any given day, <eob> there can be either a party <eol> or a burned body <eob> in the middle of a street. <eob>
There is so much that is possible in Lagos <eob> and so much that isn't, <eob> and very often the difference <eol> between possibility and impossibility <eob> is simply who you are, <eob> and if you're lucky enough, <eol> who you're connected to. <eob>
Belonging in Lagos <eol> is a fluid concept <eob> determined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, <eob> but most visibly and often <eol> most violently, <eob> class. <eob>
Before Nigeria became a country, <eob> fisherpeople from the inland creeks <eol> started to come down the Lagos lagoon <eob> and establish villages <eol> along the coast. <eob>
About 60 years later, my grandfather, <eol> Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi, <eob> also arrived in Lagos. <eob>
Like me, he was an alumnus <eol> of the University of Ibadan, <eob> a young member of the educated <eol> elite in the independence era. <eob>
Over time, he built an illustrious career <eol> as a land surveyor, <eob> mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods <eob> when they were just waist-high wild grass. <eob>
He died when I was nine. <eob>
And by that time, my family, <eol> like the families of those fisherpeople, <eob> knew Lagos as home. <eob>
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying, <eob> "Èkó gb ’ olè, ó gb ’ ọ̀lẹ," <eob> which can be translated to mean <eol> that Lagos will welcome anyone. <eob>
But that saying is becoming <eol> less and less true. <eob>
Many Lagosians, including <eol> the descendants of those fisherpeople <eob> who arrived generations before my grandfather, <eob> are now being pushed out <eob> to make room for an emergent city <eob> that has been described as "the new Dubai." <eob> You see, Lagos inspires big dreams, <eol> even in its leaders, <eob> and successive governments <eol> have declared aspirations <eob> towards a megacity where poverty does not exist. <eob>
Unfortunately, instead of focusing <eol> on the eradication of poverty <eob> as you would expect, <eob> the strategy of choice focuses <eol> on eliminating the poor. <eob>
Last October, the Governor announced plans <eob> to demolish every single waterfront <eol> settlement in Lagos. <eob>
There are more than 40 <eol> of these indigenous communities <eob> all over the city, <eob> with over 300,000 people <eol> living in them. <eob>
Otodo Gbame, <eob> a hundred-year-old fishing village <eob> with a population about three-quarters <eol> that of Monaco <eob> and similar potential <eol> for beachfront luxury -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
was one of the first to be targeted. <eob>
I first heard of <eob> Otodo Gbame <eob> after the demolition started. <eob>
When I visited in November 2016, <eol> I met Magdalene Aiyefoju. <eob>
She is a now-homeless woman <eob> whose surname means, <eol> "the world is blind." <eob> Magdalene's son Basil was one <eol> of over 20 people <eob> who were shot, drowned <eob> or presumed dead in that land grab. <eob>
Standing outside her shelter, <eol> I saw the two white-sand football fields <eob> where Basil used to play. <eob>
Spread all around us were the ruins <eol> of schools, churches, <eob> a primary health center, shops, <eob> thousands of homes. <eob>
Young children enthusiastically <eol> helped to put up shelters, <eob> and about 5,000 of the residents, <eol> with nowhere else to go, <eob> simply stayed put. <eob>
And then in April, <eob> state security personnel came back. <eob>
This time, they cleared the community <eol> out completely, <eob> with beatings, bullets and fire. <eob>
As I speak, there are construction crews <eol> preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches <eob> for anyone who can afford <eol> a multi-million-dollar view. <eob>
The new development is called "Periwinkle Estate." <eob>
Forced evictions are incredibly violent <eol> and, of course, unconstitutional. <eob>
And yet, they happen so often <eol> in so many of our cities, <eob> because the first thing we are taught <eol> to forget about poor people <eob> is that they are people. <eob>
We believe that a home is a thing <eol> a person absolutely has a right to, <eob> unless the person is poor and the home <eol> is built a certain way <eob> in a certain neighborhood. <eob>
But there is no single definition <eol> of the word "home." <eob> After all, what is a slum besides <eol> an organic response <eob> to acute housing deficits <eol> and income inequality? <eob>
And what is a shanty if not a person <eol> making a home for themselves <eob> against all odds? <eob>
Slums are an imperfect housing solution, <eob> but they are also prime examples <eol> of the innovation, adaptability <eob> and resilience at the foundation -- <eob> and the heart -- <eob> of every functional city. <eob>
You don't need to be the new Dubai <eob> when you're already Lagos. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We have our own identity, <eob> our own rhythm, <eob> and as anyone who knows Lagos can tell you, <eob> poor Lagosians are very often <eol> the source of the city's character. <eob>
Without its poor, Lagos <eol> would not be known for its music <eob> or its endless energy <eob> or even the fact that you can buy an ice cold drink <eol> or a puppy <eob> through your car window. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The conditions that cause us <eol> to define certain neighborhoods as slums <eob> can be effectively improved, <eob> but not without recognizing <eol> the humanity and the agency <eob> of the people living in them. <eob>
In Lagos, where public goods <eol> are rarely publicly available, <eob> slum dwellers are often at the forefront <eol> of innovating solutions. <eob>
After being disconnected <eol> from the grid for months <eob> because the power company couldn't figure <eol> out how to collect bills, <eob> one settlement designed a system <eol> that collectivized remittances <eob> and got everyone cheaper <eol> rates into the bargain. <eob>
Another settlement created a reform program <eob> that hires local bad boys <eol> as security. <eob>
They know every trick and every hideout, <eob> so now troublemakers are more likely <eol> to get caught and reported to police <eob> and fewer of the youth end up <eol> engaging in criminal activity. <eob>
Yet another settlement recently completed <eob> a flood-safe, eco-friendly <eol> communal toilet system. <eob>
Models like these are being <eol> adopted across Lagos. <eob>
Informal settlements <eol> are incorrectly named as the problem. <eob>
In fact, the real problems <eol> are the factors that create them, <eob> like the entrenchment of poverty, <eob> social exclusion <eob> and state failures. <eob>
When our governments frame <eol> slums as threats <eob> in order to justify violent land <eol> grabs or forced evictions, <eob> they're counting on those of us <eol> who live in formal housing <eob> to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them. <eob>
Rather, we must remind them <eob> that governments exist to serve <eol> not only those who build <eob> and live in luxury homes, <eob> but also those who clean and guard them. <eob> Our -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
our realities may differ, <eob> but our rights don't. <eob>
The Lagos state government, <eob> like far too many on our continent, <eob> pays lip service to ideas of inclusion, <eob> while acting as though progress <eol> can only be achieved <eob> by the erasure, exploitation <eol> and even elimination of groups <eob> it considers expendable. <eob>
People living with disabilities <eol> who hawk or beg on Lagos streets <eob> are rounded up, extorted <eob> and detained. <eob>
Women in low-income neighborhoods <eol> are picked up <eob> and charged with prostitution, <eob> regardless of what they actually <eol> do for a living. <eob>
Gay citizens are scapegoated <eol> to distract from real political problems. <eob>
But people, like cities, are resilient, <eob> and no amount of legislation <eol> or intimidation or violence <eob> can fully eliminate any of us. <eob>
Prostitutes, women and women <eol> who work as prostitutes <eob> still haven't gone extinct, <eob> despite centuries of active suppression. <eob>
Queer Africans <eol> continue to exist, <eob> even though queerness <eol> is now criminalized in most parts of the continent. <eob>
And I'm fairly certain that poor people <eol> don't generally tend to just disappear <eob> because they've been stripped <eol> of everything they have. <eob>
We are all already here, <eob> and that answers the question <eob> of whether or not we belong. <eob>
When those fisherpeople started to sail <eol> down the lagoon <eob> in search of new homes, <eob> it could not have occurred to them <eob> that the city that would rise <eol> up around them <eob> would one day insist that <eol> they do not belong in it. <eob>
I like to believe that my grandfather, <eob> in mapping new frontiers for Lagos, <eob> was trying to open it up <eob> to make room for other people <eol> to be welcomed by the city <eob> in the same way that he was. <eob>
On my way here, my grandma called me <eob> to remind me how proud she was, <eob> how proud [my grandfather] <eol> and my mother would have been. <eob>
I am their dreams come true. <eob>
But there is no reason <eol> why their dreams -- or mine, for that matter -- <eob> are allowed to come true <eob> while those of others <eol> are turned to nightmares. <eob>
And lest we forget: <eob> the minimum requirement for a dream <eob> is a safe place to lay your head. <eob>
It is too late now for Basil, <eob> but not for Magdalene, <eob> not for the hundreds of thousands, <eob> the millions still under threat in Lagos <eob> or any of our cities. <eob>
The world does not have to remain blind <eob> to the suffering that <eol> is created when we deny people's humanity, <eob> or even to the incredible potential <eol> for growth that exists <eob> when we recognize and value <eol> all contributions. <eob>
We must hold our governments <eob> and ourselves <eob> accountable <eob> for keeping our shared cities <eol> safe for everyone in them, <eob> because the only cities worth building -- <eob> indeed, the only futures <eol> worth dreaming of -- <eob> are those that include all of us, <eob> no matter who we are <eob> or how we make homes for ourselves. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I teach college students <eol> about inequality and race in education, <eob> and I like to leave <eol> my office open to any of my students <eob> who might just want <eol> to see me to chat. <eob>
And a few semesters ago, <eob> one of my more cheerful <eol> students, Mahari, <eob> actually came to see me <eob> and mentioned that he was feeling a bit <eol> like an outcast because he's black. <eob>
He had just transferred to NYU <eol> from a community college <eob> on a merit scholarship, <eob> and turns out, <eob> only about five percent of students <eol> at NYU are black. <eob>
And so I started to remember <eob> that I know that feeling <eol> of being an outsider <eob> in your own community. <eob>
It's partially what drew me to my work. <eob>
At my university, <eob> I'm one of the few faculty members of color, <eob> and growing up, <eol> I experienced my family's social mobility, <eob> moving out of apartments <eol> into a nice house, <eob> but in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood. <eob>
I was 12, <eob> and kids would say <eol> that were surprised that I didn't smell like curry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's because school is in the morning, <eob> and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Curry is for dinner. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So when Mahari was leaving, <eob> I asked him how he was coping <eol> with feeling isolated. <eob>
And he said that despite feeling lonely, <eob> he just threw himself at his work, <eob> that he built strategies around his grit <eob> and his desire to be successful. <eob>
A mentor of mine is actually Dr. Angela Duckworth, <eob> the psychologist at UPenn who has defined <eol> this stick-to-itiveness of grit <eob> as being "the perseverance <eol> and passion for long-term goals." <eob> Angela's book has become <eol> a bestseller, <eob> and schools across the country, <eob> particularly charter schools, <eob> have become interested <eol> in citing "grit" as a core value. <eob>
But sometimes grit isn't enough, <eob> especially in education. <eob>
So when Mahari was leaving <eob> my office, <eob> I worried that he might need <eol> something more specific <eob> to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me. <eob>
As a sociologist, I also study achievement, <eob> but from a slightly different perspective. <eob>
I research students <eol> who have overcome immense obstacles <eob> related to their background. <eob>
Students from low-income, <eob> often single-parent households, <eob> students who have been homeless, <eol> incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, <eob> or some who have struggled <eol> with substance abuse <eob> or lived through violent or sexual trauma. <eob>
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest <eol> people I've met. <eob>
Tyrique was raised by a single mother, <eob> and then after high school, <eol> he fell in with the wrong crowd. <eob>
He got arrested for armed robbery. <eob>
But in prison, he started to work hard. <eob>
He took college credit courses, <eob> so when he got out, <eol> he was able to get a master's, <eob> and today he's a manager <eol> at a nonprofit. <eob>
Vanessa had to move <eol> around a lot as a kid, <eob> from the Lower East Side <eol> to Staten Island to the Bronx. <eob>
She was raised primarily <eol> by her extended family, <eob> because her own mother <eol> had a heroin addiction. <eob>
Yet at 15, <eob> Vanessa had to drop out of school, <eob> and she had a son of her own. <eob>
But eventually, she was able <eol> to go to community college, <eob> get her associate's, <eob> then go to an elite college <eol> to finish her bachelor's. <eob>
So some people might hear <eol> these stories and say, <eob> "Yes, those two definitely have grit. <eob>
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps." <eob> But that's an incomplete picture, <eob> because what's more important <eob> is that they had factors in their lives <eol> that helped to influence their agency, <eob> or their specific capacity <eob> to actually overcome the obstacles <eol> that they were facing <eob> and navigate the system <eol> given their circumstances. <eob>
So, allow me to elaborate. <eob> In prison, Tyrique <eol> was actually aimless at first, <eob> as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island. <eob>
This is until an older <eol> detainee took him aside <eob> and asked him to help <eol> with the youth program. <eob>
And in mentoring youth, <eob> he started to see his own mistakes <eol> and possibilities in the teens. <eob>
This is what got him interested <eol> in taking college-credit courses. <eob>
And when he got out, <eob> he got a job with Fortune Society, <eob> where many executives are people <eol> who have been formerly incarcerated. <eob>
So then he was able <eol> to get a master's in social work, <eob> and today, he even lectures <eol> at Columbia about prison reform. <eob>
And Vanessa... <eob> well, after the birth of her son, <eob> she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation <eob> that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, <eob> a MetroCard <eob> and her first experiences <eol> with a computer. <eob>
These simple resources are what <eol> helped her get her GED, <eob> but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure, <eob> which was particularly problematic <eol> because she was only born with one kidney. <eob>
She spent 10 years on dialysis <eol> waiting for a successful transplant. <eob>
After that, <eob> her mentors at community <eol> college had kept in touch with her, <eob> and so she was able to go, <eob> and they put her <eol> in an honors program. <eob>
And that's the pathway <eol> that allowed her to become accepted <eob> to one of the most elite <eol> colleges for women in the country, <eob> and she received her bachelor's at 36, <eob> setting an incredible example <eol> for her young son. <eob>
What these stories primarily indicate <eol> is that teaching is social <eob> and benefits from social scaffolding. <eob>
There were factors pushing these two <eol> in one direction, <eob> but through tailored mentorship <eol> and opportunities, <eob> they were able to reflect <eol> on their circumstances <eob> and resist negative influences. <eob>
They also learned simple skills <eol> like developing a network, <eob> or asking for help -- <eob> things many of us in this room <eol> can forget that we have needed from time to time, <eob> or can take for granted. <eob>
And when we think of people like this, <eob> we should only think of them as exceptional, <eol> but not as exceptions. <eob>
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us <eob> of the collective responsibility <eol> to help students in similar situations. <eob>
When Presidents Bush, Obama <eol> and now even Trump, <eob> have called education <eol> "the civil rights issue of our time," <eob> perhaps we should treat it that way. <eob>
If schools were able to think <eol> about the agency that their students have <eob> and bring to the table <eol> when they push them, <eob> what students learn can become <eol> more relevant to their lives, <eob> and then they can tap into those internal <eol> reservoirs of grit and character. <eob>
So this here -- <eob> My student Mahari <eob> got accepted to law school with scholarships, <eob> and not to brag, <eob> but I did write one of his letters <eol> of recommendation. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And even though I know hard work <eol> is what got him this achievement, <eob> I've seen him find his voice along the way, <eob> which as someone who's grown <eol> up a little bit shy and awkward, <eob> I know it takes time and support. <eob>
So even though he will rely a lot on his grit <eob> to get him through that first-year law school grind, <eob> I'll be there as a mentor for him, <eob> check in with him from time to time, <eob> maybe take him out to get some curry ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
so that he can keep growing his agency <eol> to succeed even more. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Caitlin Quattromani: The election <eol> of 2016 felt different. <eob>
Political conversations <eol> with our family and friends <eob> uncovered a level of polarization <eob> that many of us had not previously experienced. <eob>
People who we always thought <eol> were reasonable and intelligent <eob> seemed like strangers. <eob>
We said to ourselves, <eol> "How could you think that? <eob>
I thought you were smart." <eob>
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met <eol> in the summer of 2011, <eob> and we bonded around being working moms <eob> and trying to keep our very energetic boys busy. <eob>
And we soon found out <eol> we had almost everything in common. <eob>
From our love of Colorado to our love <eol> of sushi, <eob> there wasn't much we didn't agree on. <eob>
We also discovered <eol> that we share a deep love of this country <eob> and feel a responsibility <eol> to be politically active. <eob>
But no one's perfect -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> and I soon found out two disappointing <eol> things about Caitlin. <eob>
First, she hates camping. <eob>
CQ: I think camping is the worst. <eob>
LA: So there would not be <eol> any joint camping trips in our future. <eob>
The second thing is that <eol> she's politically active all right -- <eob> as a conservative. <eob>
CQ: I may hate camping, <eol> but I love politics. <eob>
I listen to conservative <eol> talk radio just about every day, <eob> and I've volunteered for a few different <eol> conservative political campaigns. <eob>
LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left, <eob> like all the way to the left. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I've always been interested in politics. <eob>
I was a political science major, <eob> and I worked as a community organizer <eol> and on a congressional campaign. <eob>
CQ: So as Lauran and I were getting <eol> to know each other, <eob> it was right in the middle of that 2012 presidential campaign, <eob> and most of our early political conversations <eob> were really just based in jokes and pranks. <eob>
So as an example, I would change <eol> Lauran's computer screen saver <eob> to a picture of Mitt Romney, <eob> or she would put an Obama campaign magnet <eol> on the back of my car. <eob>
LA: Car, not minivan. <eob>
CQ: But over time, those conversations <eol> grew more serious <eob> and really became a core of our friendship. <eob>
And somewhere along the line, <eob> we decided we didn't want to have <eol> any topic be off limits for discussion, <eob> even if those topics pushed us way <eol> outside of our friendship comfort zone. <eob>
LA: And so to most of us, <eob> political conversations <eol> are a zero-sum game. <eob>
There's a winner and there's a loser. <eob>
We go for the attack and we spot <eol> a weakness in someone's argument. <eob>
And here's the important part: <eob> we tend to take every comment <eol> or opinion that's expressed <eob> as a personal affront to our own values <eol> and beliefs. <eob>
But what if changed the way <eol> we think about these conversations? <eob>
What if, in these heated moments, <eob> we chose dialogue over debate? <eob>
When we engage in dialogue, <eol> we flip the script. <eob>
We replace our ego and our desire to win <eob> with curiosity, empathy <eob> and a desire to learn. <eob>
Instead of coming from a place <eol> of judgment, <eob> we are genuinely interested <eol> in the other person's experiences, <eob> their values and their concerns. <eob>
CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran. <eob>
But getting to that place <eol> of true dialogue is hard, <eob> especially when we're talking <eol> about politics. <eob>
It is so easy to get emotionally fired up <eob> about issues that we're passionate about, <eob> and we can let our ego get in the way <eol> of truly hearing <eob> the other person's perspective. <eob>
And in this crazy political climate <eol> we're in right now, <eob> unfortunately, we're seeing <eol> an extreme result <eob> of those heated political conversations, <eob> to the point where people are willing <eol> to walk away from their relationships. <eob>
In fact, Rasmussen released a poll earlier this year <eob> that said 40 percent of people <eol> reported that the 2016 election <eob> negatively impacted a personal relationship, <eob> and the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience tells us <eob> that people tend to feel their way <eol> to their beliefs <eob> rather than using reasoning, <eob> and that when reason and emotion collide, <eob> it's emotion that invariably wins. <eob>
So no wonder it's hard <eol> to talk about these issues. <eob>
LA: And look, we're just two regular friends <eob> who happen to think very differently <eob> about politics and the role <eol> that government should play in our lives. <eob>
And I know we were all <eol> taught not to talk about politics <eob> because it's not polite, <eob> but we need to be able <eol> to talk about it, <eob> because it's important to us <eol> and it's a part of who we are. <eob>
CQ: We have chosen <eol> to avoid political debate <eob> and instead engage in dialogue <eob> in order to maintain what we fondly call <eob> our bipartisan friendship. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
LA: And this election and all <eol> of the craziness that has followed <eob> has given us several opportunities <eol> to practice this skill. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's start with January <eol> and the Women's March. <eob>
At this point, you can probably guess <eol> which one of us participated. <eob>
CQ: Oh, the Women's March. <eob>
I was annoyed and irritated <eol> that entire day, <eob> really because of two things. <eob>
Number one, the name "Women's March." <eob> As a conservative woman, <eob> the march's platform <eol> of issues didn't represent me, <eob> and that's OK, <eob> but hearing it talked about <eol> as this demonstration of sisterhood <eob> and solidarity for all women <eob> didn't ring true for me. <eob>
The other piece was the timing <eol> of the event, <eob> the fact that it was the day <eol> after the presidential inauguration. <eob>
It felt like we weren't even <eol> giving the new administration <eob> to actually do anything, good or bad, <eob> before people felt the need <eol> to demonstrate against it. <eob>
LA: And under normal circumstances, <eol> I would agree with Caitlin. <eob>
I think an administration <eol> does deserve the benefit of the doubt. <eob>
But in this case, I was marching <eol> to show my concern <eob> that a man with such a poor track <eol> record with women and other groups <eob> had been elected as president. <eob>
I had to be part <eol> of the collective voice <eob> that wanted to send a clear message <eol> to the new president <eob> that we did not accept or condone <eob> his behavior or rhetoric during the election. <eob>
CQ: So I'm already feeling <eol> kind of aggravated, <eob> and then I see this Facebook from Lauran <eol> pop up in my social media feed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Seeing Lauran's sons <eol> at the march and holding signs <eob> took it to a new level for me, <eol> and not in a good way, <eob> because I know these boys, <eob> I love these boys, <eob> and I didn't feel they were old enough <eob> to understand what the march stood for. <eob>
I didn't understand why Lauran would choose <eob> to have them participate in that way, <eob> and I assumed it wasn't a choice <eol> that the boys made for themselves. <eob>
But I also know Lauran. <eob>
You're an incredible mom <eob> who would never exploit <eol> your boys in any way, <eob> so I had to stop and check myself. <eob>
I had a decision to make. <eob>
I could take the easy way out <eob> and just choose not <eol> to say anything to her, <eob> and instead just kind of simmer <eol> in my frustration, <eob> or I could ask her to learn more <eol> about her motivations. <eob>
LA: And I shared with Caitlin <eob> that we actually started talking <eol> about the March <eob> weeks before we participated. <eob>
And my boys were curious as to why <eol> the event was being organized, <eob> and this led to some very <eol> interesting family conversations. <eob>
We talked about how in this country, <eol> we have the right and the privilege <eob> to demonstrate against something <eol> we don't agree with, <eob> and my husband shared with them <eol> why he thought it was so important <eob> that men joined <eol> the Women's March. <eob>
But the most significant reason <eol> we marched as a family <eob> is that it was a way for us <eol> to honor my parents' legacy. <eob>
They spent their careers <eob> working to defend the rights <eol> of some of our most vulnerable citizens, <eob> and they passed these values <eol> down to me and my brother, <eob> and we want to do the same <eol> with our sons. <eob>
CQ: After talking to Lauran, <eob> I really understood not only <eol> why she felt it was so important to march, <eob> but why she had her boys with her. <eob>
And frankly, my assumptions were wrong. <eob>
It was the boys who wanted to march <eob> after they talked about <eol> the issues as a family. <eob>
But what's most important <eol> about this example <eob> is to think about the alternative. <eob>
Had Lauran and I not talked about it, <eob> I would have been annoyed with her, <eob> and it could have resulted <eol> in an undercurrent of disrespect <eob> in our friendship. <eob>
But by asking Lauran questions, <eol> it allowed us to use dialogue <eob> to get to a place of true understanding. <eob>
Now, to be clear, <eob> our conversation didn't really change my mind <eol> about how I felt about the March, <eob> but it absolutely changed my thinking <eol> around why she brought her boys with her. <eob>
And for both of us, that dialogue <eol> allowed us to understand <eob> each other's perspective <eol> about the Women's March <eob> even though we disagreed. <eob>
LA: The second topic that challenged <eol> our ability to engage in dialogue <eob> was around my need to understand <eob> how Caitlin could vote for Trump. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Caitlin is a successful professional woman <eob> who is deeply caring <eol> and compassionate, <eob> and the Caitlin I know <eob> would never excuse any man from talking about women <eob> the way that Trump did <eol> during the campaign. <eob>
It was hard for me to reconcile <eol> these two things in my mind. <eob>
How could you overlook <eol> the things that were said? <eob>
CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be the only one here that thought <eob> we didn't have the best choices <eol> for the presidential election last year. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The Republican candidate who I did support <eol> didn't make it out of the primary, <eob> so when it came time to vote, <eob> I had a decision to make. <eob>
And you're right, there were some terrible things <eob> that came out during the Trump campaign, <eob> so much so that I almost <eol> decided to just abstain <eob> rather than voting for president, <eob> something I had never even considered <eol> doing before. <eob>
But ultimately, I did vote <eol> for Donald Trump, <eob> and for me it was really a vote <eol> for party over person, <eob> especially recognizing how important <eol> that presidential pick is <eob> on influencing our judicial branch. <eob>
But I shared with Lauran it <eol> was a decision I really wrestled with, <eob> and not one that I made lightly. <eob>
LA: And so after our conversation, <eol> I was struck by a few things. <eob>
First, I had fallen victim <eol> to my own confirmation bias. <eob>
Because of my strong feelings about Trump, <eob> I had given all Trump <eol> voters the same attributes, <eob> and none of them forgiving. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But knowing Caitlin, <eol> I started to ask questions. <eob>
What were Trump voters <eol> really concerned about? <eob>
Under all the divisive language, <eol> what was really going on? <eob>
What could we learn about ourselves <eol> and our country <eob> from this unlikely event? <eob>
I also learned that we shared <eol> a deep disappointment in this election, <eob> and that we have growing concerns <eol> about our two-party political system. <eob>
But the most important thing <eol> about this conversation <eob> is that it happened at all. <eob>
Without an open and honest dialogue <eol> between the two of us, <eob> this election would have been <eol> the elephant in the room <eob> for the next four years, pun intended. <eob>
CQ: So, look -- <eob>
So, look -- we know it takes work <eol> to get past the difficult, <eob> frustrating <eol> and sometimes emotional parts <eob> of having discussions about issues <eol> like the Women's March <eob> or why your friend <eol> may have voted for a candidate that you can't stand. <eob>
But we need to have these conversations. <eob>
Our ability to move past political debate <eob> into true dialogue <eob> is a critical skill we should all be focused on right now, <eob> especially with the people <eol> that we care about the most. <eob>
LA: And it's not just as adults <eol> that we need to bottle this behavior. <eob>
It's critical that we do it <eol> for our children as well. <eob>
My sons were inundated with this election. <eob>
We were listening to the news in the morning, <eob> and they were having conversations <eol> with their friends at school. <eob>
I was concerned that they were picking up <eol> so much polarizing misinformation, <eob> and they were growing really fearful <eol> of a Trump presidency. <eob>
Then one day, after the election, <eol> I was taking my sons to school, <eob> and my younger son, <eol> completely out of the blue, <eob> said, "Mom, we don't know anybody <eol> who voted for Trump, right?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I paused and I took a deep breath. <eob> "Yes, we do." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"The Quattromanis." <eob> And his response was so great. <eob>
He kind of got this confused <eol> look on his face, and he said ... <eob> "But we love them." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I answered, <eob> "Yes, we do." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then he said, <eol> "Why would they vote for him?" <eob> And I remember stopping and thinking <eob> that it was really important <eol> how I answered this question. <eob>
Somehow, I had to honor <eol> our own family values <eob> and show respect for our friends. <eob>
So I finally said, <eob> "They think that's the right direction <eol> for this country." <eob> And before I had even gotten the whole sentence out, <eob> he had moved on to the soccer game <eol> he was going to play at recess. <eob>
CQ: So life with boys. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So what Lauran and I have discovered <eol> through <eob> our bipartisan friendship <eob> is the possibility that lives in dialogue. <eob>
We have chosen to be genuinely curious <eob> about each other's ideas and perspectives <eob> and to be willing to listen to one another <eol> even when we disagree. <eob>
And by putting aside our ego <eol> and our preconceived ideas, <eob> we've opened ourselves up <eol> to limitless learning. <eob>
And perhaps most importantly <eol> for our relationship, <eob> we have made the commitment <eol> to each other <eob> that our friendship is way more important <eob> than either of us being right <eol> or winning a conversation about politics. <eob>
So today, we're asking <eol> you to have a conversation. <eob>
Talk to someone outside <eol> of your political party <eob> who might challenge your thinking. <eob>
Make an effort to engage with someone <eob> with whom you might typically <eol> avoid a political conversation. <eob>
But remember, the goal isn't to win, <eob> the goal is to listen and to understand <eob> and to be open to learning something new. <eob>
LA: So let's go back to election night. <eob>
As the polls were closing <eob> and it became clear that Trump <eol> was going to be our new president, <eob> I was devastated. <eob>
I was sad, I was confused, <eob> and I'll be honest -- I was angry. <eob>
And then just before midnight, <eob> I received this text message from Caitlin. <eob>
And where there so easy could have been <eol> weeks or months of awkwardness <eob> and unspoken hostility, <eol> there was this -- <eob> an offering of empathy rooted in friendship. <eob>
And I knew, in that moment, <eol> that we would make it through this. <eob>
CQ: So we must find a way <eol> to engage in meaningful conversations <eob> that are going to move us forward as a nation, <eob> and we can no longer wait <eob> for our elected officials to elevate <eol> our national discourse. <eob>
LA: The challenges ahead are going <eol> to require all of us <eob> to participate in a deeper <eol> and more meaningful way ... <eob> and it starts with each one of us <eob> building connection through dialogue -- <eob> in our relationships, our communities <eob> and as a country. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was there on a field trip <eol> with my architecture students from Zurich. <eob> And when we reached a high valley, <eob> I surprised them with the news <eol> that there was no hut <eob> or hotel booked for the night. <eob>
It was not a mistake. <eob>
It was totally on purpose. <eob>
The challenge was to build our own shelter <eol> with whatever we could find. <eob>
And we all survived. <eob>
It was cold, it was really tough ... <eob> and it was a great learning experience <eob> to discover that there are a lot <eol> of resources given by nature for free, <eob> and all that we need is our sensitivity <eol> to see them ... <eob> and our creativity to use them. <eob>
I found myself in a similar situation. <eob> When I was an architecture <eol> student about 13 years ago, <eob> I went to Bangladesh to a remote village <eol> called Rudrapur <eob> with the aim to design and build <eol> a school as my thesis project. <eob>
I had lived in that village <eol> before when I was 19 and a volunteer <eob> at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO <eol> for rural development. <eob>
And what I had learned from them <eob> was that the most sustainable <eol> strategy for sustainable development <eob> is to cherish and to use <eol> your very own resources and potential, <eob> and not get dependent <eol> on external factors. <eob>
And this is what I tried to do <eol> with my architecture as well. <eob>
In terms of suitable <eol> building materials for my school, <eob> I didn't have to look far. <eob>
They were right under my feet: <eob> mud, earth, dirt, clay, however you call it ... <eob> and bamboo that was growing all around. <eob>
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare, <eob> but we didn't need it. <eob>
We had human energy <eob> and the people were happy <eol> to have the work. <eob>
Tools were an issue, too, <eob> but we had these guys, <eob> water buffalos. <eob>
We had also tried a bit cows, <eob> but interestingly, <eol> they were too intelligent. <eob>
They were always stepping <eol> in the holes of the previous round. <eob>
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw -- <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
the sand, which are the ingredients in the walls. <eob>
And except a small team of consultants <eob> like my partner for realization, <eol> Eike Roswag, <eob> and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel, <eob> it was all built by craftsmen <eol> from the village. <eob>
And this is the METI school <eol> after six months of construction. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Load-bearing earth walls <eol> that really ground the school, <eob> and large bamboo structures <eol> that bring the lightness in. <eob>
That's the classroom on the ground floor. <eob>
Attached to it are the caves. <eob>
They're for reading, for snuggling, <eol> for solo work, <eob> for meditation, for playing ... <eob> and the classroom on the top. <eob>
The children all signed <eol> with their names in Bengali the doors, <eob> and they did not only sign, <eol> they also helped building the school. <eob>
And I'm sure you all had your hands <eol> in mud or clay before. <eob>
It's wonderful to touch. I love it. <eob> The children loved it. <eob>
And can you imagine the feeling <eol> of a small boy or a girl <eob> or an illiterate day <eol> laborer standing in front of that school building <eob> and knowing that you built this <eob> out of the ordinary bamboo <eol> and just the dirt underneath your feet, <eob> using nothing but your hands? <eob>
That gives such an enormous boost <eol> of trust and confidence <eob> in yourself and the community. <eob>
And in the material. <eob> Especially mud has a very poor image. <eob>
When we think of mud, we think of dirt -- <eob> it's ugly, it's nondurable -- <eob> and this is the image I want to change. <eob>
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season <eol> for this school now, <eob> really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains, <eob> and the walls are standing strong. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So how does it work? <eob>
First rule, a good foundation <eol> that keeps the wall dry from the ground, <eob> and second rule, a good roof <eol> that protects from the top, <eob> and third rule, erosion control. <eob>
Mud walls need speed breakers <eob> so that the rainwater <eol> cannot run down the wall fast, <eob> and these speed breakers could be lines of bamboo <eob> or stones or straw mixed into the mud, <eob> just like a hill needs trees <eol> or rocks in order to prevent erosion. <eob>
It works just the same way. <eob>
And people always ask me <eol> if I have to add cement to the mud, <eob> and the answer is no. <eob>
There is no stabilizer, no coating <eol> on these walls, <eob> only in the foundation. <eob>
So this is the close-up of the wall <eob> after 10 rainy seasons, <eob> and as much as I grew a bit older, <eob> the wall got some wrinkles as well. <eob>
The edges my not be as sharp as before, <eob> but it still looks pretty good, <eob> and if it needs repairing, <eob> it is really easy to do. <eob>
You just take the broken part, <eob> make it wet, and put it back on the wall, <eob> and it will look the same as before. <eob>
Wish that would work on me, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, and the great thing is, <eob> if an earth wall is not needed anymore, <eob> it can go back to the ground <eol> it came from, <eob> turn into a garden, <eob> or get fully recycled <eol> without any loss of quality. <eob>
There's no other material <eol> that can do this, <eob> and this is why mud is so excellent <eol> in terms of environmental performance. <eob>
What about the economic sustainability? <eob>
When we built the school, <eob> I practically lived on the construction site, <eob> and in the evening, I used to go <eol> with the workers to the market, <eob> and I could see how they spent their money. <eob>
And they would buy the vegetables <eol> from their neighbors, <eob> they would get a new haircut <eol> or a new blouse from the tailor. <eob>
And because the main part <eol> of the building budget <eob> was spent on craftsmanship, <eob> the school wasn't just a building, <eob> it became a real catalyst for local development, <eob> and that made me happy. <eob>
If I had designed the school <eol> in cement and steel, <eob> this money would have been exported <eol> and lost for those families. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The building budget at that time <eol> was 35,000 euros -- <eob> it's probably doubled by now -- <eob> and this is a lot of money for that region, <eob> and especially because this money <eol> is working within the community <eob> and rotating fast, <eob> and not on the stock market. <eob>
So when it comes to the economic <eol> sustainability of my project, <eob> my main question is, who gets the profit? <eob>
How many of you in here <eob> have some experience <eol> living in a mud house? <eob>
Chris Anderson, where is your hand? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You? OK. <eob>
Yeah. <eob> It seems totally out of our focus, <eob> but approximately three billion <eol> people all around the planet <eob> are living in earth houses, <eob> and it is a traditional building material <eob> in Europe just as much as in Africa. <eob>
Strangely enough, <eob> mud is not considered worthy <eol> of being studied at universities ... <eob> so I brought the dirt to Harvard, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
precisely 60 tons of dirt right in front <eol> of the main facade <eob> of the Graduate School of Design. <eob>
Students and faculty rolled up <eol> their sleeves, <eob> got their hands dirty <eob> and transformed the front <eol> into a warm place for people to gather. <eob>
Children would climb the structures, <eob> skaters would ride the ramp, <eob> students having lunch breaks, <eob> and it was particularly fascinating to see <eol> how many people were touching the wall, <eob> and we usually don't go around cities caressing <eol> our facades, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course, this was a small-scale project, <eob> but in terms of awareness-building <eol> and in terms of education, <eob> it was like an acupuncture trigger point. <eob>
And in fact, in more and more countries, <eob> load-bearing earthen structures <eol> are not allowed to be built anymore <eob> although they're traditional <eol> and have lasted for hundreds of years, <eob> and not because the material is weak, <eob> but because there are no architects and engineers <eob> who know how to deal with that material. <eob>
So education on all levels, <eob> for craftsmen, engineers and architects, <eob> is really strongly needed. <eob>
Equally important is technological development, <eob> like prefabrication <eol> developed by my colleague Martin Rauch, <eob> who is an Austrian artist <eol> and expert in earthen structures. <eob>
And he has created technologies <eol> for rammed earth elements, <eob> for prefabrication of rammed earth elements <eob> that include insulation, <eol> wall heatings and coolings <eob> and all sorts of electrical fittings <eob> that can be layered to multistoried buildings, <eob> and this is important in order to scale up <eob> and in order to [speed] up the processes, <eob> like in the Ricola Herb Center in Switzerland. <eob>
And finally, we need good built projects <eob> that prove you can build <eol> with an ancient material <eob> in a very modern way. <eob>
It is not a matter <eol> of how old a material is; <eob> it's a matter of our creative ability <eol> to use it today. <eob>
These, for example, are three hostels <eob> that I did in China in the village Baoxi, <eob> about six hours by bus from Shanghai. <eob>
The outside shape is woven bamboo, <eob> and the inside core is stones <eol> and rammed earth. <eob> And it is a traditional building material. <eob>
Even large parts <eol> of the Great Wall of China <eob> have been built with rammed earth, <eob> but it's getting replaced <eol> by concrete. <eob>
And this trend is happening very fast. <eob>
Within only a couple of years, <eob> China has consumed more cement <eol> than the United States <eob> in the entire 20th century. <eob>
And this trend of replacing <eol> natural building materials <eob> with materials that require <eol> a lot of energy, <eob> that are energy-intensive, <eob> and that emit CO2 <eob> is really clearly contributing <eol> to climate change. <eob>
And we have alternatives, <eob> such as mud, stones, timber, bamboo, earth, <eob> that are totally effective options <eol> for all sorts of purposes. <eob>
This, for example, is an office <eol> building that we did <eob> for Omicron Electronics in Austria. <eob>
Mud is healthy for the planet, <eol> but also for the human bodies, <eob> and the material is low-tech, <eob> but the performance is high-tech. <eob>
The earth walls keep the highly sophisticated <eol> tools in the building safe <eob> by naturally regulating moisture. <eob>
And this wall in my own home <eob> is our humidfier. <eob>
We love our six tons <eol> of dirt at home <eob> not only because it's healthy <eol> and sustainable. <eob>
Its archaic warmth <eol> is touching deep within. <eob>
My personal dream is to build <eol> a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob>
And this dream isn't so crazy <eob> if you think of the mud city <eol> of Shibam in Yemen <eob> that was built in the 16th century <eob> and has lasted now for 500 years. <eob>
What was possible that long ago <eol> is possible today as well, <eob> and we can apply all our technical know-how <eob> to these ancient materials <eob> so that it meets our needs <eol> and our dreams. <eob>
All around us, <eob> and just below our feet ... <eob> are wonderful natural building materials. <eob> Let's use them. <eob> And I deeply believe <eob> our homes, our work spaces, our cities <eob> would become more healthy and sustainable <eob> and more humane <eob> and beautiful. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, Ma was trying to explain something to me <eob> about Grandma and when they grew up, <eob> but I couldn't pay attention to her <eob> because I was five years old, <eol> and I was petrified. <eob>
I had just seen The Green Lady. <eob>
Now, about a week earlier, <eol> I'd watched that movie "Godzilla," <eob> the one about that huge lizard-like beast <eol> storming a major city, <eob> and the thought of a green monster <eol> coming for me was stuck in my mind. <eob>
And yet there I was, at the tip <eol> of Lower Manhattan with my mom, <eob> just staring at her: <eob> her horns, <eob> her muscles -- <eob> all of it just frightened me. <eob>
And I didn't know whether <eol> she was a monster or a hero. <eob>
So I decided to consult <eol> the Google of the day -- <eob> "Ma! Ma!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My mother explained that The Green Lady <eol> is actually the Statue of Liberty <eob> and that she was waving immigrants in. <eob>
Now, the part of her explanation <eol> that really messed with my young head <eob> was the fact that, according to Ma, <eob> long before us, <eob> The Green Lady <eol> was actually brown, <eob> brown like me, <eob> and that she changed colors over the years, <eob> much like America. <eob>
Now, the part that really <eol> is intriguing about this <eob> is that when she changed colors, <eob> she made me think about myself. <eob>
It all made sense to me, <eob> because as a first-generation American, <eob> I was surrounded by immigrants. <eob>
In fact, within my immediate social circle <eol> of the people who support me, <eob> who enrich my life, <eob> at least two are foreign-born. <eob>
My life as a US citizen is in <eol> many ways shaped by newcomers, <eob> and chances are, <eob> so is yours. <eob>
There are more than 40 million immigrants <eol> in the USA. <eob>
According to census data, <eob> a quarter of the nation's children <eol> have at least one foreign-born parent. <eob>
I know all these statistics because <eol> I study global migration patterns. <eob>
I'm a journalist, and for the last few years, <eob> I've been documenting the lives of US citizens <eob> who've lost people to deportation. <eob>
And the numbers are enormous. <eob>
From 2008 to 2016, <eob> more than three million people <eol> were "ordered removed" -- <eob> that's the technical term for being deported. <eob>
There is an economic, a political, <eol> a psychological and an emotional cost <eob> to those deportations -- <eob> the moments when these circles <eol> are broken. <eob>
I once asked a US soldier, <eob> "Why did you volunteer to fight this war?" <eob>
And she told me, <eob> "Because I'm proud to defend my country." <eob>
But I pressed to know — <eob> "Really, when you're on base, <eob> and you hear bombs exploding in the distance, <eob> and you see soldiers coming back <eol> who are gravely injured, <eob> in that moment, when you know <eol> you could be next, <eob> what does' my country 'mean?" <eob>
She looked at me. <eob> "My country is my wife, <eob> my family, <eob> my friends, my soldiers." <eob> What she was telling me <eob> is that "my country" <eol> is a collection of these strong relationships; <eob> these social circles. <eob>
When the social circles are weakened, <eob> a country itself is weaker. <eob>
We're missing a crucial aspect <eol> in the debate about immigration policy. <eob>
Rather than focusing on individuals, <eob> we should focus on the circles <eol> around them, <eob> because these are the people <eol> who are left behind: <eob> the voters, the taxpayers, <eob> the ones who are suffering <eol> that loss. <eob>
And it's not just the children <eol> of the deported <eob> who are impacted. <eob>
You have brothers and sisters <eol> who are separated by borders. <eob>
You have classmates, teachers, <eol> law enforcement officers, <eob> technologists, scientists, doctors, <eob> who are all scrambling to make <eol> sense of new realities <eob> when their social circles are broken. <eob>
These are the real lives <eol> behind all these statistics <eob> that dominate discussions <eol> about immigration policy. <eob>
But we don't often think about them. <eob>
And I'm trying to change that. <eob>
Here's just one of the real-life <eol> stories that I've collected. <eob>
And it still haunts me. <eob>
I met Ramon and his son in 2016, <eob> the same year both of them <eol> were being ordered out of the country. <eob>
Ramon was being deported <eol> to Latin America, <eob> while his son, who was a sergeant in the US military, <eob> was being deployed. <eob> Deported... <eob> deployed. <eob> If you just look at Ramon's case, <eob> it wouldn't be clear how deeply <eol> connected to the country he is. <eob>
But consider his son: <eob> a US citizen defending a country <eol> that's banished his father. <eob>
The social circle is what's key here. <eob>
Here's another example <eol> that illustrates those critical bonds. <eob>
A group of citizens in Philadelphia <eol> were concerned about their jobs, <eob> because the legal owner <eol> of the restaurant where they worked <eob> was an undocumented immigrant, <eob> and immigration officials had picked him up. <eob>
They rallied behind him. <eob>
An immigration lawyer argued <eob> he was too important <eol> to the local community <eob> to be deported. <eob>
At the hearing, they even <eol> submitted restaurant reviews -- <eob> restaurant reviews! <eob>
In the end, a judge exercised <eol> what's called "judicial discretion" <eob> and allowed him <eol> to stay in the country, <eob> but only because they considered <eol> the social circle. <eob>
There are 23 million <eol> noncitizens in the USA, <eob> according to verifiable federal data. <eob>
And that doesn't include the undocumented, <eob> because numbers for that population <eol> are at best complex estimates. <eob>
Let's just work with what we have. <eob>
That's 23 million social circles -- <eob> about 100 million individuals <eob> whose lives could be impacted <eol> by deportation. <eob>
And the stress of it all is trickling <eol> down through the population. <eob>
A 2017 poll by UCLA <eol> of LA County residents <eob> found that 30 percent of citizens in LA County <eob> are stressed about deportation, <eob> not because they themselves <eol> could be removed, <eob> but rather, because members <eol> of their social circle were at risk. <eob>
I am not suggesting that no one <eol> should ever be deported; <eob> don't confuse me with that. <eob>
But what I am saying is that we need <eol> to look at the bigger picture. <eob>
If you are within the sound of my voice, <eob> I want you to close your eyes for a moment <eob> and examine your own social circle. <eob>
Who are your foreign-born? <eob>
What would it feel like <eol> if the circle were broken? <eob>
Share your story. <eob> I'm building a global archive <eol> of first-person accounts <eob> and linking them with mapping technology, <eob> so that we can see exactly <eol> where these circles break, <eob> because this is not just an American issue. <eob>
There are a quarter-billion migrants <eol> around the world; <eob> people living, loving and learning <eol> in countries where they were not born. <eob>
And in my career, in my life, <eol> I've been one of them: <eob> in China, in Africa, in Europe. <eob>
And each time I become <eol> one of these foreigners -- <eob> one of these strange-looking guys <eol> in a new land -- <eob> I can't help but think back to that day <eob> when I was in Lower Manhattan <eol> with my mom <eob> all those decades ago, <eob> when I was scared, <eob> and I had just spotted that green lady. <eob>
And I guess the question <eol> that I keep on thinking about <eob> when I see her <eob> and all the younger replicas of her <eol> that are so obviously brown, <eob> and even the paintings that showcase <eol> her in the beginning <eob> as not quite green -- <eob> when I look at all of that, <eob> the question that my research seeks to answer <eob> becomes, to me, the same one <eol> that confounded me all those years ago: <eob> Is she a monster <eob> or a hero? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'd like for you to take a moment <eol> to imagine this with me. <eob>
You're a little girl of five years old. <eob>
Sitting in front of a mirror, <eob> you ask yourself, <eob> "Do I exist?" <eob> In this space, there is very little context, <eob> and so you move into a different one, <eob> one filled with people. <eob>
Surely, now you know you're not <eol> a figment of your own imagination. <eob>
You breathe their air. <eob>
You see them, <eob> so they must see you. <eob>
And yet, you still can't help but wonder: <eob> Do I only exist when people speak to me? <eob>
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right? <eob>
But through various artworks <eol> that reflect upon our society, <eob> I came to understand how a young black girl can grow up <eob> feeling as if she's not seen, and perhaps <eol> she doesn't exist. <eob>
You see, if young people <eol> don't have positive images of themselves <eob> and all that remains <eol> are negative stereotypes, <eob> this affects their self-image. <eob>
But it also affects the way <eol> that the rest of society treats them. <eob>
I discovered this <eob> having lived in Cape Town <eol> for about five years at the time. <eob>
I felt a deep sense <eol> of dislocation and invisibility. <eob>
I couldn't see myself represented. <eob>
I couldn't see the women <eol> who've raised me, <eob> the ones who've influenced me, <eob> and the ones that have made South Africa <eol> what it is today. <eob>
I decided to do something about it. <eob>
What do you think when you see this? <eob>
If you were a black girl, <eob> how would it make you feel? <eob>
Walking down the street, <eob> what does the city you live in say to you? <eob>
What symbols are present? <eob> Which histories are celebrated? <eob> And on the other hand, <eob> which ones are omitted? <eob>
You see, public spaces are hardly ever <eol> as neutral as they may seem. <eob>
I discovered this <eob> when I made this performance <eol> in 2013 on Heritage Day. <eob>
Cape Town is teeming <eol> with masculine architecture, <eob> monuments and statues, <eob> such as Louis Botha in that photograph. <eob>
This overt presence of white colonial <eol> and Afrikaner nationalist men <eob> not only echoes a social, gender <eol> and racial divide, <eob> but it also continues to affect <eol> the way that women -- <eob> and the way, particularly, black women -- <eob> see themselves in relation <eol> to dominant male figures <eob> in public spaces. <eob>
For this reason, among others, <eob> I don't believe that we need statues. <eob>
The preservation of history <eol> and the act of remembering <eob> can be achieved in more memorable <eol> and effective ways. <eob>
As part of a year-long public holiday series, <eob> I use performance art <eol> as a form of social commentary <eob> to draw people's attention <eol> to certain issues, <eob> as well as addressing the absence <eol> of the black female body <eob> in memorialized public spaces, <eob> especially on public holidays. <eob>
Women's Day was coming up. <eob>
I looked at what the day means -- <eob> the Women's March to the union buildings in 1956, <eob> petitioning against the pass laws. <eob>
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy <eol> of how women are treated, <eob> especially <eob> in public spaces <eob> today, <eob> I decided to do something about it. <eob>
Headline: <eob>
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank] <eob>
How do I comment on such polar opposites? <eob>
In the guise of my great-grandmother, <eob> I performed bare-breasted, <eob> close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga. <eob>
This space is also called Freedom Square, <eob> where women were a part <eol> of demonstrations against apartheid laws. <eob>
I was not comfortable with women being seen <eol> as only victims in society. <eob>
You might wonder how people <eol> reacted to this. <eob>
(Video) Woman: (Cheering) <eob>
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I realized that through my performances, <eob> I've been able to make <eol> regular people reflect upon their society, <eob> looking at the past as well <eol> as the current democracy. <eob>
(Video) Man (offscreen): She's been there since three o'clock. <eob>
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three. <eob>
About an hour still? <eob>
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day. <eob>
Man 1: It's very interesting. <eob>
It's very powerful. <eob>
I think it's cool. <eob>
I think a lot of people <eol> are quick to join a group <eob> that's a movement towards something, <eob> but not many people are ready to do something <eol> as an individual. <eob>
Man 2: So it's the individual <eol> versus the collective. <eob>
Man 1: Yeah. <eob> So I think her pushing her own individual <eol> message in performance ... <eob> it's powerful. <eob>
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful <eol> that she's doing it on her own. <eob>
I'd be interested to know <eol> why she's using hair extensions as wings, <eob> or whatever those things are meant to be. <eob>
They are wings, yes? <eob>
Woman 3: With her standing there right now, <eob> I think it's just my interpretation <eob> that we are bringing the statue down <eob> and bringing up something <eob> that's supposed to represent <eol> African pride, I think. <eob>
Or something like that. <eob>
Something should stand while Rhodes falls, <eob> I think that's what it's saying. Yeah. <eob> Yes. Thank you. <eob>
Man 3: What is behind me <eol> represents the African culture. <eob>
We can't have the colonialist law, <eob> so we need to remove <eol> all these colonial statues. <eob>
We have have our own statues now, <eob> our African leaders -- <eol> Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah -- <eob> all those who paid their lives <eol> for our liberation. <eob>
We can't continue <eol> in the 21st century, <eob> and after 21 years of democracy, <eob> have the colonizers in our own country. <eob> They belong somewhere. Maybe <eol> in a museum; not here. <eob>
I mean learning institutions, places where young people, <eob> young minds are being shaped. <eob>
So we cannot continue to have <eol> Louis Botha, Rhodes, all these people, <eob> because they're representing <eol> the colonialism. <eob>
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015, <eob> the Cecil John Rhodes statue <eol> was scheduled to be removed <eob> after a month of debates <eol> for and against its removal <eob> by various stakeholders. <eob>
This caused a widespread <eol> interest in statues in South Africa. <eob>
Opinions varied, <eol> but the media focused on problematizing <eob> the removal of statues. <eob>
On that -- well, that year, <eol> I had just begun my master's <eob> at the University of Cape Town. <eob>
During the time of the debate <eol> of the statue, <eob> I had been having reoccurring dreams <eob> about a bird. <eob>
And so I started conjuring her <eob> mentally, spiritually and through dress. <eob>
On that day, <eob> I happened to be having a meeting <eol> with my supervisors, <eob> and they told me that the statue <eol> was going to fall on that day. <eob>
I told them that I'd explain later, <eob> but we had to postpone the meeting <eob> because I was going to perform <eol> her as the statue came down. <eob>
Her name was Chapungu. <eob> She was a soapstone bird <eol> that was looted from Great Zimbabwe <eob> in the late 1800s, <eob> and is still currently housed <eol> in Cecil John Rhodes's estate <eob> in Cape Town. <eob>
On that day, <eob> I embodied her existence <eol> using my body, <eob> while standing in the blazing sun <eol> for nearly four hours. <eob>
As the time came, <eob> the crane came alive. <eob>
The people did, too -- <eob> shouting, <eob> screaming, <eob> clenching their fists <eob> and taking pictures of the moment <eol> on their phones and cameras. <eob>
Chapungu's wings, <eob> along with the crane, <eob> rose to declare <eol> the fall of Cecil John Rhodes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Euphoria filled the air <eol> as he became absent from his base, <eob> while she remained still, <eob> very present, <eob> half an hour after his removal. <eob>
Twenty-three years after apartheid, <eob> a new generation of radicals <eol> has arisen in South Africa. <eob>
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes <eol> in the same space and time <eob> asks important questions <eob> related to gender, <eob> power, <eob> self-representation, <eob> history making <eob> and repatriation. <eob>
From then on, <eob> I realized that my spiritual <eol> beliefs and dreams <eob> texture my material reality. <eob>
But for me, Chapungu's story <eol> felt incomplete. <eob>
This soapstone bird, <eob> a spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors, <eob> needed me to continue her story. <eob>
And so I dabbled in the dream <eol> space a little bit more, <eob> and this is how "Falling" was born. <eob>
[A film by Sethembile Msezane] <eob>
(Video) (A capella singing) <eob>
[FALLING] <eob>
In the film, <eob> Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany <eol> share a common story <eob> about the soapstone birds <eol> that were looted from Great Zimbabwe. <eob>
After Zimbabwe gained its independence, <eob> all the birds except <eol> for one were returned to the monument. <eob> "Falling" explores the mythological belief <eol> that there will be unrest <eob> until the final bird is returned. <eob>
Through my work, <eob> I have realized a lot <eol> about the world around me: <eob> how we move through spaces, <eob> who we choose to celebrate <eob> and who we remember. <eob>
Now I look in the mirror <eol> and not only see an image of myself, <eob> but of the women who have made <eol> me who I am today. <eob>
I stand tall in my work, <eob> celebrating women's histories, <eob> in the hope that perhaps one day, <eob> no little black girl has to ever feel <eob> like she doesn't exist. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What stands between Africa's current <eol> prostrate condition <eob> and a future of prosperity <eol> and abundance for its long-suffering populations? <eob>
One word: <eob> knowledge. <eob>
If Africa is to become a continent <eol> that offers the best life for humans, <eob> it must become a knowledge society <eob> immediately. <eob>
This is what I have called <eol> "Africa's knowledge imperative." <eob>
Our universities must reduce emphasis <eol> on producing manpower <eob> for running our civil society, <eob> our economy <eob> and our political institutions. <eob>
They should be dedicated <eol> mainly to knowledge production. <eob>
What sense is there <eol> in producing civil engineers <eob> who are not supported by soil scientists <eol> and geologists, <eob> who make it their business <eol> to create knowledge about our soil <eob> and our rocks? <eob>
What use is there in producing lawyers <eob> without juries who produce knowledge <eob> of the underlying philosophical foundations <eol> of the legal system? <eob>
We must seek <eob> knowledge. <eob>
We must approach the matter of knowledge <eob> with a maniacal commitment, <eob> without let or hindrance. <eob>
Though we must seek knowledge <eol> to solve problems we know of, <eob> we must also seek knowledge <eob> when there is no problem in view -- <eob> especially when there is no problem in view. <eob>
We must seek to know as much <eol> of what there is to know of all things, <eob> limited only by the insufficiency <eol> of our human nature, <eob> and not only when the need arises. <eob>
Those who do not seek knowledge <eol> when it is not needed <eob> will not have it when they must have it. <eob>
The biggest crisis in Africa today <eol> is the crisis of knowledge: <eob> how to produce it, <eob> how to manage it, <eob> and how to deploy it effectively. <eob>
For instance, Africa does not <eol> have a water crisis. <eob>
It has a knowledge crisis regarding its water, <eob> where and what types it is, <eob> how it can be tapped and made available <eol> where and when needed to all and sundry. <eob>
How does a continent that is home <eob> to some of the largest <eol> bodies of water in the world -- <eob> the Nile, <eob> the Niger, <eob> the Congo, <eob> the Zambezi <eob> and the Orange Rivers -- <eob> be said to have a water crisis, <eob> including in countries <eob> where those rivers are? <eob>
And that is only surface water. <eob>
While we wrongly dissipate our energies <eol> fighting the wrong crises, <eob> all those who invest <eol> in knowledge about us <eob> are busy figuring out how to pipe <eol> water from Libya's aquifers <eob> to quench Europe's thirst. <eob>
Such is our knowledge <eol> of our water resources <eob> that many of our countries <eol> have given up <eob> on making potable water a routine presence <eob> in the lives of Africans, <eob> rich or poor, <eob> high and low, <eob> rural and urban. <eob>
We eagerly accept <eol> what the merchants of misery <eob> and the global African Studies <eol> safari professoriat <eob> and their aid-addled, <eob> autonomy-fearing <eol> African minions <eob> in government, universities and civil society <eob> tell us regarding how nature <eol> has been to stinting towards Africa <eob> when it comes to the distribution <eol> of water resources in the world. <eob>
We are content to run our cities <eol> and rural dwellings alike <eob> on boreholes. <eob>
How does one run metropolises <eob> on boreholes <eob> and wells? <eob>
Does Africa have a food crisis? <eob>
Again, the answer is no. <eob>
It is yet another knowledge crisis <eol> regarding Africa's agricultural resources, <eob> what and where they are, <eob> and how they can be best managed <eol> to make Africans live more lives <eob> that are worth living. <eob>
Otherwise, how does one explain the fact <eob> that geography puts the source <eol> of the River Nile in Ethiopia, <eob> and its people cannot have <eol> water for their lives? <eob>
And the same geography puts California <eol> in the desert, <eob> but it is a breadbasket. <eob>
The difference, obviously, <eol> is not geography. <eob> It is <eob> knowledge. <eob> Colorado's aquifers <eob> grow California's pistachios. <eob>
Why can't Libya's aquifers <eob> grow sorghum in northern Nigeria? <eob>
Why does Nigeria not aspire <eob> to feed the world, <eob> not just itself? <eob>
If Africa's land is so poor, <eol> as we are often told, <eob> why are outsiders, <eob> from the United Arab Emirates <eol> all the way to South Korea, <eob> buying up vast acreages of our land, <eob> to grow food, no less, <eob> to feed their people <eob> in lands that are truly more <eol> geographically stinting? <eob>
The new landowners are not planning <eol> to import new topsoil <eob> to make their African acquisitions <eol> more arable. <eob>
Again, a singular instance of knowledge <eol> deficiency. <eob>
In the 19th century, <eob> our predecessors, <eob> just years removed from the ravages <eol> of slavery and the slave trade, <eob> were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers <eob> with a view to turning Africa's resources <eol> to the advantage of its people <eob> and to the rest of humanity, <eob> and their 20th-century successors <eol> were dreaming of harnessing <eob> the powers of the River Congo <eob> to light up the whole continent. <eob>
Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe <eob> are scheming of doing the same, <eob> but for exports to Europe <eol> and South Africa. <eob>
And they are even suggesting <eob> that Congolese may not benefit <eol> from this scheme, <eob> because, according to them, <eol> Congolese communities are too small <eob> to make providing them <eol> with electricity <eob> a viable concern. <eob> The solution? <eob> Africa must become <eol> a knowledge society, <eob> a defining characteristic <eol> of the modern age. <eob>
We neither are, nor are we on the path <eol> to becoming, <eob> a knowledge society. <eob>
Things have not always been this way <eob> when it comes to knowledge <eol> production and Africa. <eob>
In antiquity, the world went to Africa <eol> for intellectual enrichment. <eob>
There were celebrated centers of learning, <eob> attracting questers <eol> from all parts of the then-known world, <eob> seeking knowledge about that world. <eob>
What happened then has implications <eol> for our present. <eob>
For example, <eob> how Roman Africa managed <eol> the relationship between settlers and natives <eob> between the second and fourth centuries <eol> of our era <eob> might have something to teach us <eol> when it comes to confronting <eob> not-too-dissimilar problems <eol> at the present time. <eob>
But how many classics departments do we have in our universities? <eob>
Because we do not invest in knowledge, <eob> people come to Africa now <eob> not as a place of intellectual enrichment, <eob> but as a place where they sate <eol> their thirst for exotica. <eob>
Yet for the last half-millennium, <eob> Africa has been hemorrhaging <eol> and exporting knowledge <eob> to the rest of the world. <eob>
Regardless of the popular <eol> description of it as a trade in bodies, <eob> the European trans-Atlantic slave trade <eol> and slavery <eob> was one of the most radical <eol> and longest programs <eob> of African brains export <eol> in history. <eob>
American slave owners may have pretended <eol> that Africans were mere brutes, <eob> beasts of burden, <eob> almost as inert and dumb <eol> as other farm implements <eob> they classified them with in their ledgers. <eob>
And that's what they did. <eob>
The enslaved Africans, on the other hand, <eob> knew their were embodiments of <eob> knowledge. <eob>
They were smiths, they were poets, <eob> they were political counselors, <eol> they were princes and princesses, <eob> they were mythologists, they were herbologists, <eob> they were chefs. <eob>
The list is endless. <eob>
They, to take a single example, <eob> brought the knowledge of rice cultivation <eob> to the American South. <eob>
They created some of the most <eol> original civilizational elements <eob> for which the United States <eol> is now celebrated. <eob>
They deployed their knowledge, <eol> for the most part, <eob> without compensation. <eob>
For the last half-millennium, <eol> beginning with the slave trade, <eob> Africa has been exporting brains <eob> while simultaneously breaking the chains <eol> of knowledge transmission <eob> on the continent itself, <eob> with dire consequences <eol> for the systems of knowledge production in Africa. <eob>
Successive generations are cut off <eol> from the intellectual production <eob> of their predecessors. <eob>
We keep producing for external markets <eob> while beggaring our own internal needs. <eob>
At present, <eob> much of the best knowledge about Africa <eob> is neither produced nor housed there, <eob> even when it is produced by Africans. <eob>
Because we are dominated <eol> by immediate needs <eob> and relevant solutions when it comes <eol> to what we should know, <eob> we are happy to hand over to others <eob> the responsibility <eol> to produce knowledge, <eob> including knowledge about, of and for us, <eob> and to do so far away from us. <eob>
We are ever eager to consume knowledge <eob> and have but a mere portion of it <eob> without any anxiety about ownership <eol> and location. <eob>
African universities are now <eol> all too content <eob> to have e-connections with libraries elsewhere, <eob> having given up ambitions on building libraries <eob> to which the world would come <eol> for intellectual edification. <eob>
Control over who decides <eol> what should be stocked on our shelves <eob> and how access to collections <eol> should be determined <eob> are made to rest on our trust <eol> in our partners' good faith <eob> that they will not abandon us down the road. <eob> This must change. <eob> Africa must become <eol> a place of knowledge again. <eob>
Knowledge production actually <eol> expands the economy. <eob>
Take archaeological digs, for instance, <eob> and their impact on tourism. <eob>
Our desires to unearth our antiquity, <eob> especially those remote times <eol> of which we have no written records, <eob> requires investment in archaeology <eol> and related disciplines, <eob> e.g., paleoanthropology. <eob>
Yet, although it is our past <eol> we seek to know, <eob> by sheer serendipity, <eob> archaeology may shed light <eol> on the global human experience <eob> and yield economic payoffs <eob> that were no part of the original <eol> reasons for digging. <eob>
We must find a way to make knowledge <eol> and its production sexy and rewarding; <eob> rewarding, not in the crass sense of moneymaking <eob> but in terms of making it worthwhile <eol> to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge, <eob> support the existence <eob> of knowledge-producing groups <eol> and intellectuals, <eob> ensuring that the continent <eob> becomes the immediate locus of knowledge production, <eob> distribution and consumption, <eob> and that instead of having its depositories <eob> beyond Africa's boundaries, <eob> people once more come from the rest of the world, <eob> even if in virtual space, to learn from us. <eob>
All this we do as custodians <eol> on behalf of common humanity. <eob>
Creating <eob> a knowledge society <eob> in Africa, <eob> for me, would be one way to celebrate <eol> and simultaneously enhance diversity <eob> by infinitely enriching it <eol> with material and additional artifacts — <eob> artifacts that we furnish <eob> by our strivings <eob> in the knowledge field. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
We humans are becoming an urban species, <eob> so cities, they are our natural habitat. <eob>
That is where we live. <eob>
In 2014, over 54 percent <eob> of the world population <eob> was living in cities, <eob> and I can bet you <eob> that so many of these people have thought <eob> of how they would do things differently, <eob> like if I only had the tools <eob> to change things in my city, <eob> what would I do? <eob> What would my dream city be like? <eob> And these tools, <eob> this is just what we gave them. <eob>
Two years ago, my team and I, <eob> we released a game, <eob> "Cities: Skylines." <eob> It is a game about building cities. <eob>
So I have always been interested <eol> in cities as systems. <eob>
It's something <eol> that I find immensely interesting. <eob>
But what I didn't understand <eob> was that I am not alone in this. <eob> People love cities. <eob> They are interested. They have ideas. <eob> The game was an instant hit. <eob>
So far, over three and a half <eol> million people have played it. <eob>
And it's not just about playing. <eob>
We also have really awesome <eol> sharing systems. <eob>
So people play, they create cities <eob> and then they are sharing these creations, <eob> showing off what they have made. <eob>
And what I will show you <eob> is some of these cities <eob> created by the players. <eob>
So the game is about self-expression, <eob> creativity, <eob> not just overcoming the challenges <eol> posed by the simulation. <eob>
It is about showing <eol> what your cities look like. <eob>
So I have a couple of videos. <eob> These are from YouTube. <eob>
And these are some of the most interesting <eol> city designs I have seen. <eob>
So they are all different, <eob> and I hope you like all of these. <eob>
This one is called The Netherlands. <eob> It's by Silvarret. <eob> And when you start the game, <eob> you have an empty piece of land. <eob>
This land, it can be based on the real world, <eob> it can be hand-crafted in the map editor, <eob> or you can, of course, download <eol> a city made by someone else <eob> and play in that. <eob>
But what Silvarret has done here <eob> is that what he wanted to make <eob> was not a real city. <eob>
This is a fantasy city, <eob> even though it looks real. <eob>
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city <eol> that could be in the Netherlands. <eob>
So he kind of investigated <eob> what are the characteristics <eol> of cities in the Netherlands <eob> and combined a couple of those, <eob> and this is what he created. <eob>
So it is a city, <eob> but it is not a real city, <eob> but it could be. <eob>
It looks just like the Netherlands. <eob>
So the places are really <eol> densely populated. <eob>
So what you need is highways, trains, <eob> anything connecting these small town centers together. <eob>
Lots of people, lots of moving, <eob> so transportation is the key here. <eob>
But then let's go even more <eol> on the fantasy side. <eob>
Let's go into the future. <eob>
This is one of my personal favorites. <eob>
These city designs <eol> are what I love the most. <eob>
So this is a tiered city <eol> by Conflictnerd, <eob> and the basic idea is that you have <eol> concentric circle routes. <eob>
So the city is a big circle <eob> with tinier circles inside. <eob>
And the thing is that you put <eol> all of the services in the center, <eob> and then people actually live on the outer ring, <eob> because there is less traffic, <eol> less noise, less pollution, <eob> so that is where you want to live. <eob>
But the services are still <eol> really close by. <eob>
They are in the center. <eob>
And this is the soul of the game. <eob>
The player has to understand <eob> what are the wishes, what are the needs <eob> of the tiny people living in the cities. <eob>
So you need to know <eol> where you should put the things. <eob>
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital. <eob>
It needs to be accessible. <eob>
Citizens need to reach the hospital. <eob>
And this is one way to do it. <eob>
So maybe this is something <eol> that we might be seeing someday. <eob>
And then even more into the future. <eob> Astergea by Yuttho. <eob> So Yuttho does YouTube videos <eol> and plays the game. <eob>
What he did here <eol> was actually a 12-point series <eob> of creating this city. <eob>
So what he does is he plays the game, <eob> he records it <eob> and he explains as he's going <eol> what he's doing and why. <eob>
And as a part of this series, <eob> he actually did an interview <eol> with an actual urban planner <eob> called Jeff Speck. <eob>
And Speck is an expert on the concept <eol> of walkability. <eob>
The basic idea is that if you <eol> want your citizens to walk, <eob> which is kind of beneficial, <eob> you actually need to have walking <eol> as a reasonable means of transportation. <eob>
It should be a good way to reach places. <eob>
So what Yuttho did was <eol> that he explained this concept, <eob> he had Speck explain it, too, <eob> and then he applied it to the city <eol> that he was building. <eob>
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future: <eob> lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas, <eob> connecting high-rise buildings. <eob>
Maybe this is what the future <eol> might look like. <eob>
And the game system works <eol> really well for this. <eob>
We are seeing some real-world <eol> uses to this game. <eob>
So we know that some urban planners <eol> are using it as a sketching tool, <eob> so while the simulation <eol> is not completely realistic, <eob> it is realistic enough that if something <eol> works in the game, <eob> it is highly likely <eol> that it will also work in the real world, <eob> so that you can actually try out things, <eob> see if this intersection <eol> might fit this kind of a situation. <eob>
If we build a new road, would it help? <eob>
And this is what you can do <eol> with this game. <eob>
There was one really interesting contest held <eob> by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna. <eob>
So what they did was <eol> that they had a new area <eob> that they wanted to develop in the city. <eob>
They made a map with the existing city, <eob> they left empty the area <eol> that they would want to develop <eob> and shared this map. <eob>
So anyone could download the map, <eob> play the game, build the area <eob> and submit their creations <eol> to the city council. <eob>
So they have not yet built anything, <eob> but it might just be <eol> that they use one of these plans <eob> made with the game <eob> to actually build the real city. <eob>
And these videos that I have shown you, <eob> these are the people who are coming up <eol> with new kinds of solutions. <eob>
We know that cities are growing. <eob>
They're getting bigger as we go, <eob> and the percentage of population <eol> living in cities is projected to rise. <eob>
So we need the solutions <eob> and these people, playing the game, <eob> they are trying out different <eol> kinds of solutions. <eob>
They might have something <eol> that is really important. <eob>
So what we are seeing here is dream <eol> cities that might be real one day. <eob>
So it might be <eob> that this is not just a game. <eob>
It might be a way <eob> to decide our own fate. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Today I want to confess something to you, <eob> but first of all I'm going to ask you <eol> a couple of questions. <eob>
How many people here have children? <eob>
And how many of you are confident <eob> that you know how <eol> to bring up your children <eob> in exactly the right way? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, I don't see too many hands <eol> going up on that second one, <eob> and that's my confession, too. <eob>
I've got three boys; <eob> they're three, nine and 12. <eob>
And like you, and like most parents, <eob> the honest truth is I have pretty much <eol> no idea what I'm doing. <eob>
I want them to be happy <eol> and healthy in their lives, <eob> but I don't know what I'm supposed to do <eob> to make sure they are happy and healthy. <eob>
There's so many books offering <eol> all kinds of conflicting advice, <eob> it can be really overwhelming. <eob>
So I've spent most of their lives <eol> just making it up as I go along. <eob>
However, something changed me a few years ago, <eob> when I came across a little secret <eol> that we have in Britain. <eob>
It's helped me become more confident <eol> about how I bring up my own children, <eob> and it's revealed a lot about how we as a society <eol> can help all children. <eob>
I want to share that secret <eol> with you today. <eob>
For the last 70 years, <eob> scientists in Britain have been following <eol> thousands of children through their lives <eob> as part of an incredible scientific study. <eob>
There's nothing quite like it <eol> anywhere else in the world. <eob>
Collecting information on thousands of children <eob> is a really powerful thing to do, <eob> because it means we can compare the ones who say, <eob> do well at school or end up healthy <eol> or happy or wealthy as adults, <eob> and the ones who struggle much more, <eob> and then we can sift through <eol> all the information we've collected <eob> and try to work out why their lives <eol> turned out different. <eob>
This British study -- <eol> it's actually a kind of crazy story. <eob>
So it all starts back in 1946, <eob> just a few months <eol> after the end of the war, <eob> when scientists wanted to know <eob> what it was like for a woman <eol> to have a baby at the time. <eob>
They carried out this huge survey of mothers <eob> and ended up recording <eol> the birth of nearly every baby <eob> born in England, Scotland and Wales <eol> in one week. <eob>
That was nearly 14,000 babies. <eob>
The questions they asked these women <eob> are very different than the ones <eol> we might ask today. <eob>
They sound really old-fashioned now. <eob>
They asked them things like, <eob> "During pregnancy, <eob> did you get your full extra ration <eol> of a pint of milk a day?" <eob> "How much did you spend on smocks, corsets, <eob> nightdresses, knickers <eol> and brassieres?" <eob> And this is my favorite one: <eob> "Who looked after your husband while you <eol> were in bed with this baby?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, this wartime study <eol> actually ended up being so successful <eob> that scientists did it again. <eob>
They recorded the births of thousands <eol> of babies born in 1958 <eob> and thousands more in 1970. <eob>
They did it again in the early 1990s, <eob> and again at the turn of the millennium. <eob>
Altogether, more than 70,000 children <eol> have been involved in these studies <eob> across those five generations. <eob>
They're called the British birth cohorts, <eob> and scientists have gone back <eol> and recorded more information <eob> on all of these people every few <eol> years ever since. <eob>
The amount of information <eol> that's now been collected on these people <eob> is just completely mind-boggling. <eob>
It includes thousands of paper questionnaires <eob> and terabytes' worth <eol> of computer data. <eob>
Scientists have also built up <eol> a huge bank of tissue samples, <eob> which includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA. <eob>
They've even collected 9,000 placentas <eol> from some of the births, <eob> which are now pickled in plastic buckets <eol> in a secure storage warehouse. <eob>
This whole project has become unique -- <eob> so, no other country in the world <eol> is tracking generations of children <eob> in quite this detail. <eob>
These are some of the best-studied <eol> people on the planet, <eob> and the data has become <eol> incredibly valuable for scientists, <eob> generating well over 6,000 academic papers and books. <eob>
But today I want to focus on just one finding -- <eob> perhaps the most important discovery <eol> to come from this remarkable study. <eob>
And it's also the one <eol> that spoke to me personally, <eob> because it's about how to use science <eol> to do the best for our children. <eob>
So, let's get the bad news <eol> out of the way first. <eob>
Perhaps the biggest message <eol> from this remarkable study is this: <eob> don't be born into poverty <eol> or into disadvantage, <eob> because if you are, <eob> you're far more likely to walk <eol> a difficult path in life. <eob>
Many children in this study <eol> were born into poor families <eob> or into working-class families that had cramped homes <eol> or other problems, <eob> and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children <eob> have been more likely to struggle <eol> on almost every score. <eob>
They've been more likely to do worse at school, <eob> to end up with worse jobs <eol> and to earn less money. <eob>
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious, <eob> but some of the results <eol> have been really surprising, <eob> so children who had a tough start in life <eob> are also more likely to end up <eol> unhealthy as adults. <eob>
They're more likely to be overweight, <eob> to have high blood pressure, <eob> and then decades down the line, <eob> more likely to have a failing memory, <eol> poor health and even to die earlier. <eob>
Now, I talked about what happens later, <eob> but some of these differences emerge <eol> at a really shockingly early age. <eob>
In one study, <eob> children who were growing up in poverty <eob> were almost a year behind the richer children <eol> on educational tests, <eob> and that was by the age of just three. <eob>
These types of differences have been found again <eol> and again across the generations. <eob>
It means that our early circumstances <eol> have a profound influence <eob> on the way that the rest <eol> of our lives play out. <eob>
And working out why that is <eob> is one of the most difficult <eol> questions that we face today. <eob> So there we have it. <eob>
The first lesson for successful <eol> life, everyone, is this: <eob> choose your parents very carefully. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Don't be born into a poor family <eol> or into a struggling family. <eob>
Now, I'm sure you can see <eol> the small problem here. <eob>
We can't choose our parents <eol> or how much they earn, <eob> but this British study has also <eol> struck a real note of optimism <eob> by showing that not everyone <eol> who has a disadvantaged start <eob> ends up in difficult circumstances. <eob>
As you know, many people <eol> have a tough start in life, <eob> but they end up doing very well on some <eol> measure nevertheless, <eob> and this study starts to explain how. <eob>
So the second lesson is this: <eob> parents really matter. <eob>
In this study, <eob> children who had engaged, interested parents, <eob> ones who had ambition for their future, <eob> were more likely to escape <eol> from a difficult start. <eob>
It seems that parents and what they do <eol> are really, really important, <eob> especially in the first few years of life. <eob>
Let me give you an example of that. <eob>
In one study, <eob> scientists looked at about 17,000 children <eol> who were born in 1970. <eob>
They sifted all the mountains <eol> of data that they had collected <eob> to try to work out <eob> what allowed the children <eol> who'd had a difficult start in life <eob> to go on and do well at school <eol> nevertheless. <eob>
In other words, which ones beat the odds. <eob>
The data showed that what mattered <eol> more than anything else was parents. <eob>
Having engaged, interested parents <eol> in those first few years of life <eob> was strongly linked to children going on <eol> to do well at school later on. <eob>
In fact, quite small things that parents do <eob> are associated with good outcomes for children. <eob>
Talking and listening to a child, <eob> responding to them warmly, <eob> teaching them their letters and numbers, <eob> taking them on trips and visits. <eob>
Reading to children every day <eol> seems to be really important, too. <eob>
So in one study, <eob> children whose parents were reading <eol> to them daily when they were five <eob> and then showing an interest <eol> in their education at the age of 10, <eob> were significantly less likely to be in poverty <eol> at the age of 30 <eob> than those whose parents weren't doing those things. <eob>
Now, there are huge challenges <eol> with interpreting this type of science. <eob>
These studies show <eol> that certain things that parents do <eob> are correlated <eol> with good outcomes for children, <eob> but we don't necessarily know those behaviors <eol> caused the good outcomes, <eob> or whether some other factor <eol> is getting in the way. <eob>
For example, we have <eol> to take genes into account, <eob> and that's a whole other talk in itself. <eob>
But scientists working with this British study <eob> are working really hard <eol> to get at causes, <eob> and this is one study I particularly love. <eob>
In this one, <eob> they looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children <eob> born at the turn of the millennium. <eob>
Were the children going to bed <eol> at regular times, <eob> or did they go to bed <eol> at different times during the week? <eob>
The data showed that those children <eol> who were going to bed at different times <eob> were more likely to have behavioral problems, <eob> and then those that switched <eol> to having regular bedtimes <eob> often showed an improvement <eol> in behavior, <eob> and that was really crucial, <eob> because it suggested it was the bedtime routines <eob> that were really helping things <eol> get better for those kids. <eob>
Here's another one to think about. <eob>
In this one, <eob> scientists looked at children <eol> who were reading for pleasure. <eob>
That means that they picked up <eol> a magazine, a picture book, a story book. <eob>
The data showed that children <eol> who were reading for pleasure <eob> at the ages of five and 10 <eob> were more likely to go on in school <eol> better, on average, <eob> on school tests later in their lives. <eob>
And not just tests of reading, <eob> but tests of spelling and maths as well. <eob>
This study tried to control <eol> for all the confounding factors, <eob> so it looked at children <eol> who were equally intelligent <eob> and from the same social-class background, <eob> so it seemed as if it was the reading <eol> which really helped those children <eob> go on and score better <eol> on those school tests later in their lives. <eob>
Now at the start, <eob> I said the first lesson from this study <eob> was not to be born into poverty <eol> or into disadvantage, <eob> because those children tend to follow <eol> more difficult paths in their lives. <eob>
But then I said that parenting matters, <eob> and that good parenting, <eol> if you can call it that, <eob> helps children beat the odds <eob> and overcome some of those <eol> early disadvantages. <eob>
So wait, <eob> does that actually mean, then, that poverty <eol> doesn't matter after all? <eob>
You could argue it doesn't matter <eol> if a child is born poor -- <eob> as long as their parents <eol> are good parents, they're going to do just fine. <eob>
I don't believe that's true. <eob>
This study shows that poverty <eol> and parenting matter. <eob>
And one study actually put figures on that, <eob> so it looked at children growing up <eol> in persistent poverty <eob> and how well they were doing at school. <eob>
The data showed <eob> that even when their parents <eol> were doing everything right -- <eob> putting them to bed on time <eob> and reading to them every day <eol> and everything else -- <eob> that only got those children so far. <eob>
Good parenting only reduced the educational gap <eob> between the rich and poor children <eol> by about 50 percent. <eob>
Now that means that poverty <eol> leaves a really lasting scar, <eob> and it means that if we really want <eol> to ensure the success and well-being <eob> of the next generation, <eob> then tackling child poverty is an incredibly <eol> important thing to do. <eob>
Now, what does all this mean <eol> for you and me? <eob>
Are there lessons here <eol> we can all take home and use? <eob>
As a scientist and a journalist, <eob> I like to have some science <eol> to inform my parenting ... <eob> and I can tell you that when you're shouting <eol> at your kids <eob> to go to bed on time, <eob> it really helps to have <eol> the scientific literature on your side. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And wouldn't it be great to think <eob> that all we had to do to have <eol> happy, successful children <eob> was to talk to them, <eol> be interested in their future, <eob> put them to bed on time, <eol> and give them a book to read? <eob>
Our job would be done. <eob>
Now, as you can imagine, <eob> the answers aren't quite <eol> as simple as that. <eob>
For one thing, this study looks at what happens <eob> to thousands and thousands of children <eol> on average, <eob> but that doesn't necessarily say <eol> what will help my child or your child <eob> or any individual child. <eob>
In the end, each of our children <eol> is going to walk their own path, <eob> and that's partly defined <eol> by the genes they inherit <eob> and of course all the experiences <eol> they have through their lives, <eob> including their interactions with us, their parents. <eob>
I will tell you what I did <eol> after I learned all this. <eob>
It's a bit embarrassing. <eob>
I realized I was so busy working, <eob> and ironically, <eob> learning and writing about this <eol> incredible study of British children, <eob> that there were days when I hardly even spoke <eol> to my own British children. <eob>
So at home, we introduced talking time, <eob> which is just 15 minutes <eol> at the end of the day <eob> when we talk and listen to the boys. <eob>
I try better now to ask them <eol> what they did today, <eob> and to show that I value <eol> what they do at school. <eob>
Of course, I make sure they always <eol> have a book to read. <eob>
I tell them I'm ambitious <eol> for their future, <eob> and I think they can be happy <eol> and do great things. <eob>
I don't know that any of <eol> that will make a difference, <eob> but I'm pretty confident it <eol> won't do them any harm, <eob> and it might even do them some good. <eob>
Ultimately, if we want happy children, <eob> all we can do is listen to the science, <eob> and of course, <eob> listen to our children themselves. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
We live in a time of fear, <eob> and our response to fear <eol> can either be to contract <eob> and attempt to guard ourselves <eob> or to extend ourselves, hold on to each other, <eob> and face our fears together. <eob>
What is your instinct? <eob>
What do you see more of in the world? <eob>
The problem with the first approach <eob> is that in our mounting isolation, <eob> we divide ourselves from others. <eob>
Our sense of isolation grows, <eob> because our imagination goes into overdrive <eob> about the people and the spaces <eol> that we no longer engage with. <eob>
Our sense of otherness grows, <eol> and we lose empathy. <eob>
Today I'm going to tell you <eol> about a group of people <eob> that took the global challenge of terrorism <eob> and began creating spaces <eol> where strangers connect in solidarity. <eob>
My own obsession with what I see <eol> as irrational divisions began as a child. <eob>
As a fourth-generation Kenyan <eol> Muslim of Indian origin, <eob> it bothered me that in four generations, <eob> there wasn't a single marriage <eol> in my family <eob> outside of my small religious community. <eob>
And I wondered what that was about. <eob> Was it fear? <eob> Was it racism? <eob> Was it cultural preservation? <eob>
Did it have something to do <eol> with colonialism? <eob>
Certainly, we didn't share <eol> a lot of the same public spaces with others. <eob>
These divisions bothered me deeply, <eol> and they drove my career choices. <eob>
When I was 20, the US embassies <eol> in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed. <eob>
A year later, I was on my way <eol> to the Middle East <eob> to study conflict resolution. <eob>
And then from that point on, <eob> it wasn't very hard for me <eol> to find insecure environments to work in, <eob> because the world was quickly shifting <eob> in what we now know as the time of terrorism. <eob>
I was in Washington, DC <eol> when 9 / 11 happened, <eob> and then I moved back home <eol> to Kenya to work with refugees <eob> and then later worked in Pakistan <eob> and in Afghanistan. <eob>
In all of these places, what I noticed <eob> was how important physical spaces are <eob> to making us feel safe <eob> and well <eob> and like we belong. <eob>
In 2013, I came back home <eol> to Nairobi from Afghanistan. <eob> Al-Shabaab operatives had besieged Westgate <eol> shopping center, <eob> killing 67 people in a day <eol> of utter horror. <eob>
Soon after that, <eob> I could see how Nairobi <eol> was beginning to change, <eob> and it was beginning to feel more like the fear <eol> and terror-weary <eob> and war-torn cities <eol> that I had worked in. <eob>
And Nairobi continues to grow <eol> in fear-driven ways. <eob>
We see more walls, more barriers, <eob> more security. <eob>
And like other parts of the world, <eob> we are experiencing an erosion <eol> of human connection. <eob>
Divisions along religious lines <eol> are deepening, <eob> and we're doubting more and more <eol> how much we have in common. <eob>
We are at a pivotal time <eob> when we need to restore <eol> our confidence in humanity <eob> and stand boldly and visibly together. <eob>
So in 2014, I brought together <eol> a group of people in Nairobi <eob> to figure out what to do: <eob> public intellectuals, diplomats, artists, <eol> development workers. <eob>
And the group articulated our challenge <eol> as threefold: <eob> one, to reclaim the city <eol> from the narrative of terrorism <eob> and back into the hands <eol> of the people that live there; <eob> two, introduce a language <eol> beyond race, tribe or religion <eob> that would help us transcend our differences; <eob> and three, provide a gesture <eol> that would help restore empathy <eob> and conversation and trust. <eob>
One of the people in this group <eol> was an artist and architect, <eob> Yazmany Arboleda. <eob>
He and I have collaborated <eol> in other parts of the world <eob> over many years. <eob>
He has a history <eob> of disrupting urban environments <eob> and making strangers connect <eob> in incredible, beautiful and spectacular ways. <eob>
He had an idea. <eob>
The idea was to unite <eol> people of different faiths <eob> by getting them to paint <eol> each other's houses of worship, <eob> mosques, temples, <eol> synagogues, churches, <eob> paint them yellow <eob> in the name of love. <eob>
By focusing on icons of faith, <eob> we would get people to reexamine <eol> the true essence of their faith, <eob> the common belief that we share <eol> in kindness, generosity and friendship. <eob>
By creating pathways <eol> between houses of worship <eob> within one neighborhood, <eob> we would create islands of stability <eob> and networks of people <eob> that could withstand threats. <eob>
And neighbors, by picking up <eol> a paintbrush with other neighbors, <eob> would engage not just with their heads <eob> but with their hands and with their hearts. <eob>
And the painted buildings <eol> would become sculptures in the landscape <eob> that speak of people from very different backgrounds <eob> that stand together. <eob>
We'd call the project <eol> "Colour in Faith." <eob> We loved the idea and we immediately began <eol> approaching houses of worship: <eob> churches, temples, mosques, synagogues. <eob>
Door to door, we went to more <eol> than 60 rabbis, <eob> imams, pastors <eol> and priests. <eob>
As you can imagine, <eob> bringing these communities together <eob> when prejudices <eol> are reinforced by a global pandemic of fear <eob> is not easy. <eob> It was complicated. <eob> We were confronted <eol> with the hierarchy of decision-making <eob> within religious establishments. <eob>
For example, with Catholic churches, <eob> we were told that the archbishop <eol> would have to make the decision. <eob>
And so we wrote a letter <eol> to the archbishop. <eob>
We wrote a letter to the Vatican. <eob>
We're still waiting to hear back. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And with other houses of worship, <eob> we were told that the patrons, <eol> the people that pay for the building <eob> and the construction and the painting <eol> of the buildings <eob> would have to make a decision. <eob>
And then we came head-to-head <eob> with the long legacy of missionary <eol> and donor dependence <eob> that so impedes unconditional civic action, <eob> and we learned this the hard way. <eob>
There was one community <eob> that in our repeated conversations <eol> would keep asking us <eob> to appreciate them. <eob>
And so we would keep going back <eob> and telling them that we appreciate them, <eob> and of course, <eob> if we didn't appreciate them, <eol> we wouldn't be here. <eob>
And then we learned painfully late in the game <eob> that the word "appreciation" <eol> is code for getting paid to participate. <eob>
And so we challenged them <eob> and we asked the question, <eob> "So what will it cost? <eob>
How much could we pay you? <eob>
And if we pay for your faith, <eol> is it really faith?" <eob> We started the project asking the question, <eob> "Where does your faith live?" <eob> And here we found ourselves <eol> asking the question, <eob> "How much does your faith cost?" <eob>
But the most difficult issue <eol> was the perceived risk of standing apart. <eob>
We had one synagogue <eol> that flat-out refused to participate <eob> because it feared drawing attention to itself <eob> and becoming a target. <eob>
Similarly, we had a mosque <eol> that also feared becoming a target. <eob>
And these fears are justified. <eob>
And yet, there were 25 houses <eol> of worship that pledged to participate. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
These bold leaders took the gesture <eol> and reinforced it with their own meaning. <eob>
For some, it was to tell the world <eol> that they're not terrorists. <eob>
For others, it was to welcome people <eol> through their doors to ask questions. <eob>
And for some, it was to bridge the gap <eob> between the older and the younger generation, <eob> which by the way is something <eol> that many faiths are grappling with right now. <eob>
And for some it was simply <eol> to build neighborhood solidarity <eob> in advance of feared election violence. <eob>
When asked why yellow, <eob> one imam beautifully said, <eob> "Yellow is the color of the sun. <eob>
The sun shines on us all equally. <eob>
It does not discriminate." <eob> He and others spread the word <eol> through their congregations <eob> and over the radio. <eob>
Municipal government officials <eol> stepped forward and helped <eob> with permits and with convening <eol> civil society organizations. <eob>
A paint company donated a thousand <eol> liters of yellow paint <eob> mixed especially for us in what they now call <eol> "optimistic yellow." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And a poetry collective <eol> joined forces with a university <eob> and hosted a series of tweet chats <eob> that challenged the nation on issues of faith, <eob> our faith not just in the context <eol> of religion, <eob> but our faith in politicians <eol> and tribe and nation, <eob> our faith in the older generation <eol> and in the younger generation. <eob>
And then Colour in Faith <eol> was launched at a gallery event <eob> that invited an incredible mix <eol> of gallerygoers <eob> and religious leaders and artists <eol> and businesspeople. <eob>
Already, even before picking up <eol> a paintbrush, <eob> we had accomplished so much <eol> of the conversation and connection <eob> that we had hoped for. <eob>
And then we began to paint. <eob>
Muslims stood by Christians <eob> and atheists and agnostics and Hindus <eob> and painted a mosque yellow. <eob>
And then they all came together <eol> again and painted a church yellow, <eob> and then another mosque, <eob> and then another church. <eob>
Poets and musicians performed <eol> while we painted. <eob>
We painted in Nairobi, <eob> and then we painted in Mombasa. <eob>
The local and international press <eol> did features on Colour in Faith <eob> in English and French and Swahili <eob> and Spanish and Somali. <eob>
CNN highlighted Colour in Faith as a way <eol> of bringing communities together. <eob>
And our social media platforms lit up, <eob> connecting more and more people. <eob>
And these neighbors continued <eol> to stay in touch. <eob>
There are some that are pursuing <eol> politics with a platform of peace, <eob> and we have communities as far <eol> as Argentina and the US <eob> and as close as Mali and Rwanda <eob> that are asking for our help. <eob>
And we would love to help. <eob>
It's our dream that this project, <eol> this idea, spreads across the world, <eob> with or without our support. <eob>
Colour in Faith is literally highlighting those <eol> who mean well in yellow. <eob> Colour in Faith <eol> is binding neighborhoods together, <eob> and it's our hope that when threats come knocking, <eob> they will collectively sift <eol> fact from rumor <eob> and stand in solidarity. <eob>
We've proven that the human family <eol> can come together and send a message <eob> far brighter and more powerful <eob> than the voices of those that wish <eol> to do us harm. <eob>
Though fear is infectious, <eob> we are showing that so is hope. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I had been a photographer <eob> for 18 years <eob> before I began the Microsculpture Project. <eob>
And in that time, I had shot <eol> global ad campaigns, <eob> I had the opportunity to photograph <eol> some of my generation's icons, <eob> and I was traveling the world. <eob>
I got to a point in my career <eol> that I dreamed of getting to, <eob> and yet, for some reason, <eol> I still felt a little bit unfulfilled. <eob>
Despite the extraordinary things <eol> I was shooting and experiencing, <eob> they'd started to feel <eol> a little bit ordinary to me. <eob>
I was also getting concerned <eob> about how disposable photography <eol> had started to feel in the digital world, <eob> and I really wanted to produce <eol> images that had a sense of worth again. <eob>
And I needed a subject <eol> that felt extraordinary. <eob>
Sometimes I wish I had <eol> the eyes of a child. <eob>
And by that I mean, <eol> I wish I could look at the world <eob> in the same as I did <eol> when I was a small boy. <eob>
I think there is a danger, as we get older, <eob> that our curiosity becomes <eol> slightly muted or dulled by familiarity. <eob>
And as a visual creator, <eol> one of the challenges for me <eob> is to present the familiar in a new <eol> and engaging way. <eob>
Fortunately for me, though, <eol> I've got two great kids <eob> who are still curious about the world. <eob>
Sebastian -- he's still curious <eol> about the world, and in 2014, in spring, <eob> he brought in a ground beetle from the garden. <eob>
There was nothing particularly <eol> special about this insect -- <eob> you know, it was a common species. <eob>
But he was still curious, <eob> and he brought it up to my office, <eob> and we decided to look <eol> at it under his microscope. <eob>
He had a little science kit for Christmas. <eob>
And this is what we saw. <eob>
Now, when I first saw this, <eol> it blew me away. <eob>
Up here -- this is the back <eol> of the ground beetle. <eob>
When I first saw it, <eol> it reminded me of a galaxy. <eob>
And all the time, this had just <eol> been outside our window. <eob>
You know, I was looking <eol> for this extraordinary subject, <eob> and it took Seb's eyes <eol> and curiosity to bring it in to me. <eob>
So I decided to photograph it for him, <eol> and this is what I produced. <eob>
I basically asked myself <eol> two simple questions. <eob>
The first one: <eob> Could I take all my knowledge <eol> and skill of photographic lighting <eob> and take that onto a subject <eol> that's five millimeters long? <eob>
But also: Could I keep creative <eol> control over that lighting <eob> on a subject that size? <eob>
So I practiced <eol> on some other found specimens, <eob> and I approached the Oxford University Museum of Natural History <eob> to see if I could have access <eol> to their collection, <eob> to progress the project. <eob>
And I went up there for a meeting, <eob> and I showed them some of the images <eol> that I'd been shooting, <eob> and they could see the kind <eol> of detail I was able to get. <eob>
I don't think they'd ever really seen <eol> anything quite like it before, <eob> and from that point forward, <eol> they gave me open access <eob> to their entire collection <eob> and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan, <eol> their entomologist. <eob>
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years, <eob> I shot 37 insects from their collection. <eob>
And the way I work <eob> is that I essentially split <eol> the insect up into multiple sections, <eob> and I treat each one of those <eol> sections like a small still life. <eob>
So for example, if I was photographing <eol> the eye of the insect, <eob> which is normally quite smooth <eol> and dome-shaped, <eob> then I'd use a light source <eol> that is large and soft and diffuse, <eob> so I don't get any harsh hot spots <eol> on that surface. <eob>
But once my attention <eol> turns over to a hairy leg, <eob> that lighting setup will change completely. <eob>
And so I make that one tiny section <eol> look as beautiful as I possibly can, <eob> and I work my way across the insect <eob> until I have about 20 or 25 different sections. <eob>
The issue with photography <eol> at high magnification <eob> is that there is inherently <eol> a very shallow depth of field. <eob>
So to get around that, what I do is, <eob> I put my camera on a rail <eob> that I can automate to move <eol> 10 microns in between each shot. <eob>
That's about one-seventh <eol> the width of a human hair. <eob>
And then that provides me <eol> with a deep stack of images. <eob>
Each has a tiny sliver <eol> of focus all the way through. <eob>
And I can squash that down <eob> to produce one image that is fully <eol> focused from front to back. <eob>
So essentially, that gives me 25 <eol> sections that are fully focused <eob> and beautifully lit. <eob>
Now, each one of my images <eob> is made up of anywhere <eol> between 8- and 10,000 separate shots. <eob>
They take about three-and-a-half <eol> weeks to create, <eob> and the file sizes on average <eol> are about four gigabytes. <eob>
So I've got plenty of information <eol> to play with when I'm printing. <eob>
And the prints at the exhibition <eol> are around the three-meter mark. <eob>
In fact, I had a show in Milan two weeks ago, <eob> and we had some prints there <eol> that were nine meters long. <eob>
But, you know, I realize <eob> that these images still have <eol> to work in the digital world. <eob>
There's no point in me putting all my blood, <eol> sweat and tears <eob> into these pictures <eob> if they're only going to be showing <eol> 500 pixels on a screen. <eob>
So with the help of Rob Chandler <eol> and Will Cookson, <eob> we developed a website <eob> that enables the viewer to immerse themselves <eob> into the full four-gigabyte files, <eob> and they can explore <eol> all that microscopic detail. <eob>
So if you have the time, <eol> and I encourage you, <eob> please visit microsculpture.net <eob> and go and have a play. <eob>
It's good fun. <eob>
I first showed the work at Oxford, <eob> and since then, it's moved on <eol> to the Middle East. <eob>
It's now back in Europe and goes <eol> to Copenhagen this month. <eob>
And the feedback has been great. <eob>
You know, I get emails, actually, <eol> from all over the world -- <eob> from teachers, at the moment, <eol> who are using the website in school. <eob>
The kids are using them on the tablet. <eob>
They're zooming into the pictures <eob> and using it for art class, biology class. <eob>
And that's not something I planned. <eob>
That's just a beautiful offshoot <eol> of the project. <eob>
In fact, one of the things <eol> I like to do at the exhibitions <eob> is actually look at the kiddies' reactions. <eob>
And, you know, standing in front <eol> of a three-meter insect, <eob> they could have been horrified. <eob>
But they're not. They look in wonder. <eob>
This little chap here, he stood there <eol> for five minutes, motionless. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And at the end of the day, actually, <eol> at the end of the day at the exhibitions, <eob> we have to wipe down the lower third <eol> of the big prints — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> just to remove all those <eol> sticky handprints, <eob> because all they want to do is touch <eol> those big bugs. <eob>
I do want to leave you with one final image, <eol> if that's OK. <eob>
This has to do with Charles Darwin. <eob>
One of the recent images <eol> that I photographed <eob> was this one here. <eob>
I'm talking about the creature in the box, <eol> not my cat. <eob>
And this is a shield bug <eob> that Charles Darwin brought back <eol> from Australia <eob> on the HMS Beagle in 1836. <eob>
And when I got it home, <eob> I stood in my kitchen and stared at it <eol> for about 20 minutes. <eob>
I couldn't believe I was in possession <eol> of this beautiful creature. <eob>
And at that moment, I kind of realized <eob> that this validated the project for me. <eob>
The fact that the museum was willing <eol> to risk me playing with this <eob> kind of showed me that my images <eol> had worth -- <eob> you know, they weren't disposable. <eob>
That's the image that I produced. <eob>
I often wonder, still, <eol> when I look at this: <eob> What would Charles Darwin make of these images? <eob>
Do you think he'd like his picture <eol> of his shield bug? I hope so. <eob>
So -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know, I think it's strange in a way. <eob>
I'm a visual person, <eol> I'm a creative person, <eob> but I still needed the eyes of a child <eol> to find my extraordinary subject. <eob>
That's the way it was. <eob>
So all I can say is, thank you <eol> very much, Sebastian; <eob> I am very, very grateful. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I took a cell phone <eob> and accidentally made myself famous. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was just talking about the things <eol> that I cared about, <eob> but with the click of a button <eob> and an incendiary viral video <eob> I propelled myself <eol> into overnight stardom. <eob>
When I say overnight, <eob> I mean I literally woke up <eol> the next morning <eob> with so many notifications on my phone, <eob> I thought I slept <eol> through a national tragedy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was the craziest thing, guys, <eob> but when it came to my influence <eol> and my exposure, <eob> I literally took a quantum leap. <eob>
So I made more videos <eob> and the subject matter of my videos <eob> was often the most divisive <eol> subject in American life, <eob> but it was the way <eol> that I articulated race <eob> that made me somewhat <eol> of a digital lightning rod. <eob>
See, being a survivor <eol> myself of police brutality <eob> and having lost a childhood friend, <eob> Alonzo Ashley, <eob> at the hands of the police, <eob> I had a little something <eol> to say about the topic. <eob>
You see, this was at the height <eol> of the Black Lives Matter furor <eob> and people seemed to be turning <eol> to me to articulate their viewpoints, <eob> and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming. <eob>
You see, the internet <eol> has this interesting quality. <eob>
In one way, it totally brought the world together, <eob> and I remember being a kid <eob> and all of this utopian propaganda <eol> was being dumped on us <eob> about how the World Wide Web <eob> was going to span the reaches <eol> of people across the globe. <eob>
But as it turns out, people are people. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this magical superhighway <eob> also took the demons of our nature <eob> and gave them Ferraris. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You see, technology, y'all, <eol> is a lot like money. <eob>
It just brings out what's already <eol> inside you and amplifies it. <eob>
And so I soon became familiar <eol> with the phenomenon of the internet troll. <eob>
These guys seem to live beneath <eol> the bridges <eob> of said superhighway -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they also missed the memo <eol> about the enlightenment of the internet age. <eob>
I remember being called <eob> highly colorful racial slurs <eob> by those who use the anonymity <eol> of the internet <eob> as a Klan hood. <eob>
And some of them were pretty creative, actually, <eob> but others were pretty wounding, <eob> especially navigating the post-traumatic world <eob> of a police brutality survivor <eob> in the height of Black Lives Matter, <eob> with all of these people being killed on my timeline. <eob>
To these trolls, I wasn't a human. <eob>
I was an idea, an object, <eob> a caricature. <eob>
Did I mention that this race stuff <eol> can be kind of divisive? <eob>
You see, I'm an innately curious person <eob> and as I drew my sword to engage <eol> in epic battles in the comment section -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I also began to notice <eob> that a few of my trolls <eol> actually had brains, <eob> which made me even more curious <eol> and what to understand them even further. <eob>
And although these supposed morons <eob> engaged in what appeared <eol> to be original thought, <eob> I said to myself, <eob> "Um, these guys are highly misinformed, <eob> at least according to my knowledge." <eob> Where are these guys <eol> getting these arguments from? <eob>
Like, was there some kind <eol> of alternative universe <eob> with alternative facts? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Was history and gravity <eol> optional over there? <eob>
I don't know. <eob>
But I needed to know. Like, <eol> I wanted to know. <eob> And as it turns out, <eol> I had no idea about digital echo chambers. <eob>
That same target marketing algorithm <eob> that feeds you more of the products <eol> you like to buy <eob> also feeds you more of the news <eol> that you like to hear. <eob>
I had been living in an online universe <eob> that just reflected <eol> my worldview back to me. <eob>
So my timeline was pretty liberal. <eob>
I had no Breitbart or Infowars <eol> or Fox News. <eob>
No, no, I was all MSNBC <eol> and The Daily Show, <eob> CNN and theGrio, right? <eob>
Well, these trolls were hopping <eol> the dimensional doorway <eob> and I needed to figure out how. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So what I decided to do <eob> was trick the Facebook algorithm <eob> into feeding me more news <eol> that I didn't necessarily agree with, <eob> and this worked fine for a while, <eol> but it wasn't enough, <eob> because my online footprint <eob> already established the patterns <eol> that I like to hear. <eob>
So with the anonymity of the internet, <eob> I went undercover. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I set up this ghost profile <eol> and went crazy. <eob>
Now, on a practical level, <eol> it was very simple, <eob> but on an emotional level, <eol> it was kind of daunting, <eob> especially with the racist vitriol <eol> that I had experienced. <eob>
But what I didn't realize is that my trolls <eol> were inoculating me, <eob> thickening my skin, <eob> making me immune to viewpoints <eol> that I didn't necessarily agree with, <eob> and so I didn't react to the same things <eol> as I would have several months prior. <eob> All right? So I pressed on. <eob>
Noticing that this stuff <eol> also worked on YouTube, <eob> I became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And digitally I began to infiltrate <eol> the infamous alt-right movement. <eob>
Now, my doppelgänger <eob> was Edgar Rice Burroughs' <eol> John Carter character -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a sci-fi hero who was once <eol> a Confederate soldier. <eob>
And to think, like, years ago, <eol> I would have needed acting training <eob> and, like, makeup and a fake ID. <eob>
Now I could just lurk. <eob>
And so I started <eob> with a little Infowars, <eob> went on into some American Renaissance, <eob> National Vanguard Alliance, <eob> and, you know, I started commenting on videos, <eob> talking bad about Al Sharpton <eol> and Black Lives Matter. <eob>
I started bemoaning race baiters <eol> like Eric Holder and Barack Obama <eob> and just mirroring the antiblack sentiments <eob> that were thrown at me. <eob>
And to be honest, it was kind <eol> of exhilarating. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Like, I would literally spend days <eol> clicking through my new racist profile -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Goofing off at work in Aryan land. <eob>
It was something else. <eob>
And so I then started visiting some of the pages <eob> of my former trolls, <eob> and a lot of these guys <eol> were just regular Joes, <eob> a lot of outdoorsmen, <eol> hunters, computer nerds, <eob> some of them family guys <eol> with videos of their families. <eob>
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all <eol> could be in this room right now. Right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But when <eob> I went undercover, <eob> I found a lovely plethora <eol> of characters, <eob> luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer <eol> and David Duke. <eob>
All of these guys were thought <eol> leaders in their own right, <eob> but over time, the alt-right movement <eol> ended up using their information <eob> to fuel their momentum. <eob>
And I'm going to tell you what else <eol> led to the momentum of the alt-right: <eob> the left wing's wholesale demonization <eol> of everything white and male. <eob>
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, <eol> you're in league with Satan. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, would you believe, <eob> would you believe that some people <eol> find that offensive? <eob> And — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so, I mean, listen, <eob> the fact is that millennials <eol> get a lifetime of diet brand history. <eob>
I mean, America seems to be hellbent <eol> on filling its textbooks <eob> with CliffsNotes versions <eol> of its dark past. <eob>
This severely, severely decontextualizes race <eol> and the anger associated with it, <eob> and that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow. <eob>
Add in the wild landscape of the internet <eob> and it's easy to sell rebranded <eol> "Mein Kampf" ideas <eob> to a generation who has been <eol> failed by public schools. <eob>
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked. <eob>
Alt-facts have that quality. <eob>
However, one theme kept screaming at me <eol> through the subtext of those arguments, <eob> and that was, <eob> why should I be hated <eol> for who I cannot help but be? <eob>
Now, as a black man in America, <eol> that resonated with me. <eob>
I have spent so much time <eob> defending myself against attempts to demonize me <eob> and make me apologize for who I am, <eob> trying to portray me as something <eol> that I'm not, <eob> some kind of thug or gangster, <eol> a menace to society. <eob> Unexpected compassion. <eob> Wow. <eob> Now, listen, <eob> the historical source of the demonization <eol> of black males and white males <eob> is highly different, <eob> and where you fall on this argument, <eob> sadly, tends <eol> to be an accident of birth. <eob>
Now, you're probably surprised <eol> by this perspective, <eob> and so was I. <eob> Never in a billion years did I think <eol> that I could have some kind of compassion <eob> for people who hated <eol> my guts. <eob>
Now, mind you, not enough compassion <eol> like I want to be friends. <eob>
I don't have infinite olive branches <eol> to extend to people <eob> who, like, would not want <eol> to see me on this planet. Right? <eob> But just enough compassion to understand <eol> how they got to where they are. <eob>
And to be honest, <eob> there were a couple of fair points. <eob>
One of them was how liberals <eol> have this wide acceptance for everybody <eob> except for those with honestly held <eol> conservative viewpoints. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Heaven forbid you love God, <eol> this country and mean it. Right? <eob>
And another thing that they talked about <eol> was this fear that they had <eob> of something that they labeled <eol> as "white genocide," <eob> that diversity would be a force <eol> that would wipe them out. <eob>
Now listen, <eob> I know what it is to fear <eob> for the fate of your people. <eob>
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence, <eob> mass incarceration, <eol> gentrification, police shootings, <eob> black people have more than enough reasons <eol> to stay up at night. <eob>
But if nature is into diversity <eol> and you are not, <eob> you're going to lose <eol> that fight, buddy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You see, nature doesn't care about your race. <eol> That's man-made. <eob> Nature just cares about healthy organisms, <eob> and your precious ethnic features <eol> are expendable to that aim. <eob>
So the moment that you let <eol> go of that racist identity <eob> and relatch onto humanity, <eob> all your problems go away. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to tell you what race <eol> ain't about to die out: <eob> the human race. <eob> Join the party. The water's great. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Until the water gets too hot, <eol> but that's another TED Talk. <eob>
The point is that to get <eol> to this point of understanding, <eob> you have to let go of that fear <eob> and embrace your curiosity, <eob> and sadly, too many people <eol> will not take that journey <eob> to see the world <eol> from the other side. <eob>
And, I mean, let's be honest, <eob> that doesn't just go <eol> for progressives, <eob> but also to the right wing and conservatives. <eob>
You know, as fair as some <eol> of their points were, <eob> they were still trapped <eol> in their own echo chambers, <eob> recycling old, outdated points of view, <eob> never getting a diversity in perspective, <eob> not making them well-rounded in their worldview. <eob>
So they're not hearing <eol> certain anti-racist and political voices, <eob> voices like Tim Wise <eob> and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed. <eob>
All of these voices have the answers <eol> to the questions that they want, <eob> but unfortunately they will not hear them <eol> due to the power of these echo chambers. <eob>
We have got to break out <eol> of these digital divides, <eob> because as our technology advances, <eob> the consequences of our tribalism <eol> become more dangerous. <eob>
And this whole experience <eol> taught me something: <eob> our gadgets ain't going to save us. <eob>
All these technological devices <eob> are only mastery of the universe <eol> out there, not the one in here. <eob>
And so that's all IQ, not EQ. <eob>
That's a dangerous imbalance. <eob>
Where do you get the emotional intelligence, <eob> the character development, <eob> the virtues of patience, <eol> forbearance, compassion, <eob> you know, the things that make sure <eol> that these devices, however advanced, <eob> become a blessing and not a curse? <eob>
Seems to be me that humanity <eol> itself needs an upgrade. <eob>
Now -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
That's a big task, understandably, <eob> but I don't believe in any kind <eol> of unbeatable monster. <eob>
There was no giant out there <eol> without perhaps a simple Achilles heel. <eob>
And what if I told you <eob> that one of the best ways <eol> to actually overcome this <eob> is to have courageous conversations <eob> with difficult people, <eob> people who do not see the world the same way <eol> that you see the world? <eob>
Oh yes, folks, conversations <eol> may be indeed the key to that upgrade, <eob> because remember, <eob> language was the first form of virtual reality. <eob>
It is literally a symbolic representation <eol> of the physical world, <eob> and through this device, <eol> we change the physical world. <eob>
Keep in mind, conversations <eol> stop violence, <eob> conversations start countries, <eob> they build bridges, <eob> and when the chips are down, <eob> conversations are the last tools that humans use <eob> before they pick up their guns. <eob>
And I ain't talking about online <eol> safe conversations <eob> from the security of your laptop. <eob> No. <eob> I'm talking about in-your-face <eol> conversations with real, breathing people. <eob>
And for me, this looks like <eol> running a community forum <eob> called Shop Talk Live. <eob>
Now, in Shop Talk Live -- somebody's <eol> been there, right? <eob>
In Shop Talk Live, <eob> we have the conversations <eol> that change lives. <eob>
We meet the community right where they are, <eob> and we've done everything <eol> from divert gang violence in real time <eob> to help find people jobs <eob> to mentoring homeless youth. <eob>
And the reason why we needed to do this <eob> is because there was a severe lack <eol> of trust in the black community <eob> due to the violence <eol> of the crack era. <eob>
And so we ended up taking agency <eol> into our own hands, <eob> solving our own problems, <eob> not waiting for anybody else. <eob>
And the truth is, <eob> from the mayor to the felon, <eob> you're going to find them <eol> in that barber shop. <eob>
And so what we did was just organize <eol> what was already going on. <eob>
And so what I started doing was mining <eol> these alternative viewpoints <eob> from these alternative digital universes, <eob> dissecting them, breaking them down <eol> into controversial talking points. <eob>
Then, with my cell phone, <eob> I flipped the internet against itself <eob> and began to broadcast these live conversations <eob> to my online followers. <eob>
This made them want to leave <eol> the safety of their laptops <eob> and meet us in person <eol> to have real conversations <eob> with real people in real life. <eob>
And we did this. Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Sometimes I sit back, and I reflect <eol> on the paradox <eob> of me just trying <eol> to solve the problems, <eob> us trying to solve the problems <eol> in our own communities -- <eob> we build bridges to so many other communities, <eob> from the LGBTQ community <eol> to the Arab immigrant community <eob> and even sat down with somebody <eol> with a Confederate flag on their hat <eob> and talked about the things <eol> that actually matter. <eob>
It is time that we stop trying <eob> to hack our way around the human experience. <eob>
There is no way out of each other. <eob> Stop trying to find one. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We have to understand something. <eob> Human beings all want the same things <eob> and we have to go through each other <eol> to get these things. <eob>
These courageous conversations are the way <eol> that these bridges are built. <eob>
It's time that we start <eol> seeing people as people <eob> and not simply the ideas <eol> that we project onto them or react to. <eob>
Human beings are not the barriers <eob> but the gateways to the very things <eol> that we want. <eob>
This is a collective <eol> and conscious evolution. <eob>
My journey began with a terribly popular <eol> cell phone video <eob> and a fallen friend. <eob>
Your journey begins right about now. <eob>
Join the renaissance in human connection. <eob>
It is going to happen with or without you. <eob>
My suggestion: pick a topic, <eol> and start a community dialogue <eob> in your neck of the woods. <eob>
Meet folks back in real life. <eob>
And I'm going to tell you, <eob> when you trick the algorithm <eol> of your existence, <eob> you will get some diversified experiences. <eob>
It is time to grow, people. <eob>
And when we do this, not if, <eob> it will be clear that the key <eol> to this upgrade <eob> was always our inner world, <eol> not some device that we create, <eob> and the doorways <eol> to this experience is now, <eob> and will forever be, each other. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What are you doing on this stage <eob> in front of all these people? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Run! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Run <eob> now. <eob>
That's the voice of my anxiety talking. <eob>
Even when there's absolutely <eol> nothing wrong, <eob> I sometimes get this overwhelming <eol> sense of doom, <eob> like danger is lurking just around the corner. <eob>
You see, a few years ago, <eob> I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety <eob> and depression -- <eob> two conditions that often go hand in hand. <eob>
Now, there was a time <eol> I wouldn't have told anybody, <eob> especially not in front <eol> of a big audience. <eob>
As a black woman, <eob> I've had to develop extraordinary <eol> resilience to succeed. <eob>
And like most people in my community, <eob> I had the misconception that depression <eol> was a sign of weakness, <eob> a character flaw. <eob>
But I wasn't weak; <eob> I was a high achiever. <eob>
I'd earned a Master's degree <eol> in Media Studies <eob> and had a string of high-profile jobs <eol> in the film and television industries. <eob>
I'd even won two Emmy Awards <eol> for my hard work. <eob>
Sure, I was totally spent, <eob> I lacked interest <eol> in things I used to enjoy, <eob> barely ate, <eob> struggled with insomnia <eob> and felt isolated and depleted. <eob> But depressed? <eob> No, not me. <eob>
It took weeks before I could admit it, <eob> but the doctor was right: <eob> I was depressed. <eob>
Still, I didn't tell anybody <eol> about my diagnosis. <eob>
I was too ashamed. <eob>
I didn't think I had the right <eol> to be depressed. <eob>
I had a privileged life <eob> with a loving family <eol> and a successful career. <eob>
And when I thought <eol> about the unspeakable horrors <eob> that my ancestors had been <eol> through in this country <eob> so that I could have it better, <eob> my shame grew even deeper. <eob>
I was standing on their shoulders. <eob>
How could I let them down? <eob>
I would hold my head up, <eob> put a smile on my face <eob> and never tell a soul. <eob>
On July 4, 2013, <eob> my world came crashing in on me. <eob>
That was the day I got <eol> a phone call from my mom <eob> telling me that my 22-year-old nephew, <eol> Paul, had ended his life, <eob> after years of battling depression <eol> and anxiety. <eob>
There are no words <eol> that can describe the devastation I felt. <eob>
Paul and I were very close, <eob> but I had no idea he was in so much pain. <eob>
Neither one of us had ever talked to the other <eol> about our struggles. <eob>
The shame and stigma kept us both silent. <eob>
Now, my way of dealing with adversity <eol> is to face it head on, <eob> so I spent the next two years <eol> researching depression and anxiety, <eob> and what I found was mind-blowing. <eob>
The World Health Organization reports <eob> that depression is the leading cause <eol> of sickness and disability <eob> in the world. <eob>
While the exact cause of depression <eol> isn't clear, <eob> research suggests that most <eol> mental disorders develop, <eob> at least in part, <eob> because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, <eob> and / or an underlying <eol> genetic predisposition. <eob>
So you can't just shake it off. <eob>
For black Americans, <eob> stressors like racism <eol> and socioeconomic disparities <eob> put them at a 20 percent greater <eol> risk of developing a mental disorder, <eob> yet they seek mental health services <eob> at about half the rate <eol> of white Americans. <eob>
One reason is the stigma, <eob> with 63 percent of black Americans <eol> mistaking depression for a weakness. <eob>
Sadly, the suicide rate <eol> among black children <eob> has doubled in the past 20 years. <eob>
Now, here's the good news: <eob> seventy percent <eol> of people struggling with depression will improve <eob> with therapy, treatment and medication. <eob>
Armed with this information, <eob> I made a decision: <eob> I wasn't going to be silent anymore. <eob>
With my family's blessing, <eob> I would share our story <eob> in hopes of sparking a national conversation. <eob>
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said, <eob> "Being strong is killing us." <eob> She's right. <eob>
We have got to retire <eol> those tired, old narratives <eob> of the strong black woman <eob> and the super-masculine black man, <eob> who, no matter how many times <eol> they get knocked down, <eob> just shake it off and soldier on. <eob>
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness. <eob>
Feelings mean we're human. <eob>
And when we deny our humanity, <eob> it leaves us feeling empty inside, <eob> searching for ways to self-medicate <eol> in order to fill the void. <eob>
My drug was high achievement. <eob>
These days, I share my story openly, <eob> and I ask others to share theirs, too. <eob> I believe that's what it takes <eob> to help people <eol> who may be suffering in silence <eob> to know that they are not alone <eob> and to know that with help, <eob> they can heal. <eob>
Now, I still have my struggles, <eob> particularly with the anxiety, <eob> but I'm able to manage it <eob> through daily mediation, yoga <eol> and a relatively healthy diet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If I feel like things are starting to spiral, <eob> I make an appointment <eol> to see my therapist, <eob> a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, <eob> who has a great sense of humor <eob> and a familiarity that I find comforting. <eob>
I will always regret <eob> that I couldn't be there for my nephew. <eob>
But my sincerest hope <eob> is that I can inspire others <eol> with the lesson that I've learned. <eob>
Life is beautiful. <eob> Sometimes it's messy, <eob> and it's always unpredictable. <eob>
But it will all be OK <eob> when you have your support <eol> system to help you through it. <eob>
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy, <eob> you'll ask for a hand, too. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to begin today with a story <eob> and end with a revolution. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Are you ready? <eob>
Audience: Yes! <eob> Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story. <eob>
All my life I wanted to be an actress. <eob>
From the time I was very small, <eol> I could feel the magic of storytelling <eob> and I wanted to be a part of it. <eob>
So, at the ripe age of 21, <eob> I graduated from the American Academy <eol> of Dramatic Arts <eob> in New York City, <eob> bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, <eol> and ready to take my rightful place <eob> as the next Meryl Streep. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> That's my grandmother, <eol> not Meryl Streep. <eob> Now, it's important for this story <eol> that you understand <eob> that I was raised by a raging feminist. <eob>
I mean, just to give you some idea: <eob> when I was five or six years old <eol> and obsessed with "The Sound of Music," <eob> and running around, singing, <eol> "I am 16 going on 17," <eob> all day every day, <eob> my mother sat me down for a very serious conversation <eob> and she said, "OK, look. <eob>
I'm not going to say that <eob> you can't sing <eol> that song, <eob> but if you are going to sing <eol> that song, I do need you to understand <eob> the extremely problematic gender <eol> construct that it reinforces. <eob> "(Laughter) <eob> So that's where I come from. <eob>
So it just honestly never even occurred to me <eob> that I would be prevented <eol> from doing anything in my life <eob> because I'm a woman. <eob>
OK. So I graduate. <eob> And I start auditioning <eol> and I get work, slowly. <eob>
But I just start noticing <eol> that the parts available for women <eob> are terrible. <eob>
But, remember -- I came here <eob> to play smart, willful, <eol> complicated, interesting <eob> complex, confident female characters, right? <eob> Like Meryl. <eob> And all of the sudden, <eob> I am wrestling with 300 other gorgeous, talented women <eob> to play ... <eob> "[Female] No dialogue. <eob>
The character only needs <eol> to stand on a balcony, <eob> look forlorn, and walk <eol> back inside the house. <eob>
Only partial nudity." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest. <eob>
Attractive, cute, <eob> and flirty, she is the ideal girl <eol> and Brian's prize <eob> throughout the entire film. <eob> "" <eob> [Mom] A proper Southern belle <eol> who is making peace with the fact <eob> that her only purpose in life <eol> is to tend to her husband. <eob> "" <eob> [Abby] Must be OK <eol> with a tastefully shot gang rape, <eob> along with performing 19th-century dance. <eob> "(Laughter) <eob> Those are actual casting notices. <eob>
And so I just mentioned this <eol> to my agent one day, <eob> I say, "I feel like I'm not really <eol> going in for parts <eob> that I'm actually <eol> excited about playing. <eob> And he said," Yeah. <eol> I don't really know what to do with you. <eob>
You're too smart for the parts <eob> that are being written <eol> for women in their 20s, <eob> and you're not quite pretty <eol> enough to be the hot one, <eob> so I think you'll work when you're 35. <eob> "(Laughter) <eob>
And I said, "Oh. That's funny. <eob> I always thought that when you <eob> were 35, you <eol> were kind of, like, <eob> over the hill as an actress, <eob> that you <eob> were relegated <eol> to playing 20-year-olds' mothers." <eob> And he said, "Yeah — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> It's just the way it is." <eob> So, maybe a year or so after this, <eob> I'm having lunch <eol> with an actress friend of mine, <eob> and we're talking about <eol> how insane this is. <eob>
And we decide, you know what? No problem. <eob> We'll just make our own movie. <eob>
And I'll write and then I'll write it <eol> about two complex female characters. <eob> So we do. <eob> We set out to make this movie, <eob> and sort of accidentally, <eol> we end up hiring an all-female production team: <eob> the writer, directors, producers, <eob> and it's a film about two women. <eob>
And so pretty soon, <eol> we're sitting in the office <eob> of a successful male producer, <eob> and he goes, "OK, girls. <eob>
So, you do understand that at some point <eol> you are going to have to hire <eob> a male producer onboard, right? <eob>
Just so that people will trust you with their money." <eob> Over and over again, people tell us, <eob> "Yeah, but people don't really want <eol> to see films about women, <eob> so maybe you should think <eol> about making something else. <eob>
It's just the way it is." <eob> So we make the movie, anyway. <eob>
We scrape together 80,000 dollars, <eob> and we make it, and it does so well. <eob>
It gets into tons of festivals <eol> and we win a lot of awards <eob> and it's big and exciting. <eob>
But these experiences <eol> I've had just keep rubbing at me. <eob>
And so, I just start talking about them, <eob> first, at Q and A's after screenings of the film, <eob> and then I get invited to be on panels <eol> and talk at conferences. <eob>
And the really amazing thing <eol> is that, to begin with, <eob> when I'm just talking to audiences <eob> and other people, you know, <eol> coming up in the film industry, <eob> the universal reaction is, <eob> "Oh my god! This is terrible. <eol> What do we do about this?" <eob> But the bigger panels I get on, <eob> suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me, <eob> "Look, I totally agree with everything you're saying. <eob>
You just need to be really careful <eol> about where you say it. <eob> "An Oscar-winning producer tells me <eob> that she doesn't think it's a good idea <eol> to play the woman card. <eob>
It's just the way it is." <eob>
And I think this is how sexism <eol> continues on in 2016, right? <eob>
For the most part, it happens casually -- <eob> unconsciously, even. <eob>
It happens because people <eol> are just trying to get along <eob> within an existing system. <eob>
It happens, maybe, <eol> out of a genuine desire <eob> to teach a young woman <eol> the way that the world "just is." <eob> The problem is that unless we do <eol> something about it, <eob> that is the way the world <eol> will always be. <eob>
So why should you care about this? <eob> Right? <eob> I mean, we're facing some <eol> rather significant problems in the world <eob> just at present, <eob> what does it really matter <eol> if I can't get a job, <eob> or you're stuck watching <eol> "Transformer 17," right? <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Well, let me put it to you this way: <eob> the year "Jaws" came out, <eob> Americans suddenly started listing "sharks" <eol> among their top 10 major fears. <eob>
In 1995, BMW paid <eol> the James Bond franchise three million dollars <eob> to have James Bond switch <eol> from driving an Aston Martin <eob> to a BMW Z3. <eob>
That one move caused so many people <eol> to go out and buy that car, <eob> that BMW made 240 million dollars <eol> in pre-sales alone. <eob>
The year that "Brave" <eol> and "Hunger Games" came out, <eob> female participation in archery <eol> went up 105 percent. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In fact, studies show <eob> that the movies you watch <eol> don't just affect your hobbies, <eob> they affect your career choices, <eol> your emotions, your sense of identity, <eob> your relationships, your mental health -- <eol> even your marital status. <eob>
So now, consider this: <eob> if you have watched mostly American <eol> movies in your lifetime, <eob> 95 percent of all the films <eol> you have ever seen <eob> were directed by men. <eob>
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent <eol> of all of the leading characters <eob> that you have ever seen <eob> were men. <eob>
And even if we just talk <eol> about the last five years, <eob> 55 percent of the time <eol> that you have seen a woman in a movie, <eob> she was naked or scantily clad. <eob> That affects you. <eob> That affects all of us. <eob>
We actually can't even imagine <eol> how much it affects us, <eob> because this is all we've ever had. <eob>
Stories -- and movies <eol> are just modern stories -- <eob> are not frivolous. <eob>
They're actually the mechanism <eol> through which we process <eob> our experience of being alive. <eob>
They're the way <eol> that we understand the world <eob> and our place in it. <eob>
They're the way we develop empathy <eob> for people who have experiences <eol> different than our own. <eob>
And right now, all of that <eol> is being funneled at us <eob> through the prism of this one perspective. <eob>
It's not that it's a bad perspective, <eob> but don't we deserve to hear them all? <eob>
How would the world be different <eol> if all of the stories were told? <eob>
So what do we do about this? <eob>
This may be the first time a lot of you <eol> are hearing about this, <eob> but a lot of us within the film <eol> industry have spent years -- <eob> a lot of people, a lot longer than I have -- <eob> giving speeches and doing panels <eol> and writing articles <eob> and doing studies, <eob> and really just yelling at Hollywood <eol> to do a better job about this. <eob>
I mean, we have really yelled at them. <eob>
And yet, Paramount and Fox <eol> recently released their slates, <eob> and of the 47 films <eol> that they will release between now and 2018, <eob> not a single one will be <eol> directed by a woman. <eob>
So it is beginning to occur to me <eob> that waiting for Hollywood <eol> to grow a conscience <eob> may not actually be a winning strategy. <eob>
In fact, it seems to me <eob> that whenever there is a small, <eol> ruling class of people <eob> who have all of the money <eol> and power and resources, <eob> they're not actually that excited <eol> about giving it up. <eob>
And so you don't get change by asking them <eob> or even yelling at them. <eob>
You have to make that change happen <eob> through a revolution. <eob>
Now, please don't worry — I promise you, here, now, today, <eob> our body count will be very low. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So, now before I get to my four-point plan <eol> for the revolution — <eob> yes, I have a four-point plan — <eob> I have two pieces of very good <eol> and important news for you. <eob>
Good news number one: <eob> there are female filmmakers. <eob> (Cheers and applause) <eob>
Yes! I know! <eob> (Applause) <eob>
We exist! <eob> We actually graduate from film schools <eob> at the same rate that men do -- 50 percent. <eob>
So here we have our 50 women. <eob>
The problem is that as soon as you <eol> get to the micro-budget film, <eob> so even the very smallest films, <eob> we're already only directing 18 percent. <eob>
Then you get to slightly bigger films, <eob> indies in the $1-5 million budget range, <eob> and we go down to 12 percent. <eob>
So by the time you get <eol> to the studio system, <eob> we're only directing five percent of movies. <eob>
Now, I know some of you out <eol> there will look at this <eob> and secretly think to yourselves, <eob> "Well, maybe women just aren't as good <eol> at directing movies." <eob> And that's not a totally insane question. <eob>
I mean, we like to believe the film industry <eol> is a meritocracy, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Laughs) <eob>
But look at this trajectory. <eob>
Either you have to accept <eob> that women are actually five percent <eol> as talented as men, <eob> which I don't, <eob> or you have to accept <eol> that there are serious systemic issues <eob> preventing us from getting from here to there. <eob>
But the good news is, we exist, <eob> and there is a vast amount <eol> of untapped potential over here. <eob>
Good news number two, <eol> and this is really good news: <eob> films by and about women make more money. <eob> Yes! Yes! It's true! <eob> (Cheers and applause) <eob>
It's true. <eob> The Washington Post recently released a study <eob> showing that films that feature women <eol> make 23 cents more on every dollar <eob> than films that don't. <eob>
Furthermore, my colleagues and I commissioned a study <eob> comparing 1,700 films made <eol> over the last five years <eob> and, looking at the average <eol> returns on investment -- <eob> so, how much money <eol> does that movie make -- <eob> comparing if a man or a woman filled each of the following roles: <eob> director, producer, screenwriter <eol> and lead actor. <eob>
And in every single category, <eob> the return on investment <eol> is higher if it's a woman. <eob>
Fact: women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets. <eob>
Films by and about women make more money. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And of course, at least some portion <eol> of the male population <eob> does also like women -- <eob> so "women films" <eol> are not just for women. <eob>
And yet, Hollywood only targets <eol> 18 percent of all of their films <eob> as "women films." <eob> So what you're left <eol> with is a giant underserved audience <eob> and untapped profit potential. <eob>
So we exist, and we have stories to tell. <eob>
We have so many stories to tell. <eob>
And despite everything we've heard: <eol> you want to see them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> The problem is, we've got this thing -- <eol> let's call it "Hollywood" -- <eob> no, no, I'm just kidding; <eob> I've met some very nice <eol> people in Hollywood -- <eob> Hollywood, preventing us from getting to you. <eob>
So here is my four-point plan <eol> for the revolution, <eob> and everybody -- man or woman, <eol> in this room or anywhere in the world -- <eob> is going to get to help. <eob>
And this revolution is not just for women. <eob>
Anyone who has been disenfranchised, <eob> anyone whose story <eol> has not been told, <eob> the same principles apply, <eob> and I really hope we can do <eol> the revolution together. <eob>
My four-point plan. <eob> Number one: watch movies. <eob>
Isn't this a good revolution? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, first I want to talk <eol> to anyone who watches movies. <eob>
Who watches movies in here? <eob> Great! <eob> Will you pledge to watch one film <eol> by a female filmmaker per month? <eob>
That's it, just start there. <eob> Great! <eob> If you need help finding them, <eob> you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com <eob> It's an easily searchable database <eol> of films by women. <eob>
And as you start watching all movies, <eob> I just want you to pay attention <eol> to the female characters. <eob>
How many of them are there? <eob>
What are they wearing? <eob> Or not? <eob> Do they get to do cool things, <eob> or are they just there <eol> to emotionally support the men? <eob>
I'm telling you, once you see this, <eol> you're not going to be able to unsee it. <eob>
And as you start noticing this, <eol> it's going to shift your viewing habits. <eob>
And this already sizable market <eol> is going to continue to grow. <eob>
Step two: make movies. <eob>
So now I'm talking to all <eol> the female filmmakers out there: <eob> we need you to be very brave. <eob>
It will be harder for you to make movies. <eob>
In fact, there will be an entire industry <eol> constantly telling you <eob> that your stories don't matter. <eob>
And we need you to make them, anyway. <eob>
That 18 percent in the micro-budget range -- <eol> that is on us to fix. <eob>
Don't wait for permission. <eob>
Don't wait for somebody to pick you, <eob> because 95 percent says <eol> they are not going to. <eob> Crowd fund. <eob> Write letters to eccentric relatives. <eob>
I know how hard it is, <eob> but you have to make your movies -- <eol> now, today, features, not shorts. <eob>
There is an audience for them, <eol> and they want and need to see them. <eob>
Three: invest in each other. <eob>
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like we need <eol> to stop wasting so much energy <eob> on a system that does not want us. <eob>
We need to find our audience <eol> and invest in cultivating them. <eob>
If we can figure out how <eol> to make our movies <eob> and deliver them to the audiences <eol> that want them, <eob> that's it. <eob>
That's the whole game. <eob>
And whatever they're doing in the middle <eob> is going to cease <eol> to be quite so important. <eob>
Audiences, invest in us. <eob>
Help us make the movies <eol> that you want to see. <eob>
If you can give a female filmmaker <eol> 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign, <eob> great, do that. <eob>
If you can invest more seriously <eob> and help us over that critical <eol> million-dollar hurdle, <eob> do that. <eob>
But invest in seeing the other <eol> half of the story. <eob>
Four: disrupt through business. <eob>
So now I'm talking <eol> to all of the businesspeople <eob> and entrepreneurs. <eob>
This does not happen <eol> very often in the world, <eob> but right here we have <eol> a golden situation <eob> in which you can enact significant social change <eob> while also making money. <eob>
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption. <eob>
The old models of financing <eol> and distribution are crumbling -- <eob> please come in and disrupt it. <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob>
Right now, with some incredible women, <eob> I am launching the "The 51 Fund." <eob> It's a venture capital fund <eob> that will finance films written, <eol> directed and produced by women <eob> in that critical $1-5 million range. <eob>
We will give a significant number <eol> of female filmmakers <eob> the chance to make their movies <eob> and we will deliver them <eol> to the audiences who want them. <eob>
Good for equality, good for business. <eob>
But that's only one example, we need more. <eob>
There is room for so many more. <eob>
So I say to you: <eob> Hollywood is leaving money on the table. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Come pick it up. <eob> Now, all of this may seem like a lot, <eol> but it is actually so doable. <eob>
Entrenched systems don't change <eol> because you ask the people in charge, <eob> they change because all of the people <eol> who don't have what they want <eob> rise up and make that change happen. <eob>
And don't you want to? <eob>
I want to see what the other 51 percent <eol> of the population has to say. <eob>
I want to watch movies <eol> that teach me about people <eob> who are different than I am. <eob>
I want to see women's bodies on film <eol> that aren't perfect. <eob>
I want to give our little boys the chance <eob> to empathize with female characters <eob> so that they can become more whole men. <eob>
And I definitely want <eol> to give a little girl <eob> who may not have <eol> a real-life role model <eob> the chance to watch movies <eob> and see women doing <eol> everything she dreams of achieving. <eob>
This is not about making <eol> one industry better. <eob>
This is about making a better world. <eob> Will you help? <eob> The time for waiting is over. <eob>
(Cheers and applause) <eob> The time for the revolution is now. <eob>
Some months back, I was visiting <eol> this East African city, <eob> and we were stuck in traffic. <eob>
And this vendor suddenly approaches my window <eob> with a half-opened <eol> alphabet sheet. <eob>
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet, <eob> and I thought of my daughter, <eob> how it would be nice to spread it on the floor <eob> and just play all over it with her <eob> while getting her <eol> to learn the alphabet. <eob>
So the traffic moved a bit, <eol> and I quickly grabbed a copy, <eob> and we moved on. <eob>
When I had time to fully open <eol> the alphabet sheet <eob> and take a more detailed look at it, <eob> I knew I was not going to use <eol> that to teach my daughter. <eob>
I regretted my purchase. <eob> Why so? <eob> Looking at the alphabet <eol> sheet reminded me of the fact <eob> that not much has changed <eob> in the education curricula in Africa. <eob>
Some decades back, I was taught out <eol> of a similar alphabet sheet. <eob>
And because of that, <eol> I struggled for years. <eob>
I struggled to reconcile my reality <eol> with the formal education I received <eob> in school, in the schools I attended. <eob>
I had identity crises. <eob>
I looked down on my reality. <eob>
I looked at my ancestry, <eol> I looked at my lineage with disrespect. <eob>
I had very little patience for what my life <eol> had to offer around me. <eob>
Why? <eob> "A is for apple." <eob> "A is for apple." <eob> "A is for apple" is for that child <eol> in that part of the world <eob> where apples grow out; <eob> who has an apple in her lunch bag; <eob> who goes to the grocery store with her mom <eol> and sees red, <eob> green, yellow — apples of all shapes <eol> and colors and sizes. <eob>
And so, introducing education to this child <eob> with an alphabet sheet like this <eob> fulfills one of the major functions <eol> of education, <eob> which is to introduce the learner <eob> to an appreciation of the learner's environment <eob> and a curiosity to explore more in order to add value. <eob>
In my own case, <eob> when and where I grew up in Africa, <eob> apple was an exotic fruit. <eob>
Two or three times a year, <eob> I could get some yellowish apples <eol> with brown dots, you know, <eob> signifying thousands of miles traveled — <eol> warehouses storing — <eob> to get to me. <eob>
I grew up in the city <eob> to very financially comfortable parents, <eob> so it was my dignified reality, <eob> exactly the same way <eob> cassava fufu or ugali <eol> would not regularly feature <eob> in an American, Chinese <eol> or Indian diet, <eob> apples didn't count as part <eol> of my reality. <eob>
So what this did to me, <eob> introducing education to me with <eob> "A is for apple," <eob> made education an abstraction. <eob>
It made it something out of my reach -- <eob> a foreign concept, <eob> a phenomenon for which I would have <eol> to constantly and perpetually seek <eob> the validation <eol> of those it belonged to <eob> for me to make progress <eol> within it and with it. <eob>
That was tough for a child; <eol> it would be tough for anyone. <eob>
As I grew up and I advanced academically, <eob> my reality was further separated <eol> from my education. <eob>
In history, I was taught <eob> that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park <eol> discovered the Niger River. <eob>
And so it bothered me. <eob>
My great-great-grandparents grew up <eob> quite close to the edge <eol> of the Niger River. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it took someone to travel <eol> thousands of miles from Europe <eob> to discover a river right under their nose? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No! <eob>
What did they do with their time? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams, <eob> fighting tribal wars? <eob>
I mean, I just knew my education <eol> was preparing me to go somewhere else <eob> and practice and give to another environment <eol> that it belonged to. <eob>
It was not for my environment, <eol> where and when I grew up. <eob>
And this continued. <eob> This philosophy undergirded my studies <eob> all through the time I studied in Africa. <eob>
It took a lot of experiences <eol> and some studies <eob> for me to begin to have <eol> a change of mindset. <eob>
I will share a couple <eol> of the remarkable ones with us. <eob>
I was in the United States <eol> in Washington, DC <eob> studying towards my doctorate, <eob> and I got this consultancy position <eol> with the World Bank Africa Region. <eob>
And so I remember one day, <eob> my boss -- we were having <eol> a conversation on some project, <eob> and he mentioned a particular World Bank project, <eob> a large-scale irrigation <eol> project that cost millions of dollars <eob> in Niger Republic <eob> that was faltering sustainably. <eob>
He said this project wasn't so sustainable, <eob> and it bothered those <eol> that instituted the whole package. <eob>
But then he mentioned a particular project, <eob> a particular traditional irrigation <eol> method that was hugely successful <eob> in the same Niger Republic where the World Bank <eol> project was failing. <eob>
And that got me thinking. <eob>
So I did further research, <eob> and I found out about Tassa. <eob>
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method <eob> where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide <eol> and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes <eob> are dug across a field <eol> to be cultivated. <eob>
Then, a small dam <eol> is constructed around the field, <eob> and then crops are planted <eol> across the surface area. <eob>
What happens is that when rain falls, <eob> the holes are able to store the water <eob> and appropriate it to the extent <eol> that the plant needs the water. <eob>
The plant can only assimilate <eol> as much water as needed <eob> until harvest time. <eob>
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert, <eob> so this is something <eol> that is a life-or-death situation, <eob> and it has been used for centuries. <eob>
In an experiment <eol> that was conducted, <eob> two similar plots of land <eol> were used in the experiment, <eob> and one plot of land <eob> did not have the Tassa technique on it. <eob> Similar plots. <eob> The other one had Tassa technique <eol> constructed on it. <eob>
Then similar grains of millet <eol> also were planted on both plots. <eob>
During harvest time, <eob> the plot of land <eol> without Tassa technique <eob> yielded 11 kilograms <eol> of millet per hectare. <eob>
The plot of land with Tassa technique <eob> yielded 553 kilograms <eol> of millet per hectare. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I looked at the research, <eol> and I looked at myself. <eob>
I said, "I studied agriculture for 12 years, <eob> from primary to Senior Six, <eol> as we say in East Africa, <eob> SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade. <eob>
No one ever taught me <eob> of any form of traditional <eol> African knowledge of cultivation -- <eob> of harvesting, of anything -- <eob> that will work in modern times <eol> and actually succeed, <eob> where something imported from the West <eol> would struggle to succeed. <eob> That was when I knew the challenge, <eob> the challenge of Africa's curricula, <eob> And I thus began my quest <eol> to dedicate my life, concern my life work, <eob> to studying, conducting research <eol> on Africa's own knowledge system <eob> and being able to advocate <eol> for its mainstreaming <eob> in education, in research, policy <eob> across sectors and industries. <eob>
Another conversation and experience <eol> I had at the bank <eob> I guess made me take that final decision <eol> of where I was going to go, <eob> even though it wasn't the most lucrative <eol> research to go into, <eob> but it was just about <eol> what I believed in. <eob>
And so one day, my boss said <eol> that he likes to go to Africa <eob> to negotiate World Bank loans <eol> and to work on World Bank projects. <eob> And I was intrigued. <eol> I asked him why. <eob>
He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa, <eob> it's so easy. <eob>
I just write up my loan documents <eol> and my project proposal in Washington, DC, <eob> I go to Africa, and they all just get signed. <eob>
I get the best deal, and I'm back to base. <eob>
My bosses are happy with me." <eob>
But then he said, <eol> "I hate going to Asia or ..." <eob> and he mentioned a particular country, <eol> Asia and some of these countries. <eob> "They keep me for this, <eol> trying to get the best deal for their countries. <eob>
They get the best deal. <eob>
They tell me, 'Oh, that clause <eol> will not work for us <eob> in our environment. <eob>
It's not our reality. <eob>
It's just so Western. <eob> 'And they tell me,' Oh, we have enough experts <eob> to take care of this. <eob>
You don't have enough experts. <eob>
We know our aim.' <eob> And they just keep going <eol> through all these things. <eob>
By the time they finish, yes, <eol> they get the best deal, <eob> but I'm so exhausted and I don't get <eol> the best deal for the bank, <eob> and we're in business." <eob> "Really?" I thought <eol> in my head, "OK." <eob>
I was privileged to sit in <eol> on a loan negotiating session <eob> in an African country. <eob>
So I would do these consultancy <eol> positions during summer, <eob> you know, since I was a doctoral student. <eob>
And then I traveled with the team, <eol> with the World Bank team, <eob> as more like someone to help <eol> out with organizational matters. <eob>
But I sat in during the negotiating session. <eob>
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know, <eol> with me from Washington, DC. <eob>
And I looked across the table <eol> at my African brothers and sisters. <eob>
I could see intimidation on their faces. <eob>
"A is for apple." <eob> They didn't believe they had anything <eol> to offer <eob> the great-great-grandchildren <eol> of Mungo Park -- <eob> the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple." <eob> They just sat and watched: "Oh, just give us, let us sign. <eob>
You know it all. Just, where do we sign? <eob>
Show us, let us sign. "They had no voice. <eob>
They didn't believe in themselves. <eob>
Excuse me. <eob>
And so, <eob> I have been doing this for a decade. <eob>
I have been conducting research <eol> on Africa's knowledge system, <eob> original, authentic, traditional knowledge. <eob>
In the few cases where this <eol> has been implemented in Africa, <eob> there has been remarkable successes recorded. <eob>
I think of Gacaca. <eob> Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional judicial system <eob> that was used after the genocide. <eob>
In 1994, when the genocide ended, <eob> Rwanda's national court system <eol> was in shambles: <eob> no judges, no lawyers to try <eol> hundreds of thousands of genocide cases. <eob>
So the government of Rwanda came up with this idea <eob> to resuscitate a traditional judicial system <eol> known as Gacaca. <eob>
Gacaca is a community-based judicial system, <eob> where community members come together <eob> to elect men and women <eol> of proven integrity <eob> to try cases of crimes <eol> committed within these communities. <eob>
So by the time Gacaca concluded <eol> its trial of genocide cases in 2012, <eob> 12,000 community-based courts had tried approximately <eol> 1.2 million cases. <eob>
That's a record. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized Rwanda's traditional philosophy <eob> of reconciliation and reintegration, <eob> as against the whole punitive and banishment idea <eob> that undergirds present-day Western style. <eob>
And not to compare, but just to say <eol> that it really emphasized <eob> Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy. <eob>
And so <eob> it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, <eob> former president of Tanzania — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
who said that you cannot develop people. <eob>
People will have to develop themselves. <eob>
I agree with Mwalimu. <eob>
I am convinced <eob> that Africa's further transformation, <eol> Africa's advancement, <eob> rests simply in the acknowledgment, <eol> validation and mainstreaming <eob> of Africa's own traditional, <eol> authentic, original, indigenous knowledge <eob> in education, in research, in policy <eol> making and across sectors. <eob>
This is not going to be easy for Africa. <eob>
It is not going to be easy for a people <eol> used to being told how to think, <eob> what to do, how to go about it, <eob> a people long subjected <eol> to the intellectual guidance <eob> and direction of others, <eob> be they the colonial masters, <eob> aid industry or international <eol> news media. <eob>
But it is a task that we have to do <eol> to make progress. <eob>
I am strengthened by the words <eol> of Joseph Shabalala, <eob> founder of the South African choral group Ladysmith <eol> Black Mambazo. <eob>
He said that the task ahead of us <eol> can never, ever be greater <eob> than the power within us. <eob>
We can do it. <eob>
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves. <eob>
We can learn to place value <eol> on our reality and our knowledge. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
"Robam kbach boran," <eob> or the art of Khmer classical dance, <eob> is more than 1,000 years old. <eob>
It was developed as a prayer in movement <eob> for rain and fertility, <eob> and a prosperity that this meant <eol> for an agricultural society. <eob>
Dancers who were both men and women <eob> were offered to temples <eob> where they served as living bridges <eol> between heaven and earth. <eob>
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers <eol> of the people up to the gods, <eob> and the will of the deities <eol> was delivered back through them <eob> to the people and the land. <eob>
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance. <eob>
Our backs are arched, <eob> our knees are bent, <eob> our toes are curled, <eob> our elbows are hyperflexed <eob> and our fingers are curved backwards. <eob>
All of these curves create a serpentine impression, <eob> and this is important because before <eol> the introduction of major religions, <eob> Khmers, and people all over <eol> the world practiced animism. <eob>
Serpents were especially <eol> important in this belief system <eob> because in their fluid, curvilinear movement, <eob> they mimicked the flow of water. <eob>
So to invoke the serpent <eol> in your dancing body then <eob> was to conjure the image <eol> of rivers cutting across the earth: <eob> inspire the flow of life-giving waters. <eob>
As you can see then, <eob> Khmer classical dance <eol> is a transformation of nature, <eob> of both the physical world <eol> around us and of our own internal universe. <eob>
We have four primary <eol> hand gestures that we use. <eob>
Can we do them together? <eob> Yeah? OK. <eob>
This is a tree. <eob> That tree will grow, <eob> and then it will have leaves. <eob>
After it has leaves, <eob> it'll have flowers, <eob> and after it has flowers, <eob> it'll have fruit. <eob>
That fruit will drop <eob> and a new tree will grow. <eob>
And in those four gestures <eob> is the cycle of life. <eob>
These four gestures are then used <eob> to create a whole entire language <eol> with which dancers express themselves. <eob>
So for example, <eob> I can say, <eob> "I." <eob> "I." <eob> In dance that would be... <eob> "I." <eob> Or I can say... <eob> "Hey you, come here, come here." <eob> In dance... <eob> "Come here," <eob> or, "Go, go." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Go." <eob> And everything from... love... <eob> to sadness, <eob> to — <eob>
(Stomping) <eob>
anger <eob> can be expressed <eol> through the dance as well. <eob>
There's a certain magic <eob> in the way that things are filtered, <eol> transformed and put together <eob> to create limitless possibilities in art. <eob>
The Khmer word for art, <eob> silapak, <eob> in fact, at its root, means "magic." <eob> The artist -- <eob> the silapakar, <eob> or the silapakarani, then, <eob> is nothing short of a magician. <eob>
I am very proud to say <eob> that I belong <eol> to a long line of magicians, <eob> from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, <eob> to her teachers who were <eol> stars in the royal palace, <eob> to the ancient dancers of Angkor <eob> and to the primal villagers <eob> from which the art form originally took life. <eob>
That said, <eob> our cherished heritage <eol> was once almost completely destroyed. <eob>
If you are wearing glasses, <eob> please stand up. <eob>
please stand up. <eob> If you speak more than one language, <eob>
please stand up. <eob> If you have light skin, <eob>
Your glasses meant <eol> that you could afford health care. <eob>
That second or third language <eol> you spoke indicated your elite education. <eob>
Your light skin meant <eol> you didn't have to work beneath the sun. <eob>
Under the Khmer Rouge, <eob> who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, <eob> we would all be dead now, <eob> targeted because of our assumed privilege. <eob>
You see, <eob> the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia, <eob> and they saw centuries <eol> of rigid inequality. <eob>
The king and the few elites around him <eob> had all the pleasures <eol> and comforts of the world <eob> while the mass majority suffered <eol> from backbreaking labor <eob> and harsh poverty. <eob>
You don't need a history book <eol> to see that this is true. <eob>
The Khmer word for "I," <eob> for "me," <eob> is khnhom. <eob>
This very same word can also mean "slave" <eob> and dancers were in fact known as knhom preah robam, <eob> or "slaves of the sacred dance." <eob> The Khmer Rouge sought <eol> to end slavery in Cambodia, <eob> yet somehow they turned everyone <eol> into slaves to do it. <eob>
They became the oppression <eol> that they sought to end. <eob>
They evacuated the capital <eob> and forced people into labor camps. <eob>
They tore families apart <eob> and brainwashed children <eol> against their own parents. <eob>
Everywhere, people were dying <eol> and being killed, <eob> losing their lives from disease, <eob> overwork, <eob> execution and starvation. <eob>
The result of this is that an entire <eol> third of Cambodia's population was lost <eob> in less than four years, <eob> and in that number were 90 percent <eol> of Khmer dance artists. <eob>
In other words, <eob> nine out of 10 visions <eol> for the tradition and future were lost. <eob>
Thankfully, however, <eob> it was my teacher's teachers, <eob> Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon, <eob> who would lead the revival of the art form <eob> from the ashes of war and genocide: <eob> one student, <eob> one gesture, <eob> one dance at a time. <eob>
They wrote the love, <eob> magic, <eob> beauty, <eob> history and philosophy of our lineage <eob> into the bodies of the next generation. <eob>
Nearly 40 years later, <eob> Khmer classical dance <eol> has been revived to new heights. <eob>
Yet somehow it still exists <eol> in a vulnerable environment. <eob>
The disastrous effects of war <eol> still haunt Khmer people today. <eob>
It is written in our bodies, <eob> manifested in a genetic passage <eol> of PTSD <eob> and in families facing cyclical poverty <eob> and immense cultural rifts and language barriers. <eob>
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing. <eob>
Beauty has this ability to grow <eol> anywhere and everywhere <eob> at any time. <eob>
Beauty is what connects people <eol> through time and place. <eob>
Beauty is a liberation from suffering. <eob>
As Khmer artists work <eol> to revive our culture and country, <eob> we find that there are many paths <eol> in which to move forward into the future. <eob>
And in a tradition where we often <eol> don't know the dancer's names, <eob> who they were, <eob> what their lives were like, <eob> what they felt, <eob> let me propose that we move <eol> forward honestly and openly from "khnhom." <eob> Khnhom not as in slave, <eob> but as in conscious service. <eob>
Khnhom: <eob> "I," <eob> "me," <eob> "flowering." <eob>
My name is Prumsodun Ok. <eob>
I am Khmer, <eob> and I am American. <eob>
I am the child of refugees, <eob> a creator, a healer, <eob> and a builder of bridges. <eob>
I am my teacher's first male student <eob> in a tradition understood by many as female, <eob> and I founded Cambodia's <eol> first gay dance company. <eob>
I am the incarnation of the <eob> beauty, <eob> dreams and power <eob> of those who came before me. <eob>
The convergence of past, <eol> present and future, <eob> and of individual and collective. <eob>
Let me then play <eol> that ancient and ageless role <eob> of the artist as messenger, <eob> by sharing the words <eol> of Chheng Phon <eob> "A garden with only one <eol> type of flower, <eob> or flowers of only one color, <eob> is no good." <eob> This is a reminder that our strength, <eob> growth, <eob> survival <eob> and very existence, <eob> lies in diversity. <eob>
It is, however, <eob> a message of courage as well. <eob>
For a flower does not ask <eol> for anyone's permission to bloom. <eob>
It was born to offer itself to the world. <eob>
Fearless love is its nature. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want us to start by thinking <eol> about this device, <eob> the phone that's very likely in <eol> your pockets right now. <eob>
Over 40 percent of Americans <eol> check their phones <eob> within five minutes <eol> of waking up every morning. <eob>
And then they look at it <eol> another 50 times during the day. <eob>
Grownups consider <eol> this device to be a necessity. <eob>
But now I want you to imagine it <eol> in the hands of a three-year-old, <eob> and as a society, we get anxious. <eob>
Parents are very worried <eob> that this device is going to stunt <eol> their children's social growth; <eob> that it's going to keep them <eol> from getting up and moving; <eob> that somehow, <eob> this is going to disrupt childhood. <eob>
So, I want to challenge this attitude. <eob>
I can envision a future <eob> where we would be excited <eol> to see a preschooler interacting with a screen. <eob>
These screens can get kids <eol> up and moving even more. <eob>
They have the power to tell us more <eol> about what a child is learning <eob> than a standardized test can. <eob>
And here's the really crazy thought: <eob> I believe that these screens <eol> have the power <eob> to prompt more real-life conversations <eob> between kids and their parents. <eob>
Now, I was perhaps <eol> an unlikely champion for this cause. <eob>
I studied children's literature <eob> because I was going to work <eol> with kids and books. <eob>
But about 20 years ago, <eob> I had an experience <eol> that shifted my focus. <eob> I was helping lead a research study <eol> about preschoolers and websites. <eob>
And I walked in and was assigned <eol> a three-year-old named Maria. <eob>
Maria had actually <eol> never seen a computer before. <eob>
So the first thing I had to do <eol> was teach her how to use the mouse, <eob> and when I opened up the screen, <eol> she moved it across the screen, <eob> and she stopped on a character named X the Owl. <eob>
And when she did that, <eob> the owl lifted his wing and waved at her. <eob>
Maria dropped the mouse, pushed <eol> back from the table, leaped up <eob> and started waving frantically back at him. <eob>
Her connection to that character <eob> was visceral. <eob>
This wasn't a passive screen experience. <eob>
This was a human experience. <eob>
And it was exactly appropriate <eol> for a three-year-old. <eob>
I've now worked at PBS Kids <eol> for more than 15 years, <eob> and my work there is focused on harnessing <eol> the power of technology <eob> as a positive in children's lives. <eob>
I believe that as a society, <eol> we're missing a big opportunity. <eob>
We're letting our fear <eol> and our skepticism <eob> about these devices <eob> hold us back from realizing <eol> their potential <eob> in our children's lives. <eob>
Fear about kids and technology <eol> is nothing new; <eob> we've been here before. <eob>
Over 50 years ago, the debate <eol> was raging about the newly dominant media: <eob> the television. <eob>
That box in the living room? <eob>
It might be separating kids <eol> from one another. <eob>
It might keep them away <eol> from the outside world. <eob>
But this is the moment <eol> when Fred Rogers, <eob> the long-running host <eol> of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," <eob> challenged society to look <eol> at television as a tool, <eob> a tool that could promote emotional growth. <eob>
Here's what he did: <eob> he looked out from the screen, <eol> and he held a conversation, <eob> as if he were speaking to each child individually <eob> about feelings. <eob>
And then he would pause <eob> and let them think about them. <eob>
You can see his influence <eol> across the media landscape today, <eob> but at the time, this was revolutionary. <eob>
He shifted the way we looked <eol> at television in the lives of children. <eob>
Today it's not just one box. <eob>
Kids are surrounded by devices. <eob>
And I'm also a parent -- <eol> I understand this feeling of anxiety. <eob>
But I want us to look <eol> at three common fears <eob> that parents have, <eob> and see if we can shift our focus <eob> to the opportunity that's in each of them. <eob>
So. <eob> Fear number one: <eob> "Screens are passive. <eob>
This is going to keep our kids <eol> from getting up and moving." <eob> Chris Kratt and Martin <eol> Kratt are zoologist brothers <eob> who host a show about animals <eol> called "Wild Kratts." <eob> And they approached the PBS team to say, <eob> "Can we do something <eol> with those cameras <eob> that are built into every device now? <eob>
Could those cameras capture <eol> a very natural kid play pattern -- <eob> pretending to be animals?" <eob>
So we started with bats. <eob>
And when kids came <eol> in to play this game, <eob> they loved seeing themselves <eol> on-screen with wings. <eob>
But my favorite part of this, <eob> when the game was over <eol> and we turned off the screens? <eob>
The kids kept being bats. <eob>
They kept flying around the room, <eob> they kept veering left <eol> and right to catch mosquitoes. <eob>
And they remembered things. <eob>
They remembered that bats fly at night. <eob> And they remembered that when bats sleep, <eob> they hang upside down and fold <eol> their wings in. <eob>
This game definitely got kids up <eol> and moving. <eob>
But also, now when kids go outside, <eob> do they look at a bird and think, <eob> "How does a bird fly differently <eol> than I flew <eob> when I was a bat?" <eob> The digital technology prompted <eol> embodied learning <eob> that kids can now take out into the world. <eob>
Fear number two: <eob> "Playing games on these screens <eol> is just a waste of time. <eob>
It's going to distract children <eol> from their education." <eob> Game developers know <eob> that you can learn a lot about a player's skill <eob> by looking at the back-end data: <eob> Where did a player pause? <eob>
Where did they make a few mistakes <eol> before they found the right answer? <eob>
My team wanted to take that tool <eol> set and apply it to academic learning. <eob>
Our producer in Boston, WGBH, <eob> created a series of Curious George games <eob> focused on math. <eob>
And researchers came in and had 80 preschoolers <eol> play these games. <eob>
They then gave all 80 <eol> of those preschoolers <eob> a standardized math test. <eob>
We could see early on <eob> that these games were actually <eol> helping kids <eob> understand some key skills. <eob>
But our partners at UCLA <eol> wanted us to dig deeper. <eob>
They focus on data analysis <eol> and student assessment. <eob>
And they wanted to take <eol> that back-end game-play data <eob> and see if they could use it to predict <eol> a child's math scores. <eob>
So they made a neural net -- <eol> they essentially trained the computer <eob> to use this data, <eob> and here are the results. <eob>
This is a subset of the children's standardized <eol> math scores. <eob>
And this <eob> is the computer's prediction <eol> of each child's score, <eob> based on playing some Curious <eol> George games. <eob>
The prediction is astonishingly accurate, <eob> especially considering the fact <eol> that these games weren't built <eob> for assessment. <eob>
than a standardized test can. <eob> The team that did this study <eol> believes that games like these <eob> can teach us more about a child's cognitive learning <eob>
What if games could reduce <eol> testing time in the classroom? <eob>
What if they could reduce testing anxiety? <eob>
How could they give teachers <eol> snapshots of insight <eob> to help them better focus <eol> their individualized learning? <eob>
So the third fear I want to address <eob> is the one that I think <eol> is often the biggest. <eob>
And that's this: <eob> "These screens are isolating me <eol> from my child." <eob> Let's play out a scenario. <eob>
Let's say that you are a parent, <eob> and you need 25 minutes <eol> of uninterrupted time <eob> to get dinner ready. <eob>
And in order to do that, you hand a tablet <eol> to your three-year-old. <eob>
Now, this is a moment <eol> where you probably feel very guilty <eob> about what you just did. <eob>
But now imagine this: <eob> Twenty minutes later, <eol> you receive a text message. <eob> on that cell phone <eol> that's always within arm's reach. <eob>
And it says: "Alex <eol> just matched five rhyming words. <eob>
Ask him to play this game with you. <eob>
Can you think of a word <eol> that rhymes with 'cat'? <eob>
Or how about 'ball'?" <eob> In our studies, when parents <eol> receive simple tips like these, <eob> they felt empowered. <eob>
They were so excited <eob> to play these games at the dinner <eol> table with their kids. <eob>
And the kids loved it, too. <eob>
Not only did it feel like magic <eol> that their parents knew <eob> what they had been playing, <eob> kids love to play games <eol> with their parents. <eob>
Just the act of talking <eol> to kids about their media <eob> can be incredibly powerful. <eob>
Last summer, Texas <eol> Tech University published a study <eob> that the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote <eob> the development of empathy among children. <eob>
But there was a really important <eol> catch to this study: <eob> the greatest benefit was only <eol> when parents talked to kids <eob> about what they watched. <eob>
Neither just watching <eob> nor just talking about it was enough; <eob> it was the combination that was key. <eob>
So when I read this study, <eob> I started thinking about <eob> how rarely parents of preschoolers <eol> actually talk to kids about the content <eob> of what they're playing <eol> and what they're watching. <eob>
And so I decided to try it <eol> with my four-year-old. <eob>
I said, <eob> "Were you playing a car game earlier today?" <eob> And Benjamin perked up and said, <eob> "Yes! <eob>
And did you see that I made <eol> my car out of a pickle? <eob>
It was really hard to open the trunk." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This hilarious conversation <eol> about what was fun in the game <eob> and what could have been better <eob> continued all the way <eol> to school that morning. <eob>
I'm not here to suggest to you <eol> that all digital media is great for kids. <eob>
There are legitimate reasons <eol> for us to be concerned <eob> about the current state <eol> of children's content <eob> on these screens. <eob>
And it's right for us <eol> to be thinking about balance: <eob> Where do screens fit against all the other things <eob> that a child needs to do <eol> to learn and to grow? <eob>
But when we fixate <eol> on our fears about it, <eob> we forget a really major point, <eob> and that is, that kids are living <eol> in the same world that we live in, <eob> the world where the grownups <eol> check their phones <eob> more than 50 times a day. <eob>
Screens are a part of children's lives. <eob>
And if we pretend <eol> that they aren't, <eob> or if we get overwhelmed by our fear, <eob> kids are never going to learn <eol> how and why to use them. <eob>
What if we start raising our expectations <eob> for this media? <eob>
What if we start talking to kids regularly <eob> about the content <eob> on these screens? <eob>
What if we start looking <eol> for the positive impacts <eob> that this technology can have <eob> in our children's lives? <eob>
That's when the potential of these tools <eol> can become a reality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So there's a lot of valid concern <eol> these days <eob> that our technology is getting so smart <eob> that we've put ourselves on the path <eol> to a jobless future. <eob>
And I think the example <eol> of a self-driving car <eob> is actually the easiest one to see. <eob>
So these are going to be fantastic <eol> for all kinds of different reasons. <eob>
But did you know that "driver" <eol> is actually the most common job <eob> in 29 of the 50 US states? <eob>
What's going to happen to these jobs <eol> when we're no longer driving our cars <eob> or cooking our food <eob> or even diagnosing our own diseases? <eob>
Well, a recent study from Forrester Research <eob> goes so far to predict <eol> that 25 million jobs <eob> might disappear over the next 10 years. <eob>
To put that in perspective, <eob> that's three times as many jobs lost <eol> in the aftermath of the financial crisis. <eob>
And it's not just blue-collar <eol> jobs that are at risk. <eob>
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley, we are seeing tremendous gains <eob> in the quality of analysis <eol> and decision-making <eob> because of machine learning. <eob>
So even the smartest, highest-paid <eol> people will be affected by this change. <eob>
What's clear is that no matter <eol> what your job is, <eob> at least some, if not all of your work, <eob> is going to be done by a robot <eol> or software in the next few years. <eob>
And that's exactly why people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates <eob> are talking about the need for government-funded minimum income levels. <eob>
But if our politicians can't agree <eol> on things like health care <eob> or even school lunches, <eob> I just don't see a path <eol> where they'll find consensus <eob> on something as big and as expensive <eol> as universal basic life income. <eob>
Instead, I think the response <eol> needs to be led by us in industry. <eob>
We have to recognize the change <eol> that's ahead of us <eob> and start to design <eol> the new kinds of jobs <eob> that will still be relevant <eol> in the age of robotics. <eob>
The good news is that we have faced <eol> down and recovered <eob> two mass extinctions <eol> of jobs before. <eob>
From 1870 to 1970, <eob> the percent of American workers <eol> based on farms fell by 90 percent, <eob> and then again from 1950 to 2010, <eob> the percent of Americans <eol> working in factories <eob> fell by 75 percent. <eob>
The challenge we face this time, <eol> however, is one of time. <eob>
We had a hundred years <eol> to move from farms to factories, <eob> and then 60 years <eol> to fully build out a service economy. <eob>
The rate of change today <eob> suggests that we may only have 10 <eol> or 15 years to adjust, <eob> and if we don't react fast enough, <eob> that means by the time today's elementary-school students <eob> are college-aged, <eob> we could be living in a world <eol> that's robotic, <eob> largely unemployed and stuck in kind <eol> of un-great depression. <eob>
But I don't think it has to be this way. <eob>
You see, I work in innovation, <eob> and part of my job is to shape <eol> how large companies apply new technologies. <eob>
Certainly some of these technologies <eob> are even specifically designed <eol> to replace human workers. <eob>
But I believe that if we start <eol> taking steps right now <eob> to change the nature of work, <eob> we can not only create environments <eol> where people love coming to work <eob> but also generate the innovation <eol> that we need <eob> to replace the millions of jobs <eol> that will be lost to technology. <eob>
I believe that the key <eol> to preventing our jobless future <eob> is to rediscover <eol> what makes us human, <eob> and to create a new generation <eol> of human-centered jobs <eob> that allow us to unlock <eol> the hidden talents and passions <eob> that we carry with us every day. <eob>
But first, I think <eol> it's important to recognize <eob> that we brought this problem on ourselves. <eob>
And it's not just because, you know, <eol> we are the one building the robots. <eob>
But even though most jobs <eol> left the factory decades ago, <eob> we still hold on to this factory mindset <eob> of standardization and de-skilling. <eob>
We still define jobs around procedural tasks <eob> and then pay people for the number of hours <eol> that they perform these tasks. <eob>
We've created narrow job definitions <eob> like cashier, loan processor <eol> or taxi driver <eob> and then asked people to form entire careers <eob> around these singular tasks. <eob>
These choices have left us <eol> with actually two dangerous side effects. <eob>
The first is that these narrowly defined jobs <eob> will be the first to be displaced by robots, <eob> because single-task robots <eol> are just the easiest kinds to build. <eob>
But second, we have accidentally made it <eob> so that millions of workers <eol> around the world <eob> have unbelievably boring working lives. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's take the example <eol> of a call center agent. <eob>
Over the last few decades, we brag <eol> about lower operating costs <eob> because we've taken most of the need <eol> for brainpower <eob> out of the person <eol> and put it into the system. <eob>
For most of their day, <eol> they click on screens, <eob> they read scripts. <eob>
They act more like machines than humans. <eob>
And unfortunately, over the next few years, <eob> as our technology gets more advanced, <eob> they, along with people like clerks and bookkeepers, <eob> will see the vast majority of their work disappear. <eob>
To counteract this, we have <eol> to start creating new jobs <eob> that are less centered <eol> on the tasks that a person does <eob> and more focused on the skills <eol> that a person brings to work. <eob>
For example, robots are great <eol> at repetitive and constrained work, <eob> but human beings have an amazing ability <eob> to bring together capability with creativity <eob> when faced with problems <eol> that we've never seen before. <eob>
It's when every day brings <eol> a little bit of a surprise <eob> that we have designed work for humans <eob> and not for robots. <eob>
Our entrepreneurs and engineers <eol> already live in this world, <eob> but so do our nurses and our plumbers <eob> and our therapists. <eob>
You know, it's the nature <eol> of too many companies and organizations <eob> to just ask people to come to work <eol> and do your job. <eob>
But if you work is better done by a robot, <eob> or your decisions better made by an AI, <eob> what are you supposed to be doing? <eob>
Well, I think for the manager, <eob> we need to realistically <eol> think about the tasks that will be disappearing <eob> over the next few years <eob> and start planning for more meaningful, <eol> more valuable work that should replace it. <eob>
We need to create environments <eob> where both human beings and robots thrive. <eob>
I say, let's give more work <eol> to the robots, <eob> and let's start with the work <eol> that we absolutely hate doing. <eob>
Here, robot, <eob> process this painfully idiotic report. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And move this box. Thank you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And for the human beings, <eob> we should follow the advice <eol> from Harry Davis at the University of Chicago. <eob>
He says we have to make it so that <eol> people don't leave too much of themselves <eob> in the trunk of their car. <eob>
I mean, human beings <eol> are amazing on weekends. <eob>
Think about the people that you know <eol> and what they do on Saturdays. <eob>
They're artists, carpenters, <eol> chefs and athletes. <eob>
But on Monday, they're back <eol> to being Junior HR Specialist <eob> and Systems Analyst 3. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, these narrow job titles <eol> not only sound boring, <eob> but they're actually a subtle encouragement <eob> for people to make narrow <eol> and boring job contributions. <eob>
But I've seen firsthand that when <eol> you invite people to be more, <eob> they can amaze us <eol> with how much more they can be. <eob>
A few years ago, I was working <eol> at a large bank <eob> that was trying to bring more innovation <eol> into its company culture. <eob>
So my team and I designed <eol> a prototyping contest <eob> that invited anyone to build anything <eol> that they wanted. <eob>
We were actually trying to figure out <eob> whether or not the primary <eol> limiter to innovation <eob> was a lack of ideas <eol> or a lack of talent, <eob> and it turns out it was neither one. <eob>
It was an empowerment problem. <eob>
And the results of the program <eol> were amazing. <eob>
We started by inviting people <eol> to reenvision <eob> what it is they could bring to a team. <eob>
This contest was not only a chance <eol> to build anything that you wanted <eob> but also be anything that you wanted. <eob>
And when people were no longer limited <eol> by their day-to-day job titles, <eob> they felt free to bring <eol> all kinds of different skills and talents <eob> to the problems that they were trying to solve. <eob>
We saw technology people <eol> being designers, marketing people being architects, <eob> and even finance people showing off their ability <eol> to write jokes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We ran this program twice, <eob> and each time more than 400 people <eol> brought their unexpected talents to work <eob> and solved problems that they had been <eol> wanting to solve for years. <eob>
Collectively, they created <eol> millions of dollars of value, <eob> building things like a better touch-tone <eol> system for call centers, <eob> easier desktop tools for branches <eob> and even a thank you card system <eob> that has become a cornerstone <eol> of the employee working experience. <eob>
Over the course of the eight weeks, <eob> people flexed muscles <eol> that they never dreamed of using at work. <eob>
People learned new skills, <eob> they met new people, <eob> and at the end, somebody <eol> pulled me aside and said, <eob> "I have to tell you, <eob> the last few weeks has been <eol> one of the most intense, <eob> hardest working experiences <eol> of my entire life, <eob> but not one second of it felt like work." <eob>
And that's the key. <eob>
For those few weeks, people <eol> got to be creators and innovators. <eob>
They had been dreaming of solutions <eob> to problems that had been bugging them for years, <eob> and this was a chance to turn <eol> those dreams into a reality. <eob>
And that dreaming is an important part <eol> of what separates us from machines. <eob>
For now, our machines do not get frustrated, <eob> they do not get annoyed, <eob> and they certainly don't imagine. <eob>
But we, as human beings -- <eob> we feel pain, <eob> we get frustrated. <eob>
And it's when we're most annoyed <eol> and most curious <eob> that we're motivated <eol> to dig into a problem and create change. <eob>
Our imaginations are the birthplace <eol> of new products, new services, <eob> and even new industries. <eob>
I believe that the jobs of the future <eob> will come from the minds of people <eob> who today we call analysts and specialists, <eob> but only if we give them the freedom <eol> and protection that they need to grow <eob> into becoming explorers and inventors. <eob>
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs, <eob> we, as leaders, <eol> need to get out of the mindset <eob> of telling people what to do <eob> and instead start asking them what problems <eol> they're inspired to solve <eob> and what talents they want <eol> to bring to work. <eob>
Because when you can bring <eol> your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays, <eob> you'll look forward to Mondays more, <eob> and those feelings that we have <eol> about Mondays <eob> are part of what makes us human. <eob>
And as we redesign work <eol> for an era of intelligent machines, <eob> I invite you all to work alongside me <eob> to bring more humanity <eol> to our working lives. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I recently read about what the young <eol> generation of workers want <eob> in Harvard Business Review. <eob>
One thing that stuck out to me was: <eol> don't just talk about impact, <eob> but make an impact. <eob>
I'm a little bit older than you, <eob> maybe much older than you, <eob> but this is exactly the same goal <eol> that I had when I was in college. <eob>
I wanted to make my own impact <eol> for those who live under injustice; <eob> it's the reason <eol> that I became a documentary journalist, <eob> the reason I became <eob> a prisoner in North Korea <eol> for 140 days. <eob>
It was March 17, 2009. <eob>
It is St. Patrick's Day <eol> for all of you, <eob> but it was the day <eol> that turned my life upside down. <eob>
My team and I were making <eol> a documentary about North Korean refugees <eob> living below human life in China. <eob>
We were at the border. <eob>
It was our last day of filming. <eob>
There was no wire fence <eob> or bars <eob> or sign to show that it is the border, <eob> but this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use <eob> as an escape route. <eob>
It was still winter, <eob> and the river was frozen. <eob>
When we were in the middle <eol> of the frozen river, <eob> we were filming about the condition <eol> of the cold weather <eob> and the environment <eob> that North Koreans had to deal with <eob> when they seek their freedom. <eob>
And suddenly, one of my team members shouted, <eob> "Soldiers!" <eob> So I looked back, <eob> and there were two small soldiers <eol> in green uniforms with rifles, <eob> chasing after us. <eob>
We all ran as fast as we could. <eob>
I prayed that, please <eol> don't let them shoot my head. <eob>
And I was thinking that, <eob> if my feet are on Chinese soil, <eob> I'll be safe. <eob>
And I made it to Chinese soil. <eob>
Then I saw my colleague Laura <eol> Ling fall on her knees. <eob>
I didn't know what to do <eol> at that short moment, <eob> but I knew that I could not <eol> leave her alone there <eob> when she said, "Euna, <eol> I can't feel my legs." <eob>
In a flash, we were surrounded <eol> by these two Korean soldiers. <eob>
They were not much bigger than us, <eob> but they were determined to take us <eol> to their army base. <eob>
I begged and yelled <eol> for any kind of help, <eob> hoping that someone <eol> would show up from China. <eob>
Here I was, being stubborn <eob> towards a trained soldier with a gun. <eob>
I looked at his eyes. <eob>
He was just a boy. <eob>
At that moment, he raised <eol> his rifle to hit me, <eob> but I saw that he was hesitating. <eob>
His eyes were shaking, <eob> and his rifle was still up in the air. <eob>
So I shouted at him, <eob> "OK, OK, I'll walk with you." <eob> And I got up. <eob>
When we arrived at their army base, <eob> my head was spinning <eol> with these worst-case scenarios, <eob> and my colleague's statement <eol> wasn't helping. <eob>
She said, "We are the enemy." <eob> She was right: we were the enemy. <eob>
And I was supposed to be frightened, too. <eob>
But I kept having these odd experiences. <eob>
This time, an officer brought me his coat <eob> to keep me warm, <eob> because I lost my coat on the frozen river <eob> while battling with one of these soldiers. <eob>
I will tell you what I mean <eol> by these odd experiences. <eob>
I grew up in South Korea. <eob>
To us, North Korea was always the enemy, <eob> even before I was born. <eob>
South and North have been <eol> under armistice for 63 years, <eob> since the end of the Korean War. <eob>
And growing up in the South <eol> in the '80s and '90s, <eob> we were taught propaganda <eol> about North Korea. <eob>
And we heard so many graphic stories, <eob> such as, a little young boy <eol> being brutally killed <eob> by North Korean spies just because he said, <eob> "I don't like communists." <eob> Or, I watched this cartoon series <eob> about a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig, <eob> which represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time. <eob>
And the effect of hearing <eol> these horrible stories over and over <eob> instilled one word in a young mind: <eob> "enemy." <eob> And I think at some point, <eol> I dehumanized them, <eob> and the people of North Korea <eol> became equated <eob> with the North Korean government. <eob>
Now, back to my detention. <eob>
It was the second day <eob> of being in a cell. <eob>
I had not slept since I was out <eol> at the border. <eob>
This young guard came to my cell <eob> and offered me this small boiled egg <eob> and said, "This will give <eol> you strength to keep going." <eob> Do you know what it is like, <eob> receiving a small kindness <eol> in the enemy's hand? <eob>
Whenever they were kind to me, <eol> I thought the worst case <eob> was waiting for me after the kindness. <eob>
One officer noticed my nervousness. <eob>
He said, "Did you think <eol> we were all these red pigs?" <eob> referring to the cartoon <eol> that I just showed you. <eob>
Every day was like a psychological battle. <eob>
The interrogator had me sit at a table <eob> six days a week <eob> and had me writing down about my journey, my work, <eob> over and over until I wrote down the confession <eol> that they wanted to hear. <eob>
After about three months of detention, <eob> the North Korean court sentenced me <eob> to 12 years in a labor camp. <eob>
So I was just sitting in my room <eol> to be transferred. <eob>
At that time, I really <eol> had nothing else to do, <eob> so I paid attention to these <eol> two female guards <eob> and listened to what they were talking about. <eob>
Guard A was older, <eob> and she studied English. <eob>
She seemed like she came <eol> from an affluent family. <eob>
She often showed up <eol> with these colorful dresses, <eob> and then loved to show off. <eob>
And Guard B was the younger one, <eob> and she was a really good singer. <eob>
She loved to sing Celine <eol> Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" -- <eob> sometimes too much. <eob>
She knew just how to torture me <eol> without knowing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this girl spent a lot of time <eol> in the morning to put on makeup, <eob> like you can see in any young girl's life. <eob>
And they loved to watch <eol> this Chinese drama, <eob> a better quality production. <eob>
I remember Guard B said, <eob> "I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this." <eob> She got scolded <eob> for degrading her own country's produced TV shows. <eob>
Guard B had more of a free mind <eol> than Guard A, <eob> and she often got scolded by Guard A whenever <eol> she expressed herself. <eob>
One day, they invited <eol> all these female colleagues -- <eob> I don't know where they came from -- <eob> to where I was held, <eob> and they invited me <eob> to their guard room <eob> and asked <eob> if one-night <eol> stands really happen in the US. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is the country <eol> where young couples are not even allowed <eob> to hold hands in public. <eob>
I had no idea where <eol> they had gotten this information, <eob> but they were shy and giggly <eol> even before I said anything. <eob>
I think we all forgot <eol> that I was their prisoner, <eob> and it was like going back <eol> to my high school classroom again. <eob>
And I learned that these girls also <eol> grew up watching a similar cartoon, <eob> but just propaganda <eol> towards South Korea and the US. <eob>
I started to understand <eol> where these people's anger was coming from. <eob>
If these girls grew up learning <eol> that we are enemies, <eob> it was just natural that they would hate us <eob> just as I feared them. <eob>
But at that moment, we were all just girls <eob> who shared the same interests, <eob> beyond our ideologies that separated us. <eob>
I shared these stories with my boss <eol> at Current TV at the time <eob> after I came home. <eob>
His first reaction was, <eob> "Euna, have you heard <eol> of Stockholm Syndrome?" <eob> Yes, and I clearly remember <eob> the feeling of fear <eob> and being threatened, <eob> and tension rising up between me and the interrogator <eob> when we talked about politics. <eob>
There definitely was a wall <eol> that we couldn't climb over. <eob>
But we were able to see <eol> each other as human beings <eob> when we talked about family, <eob> everyday life, <eob> the importance of the future <eol> for our children. <eob>
It was about a month before I came home. <eob> I got really sick. <eob>
Guard B stopped by my room <eol> to say goodbye, <eob> because she was leaving the detention center. <eob>
She made sure that no one watched us, <eob> no one heard us, <eob> and quietly said, <eob> "I hope you get better <eob> and go back to your family soon." <eob> It is these people -- <eob> the officer who brought me his coat, <eob> the guard who offered me a boiled egg, <eob> these female guards who asked me <eol> about dating life in the US -- <eob> they are the ones that I remember of North Korea: <eob> humans just like us. <eob>
North Koreans and I were not <eol> ambassadors of our countries, <eob> but I believe that we were representing <eob> the human race. <eob>
Now I'm back home and back to my life. <eob>
The memory of these people <eol> has blurred as time has passed. <eob>
And I'm in this place <eob> where I read and hear about North Korea <eol> provoking the US. <eob>
I realized how easy it is <eob> to see them as an enemy again. <eob>
But I have to keep reminding myself <eol> that when I was over there, <eob> I was able to see humanity <eob> over hatred <eob> in my enemy's eyes. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Since 2009, the world has been stuck <eob> on a single narrative <eol> around a coming global food crisis <eob> and what we need to do to avoid it. <eob>
How do we feed <eol> nine billion people by 2050? <eob>
Every conference, podcast and dialogue <eol> around global food security <eob> starts with this question <eob> and goes on to answer it <eob> by saying we need to produce <eol> 70 percent more food. <eob>
The 2050 narrative started to evolve <eob> shortly after global food prices <eol> hit all-time highs in 2008. <eob>
People were suffering and struggling, <eob> governments and world leaders <eob> needed to show us <eol> that they were paying attention <eob> and were working to solve it. <eob>
The thing is, 2050 is so far into the future <eob> that we can't even relate to it, <eob> and more importantly, <eob> if we keep doing what we're doing, <eob> it's going to hit us <eol> a lot sooner than that. <eob>
I believe we need <eol> to ask a different question. <eob>
The answer to that question <eob> needs to be framed differently. <eob>
If we can reframe the old narrative <eob> and replace it with new numbers <eob> that tell us a more complete pictures, <eob> numbers that everyone can understand <eob> and relate to, <eob> we can avoid the crisis altogether. <eob>
I was a commodities trader <eol> in my past life <eob> and one of the things <eol> that I learned trading <eob> is that every market <eol> has a tipping point, <eob> the point at which change occurs so rapidly <eob> that it impacts the world <eob> and things change forever. <eob>
Think of the last financial crisis, <eob> or the dot-com crash. <eob>
So here's my concern. <eob>
We could have a tipping point <eob> in global food and agriculture <eob> if surging demand <eob> surpasses the agricultural <eol> system's structural capacity to produce food. <eob>
This means at this point supply <eol> can no longer keep up with demand <eob> despite exploding prices, <eob> unless we can commit to some type <eol> of structural change. <eob>
This time around, <eob> it won't be about stock markets and money. <eob>
It's about people. <eob>
People could starve <eol> and governments may fall. <eob>
This question of at what point <eol> does supply struggle <eob> to keep up with surging demand <eob> is one that started off as an interest <eol> for me while I was trading <eob> and became an absolute obsession. <eob>
It went from interest to obsession <eob> when I realized through <eol> my research how broken the system was <eob> and how very little data was being used <eol> to make such critical decisions. <eob>
That's the point I decided <eol> to walk away from a career on Wall Street <eob> and start an entrepreneurial journey <eob> to start Gro Intelligence. <eob>
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data <eob> and doing the work to make it actionable, <eob> to empower decision-makers at every level. <eob>
But doing this work, <eob> we also realized that the world, <eob> not just world leaders, <eob> but businesses and citizens like every <eol> single person in this room, <eob> lacked an actionable guide <eob> on how we can avoid <eol> a coming global food security crisis. <eob>
And so we built a model, <eob> leveraging the petabytes of data we sit on, <eob> and we solved for the tipping point. <eob>
Now, no one knows <eol> we've been working on this problem <eob> and this is the first time <eol> that I'm sharing what we discovered. <eob>
We discovered that the tipping point <eol> is actually a decade from now. <eob>
We discovered that the world <eob> will be short 214 trillion calories <eob> by 2027. <eob>
The world is not in a position <eol> to fill this gap. <eob>
Now, you'll notice <eob> that the way I'm framing this is different <eol> from how I started, <eob> and that's intentional, because until now <eob> this problem has been quantified <eol> using mass: <eob> think kilograms, tons, hectograms, <eob> whatever your unit of choice <eol> is in mass. <eob>
Why do we talk about <eol> food in terms of weight? <eob>
Because it's easy. <eob>
We can look at a photograph <eol> and determine tonnage on a ship <eob> by using a simple pocket calculator. <eob>
We can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts. <eob>
But what we care about in food <eol> is nutritional value. <eob>
Not all foods are created equal, <eob> even if they weigh the same. <eob>
This I learned firsthand <eob> when I moved from Ethiopia <eol> to the US for university. <eob>
Upon my return back home, <eob> my father, who was so excited to see me, <eob> greeted me by asking why I was fat. <eob>
Now, turns out that eating <eob> approximately the same amount <eol> of food as I did in Ethiopia, but in America, <eob> had actually lent <eol> a certain fullness to my figure. <eob>
This is why we should care about calories, <eob> not about mass. <eob>
It is calories which sustain us. <eob>
So 214 trillion calories <eol> is a very large number, <eob> and not even the most dedicated of us <eob> think in the hundreds of trillions <eol> of calories. <eob>
So let me break this down differently. <eob>
An alternative way to think about this <eob> is to think about it in Big Macs. <eob> 214 trillion calories. <eob> A single Big Mac has 563 calories. <eob>
That means the world will be short 379 billion <eol> Big Macs in 2027. <eob>
That is more Big Macs than McDonald's <eol> has ever produced. <eob>
So how did we get to these numbers <eol> in the first place? <eob>
They're not made up. <eob>
This map shows you where <eol> the world was 40 years ago. <eob>
It shows you net calorie gaps <eol> in every country in the world. <eob>
Now, simply put, <eob> this is just calories consumed <eol> in that country <eob> minus calories produced <eol> in that same country. <eob>
This is not a statement on malnutrition <eol> or anything else. <eob>
It's simply saying how many calories <eol> are consumed in a single year <eob> minus how many are produced. <eob>
Blue countries are net calorie exporters, <eob> or self-sufficient. <eob>
They have some in storage for a rainy day. <eob>
Red countries are net calorie importers. <eob>
The deeper, the brighter the red, <eob> the more you're importing. <eob>
40 years ago, such few countries <eol> were net exporters of calories, <eob> I could count them with one hand. <eob>
Most of the African continent, <eob> Europe, most of Asia, <eob> South America excluding Argentina, <eob> were all net importers of calories. <eob>
And what's surprising is that China <eol> used to actually be food self-sufficient. <eob>
India was a big net importer of calories. <eob>
40 years later, this is today. <eob>
You can see the drastic transformation <eol> that's occurred in the world. <eob>
Brazil has emerged <eol> as an agricultural powerhouse. <eob>
Europe is dominant in global agriculture. <eob>
India has actually flipped <eol> from red to blue. <eob>
It's become food self-sufficient. <eob>
And China went from that light blue <eob> to the brightest red that <eol> you see on this map. <eob>
How did we get here? What happened? <eob> So this chart shows you India and Africa. <eob>
Blue line is India, red line is Africa. <eob>
How is it that two regions that started <eol> off so similarly <eob> in such similar trajectories <eob> take such different paths? <eob>
India had a green revolution. <eob>
Not a single African country <eol> had a green revolution. <eob> The net outcome? <eob> India is food self-sufficient <eob> and in the past decade <eol> has actually been exporting calories. <eob>
The African continent now imports over 300 trillion calories a year. <eob>
Then we add China, the green line. <eob>
Remember the switch <eol> from the blue to the bright red? <eob>
What happened and when did it happen? <eob>
China seemed to be <eol> on a very similar path to India <eob> until the start of the 21st century, <eob> where it suddenly flipped. <eob>
A young and growing population <eob> combined with significant economic growth <eob> made its mark with a big bang <eob> and no one in the markets saw it coming. <eob>
This flip was everything <eol> to global agricultural markets. <eob>
Luckily now, South America <eob> was starting to boom <eol> at the same time as China's rise, <eob> and so therefore, supply and demand <eol> were still somewhat balanced. <eob>
So the question becomes, <eob> where do we go from here? <eob> Oddly enough, <eob> it's not a new story, <eob> except this time it's not <eol> just a story of China. <eob>
It's a continuation of China, <eob> an amplification of Africa <eob> and a paradigm shift in India. <eob>
By 2023, <eob> Africa's population is forecasted <eol> to overtake that of India's and China's. <eob>
By 2023, <eob> these three regions combined <eob> will make up over half <eol> the world's population. <eob>
This crossover point starts <eol> to present really interesting challenges <eob> for global food security. <eob>
And a few years later, we're hit hard <eol> with that reality. <eob>
What does the world look like in 10 years? <eob>
So far, as I mentioned, India <eol> has been food self-sufficient. <eob>
Most forecasters predict <eol> that this will continue. <eob> We disagree. <eob> India will soon become <eol> a net importer of calories. <eob>
This will be driven both by the fact <eob> that demand is growing from <eol> a population growth standpoint <eob> plus economic growth. <eob>
It will be driven by both. <eob>
And even if you have optimistic assumptions <eob> around production growth, <eob> it will make that slight flip. <eob>
That slight flip can have <eol> huge implications. <eob>
Next, Africa will continue <eol> to be a net importer of calories, <eob> again driven by population growth <eol> and economic growth. <eob>
This is again assuming <eol> optimistic production growth assumptions. <eob>
Then China, <eob> where population <eol> is flattening out, <eob> calorie consumption will explode <eob> because the types of calories consumed <eob> are also starting to be higher-calorie-content foods. <eob>
And so therefore, <eob> these three regions combined <eob> start to present a really interesting <eol> challenge for the world. <eob>
Until now, countries with calorie deficits <eob> have been able to meet these deficits <eob> by importing from surplus regions. <eob>
By surplus regions, I'm talking about <eob> North America, South America and Europe. <eob>
This line chart over here shows you <eob> the growth and the projected growth <eol> over the next decade of production <eob> from <eob> North America, South America and Europe. <eob>
What it doesn't show you <eob> is that most of this growth <eol> is actually going to come from South America. <eob>
And most of this growth <eob> is going to come at the huge cost <eol> of deforestation. <eob>
North America, South America and Europe. <eob> And so when you look <eol> at the combined demand increase <eob> coming from India, China and the African continent, <eob> and look <eob> at it versus <eol> the combined increase in production <eob> coming from India, China, <eol> the African continent, <eob> you are left with a 214-trillion-calorie deficit, <eob> one we can't produce. <eob>
And this, by the way, is actually assuming <eol> we take all the extra calories <eob> produced in <eob> North America, <eol> South America and Europe <eob> and export them solely <eol> to India, China and Africa. <eob>
What I just presented to you <eol> is a vision of an impossible world. <eob>
We can do something to change that. <eob>
We can change consumption patterns, <eob> we can reduce food waste, <eob> or we can make a bold commitment <eob> to increasing yields exponentially. <eob>
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing <eob> changing consumption patterns <eol> or reducing food waste, <eob> because those conversations <eol> have been going on for some time now. <eob> Nothing has happened. <eob> Nothing has happened <eol> because those arguments <eob> ask the surplus regions to change their behavior <eob> on behalf of deficit regions. <eob>
Waiting for others <eol> to change their behavior <eob> on your behalf, for your survival, <eob> is a terrible idea. <eob> It's unproductive. <eob>
So I'd like to suggest an alternative <eol> that comes from the red regions. <eob>
China, India, Africa. <eob>
China is constrained in terms of how <eol> much more land it actually has <eob> available for agriculture, <eob> and it has massive water resource availability issues. <eob>
So the answer really <eol> lies in India and in Africa. <eob>
India has some upside in terms <eol> of potential yield increases. <eob>
Now this is the gap <eol> between its current yield <eob> and the theoretical maximum <eol> yield it can achieve. <eob>
It has some unfarmed arable land remaining, <eol> but not much, <eob> India is quite land-constrained. <eob>
Now, the African continent, <eol> on the other hand, <eob> has vast amounts of arable land remaining <eob> and significant upside potential in yields. <eob>
Somewhat simplified picture here, <eob> but if you look at sub-Saharan African yields <eol> in corn today, <eob> they are where North American yields <eol> were in 1940. <eob>
We don't have 70-plus years <eol> to figure this out, <eob> so it means we need to try something new <eob> and we need to try something different. <eob>
The solution starts with reforms. <eob>
We need to reform and commercialize <eob> the agricultural industries in Africa <eob> and in India. <eob>
Now, by commercialization -- <eob> commercialization is not <eol> about commercial farming alone. <eob>
Commercialization is about leveraging data <eob> to craft better policies, <eob> to improve infrastructure, <eob> to lower the transportation costs <eob> and to completely reform banking <eol> and insurance industries. <eob>
Commercialization is about taking agriculture <eob> from too risky an endeavor <eol> to one where fortunes can be made. <eob>
Commercialization <eol> is not about just farmers. <eob>
Commercialization is about <eol> the entire agricultural system. <eob>
But commercialization also means <eol> confronting the fact <eob> that we can no longer <eol> place the burden of growth <eob> on small-scale farmers alone, <eob> and accepting that commercial farms <eol> and the introduction of commercial farms <eob> could provide certain economies of scale <eob> that even small-scale farmers can leverage. <eob>
It is not about small-scale farming <eol> or commercial agriculture, <eob> or big agriculture. <eob>
We can create the first successful models <eol> of the coexistence and success <eob> of small-scale farming alongside <eol> commercial agriculture. <eob>
This is because, for the first time ever, <eob> the most critical tool <eol> for success in the industry -- <eob> data and knowledge -- <eob> is becoming cheaper by the day. <eob>
And very soon, it won't matter <eol> how much money you have <eob> or how big you are <eob> to make optimal decisions <eol> and maximize probability of success <eob> in reaching your intended goal. <eob>
Companies like Gro are working <eol> really hard to make this a reality. <eob>
So if we can commit to this <eol> new, bold initiative, <eob> to this new, bold change, <eob> not only can we solve the 214-trillion gap <eol> that I talked about, <eob> but we can actually set the world <eol> on a whole new path. <eob>
India can remain food self-sufficient <eob> and Africa can emerge <eol> as the world's next dark blue region. <eob>
The new question is, <eob> how do we produce <eob> 214 trillion calories <eob> to feed 8.3 billion people <eob> by 2027? <eob> We have the solution. <eob>
We just need to act on it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A long time ago, <eob> I was a professional animator. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
[Eric Dyer] <eob>
And at night, <eob> I would make my own experimental films. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
And I was spending a lot of time, way too much <eol> time, in front of a screen <eob> for work that would be presented on a screen, <eob> and I had this great need <eol> to get my hands back on the work again. <eob>
Now, before "The Simpsons," <eob> before "Gumby," <eob> before "Betty Boop," <eob> before there was such a thing <eol> as cinema and television, <eob> animation was hugely popular in this form. <eob>
This is a zoetrope. <eob>
And you spin this drum, <eob> and you look through the slits <eol> into the inside of the drum, <eob> and you see the animation pop to life. <eob>
This is animation in physical form, <eob> and it's animation I could get <eol> my hands on again. <eob>
I took these ideas to Denmark. <eob>
I went there with my family <eol> on a Fulbright Fellowship. <eob>
That's my daughter, Mia. <eob>
I rode around the city on my bicycle <eob> and shot all the interesting <eol> moving elements of Copenhagen: <eob> the boaters in the canals, <eob> the colors that explode in spring, <eob> the free-use city bikes, <eob> love, <eob> textures, <eob> the healthy cuisine -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I brought all that video <eol> back into the physical world <eob> by printing it out on these long strips <eol> of ink-jet paper <eob> and cutting out the forms. <eob>
Now, I invented my own form <eol> of the zoetrope, <eob> which removes the drum <eob> and replaces the slits <eol> with a video camera. <eob>
And this was very exciting for me, <eob> because it meant that I could make <eol> these physical objects, <eob> and I could make films from those objects. <eob>
That's me riding on my bicycle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I made about 25 paper sculptures, <eob> each the size of a bicycle wheel. <eob>
I brought them into the studio, <eob> spun them <eob> and shot them to make the film <eol> "Copenhagen Cycles." <eob>
(Music) <eob>
This project not only allowed me <eol> to get my hands back on the work again <eob> but it helped me get my life back. <eob>
Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day <eol> with my face plastered to a screen, <eob> I was having these little adventures <eol> with our new family <eob> and shooting video along the way, <eob> and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life. <eob>
And I think that it's no mistake <eob> that zoetrope translates <eol> into "wheel of life." <eob>
(Music) <eob>
But film and video does flatten sculpture, <eob> so I tried to imagine <eob> a way that animated sculpture <eol> could be experienced as such, <eob> and also a completely immersive <eol> kind of animated sculpture. <eob>
And that's where I came up with the idea <eol> for the zoetrope tunnel. <eob>
You walk through with a handheld strobe, <eob> and wherever you point the flashlight, <eob> the animation pops to life. <eob>
I plan to finish this project <eol> in the next 30 to 40 years. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I did build a half-scale prototype. <eob>
It's covered in Velcro, <eob> and I could lay inside on this bridge <eob> and stick animated sequences to the walls <eob> and test stuff out. <eob>
People would comment <eol> that it reminded them of an MRI. <eob>
And that medical connection <eol> spoke to me, <eob> because at the age of 14, <eob> I was diagnosed with a degenerative <eol> retinal condition <eob> that's slowly taking my vision away, <eob> and I'd never responded <eol> to that in my work. <eob>
So I responded to it in this piece <eol> called, "Implant." <eob> It is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device <eob> that fits around the optic nerve. <eob>
And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized <eol> to experience it. <eob>
With a handheld strobe, <eob> they can explore the sculpture, <eob> and discover thousands of cell-sized robots <eob> hard at work, leaping <eol> in and out of the optic nerve, <eob> being deployed to the retina <eob> to repair it. <eob>
It's my science fiction fantasy <eol> cure of my own incurable disorder. <eob>
Now, in the real-world gene <eol> therapy and gene therapy research, <eob> healthy genes are being administered <eol> to unhealthy cells using viruses. <eob>
There's a lot of colorful, <eol> fluffy hope in this, <eob> and there's also some creepy, threatening idea <eob> of viruses maybe becoming <eol> an invasive species in your body. <eob>
Vision loss has helped <eol> to take me away from the things <eob> that disconnect me from the world. <eob>
Instead of being sealed off <eol> in an automobile, <eob> I ride my bike, <eob> take buses and trains <eob> and walk a lot. <eob>
And instead of a visually intensive process <eol> in the studio, primarily, <eob> I'm also getting outdoors a lot more <eob> and using more of my senses. <eob>
This landscape is a couple hours east <eol> of San Diego, California. <eob>
My brother lives out that way. <eob>
He and I went camping there for four days. <eob>
And I grabbed my camera, <eob> and I walked through the canyons. <eob>
And I tried to imagine and figure out <eob> what kind of motion <eol> would be present <eob> in this place that was so still and so devoid of motion. <eob>
I think it's the stillest place <eol> I've ever been. <eob>
And I realized that it was the movement <eol> of my own body through the landscape <eob> that was creating the animation. <eob>
It was the motion of changing perspective. <eob>
So I created this piece called <eol> "Mud Caves" from those photographs. <eob>
It's a multilayered print piece, <eob> and you can think of it <eol> as a zoetrope laid flat. <eob>
It's kind of my western landscape <eol> panorama. <eob>
And next to the print piece <eol> there's a video monitor <eob> that shows the animation <eol> hidden within the artwork. <eob>
I think one of the best parts <eol> about this project for me <eob> was that I got to hang out <eol> with my brother a lot, <eob> who lives 2,500 miles <eol> away from me. <eob>
And we would just sit in this <eol> seemingly eternal landscape <eob> sculpted by water over millions of years <eob> and talk. <eob>
We'd talk about our kids growing up <eob> and the slowing pace of our parents, <eob> and our dad who's suffering from leukemia, <eol> memory loss and infection. <eob>
And it struck me that, as individuals, <eob> we're finite, <eob> but as a family, <eob> we are an ongoing cycle -- <eob> a kind of wheel of life. <eob>
Now, I want to leave you with <eol> a tribute to one of my mentors. <eob>
She reminds me <eol> that physical presence is important <eob> and that play is not a luxury, <eob> but a necessity. <eob>
She's Pixie, <eob> and she's our family dog. <eob> And she loves to jump. <eob>
(Dog barking <eob> and spring boinging) <eob>
And this is a new kind of zoetrope <eob> that I developed at the Imaging Research Center <eob> at UMBC in Baltimore. <eob>
And I call it a "real-time zoetrope." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: Christiane, <eol> great to have you here. <eob>
So you've had this amazing viewpoint, <eob> and perhaps it's fair to say <eol> that in the last few years, <eob> there have been some alarming developments <eol> that you're seeing. <eob>
What's alarmed you most? <eob>
Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listening <eol> to the earlier speakers, <eob> I can frame it <eol> in what they've been saying: <eob> climate change, for instance -- <eol> cities, the threat to our environment <eob> and our lives. <eob>
It basically also boils down <eol> to understanding the truth <eob> and to be able to get to the truth <eol> of what we're talking about <eob> in order to really be able to solve it. <eob>
So if 99.9 percent <eol> of the science on climate <eob> is empirical, scientific evidence, <eob> but it's competing almost equally <eol> with a handful of deniers, <eob> that is not the truth; <eob> that is the epitome <eol> of fake news. <eob>
And so for me, the last few years -- <eol> certainly this last year -- <eob> has crystallized the notion <eol> of fake news in a way that's truly alarming <eob> and not just some slogan <eol> to be thrown around. <eob>
Because when you can't distinguish <eol> between the truth and fake news, <eob> you have a very much more difficult <eol> time trying to solve <eob> some of the great issues <eol> that we face. <eob>
CA: Well, you've been involved <eol> in this question of, <eob> what is balance, what is truth, <eol> what is impartiality, <eob> for a long time. <eob>
You were on the front lines <eol> reporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago. <eob>
And back then, you famously said, <eob> by calling out human right abuses, <eob> you said, "Look, there are some situations <eol> one simply cannot be neutral about, <eob> because when you're neutral, <eob> you are an accomplice." <eob> So, do you feel that today's journalists <eol> aren't heeding that advice <eob> about balance? <eob>
CA: Well, look, I think for journalists, <eol> objectivity is the golden rule. <eob>
But I think sometimes we don't understand <eol> what objectivity means. <eob>
And I actually learned this very, <eol> very young in my career, <eob> which was during the Balkan Wars. <eob>
I was young then. <eob>
It was about 25 years ago. <eob>
And what we faced was the wholesale violation, <eol> not just of human rights, <eob> but all the way to ethnic cleansing and genocide, <eob> and that has been adjudicated <eol> in the highest war crimes court <eob> in the world. <eob>
So, we know what we were seeing. <eob>
Trying to tell the world <eol> what we were seeing <eob> brought us accusations <eol> of bias, <eob> of siding with one side, <eob> of not seeing the whole side, <eob> and just, you know, <eol> trying to tell one story. <eob>
I particularly and personally <eol> was accused of siding with, <eob> for instance, the citizens of Sarajevo -- <eob> "siding with the Muslims," <eob> because they were the minority <eol> who were being attacked <eob> by Christians on the Serb side <eob> in this area. <eob> And it worried me. <eob> It worried me that I was being accused of this. <eob>
I thought maybe I was wrong, <eob> maybe I'd forgotten what objectivity was. <eob>
But then I started to understand <eol> that what people wanted <eob> was actually not to do anything -- <eob> not to step in, <eob> not to change the situation, <eob> not to find a solution. <eob>
And so, their fake news at that time, <eob> their lie at that time -- <eob> including our government's, <eol> our democratically elected government's, <eob> with values and principles of human rights -- <eob> their lie was to say that all sides <eol> are equally guilty, <eob> that this has been centuries <eol> of ethnic hatred, <eob> whereas we knew that wasn't true, <eob> that one side had decided to kill, <eol> slaughter and ethnically cleanse <eob> another side. <eob>
So that is where, for me, <eob> I understood that objectivity means <eol> giving all sides an equal hearing <eob> and talking to all sides, <eob> but not treating all sides equally, <eob> not creating a forced moral equivalence <eol> or a factual equivalence. <eob>
And when you come up against that crisis point <eob> in situations of grave violations <eol> of international and humanitarian law, <eob> if you don't understand what you're seeing, <eob> if you don't understand the truth <eob> and if you get trapped in the fake news paradigm, <eob> then <eob> you are an accomplice. <eob>
And I refuse to be <eol> an accomplice to genocide. <eob>
CH: So there have always been <eol> these propaganda battles, <eob> and you were courageous in taking <eol> the stand you took back then. <eob>
Today, there's a whole new way, though, <eob> in which news seems to be becoming fake. <eob> How would you characterize that? <eob>
CA: Well, look -- I am really alarmed. <eob>
And everywhere I look, <eob> you know, we're buffeted by it. <eob>
Obviously, when the leader of the free world, <eob> when the most powerful person <eol> in the entire world, <eob> which is the president of the United States -- <eob> this is the most important, <eol> most powerful country in the whole world, <eob> economically, militarily, <eol> politically in every which way -- <eob> and it seeks to, obviously, promote its values <eol> and power around the world. <eob>
So we journalists, who only seek the truth -- <eob> I mean, that is our mission -- <eob> we go around the world looking for the truth <eob> in order to be everybody's eyes and ears, <eob> people who can't go out <eol> in various parts of the world <eob> to figure out what's going on about things <eol> that are vitally important <eob> to everybody's health and security. <eob>
So when you have a major world <eol> leader accusing you of fake news, <eob> it has an exponential ripple effect. <eob>
And what it does is, <eol> it starts to chip away <eob> at not just our credibility, <eob> but at people's minds -- <eob> people who look at us, <eol> and maybe they're thinking, <eob> "Well, if the president <eol> of the United States says that, <eob> maybe somewhere there's a truth in there." <eob>
CH: Presidents have always <eol> been critical of the media -- <eob>
CA: Not in this way. <eob>
CH: So, to what extent -- <eob>
CH: I mean, someone a couple years ago <eol> looking at the avalanche of information <eob> pouring through Twitter <eol> and Facebook and so forth, <eob> might have said, <eob> "Look, our democracies are healthier <eol> than they've ever been. <eob>
There's more news than ever. <eob>
Of course presidents will say <eol> what they'll say, <eob> but everyone else can say <eol> what they will say. <eob>
What's not to like? <eob>
How is there an extra danger? " <eob>
CA: So, I wish that was true. <eob> I wish that the proliferation of platforms <eol> upon which we get our information <eob> meant that there was a proliferation of truth <eol> and transparency <eob> and depth and accuracy. <eob>
But I think the opposite has happened. <eob>
You know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite, <eob> I will confess. <eob>
Even when we started to talk <eol> about the information superhighway, <eob> which was a long time ago, <eob> before social media, Twitter <eol> and all the rest of it, <eob> I was actually really afraid <eob> that that would put people <eol> into certain lanes and tunnels <eob> and have them just focusing <eol> on areas of their own interest <eob> instead of seeing the broad picture. <eob>
And I'm afraid to say <eol> that with algorithms, with logarithms, <eob> with whatever the "-ithms" are <eob> that direct us into all these <eol> particular channels of information, <eob> that seems to be happening right now. <eob>
I mean, people have written <eol> about this phenomenon. <eob>
People have said that yes, the internet came, <eob> its promise was to exponentially <eol> explode our access to more democracy, <eob> more information, <eob> less bias, <eob> more varied information. <eob>
And, in fact, the opposite has happened. <eob>
And so that, for me, <eol> is incredibly dangerous. <eob>
And again, when you are the president <eol> of this country and you say things, <eob> it also gives leaders <eol> in other undemocratic countries the cover <eob> to affront us even worse, <eob> and to really whack us -- <eol> and their own journalists -- <eob> with this bludgeon of fake news. <eob>
CH: To what extent is what happened, though, <eob> in part, just an unintended consequence, <eob> that the traditional media that you worked in <eob> had this curation-mediation role, <eob> where certain norms were observed, <eob> certain stories would be rejected because they weren't credible, <eob> but now that the standard for publication <eol> and for amplification <eob> is just interest, attention, excitement, click, <eob> "Did it get clicked on?" <eob> "Send it out there!" <eob> and that's what's -- is that part of what's caused the problem? <eob>
CA: I think it's a big problem, and we saw this in the election of 2016, <eob> where the idea of "clickbait" <eol> was very sexy and very attractive, <eob> and so all these fake news <eol> sites and fake news items <eob> were not just haphazardly <eol> and by happenstance being put out there, <eob> there's been a whole industry <eol> in the creation of fake news <eob> in parts of Eastern Europe, wherever, <eob> and you know, it's planted <eol> in real space and in cyberspace. <eob>
So I think that, also, <eob> the ability of our technology <eol> to proliferate this stuff <eob> at the speed of sound or light, <eol> just about -- <eob> we've never faced that before. <eob>
And we've never faced such a massive amount <eol> of information <eob> which is not curated <eob> by those whose profession leads them <eol> to abide by the truth, <eob> to fact-check <eob> and to maintain a code <eol> of conduct and a code of professional ethics. <eob>
CH: Many people here may know <eol> people who work at Facebook <eob> or Twitter and Google and so on. <eob>
They all seem like great people <eol> with good intention -- <eob> let's assume that. <eob>
If you could speak <eol> with the leaders of those companies, <eob> what would you say to them? <eob>
CA: Well, you know what -- <eob> I'm sure they are <eol> incredibly well-intentioned, <eob> and they certainly developed an unbelievable, <eol> game-changing system, <eob> where everybody's <eol> connected on this thing called Facebook. <eob>
And they've created a massive economy <eol> for themselves <eob> and an amazing amount of income. <eob>
I would just say, <eob> "Guys, you know, it's time <eol> to wake up and smell the coffee <eob> and look at what's happening <eol> to us right now." <eob> Mark Zuckerberg wants <eol> to create a global community. <eob>
I want to know: What is that global community <eol> going to look like? <eob>
I want to know where the codes <eol> of conduct actually are. <eob>
Mark Zuckerberg said -- <eob> and I don't blame him, <eol> he probably believed this -- <eob> that it was crazy to think <eob> that the Russians or anybody else <eol> could be tinkering and messing around <eob> with this avenue. <eob>
And what have we just learned <eol> in the last few weeks? <eob>
That, actually, there has been <eol> a major problem in that regard, <eob> and now they're having to investigate it <eol> and figure it out. <eob>
Yes, they're trying to do <eol> what they can now <eob> to prevent the rise of fake news, <eob> but, you know, <eob> it went pretty unrestricted <eol> for a long, long time. <eob>
So I guess I would say, you know, <eob> you guys are brilliant at technology; <eob> let's figure out another algorithm. <eob> Can we not? <eob>
CH: An algorithm that includes journalistic <eol> investigation -- <eob>
CA: I don't really know how they do it, <eol> but somehow, you know -- <eob> filter out the crap! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And not just the unintentional -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
but the deliberate lies that are planted <eob> by people who've been doing <eol> this as a matter of warfare <eob> for decades. <eob>
The Soviets, the Russians -- <eob> they are the masters <eol> of war by other means, of hybrid warfare. <eob>
And this is a -- <eob> this is what they've decided to do. <eob>
It worked in the United States, <eob> it didn't work in France, <eob> it hasn't worked in Germany. <eob>
During the elections there, <eol> where they've tried to interfere, <eob> the president of France <eol> right now, Emmanuel Macron, <eob> took a very tough stand <eol> and confronted it head on, <eob> as did Angela Merkel. <eob>
CH: There's some hope <eol> to be had from some of this, isn't there? <eob>
That the world learns. <eob>
We get fooled once, <eob> maybe we get fooled again, <eob> but maybe not the third time. <eob> Is that true? <eob>
CA: I mean, let's hope. <eob> But I think in this regard that so much of it <eol> is also about technology, <eob> that the technology has to also be given <eol> some kind of moral compass. <eob>
I know I'm talking nonsense, <eol> but you know what I mean. <eob>
CH: We need a filter-the-crap algorithm <eol> with a moral compass -- <eob>
CA: There you go. <eob>
CH: I think that's good. <eob>
CA: No -- "moral technology." <eob> We all have moral compasses -- <eol> moral technology. <eob>
CH: I think that's a great challenge. <eob>
CA: You know what I mean. <eob>
CH: Talk just a minute about leadership. <eob>
You've had a chance to speak <eol> with so many people across the world. <eob>
I think for some of us -- <eob> I speak for myself, <eol> I don't know if others feel this -- <eob> there's kind of been a disappointment of: <eob> Where are the leaders? <eob>
So many of us have been disappointed -- <eob> Aung San Suu Kyi, <eol> what's happened recently, <eob> it's like, "No! Another one bites the dust." <eob> You know, it's heartbreaking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Who have you met <eob> who you have been impressed <eol> by, inspired by? <eob>
CA: Well, you talk <eol> about the world in crisis, <eob> which is absolutely true, <eob> and those of us who spend <eol> our whole lives immersed in this crisis -- <eob> I mean, we're all on the verge <eol> of a nervous breakdown. <eob>
So it's pretty stressful right now. <eob>
And you're right -- <eob> there is this perceived <eol> and actual vacuum of leadership, <eob> and it's not me saying it, <eol> I ask all these -- <eob> whoever I'm talking to, <eol> I ask about leadership. <eob>
I was speaking to the outgoing <eol> president of Liberia today, <eob> [Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,] <eob> who -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
in three weeks' time, <eob> will be one of the very rare <eol> heads of an African country <eob> who actually abides by the constitution <eob> and gives up power after her prescribed term. <eob>
She has said she wants <eol> to do that as a lesson. <eob>
But when I asked her about leadership, <eob> and I gave a quick-fire round of certain names, <eob> I presented her with the name <eol> of the new French president, <eob> Emmanuel Macron. <eob>
And she said -- <eob> I said, "So what do you think <eol> when I say his name?" <eob> And she said, <eob> "Shaping up potentially to be <eob> a leader to fill our current <eol> leadership vacuum." <eob> I thought that was really interesting. <eob>
Yesterday, I happened <eol> to have an interview with him. <eob>
I'm very proud to say, <eob> I got his first international interview. <eol> It was great. It was yesterday. <eob> And I was really impressed. <eob>
I don't know whether I should be saying <eol> that in an open forum, <eob> but I was really impressed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it could be just because <eol> it was his first interview, <eob> but -- I asked questions, and you know what? <eob> He answered them! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There was no spin, <eob> there was no wiggle <eol> and waggle, <eob> there was no spend-five-minutes- <eol> to-come-back-to-the-point. <eob>
I didn't have to keep interrupting, <eob> which I've become rather <eol> renowned for doing, <eob> because I want people to answer the question. <eob>
And he answered me, <eob> and it was pretty interesting. <eob> And he said — <eob>
CH: Tell me what he said. <eob>
CA: No, no, you go ahead. <eob>
CA: No, no, go ahead. <eob>
CH: What'd he say? <eob>
CA: OK. You've talked about nationalism <eol> and tribalism here today. <eob>
I asked him, "How did you have the guts <eol> to confront the prevailing winds <eob> of anti-globalization, nationalism, populism <eob> when you can see what happened <eol> in Brexit, <eob> when you could see what happened <eol> in the United States <eob> and what might have happened <eol> in many European elections <eob> at the beginning of 2017?" <eob> And he said, <eob> "For me, nationalism means war. <eob>
We have seen it before, <eob> we have lived through it <eol> before on my continent, <eob> and I am very clear about that." <eob> So he was not going to, <eol> just for political expediency, <eob> embrace the, kind of, lowest common <eol> denominator <eob> that had been embraced in other political elections. <eob>
And he stood against Marine Le Pen, <eol> who is a very dangerous woman. <eob>
CH: Last question for you, Christiane. <eob>
Tell us about ideas worth spreading. <eob>
If you could plant one idea <eol> into the minds of everyone here, <eob> what would that be? <eob>
CA: I would say really be careful <eol> where you get your information from; <eob> really take responsibility <eol> for what you read, listen to and watch; <eob> make sure that you go to the trusted brands <eol> to get your main information, <eob> no matter whether you have <eol> a wide, eclectic intake, <eob> really stick with the brand names that you know, <eob> because in this world right now, <eol> at this moment right now, <eob> our crises, our challenges, our problems are so severe, <eob> that unless we are all engaged as global citizens <eob> who appreciate the truth, <eob> who understand science, empirical evidence and facts, <eob> then we are just simply going to be wandering along <eob> to a potential catastrophe. <eob>
So I would say, the truth, <eob> and then I would come back to <eob> Emmanuel Macron <eob> and talk about love. <eob>
I would say that there's not enough <eol> love going around. <eob>
And I asked him to tell me about love. <eob>
I said, "You know, your marriage <eol> is the subject of global obsession." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Can you tell me about love? <eob> What does it mean to you?" <eob> I've never asked a president <eol> or an elected leader about love. <eob> I thought I'd try it. <eob>
And he said — <eob> you know, he actually answered it. <eob>
And he said, <eob> "I love my wife, she is part of me, <eob> we've been together for decades." <eob> But here's where it really counted, <eob> what really stuck with me. <eob>
He said, <eob> "It is so important for me <eol> to have somebody at home <eob> who tells me the truth." <eob>
So you see, I brought it home. <eob>
It's all about the truth. <eob>
CH: So there you go. Truth and love. <eol> Ideas worth spreading. <eob>
Christiane Amanpour, thank you so much. <eol> That was great. <eob>
I'm a neuroscientist, <eob> and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains, <eob> and our mission is to train the <eol> next generation of neuroscientists <eob> by taking graduate-level neuroscience research equipment <eob> and making it available for kids <eol> in middle schools and high schools. <eob>
And so when we go into the classroom, <eob> one way to get them thinking about the brain, <eol> which is very complex, <eob> is to ask them a very simple question <eol> about neuroscience, <eob> and that is, "What has a brain?" <eob> When we ask that, <eob> students will instantly tell you <eol> that their cat or dog has a brain, <eob> and most will say that a mouse <eol> or even a small insect has a brain, <eob> but almost nobody says that a plant or a tree <eob> or a shrub has a brain. <eob>
And so when you push -- <eob> because this could actually help <eol> describe a little bit <eob> how the brain actually functions -- <eob> so you push and say, <eob> "Well, what is it that makes living <eol> things have brains versus not?" <eob> And often they'll come back <eol> with the classification <eob> that things that move tend to have brains. <eob>
And that's absolutely correct. <eob>
Our nervous system evolved <eol> because it is electrical. <eob>
It's fast, so we can quickly <eol> respond to stimuli in the world <eob> and move if we need to. <eob>
But you can go back <eol> and push back on a student, <eob> and say, "Well, you know, you say <eol> that plants don't have brains, <eob> but plants do move." <eob> Anyone who has grown a plant <eob> has noticed that the plant will move <eob> and face the sun. <eob>
But they'll say, "But that's a slow movement. <eob>
You know, that doesn't count. <eob>
That could be a chemical process. <eob> "But what about fast-moving plants? <eob>
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs, <eol> the Royal Governor of North Carolina, <eob> made a pretty fascinating discovery. <eob>
In the swamps behind his house, <eob> he found a plant that would spring shut <eob> every time a bug would fall in between it. <eob>
He called this plant the flytrap, <eob> and within a decade, <eol> it made its way over to Europe, <eob> where eventually the great Charles Darwin <eol> got to study this plant, <eob> and this plant absolutely blew him away. <eob>
He called it the most wonderful <eol> plant in the world. <eob>
This is a plant <eol> that was an evolutionary wonder. <eob>
This is a plant that moves quickly, <eob> which is rare, <eob> and it's carnivorous, which is also rare. <eob>
And this is in the same plant. <eob>
But I'm here today to tell you <eob> that's not even the coolest thing about this plant. <eob> The coolest thing is that <eol> the plant can count. <eob>
So in order to show that, <eob> we have to get some vocabulary out of the way. <eob>
So I'm going to do what we do <eol> in the classroom with students. <eob>
We're going to do an experiment <eol> on electrophysiology, <eob> which is the recording of the body's electrical signal, <eob> either coming from neurons <eol> or from muscles. <eob>
And I'm putting some electrodes <eol> here on my wrists. <eob>
As I hook them up, <eob> we're going to be able to see a signal <eob> on the screen here. <eob>
And this signal may be familiar to you. <eob>
It's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram. <eob>
And this is coming <eol> from neurons in my heart <eob> that are firing what's called action potentials, <eob> potential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down, <eob> which causes my heart to fire, <eob> which then causes the signal that you see here. <eob>
And so I want you to remember <eol> the shape of what we'll be looking at right here, <eob> because this is going to be important. <eob>
This is a way that the brain <eol> encodes information <eob> in the form of an action potential. <eob>
So now let's turn to some plants. <eob> So I'm going to first introduce <eol> you to the mimosa, <eob> not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica, <eob> and this is a plant <eol> that's found in Central America and South America, <eob> and it has behaviors. <eob>
And the first behavior <eol> I'm going to show you <eob> is if I touch the leaves here, <eob> you get to see that the leaves tend to curl up. <eob>
And then the second behavior is, <eob> if I tap the leaf, <eob> the entire branch seems to fall down. <eob> So why does it do that? <eob> It's not really known to science. <eob>
One of the reasons why could <eol> be that it scares away insects <eob> or it looks less appealing <eol> to herbivores. <eob> But how does it do that? <eol> Now, that's interesting. <eob>
We can do an experiment to find out. <eob>
So what we're going to do now, <eob> just like I recorded the electrical potential from my body, <eob> we're going to record <eol> the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa. <eob>
And so what we're going to do is I've got a wire <eol> wrapped around the stem, <eob> and I've got the ground electrode where? <eob> In the ground. It's an electrical engineering <eol> joke. Alright. <eob>
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead <eol> and tap the leaf here, <eob> and I want you to look <eol> at the electrical recording <eob> that we're going to see inside the plant. <eob> Whoa. It is so big, <eol> I've got to scale it down. <eob> Alright. So what is that? <eob>
That is an action potential <eol> that is happening inside the plant. <eob>
Why was it happening? <eob>
Because it wanted to move. Right? <eob> And so when I hit <eol> the touch receptors, <eob> it sent a voltage all the way down <eol> to the end of the stem, <eob> which caused it to move. <eob>
And now, in our arms, <eol> we would move our muscles, <eob> but the plant doesn't have muscles. <eob>
What it has is water inside the cells <eob> and when the voltage hits it, <eol> it opens up, releases the water, <eob> changes the shape of the cells, <eol> and the leaf falls. <eob>
OK. So here we see an action <eol> potential encoding information to move. Alright? <eob> But can it do more? <eob> So let's go to find out. <eob> We're going to go to our good friend, <eol> the Venus flytrap here, <eob> and we're going to take a look <eol> at what happens inside the leaf <eob> when a fly lands on here. <eob>
So I'm going to pretend <eol> to be a fly right now. <eob>
And now here's my Venus flytrap, <eob> and inside the leaf, <eol> you're going to notice <eob> that there are three little hairs here, <eol> and those are trigger hairs. <eob>
And so when a fly lands -- <eob> I'm going to touch <eol> one of the hairs right now. <eob> Ready? One, two, three. <eob> What do we get? We get a beautiful <eol> action potential. <eob>
However, the flytrap doesn't close. <eob>
And to understand why that is, <eob> we need to know a little bit more <eol> about the behavior of the flytrap. <eob>
Number one is that it takes a long time <eol> to open the traps back up -- <eob> you know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it. <eob>
And so it takes a lot of energy. <eob>
And two, it doesn't need to eat <eol> that many flies throughout the year. <eob> Only a handful. It gets most <eol> of its energy from the sun. <eob>
It's just trying to replace some nutrients <eol> in the ground with flies. <eob>
And the third thing is, <eob> it only opens then closes the traps <eol> a handful of times <eob> until that trap dies. <eob>
So therefore, it wants to make <eol> really darn sure <eob> that there's a meal <eol> inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut. <eob> So how does it do that? <eob> It counts the number of seconds <eob> between successive touching of those hairs. <eob>
And so the idea is <eol> that there's a high probability, <eob> if there's a fly inside of there, <eol> they're going to be quick together, <eob> and so when it gets <eol> the first action potential, <eob> it starts counting, one, two, <eob> and if it gets to 20 and it doesn't fire again, <eob> then it's not going to close, <eob> but if it does it within there, <eol> then the flytrap will close. <eob>
So we're going to go back now. <eob>
I'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again. <eob> I've been talking <eol> for more than 20 seconds. <eob>
So we can see what happens <eol> when I touch the hair a second time. <eob> So what do we get? <eol> We get a second action potential, <eob> but again, the leaf doesn't close. <eob>
So now if I go back in there <eob> and if I'm a fly moving around, <eob> I'm going to be touching <eol> the leaf a few times. <eob>
I'm going to go and brush it a few times. <eob>
And immediately, <eob> the flytrap closes. <eob>
So here we are seeing the flytrap actually <eol> doing a computation. <eob>
It's determining <eol> if there's a fly inside the trap, <eob> and then it closes. <eob>
So let's go back to our original question. <eob> Do plants have brains? <eob>
Well, the answer is no. <eob>
There's no brains in here. <eob> There's no axons, no neurons. <eob> It doesn't get depressed. <eob>
It doesn't want to know <eol> what the Tigers' score is. <eob> It doesn't have self-actualization problems. <eob>
But what it does have is something <eol> that's very similar to us, <eob> which is the ability to communicate <eol> using electricity. <eob>
It just uses slightly <eol> different ions than we do, <eob> but it's actually doing the same thing. <eob>
So just to show you <eob> the ubiquitous nature <eol> of these action potentials, <eob> we saw it in the Venus flytrap, <eob> we've seen an action potential <eol> in the mimosa. <eob>
We've even seen an action <eol> potential in a human. <eob>
Now, this is the euro of the brain. <eob>
It's the way that all information <eol> is passed. <eob>
And so what we can do is we can use <eol> those action potentials <eob> to pass information <eob> between species of plants. <eob>
And so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator, <eob> and what we've done <eol> is we've created a brand new experiment <eob> where we're going to record <eol> the action potential from a Venus flytrap, <eob> and we're going to send it <eol> into the sensitive mimosa. <eob>
So I want you to recall what happens <eob> when we touch the leaves of the mimosa. <eob>
It has touch receptors that are sending <eol> that information <eob> back down <eob> in the form of an action potential. <eob>
And so what would happen <eob> if we took the action potential <eol> from the Venus flytrap <eob> and sent it into all the stems of the mimosa? <eob>
We should be able to create <eol> the behavior of the mimosas <eob> without actually touching it ourselves. <eob>
And so if you'll allow me, <eob> I'm going to go ahead <eol> and trigger this mimosa right now <eob> by touching on the hairs <eol> of the Venus flytrap. <eob>
So we're going to send information <eol> about touch from one plant to another. <eob>
So there you see it. <eob> So -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I hope you learned a little bit, <eol> something about plants today, <eob> and not only that. <eob> You learned that plants could be used <eol> to help teach neuroscience <eob> and bring along the neurorevolution. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'd like to take you back <eol> about seven years in my life. <eob>
Friday afternoon, <eob> a few days before Christmas 2009. <eob> I was the director of operations <eob> at a consumer products company in San Francisco, <eob> and I was called into a meeting <eol> that was already in progress. <eob>
That meeting turned out <eol> to be my exit interview. <eob>
I was fired, along with several others. <eob>
I was 64 years old at the time. <eob>
It wasn't completely unexpected. <eob>
I signed a stack of papers, <eob> gathered my personal effects, <eob> and left to join my wife <eob> who was waiting for me at a nearby restaurant, <eob> completely unaware. <eob>
Fast-forward several hours, <eob> we both got really silly drunk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment <eob> for a variety of companies, <eol> large and small, <eob> was over. <eob>
I had a good a network, <eol> a good reputation -- <eob> I thought I'd be just fine. <eob>
I was an engineer <eol> in manufacturing and packaging. <eob> I had a good background. <eob>
Retirement was, like for so many people, <eob> simply not an option for me, <eob> so I turned to consulting <eol> for the next couple of years <eob> without any passion whatsoever. <eob>
And then an idea began to take root, <eob> born from my concern for our environment. <eob>
I wanted to build my own business, <eob> designing and manufacturing biodegradable packaging <eol> from waste -- <eob> paper, agricultural, even textile waste -- <eob> replacing the toxic, <eol> disposable plastic packaging <eob> to which we've all become addicted. <eob>
This is called clean technology, <eob> and it felt really meaningful to me. <eob>
A venture that could help <eol> to reduce the billions of pounds <eob> of single-use <eol> plastic packaging dumped each year <eob> and polluting our land, <eol> our rivers and our oceans, <eob> and left for future generations <eol> to resolve -- <eob> our grandchildren, <eob> my grandchildren. <eob>
And so now at the age of 66, <eob> with 40 years of experience, <eob> I became an entrepreneur <eol> for the very first time. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> But there's more. <eob>
Lots of issues to deal with: <eob> manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation, <eob> patents, partnerships, funding -- <eob> these are all typical issues for a start-up, <eob> but hardly typical for me. <eob>
And a word about funding. <eob>
I live and work in San Francisco, <eob> and if you're looking for funding, <eob> you are typically going to compete <eol> with some very young people <eob> from the high-tech industry, <eob> and it can be very discouraging <eol> and intimidating. <eob>
I have shoes older than most <eol> of these people. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I do. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But five years later, <eob> I'm thrilled and proud to share with you <eob> that our revenues <eol> have doubled every year, <eob> we have no debt, <eob> we have several marquee clients, <eob> our patent was issued, <eob> I have a wonderful partner <eob> who's been with me right <eol> from the beginning, <eob> and we've won more than 20 awards for the work that we've done. <eob>
But best of all, <eob> we've made a small dent -- <eob> a very small dent -- <eob> in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I am doing the most rewarding <eol> and meaningful work of my life right now. <eob>
I can tell you there's lots of resources <eol> available to entrepreneurs of all ages, <eob> but what I really yearned for five years ago <eob> was to find other first-time entrepreneurs <eob> who were my age. <eob>
I wanted to connect with them. <eob>
I had no role models, absolutely none. <eob>
That 20-something app <eol> developer from Silicon Valley <eob> was not my role model. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm sure he was very clever -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I want to do something about that, <eob> and I want all of us <eol> to do something about that. <eob>
I want us to start talking more <eob> about people who don't become entrepreneurs <eol> until they are seniors. <eob>
Talking about these bold men <eol> and women who are checking in <eob> when their peers, in essence, <eol> are checking out. <eob>
And then connecting all these people <eol> across industries, across regions, <eob> across countries -- <eob> building a community. <eob>
You know, the Small Business Administration tells us <eob> that 64 percent of new jobs created <eol> in the private sector in the USA <eob> are thanks to small businesses like mine. <eob>
And who's to say <eol> that we'll stay forever small? <eob>
We have an interesting culture <eob> that really expects <eol> when you reach a certain age, <eob> you're going to be golfing, <eol> or playing checkers, <eob> or babysitting the grandkids <eol> all of the time. <eob>
And I adore <eob> my grandchildren <eob> — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and I'm also passionate <eob> about doing something meaningful <eol> in the global marketplace. <eob>
And I'm going to have lots of company. <eob>
The Census Bureau <eol> says that by 2050, <eob> there will be 84 million <eol> seniors in this country. <eob>
That's an amazing number. <eob>
That's almost twice as many <eol> as we have today. <eob>
Can you imagine how many first-time entrepreneurs <eol> there will be <eob> among 84 million people? <eob>
And they'll all have <eol> four decades of experience. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So when I say, "Let's start talking more <eol> about these wonderful entrepreneurs," <eob> I mean, let's talk <eol> about their ventures, <eob> just as we do the ventures <eol> of their much younger counterparts. <eob>
The older entrepreneurs in this country <eol> have a 70 percent success rate <eob> starting new ventures. <eob>
70 percent success rate. <eob>
We're like the Golden State <eol> Warriors of entrepreneurs -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> And that number plummets to 28 percent <eol> for younger entrepreneurs. <eob>
This is according <eol> to a UK-based group called CMI. <eob>
Aren't the accomplishments <eol> of a 70-year-old entrepreneur <eob> every bit as meaningful, <eob> every bit as newsworthy, <eob> as the accomplishments of a 30-year-old entrepreneur? <eob>
Of course they are. <eob>
That's why I'd like to make <eol> the phrase "70 over 70" just as -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
just as commonplace <eol> as the phrase "30 under 30." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
When was I was 21 years old, <eob> I had all this physics homework. <eob>
Physics homework <eol> requires taking breaks, <eob> and Wikipedia was relatively new, <eol> so I took a lot of breaks there. <eob>
I kept going back to the same articles, <eob> reading them again and again, <eob> on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland. <eob>
How cool would it be to visit these places <eob> and what would it take to do so? <eob>
Well, here we are <eob> on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane <eob> operated by NASA <eob> flying over the Greenland ice sheet. <eob>
There's a lot to see here, <eob> but there's more that is hidden, <eob> waiting to be uncovered. <eob>
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me <eob> is that there's liquid water hidden <eol> inside the ice sheet, <eob> because we didn't know that yet. <eob>
I did learn on Wikipedia <eol> that the Greenland ice sheet is huge, <eob> the size of Mexico, <eob> and its ice from top to bottom <eol> is two miles thick. <eob>
But it's not just static. <eob>
The ice flows like a river downhill <eol> towards the ocean. <eob>
As it flows around bends, <eob> it deforms and cracks. <eob>
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics, <eob> which are located <eol> in one of the most remote physical environments <eob> remaining on earth. <eob>
To work in glaciology right now <eol> is like getting in on the ground floor <eob> at Facebook in the 2000s. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Our capability to fly airplanes and satellites <eol> over the ice sheets <eob> is revolutionizing glaciology. <eob> It's just starting to do for science <eob> what the smartphone has done for social media. <eob>
The satellites are reporting <eol> a wealth of observations <eob> that are revealing new hidden <eol> facts about the ice sheets continuously. <eob>
For instance, we have observations <eol> of the size of the Greenland ice sheet <eob> every month going back to 2002. <eob>
You can look towards the bottom of the screen here <eob> to see the month and the year go forward. <eob>
You can see that some areas <eol> of the ice sheet melt <eob> or lose ice in the summer. <eob>
Other areas experience snowfall <eob> or gain ice back in the winter. <eob>
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed <eol> by an overall rate of mass loss <eob> that would have stunned a glaciologist <eol> 50 years ago. <eob>
We never thought that an ice sheet could lose <eol> mass into the ocean this quickly. <eob>
Since these measurements began in 2002, <eob> the ice sheet has lost so much ice <eob> that if that water were piled up <eol> on our smallest continent, <eob> it would drown Australia <eol> knee-deep. <eob> How is this possible? <eob> Well, under the ice <eol> lies the bedrock. <eob>
We used radar to image the hills, valleys, <eol> mountains and depressions <eob> that the ice flows over. <eob>
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels <eol> the size of the Grand Canyon <eob> that funnel ice and water off of Greenland <eol> and into the ocean. <eob>
The reason that radar <eol> can reveal the bedrock <eob> is that ice is entirely transparent <eol> to radar. <eob>
You can do an experiment. <eob> Go home and put an ice cube <eol> in the microwave. <eob>
It won't melt, <eob> because microwaves, or radar, <eob> pass straight through the ice <eol> without interacting. <eob>
If you want to melt your ice cube, <eol> you have to get it wet, <eob> because water heats up easily <eol> in the microwave. <eob>
That's the whole principle the microw <eol>ave oven is designed around. <eob>
Radar can see water. <eob>
And radar has revealed <eol> a vast pool of liquid water <eob> hidden under my colleague Olivia, <eob> seven stories beneath her feet. <eob>
Here, she's used a pump <eob> to bring some of that water back <eol> to the ice sheet's surface. <eob>
Just six years ago, we had no idea <eol> this glacier aquifer existed. <eob>
The aquifer formed <eob> when snow melts in the summer sun <eob> and trickles downward. <eob>
It puddles up in huge pools. <eob>
From there, the snow acts <eol> as an igloo, <eob> insulating this water from the cold <eol> and the wind above. <eob>
So the water can stay hidden <eol> in the ice sheet <eob> in liquid form year after year. <eob>
The question is, what happens next? <eob>
Does the water stay there forever? <eob> It could. <eob> Or does it find a way out <eol> to reach the global ocean? <eob>
One possible way for the water <eol> to reach the bedrock <eob> and from there the ocean <eob> is a crevasse, <eol> or a crack in the ice. <eob>
When cracks fill with water, <eob> the weight of the water forces <eol> them deeper and deeper. <eob>
This is how fracking works <eob> to extract natural gas <eol> from deep within the earth. <eob> Pressurized fluids <eol> fracture rocks. <eob>
All it takes is a crack to get started. <eob>
Well, we recently discovered <eob> that there are cracks available <eol> in the Greenland ice sheet <eob> near this glacier aquifer. <eob>
You can fly over most of the Greenland <eol> ice sheet <eob> and see nothing, <eob> no cracks, no features <eol> on the surface, <eob> but as this helicopter flies <eol> towards the coast, <eob> the path that water would take <eol> on its quest to flow downhill, <eob> one crack appears, <eob> then another and another. <eob>
Are these cracks filled with liquid water? <eob>
And if so, how deep <eol> do they take that water? <eob>
Can they take it to the bedrock <eob> and the ocean? <eob>
To answer these questions, <eob> we need something beyond remote sensing data. <eob>
We need numeric models. <eob>
I write numeric models <eol> that run on supercomputers. <eob>
A numeric model is simply <eol> a set of equations <eob> that works together to describe something. <eob>
It can be as simple <eol> as the next number in a sequence -- <eob> one, three, five, seven -- <eob> or it can be a more complex <eol> set of equations <eob> that predict the future <eob> based on known conditions in the present. <eob>
In our case, what are the equations <eol> for how ice cracks? <eob>
Well, engineers already have <eol> a very good understanding <eob> of how aluminum, steel and plastics fracture under stress. <eob>
It's an important problem in our society. <eob>
And it turns out <eol> that the engineering equations <eob> for how materials fracture <eob> are not that different <eol> from my physics homework. <eob>
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice, <eob> and then I had a numeric model <eol> for how a crevasse can fracture <eob> when filled with water <eol> from the aquifer. <eob>
This is the power of math. <eob>
It can help us understand <eol> real processes in our world. <eob>
I'll show you now the results <eol> of my numeric model, <eob> but first I should point out <eob> that the crevasse is about <eol> a thousand times narrower than it is deep, <eob> so in the main panel here, <eob> we've zoomed in to better <eol> see the details. <eob>
You can look to the smaller <eol> panel on the right <eob> to see the true scale for how tall <eol> and skinny the crevasse is. <eob>
As the aquifer water flows into the crevasse, <eob> some of it refreezes <eol> in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice. <eob> That's about as cold as your kitchen <eol> freezer. <eob>
But this loss can be overcome <eob> if the flow rate in from the glacier <eol> aquifer is high enough. <eob>
In our case, it is, <eob> and the aquifer water drives <eob> the crevasse all the way to the base <eol> of the ice sheet <eob> a thousand meters below. <eob>
From there, it has a clear path <eol> to reach the ocean. <eob>
So the aquifer water is a part <eob> of the three millimeters <eol> per year of sea level rise <eob> that we experience as a global society. <eob>
But there's more: <eob> the aquifer water might be <eol> punching above its weight. <eob>
The ice flows in complex ways. <eob>
In some places, the ice flows very fast. <eob>
There tends to be water at the base <eol> of the ice sheet here. <eob>
In other places, not so fast. <eob> Usually, there's not <eol> water present at the base there. <eob>
Now that we know the aquifer water is getting <eol> to the base of the ice sheet, <eob> the next question is: <eob> Is it making the ice itself <eol> flow faster into the ocean? <eob>
We're trying to uncover these mysteries <eol> hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet <eob> so that we can better plan for the sea level <eol> rise it holds. <eob>
The amount of ice that Greenland <eol> has lost since 2002 <eob> is just a small fraction <eol> of what that ice sheet holds. <eob>
Ice sheets are immense, powerful <eol> machines that operate on long timescales. <eob>
In the next 80 years, global sea levels <eol> will rise at least 20 centimeters, <eob> perhaps as much as one meter, <eob> and maybe more. <eob>
Our understanding of future <eol> sea level rise is good, <eob> but our projections have a wide range. <eob>
It's our role as glaciologists <eol> and scientists <eob> to narrow these uncertainties. <eob>
How much sea level rise is coming, <eob> and how fast will it get here? <eob>
We need to know how much and how fast, <eob> so the world and its communities <eol> can plan for the sea level rise that's coming. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
After decades of research <eob> and billions of dollars <eol> spent in clinical trials, <eob> we still have a problem with cancer drug delivery. <eob>
We still give patients chemotherapy, <eob> which is so non-specific <eob> that even though it kills <eol> the cancer cells, <eob> it kind of kills <eol> the rest of your body, too. <eob>
And yes, we have developed <eol> more selective drugs, <eob> but it's still a challenge <eol> to get them into the tumor, <eob> and they end up accumulating <eol> in the other organs as well <eob> or passing through your urine, <eob> which is a total waste. <eob>
And fields like mine have emerged <eob> where we try to encapsulate these drugs <eob> to protect them as they travel <eol> through the body. <eob>
But these modifications cause problems <eob> that we make more modifications to fix. <eob>
So what I'm really trying to say <eol> is we need a better drug delivery system. <eob>
And I propose, <eob> rather than using solely human design, <eob> why not use nature's? <eob>
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles <eol> that travel throughout our body, <eob> patrolling for signs of disease <eob> and arriving at a wound mere minutes after injury. <eob>
So I ask you guys: <eob> If immune cells are already traveling <eol> to places of injury or disease <eob> in our bodies, <eob> why not add an extra passenger? <eob>
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs <eob> to cure some of our biggest problems <eob> in disease? <eob>
I am a biomedical engineer, <eob> and I want to tell you guys <eol> a story about how I use immune cells <eob> to target one of the largest <eol> problems in cancer. <eob>
Did you know that over 90 percent <eol> of cancer deaths <eob> can be attributed <eol> to its spread? <eob>
So if we can stop these cancer cells <eob> from going from the primary <eol> tumor to a distant site, <eob> we can stop cancer right in its tracks <eob> and give people more of their lives back. <eob>
To do this special mission, <eob> we decided to deliver a nanoparticle made <eol> of lipids, <eob> which are the same materials <eol> that compose your cell membrane. <eob>
And we've added two special molecules. <eob> One is called e-selectin, <eob> which acts as a glue <eob> that binds the nanoparticle <eol> to the immune cell. <eob> And the second one is called trail. <eob>
Trail is a therapeutic drug <eol> that kills cancer cells <eob> but not normal cells. <eob>
Now, when you put both of these together, <eob> you have a mean killing machine on wheels. <eob>
To test this, we ran <eol> an experiment in a mouse. <eob>
So what we did was we injected <eol> the nanoparticles, <eob> and they bound almost <eol> immediately to the immune cells in the bloodstream. <eob>
And then we injected the cancer cells <eol> to mimic a process <eob> through which cancer cells spread <eol> throughout our bodies. <eob>
And we found something very exciting. <eob>
We found that in our treated group, <eob> over 75 percent of the cancer cells <eol> we initially injected were dead or dying, <eob> in comparison to only around 25 percent. <eob> So just imagine: these fewer amount <eol> of cells were available <eob> to actually be able to spread <eol> to a different part of the body. <eob>
And this is only after two hours <eol> of treatment. <eob>
Our results were amazing, and we had <eol> some pretty interesting press. <eob>
My favorite title was actually, <eob> "Sticky balls may stop <eol> the spread of cancer." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I can't tell you just how smug my male colleagues were, <eob> knowing that their sticky balls <eol> might one day cure cancer. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I can tell you they made <eol> some pretty, pretty, exciting, <eob> pretty ballsy t-shirts. <eob>
This was also my first experience <eol> talking to patients <eob> where they asked how soon our therapy <eol> would be available. <eob>
And I keep these stories with me <eol> to remind me of the importance <eob> of the science, the scientists <eol> and the patients. <eob>
Now, our fast-acting results <eol> were pretty interesting, <eob> but we still had one lingering question: <eob> Can our sticky balls, <eob> our particles actually <eol> attached to the immune cells, <eob> actually stop the spread of cancer? <eob>
So we went to our animal model, <eol> and we found three important parts. <eob>
Our primary tumors were smaller <eol> in our treated animals, <eob> there were fewer cells in circulation, <eob> and there was little to no tumor burden <eol> in the distant organs. <eob>
Now, this wasn't just a victory <eol> for us and our sticky balls. <eob>
This was also a victory to me <eob> in drug delivery, <eob> and it represents a paradigm shift, <eob> a revolution -- <eob> to go from just using drugs, <eol> just injecting them <eob> and hoping they go to the right places in the body, <eob> to using immune cells as special delivery drivers in your body. <eob>
For this example, we used two molecules, <eol> e-selectin and trail, <eob> but really, the possibility of drugs <eol> you can use are endless. <eob>
And I talked about cancer, <eob> but where disease goes, so do immune cells. <eob>
So this could be used for any disease. <eob>
Imagine using immune cells to deliver crucial <eol> wound-healing agents <eob> after a spinal cord injury, <eob> or using immune cells to deliver drugs <eol> past the blood-brain barrier <eob> to treat Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. <eob>
These are the ideas that excite me <eol> about science the most. <eob>
And from where I stand, I see <eol> so much promise and opportunity. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm often asked <eob> why I do art, <eob> what do I want to say <eol> with my art photography, <eob> and what is the use of it? <eob>
Once in a while I start to worry <eob> how to actually measure <eol> the impact from the art <eob> like we do with medicine or technology, <eob> where we can see the results <eol> and calculate it. <eob>
Then I would finally be able <eol> to explain to my mother my art <eob> with real numbers. <eob>
But my art is so far from metrics, <eob> and moreover, my photography <eol> is widely exposing the theme of escapism. <eob>
My theory is that all of us <eob> struggle sometimes to escape <eob> in order to analyze our reality, <eob> appreciate it or change. <eob>
I don't work with daily life as it is, <eob> and I'm not a documentary photographer <eob> in the common sense. <eob>
But I am a documentary photographer <eob> in a different sense. <eob> I document dreams. <eob> I work with daily life as it could be, <eob> as I imagine it. <eob>
I am a daydreamer, but at the same time <eol> I love things that are authentic <eob> and deal with our innermost nature, <eob> which I would never want to escape from. <eob>
I adore complicated personalities, <eob> and real life inspires me <eol> to create my images. <eob>
Real life inspires our escape, <eob> and sometimes that escape is very needed. <eob>
I believe heroes are not created easily, <eob> and I choose to work with individuals <eob> who are survivors <eob> and facing everyday routines <eob> that are not always full of color, <eob> people who are on their way to a better life, <eob> fighting against life circumstances. <eob>
Why do I choose people <eol> like that for my models? <eob>
Because I've been in that position myself, <eob> when I had to learn how to survive in real life. <eob>
I was a student living abroad in London. <eob>
I was working at two places <eol> at the same time as a waitress. <eob>
Obviously that wasn't my dream job, <eob> but I decided to play a game <eob> where I imagined that I am taking <eol> a role in a film, <eob> and in the film I am a waitress, <eob> and I need to act great. <eob>
I used to dye my hair and brows <eol> to gingerette, <eob> I changed my hair to curly perm, <eob> I lost weight <eob> and made myself believe <eob> I am just a character acting in a film. <eob>
That isn't forever, <eob> that is all just temporary. <eob>
That helped me a lot. <eob>
It motivated me to change my life <eob> and take a hard time as a game. <eob>
Now, as an artist, <eob> I am creating different lives <eol> for my models <eob> in order to give them the experience <eol> of being someone else in reality. <eob>
Through the photographic process, <eob> all of my models become <eol> like silent movie actors. <eob>
They are captured at the moment <eob> when they believe in being <eol> someone else entirely. <eob>
In order to create a new reality <eol> in its entirety, <eob> I physically create every single <eol> thing in my work, <eob> sometimes from outfits to the stage. <eob>
Because I work with analogues, <eob> and I don't make any digital <eol> manipulations to my photographs, <eob> I need everything to take place in reality, <eob> in spite of the fact <eol> that nowadays, <eob> digitally, you can create <eol> pretty much everything. <eob>
I don't like this path. <eob>
Even if that reaches perfection, <eob> I see the beauty <eol> in authenticity of making, <eob> and that's impossible without flaws. <eob>
A digitally manipulated photograph <eob> is not true for me. <eob>
It doesn't capture anything real. <eob>
It's not experienced, not motivating. <eob>
It's like, instead of going traveling, <eob> you look at someone else's travel photographs. <eob>
What I find so exciting <eob> is the ability to make <eol> people's dreams of being someone else a reality. <eob>
That's like a drug <eob> which pushes me to keep working, <eob> even without metrics. <eob>
One of my models <eob> had always dreamed of being seen <eol> as a warrior, <eob> but she wasn't able to do sports <eol> because of her health problems. <eob>
Half a year ago, she passed away <eob> from heart disease at the age of 22. <eob>
But two days before her death, <eob> the images we spent months <eol> working on together <eob> of her as a warrior she dreamed of becoming <eob> were published at a large exhibition in Milan <eol> by Vogue Magazine. <eob>
All her life was about overcoming. <eob>
Before she died, she had known <eob> that thousands of people saw her image <eol> from the land of escapism <eob> and believed in her as a brave <eol> and fearless warrior. <eob>
For my work, I invite people <eol> to play a game <eob> like we all used to as children <eob> when we pretend to be someone else <eob> and that process made us really happy. <eob>
To my mind it is important for grown-ups. <eob>
We need these transformations <eob> to enact this in the name of art. <eob>
It gives us the very real feeling <eol> of being important and powerful <eob> in order to influence our reality. <eob>
I know this from my own <eol> personal experience. <eob>
I have had so many versions of myself <eob> through my self-portraits <eob> that I've been many different characters. <eob>
Being someone else in the land of escapism <eob> doesn't exactly give us numbers <eol> that we can gauge, <eob> but it's like a real lost form of magic <eob> which exists but can't be measured. <eob>
There is a unique power in art <eob> to transform and lift our limits. <eob>
Art creates what I call a conjured life, <eob> which helps our existence <eob> and pushes, motivates <eol> and inspires us to dwell <eob> and express ourselves <eob> without metrics or calculations. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"Can you taste words?" <eob>
It was a question <eol> that caught me by surprise. <eob>
This summer, I was giving a talk <eol> at a literary festival, <eob> and afterwards, as I was signing books, <eob> a teenage girl came with her friend, <eob> and this is what she asked me. <eob>
I told her that some people <eol> experience an overlap in their senses <eob> so that they could hear colors <eob> or see sounds, <eob> and many writers were fascinated <eol> by this subject, myself included. <eob>
But she cut me off, a bit impatiently, <eol> and said, "Yeah, I know all of that. <eob>
It's called synesthesia. <eob>
We learned it at school. <eob>
But my mom is reading your book, <eob> and she says there's lots of food <eol> and ingredients <eob> and a long dinner scene in it. <eob>
She gets hungry at every page. <eob>
So I was thinking, <eob> how come you don't get hungry <eol> when you write? <eob>
And I thought maybe, maybe <eol> you could taste words. <eob>
Does it make sense?" <eob>
And, actually, it did make sense, <eob> because ever since my childhood, <eob> each letter in the alphabet <eol> has a different color, <eob> and colors bring me flavors. <eob>
So for instance, the color purple is quite pungent, <eol> almost perfumed, <eob> and any words that I associate <eol> with purple <eob> taste the same way, <eob> such as "sunset" -- <eol> a very spicy word. <eob>
But I was worried that if I tell <eol> all of this to the teenager, <eob> it might sound either too abstract <eob> or perhaps too weird, <eob> and there wasn't enough time anyhow, <eob> because people were waiting in the queue, <eob> so it suddenly felt like what <eol> I was trying to convey <eob> was more complicated and detailed <eob> than what the circumstances allowed me to say. <eob>
And I did what I usually <eol> do in similar situations: <eob> I stammered, I shut down, <eol> and I stopped talking. <eob>
I stopped talking <eol> because the truth was complicated, <eob> even though I knew, deep within, <eob> that one should never, ever remain silent <eol> for fear of complexity. <eob>
So I want to start my talk today <eob> with the answer that I was not able <eol> to give on that day. <eob>
Yes, I can taste words -- <eob> sometimes, that is, not always, <eob> and happy words have a different <eol> flavor than sad words. <eob>
I like to explore: What does the word "creativity" taste like, <eob> or "equality," <eob> "love," "revolution?" <eob>
And what about "motherland?" <eob> These days, it's particularly this last <eol> word that troubles me. <eob>
It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue, <eob> like cinnamon, a bit of rose water <eob> and golden apples. <eob>
But underneath, there's a sharp tang, <eob> like nettles and dandelion. <eob>
The taste of my motherland, Turkey, <eob> is a mixture of sweet and bitter. <eob>
And the reason why <eol> I'm telling you this <eob> is because I think there's more <eol> and more people <eob> all around the world today <eob> who have similarly mixed emotions <eob> about the lands <eol> they come from. <eob>
We love our native countries, yeah? <eob> How can we not? <eob> We feel attached to the people, <eol> the culture, the land, the food. <eob>
And yet at the same time, <eob> we feel increasingly frustrated <eol> by its politics and politicians, <eob> sometimes to the point of despair <eol> or hurt or anger. <eob>
I want to talk about emotions <eob> and the need to boost <eol> our emotional intelligence. <eob>
I think it's a pity <eob> that mainstream political theory <eol> pays very little attention to emotions. <eob>
Oftentimes, analysts and experts <eol> are so busy with data and metrics <eob> that they seem to forget <eol> those things in life <eob> that are difficult to measure <eob> and perhaps impossible to cluster <eol> under statistical models. <eob>
But I think this is a mistake, <eol> for two main reasons. <eob>
Firstly, because we are emotional beings. <eob>
As human beings, I think <eol> we all are like that. <eob>
But secondly, and this is new, <eob> we have entered a new stage <eol> in world history <eob> in which collective sentiments <eol> guide and misguide politics <eob> more than ever before. <eob>
And through social media <eol> and social networking, <eob> these sentiments <eol> are further amplified, <eob> polarized, and they travel <eol> around the world quite fast. <eob>
Ours is the age of anxiety, anger, <eob> distrust, resentment <eob> and, I think, lots of fear. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> even though there's plenty of research <eol> about economic factors, <eob> there's relatively few studies <eol> about emotional factors. <eob>
Why is it that we underestimate <eol> feelings and perceptions? <eob>
I think it's going to be one <eol> of our biggest intellectual challenges, <eob> because our political systems <eol> are replete with emotions. <eob>
In country after country, <eob> we have seen illiberal politicians <eol> exploiting these emotions. <eob>
And yet within the academia <eol> and among the intelligentsia, <eob> we are yet to take emotions seriously. <eob>
I think we should. <eob>
And just like we should focus <eol> on economic inequality worldwide, <eob> we need to pay more attention <eol> to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide <eob> and how to bridge these gaps, <eob> because they do matter. <eob>
Years ago, when I was still <eol> living in Istanbul, <eob> an American scholar working on women <eol> writers in the Middle East <eob> came to see me. <eob>
And at some point <eol> in our exchange, she said, <eob> "I understand why you're a feminist, <eob> because, you know, you live in Turkey." <eob> And I said to her, <eob> "I don't understand why <eol> you're not a feminist, <eob> because, you know, you live in America." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> And she laughed. <eob>
She took it as a joke, <eob> and the moment passed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the way she had divided the world <eol> into two imaginary camps, <eob> into two opposite camps -- <eob> it bothered me and it stayed with me. <eob>
According to this imaginary map, <eob> some parts of the world <eol> were liquid countries. <eob> They were like choppy waters <eol> not yet settled. <eob>
Some other parts of the world, <eol> namely the West, <eob> were solid, safe and stable. <eob>
So it was the liquid lands <eol> that needed feminism <eob> and activism and human rights, <eob> and those of us <eol> who were unfortunate enough <eob> to come from such places <eob> had to keep struggling <eol> for these most essential values. <eob>
But there was hope. <eob>
Since history moved forward, <eob> even the most unsteady lands <eol> would someday catch up. <eob>
And meanwhile, the citizens <eol> of solid lands <eob> could take comfort in the progress <eol> of history <eob> and in the triumph of the liberal order. <eob>
They could support the struggles <eol> of other people elsewhere, <eob> but they themselves did not have to struggle <eob> for the basics of democracy anymore, <eob> because they were beyond that stage. <eob>
I think in the year 2016, <eob> this hierarchical geography <eol> was shattered to pieces. <eob>
Our world no longer follows <eol> this dualistic pattern <eob> in the scholar's mind, if it ever did. <eob>
Now we know that history <eol> does not necessarily move forward. <eob>
Sometimes it draws circles, <eob> even slides backwards, <eob> and that generations can make <eol> the same mistakes <eob> that their great-grandfathers <eol> had made. <eob>
And now we know <eol> that there's no such thing <eob> as solid countries versus liquid countries. <eob>
In fact, we are all living in liquid times, <eob> just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us. <eob>
And Bauman had another <eol> definition for our age. <eob>
He used to say we are all going <eol> to be walking on moving sands. <eob>
And if that's the case, I think, <eob> it should concern us women more than men, <eob> because when societies slide backwards <eol> into authoritarianism, <eob> nationalism or religious fanaticism, <eob> women have much more to lose. <eob>
That is why this needs <eol> to be a vital moment, <eob> not only for global activism, <eob> but in my opinion, <eol> for global sisterhood as well. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But I want to make a little confession <eol> before I go any further. <eob>
Until recently, whenever I took part <eol> in an international conference or festival, <eob> I would be usually one of the more depressed speakers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Having seen how our dreams of democracy <eol> and how our dreams of coexistence <eob> were crushed in Turkey, <eob> both gradually but also with a bewildering speed, <eob> over the years I've felt quite demoralized. <eob>
And at these festivals there <eol> would be some other gloomy writers, <eob> and they would come from places <eol> such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, <eob> Bangladesh, Philippines, China, Venezuela, Russia. <eob>
And we would smile at each other <eol> in sympathy, <eob> this camaraderie of the doomed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you could call us WADWIC: <eob> Worried and Depressed <eol> Writers International Club. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But then things began to change, <eob> and suddenly our club became more popular, <eob> and we started to have new members. <eob> I remember -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I remember Greek writers and poets <eol> joined first, came on board. <eob>
And then writers from Hungary and Poland, <eob> and then, interestingly, <eol> writers from Austria, the Netherlands, France, <eob> and then writers from the UK, <eol> where I live and where I call my home, <eob> and then writers from the USA. <eob>
Suddenly, there were more of us <eob> feeling worried <eol> about the fate of our nations <eob> and the future of the world. <eob>
And maybe there were more of us now <eob> feeling like strangers <eol> in our own motherlands. <eob>
And then this bizarre thing happened. <eob>
Those of us who used to be <eol> very depressed for a long time, <eob> we started to feel less depressed, <eob> whereas the newcomers, <eol> they were so not used to feeling this way <eob> that they were now even more depressed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you could see writers <eol> from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt <eob> trying to console their colleagues <eob> from Brexit Britain <eol> or from post-election USA. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But joking aside, <eob> I think our world <eol> is full of unprecedented challenges, <eob> and this comes with an emotional backlash, <eob> because in the face <eol> of high-speed change, <eob> many people wish to slow down, <eob> and when there's too much unfamiliarity, <eob> people long for the familiar. <eob>
And when things get too confusing, <eob> many people crave simplicity. <eob>
This is a very dangerous crossroads, <eob> because it's exactly where the demag <eol>ogue enters into the picture. <eob>
The demagogue understands how collective <eol> sentiments work <eob> and how he -- it's usually a he -- <eol> can benefit from them. <eob>
He tells us that we all belong <eol> in our tribes, <eob> and he tells us that we will be safer <eol> if we are surrounded by sameness. <eob>
Demagogues come <eol> in all sizes and in all shapes. <eob>
This could be the eccentric leader <eol> of a marginal political party <eob> somewhere in Europe, <eob> or an Islamist extremist imam preaching <eol> dogma and hatred, <eob> or it could be a white supremacist Nazi-admiring <eol> orator somewhere else. <eob>
All these figures, at first glance -- <eol> they seem disconnected. <eob>
But I think they feed each other, <eob> and they need each other. <eob>
And all around the world, <eob> when we look at how demagogues talk <eol> and how they inspire movements, <eob> I think they have one unmistakable quality in common: <eob> they strongly, strongly dislike plurality. <eob>
They cannot deal with multiplicity. <eob>
Adorno used to say, <eob> "Intolerance of ambiguity <eol> is the sign of an authoritarian personality." <eob> But I ask myself: <eob> What if that same sign, <eob> that same intolerance <eol> of ambiguity -- <eob> what if it's the mark of our times, <eol> of the age we're living in? <eob>
Because wherever I look, <eol> I see nuances withering away. <eob>
On TV shows, we have <eol> one anti-something speaker <eob> situated against a pro-something speaker. <eob> Yeah? It's good ratings. <eob>
It's even better <eol> if they shout at each other. <eob>
Even in academia, where our intellect is supposed to be nourished, <eob> you see one atheist scholar <eol> competing with a firmly theist scholar, <eob> but it's not a real intellectual exchange, <eob> because it's a clash between two certainties. <eob>
I think binary oppositions are everywhere. <eob>
So slowly and systematically, <eob> we are being denied the right <eol> to be complex. <eob>
Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels, <eob> Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona: <eob> we have seen one horrible terror attack <eol> after another. <eob>
And when you express your sorrow, <eol> and when you react against the cruelty, <eob> you get all kinds of reactions, <eob> messages on social media. <eob>
But one of them is quite disturbing, <eob> only because it's so widespread. <eob> They say, "Why do you feel sorry for them? <eob>
Why do you feel sorry for them? <eob>
Why don't you feel sorry <eol> for civilians in Yemen <eob> or civilians in Syria?" <eob>
And I think the people <eol> who write such messages <eob> do not understand <eob> that we can feel sorry <eol> for and stand in solidarity with <eob> victims of terrorism and violence <eol> in the Middle East, in Europe, <eob> in Asia, in America, <eol> wherever, everywhere, <eob> equally and simultaneously. <eob>
They don't seem to understand <eol> that we don't have to pick one pain <eob> and one place over all others. <eob>
But I think this is what tribalism <eol> does to us. <eob>
It shrinks our minds, for sure, <eob> but it also shrinks our hearts, <eob> to such an extent that we become numb <eol> to the suffering of other people. <eob>
And the sad truth is, <eol> we weren't always like this. <eob>
I had a children's book <eol> out in Turkey, <eob> and when the book was published, <eol> I did lots of events. <eob>
I went to many primary schools, <eob> which gave me a chance <eol> to observe younger kids in Turkey. <eob>
And it was always amazing to see <eol> how much empathy, imagination <eob> and chutzpah they have. <eob>
These children are much more <eol> inclined to become global citizens <eob> than nationalists at that age. <eob>
And it's wonderful to see, <eol> when you ask them, <eob> so many of them want to be poets and writers, <eob> and girls are just as confident as boys, <eob> if not even more. <eob>
But then I would go to high schools, <eob> and everything has changed. <eob>
Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore, <eob> now nobody wants <eol> to be a novelist anymore, <eob> and girls have become timid, <eob> they are cautious, guarded, <eob> reluctant to speak up in the public space, <eob> because we have taught them -- <eob> the family, the school, the society -- <eob> we have taught them to erase <eol> their individuality. <eob>
I think East and West, <eob> we are losing multiplicity, <eob> both within our societies <eol> and within ourselves. <eob>
And coming from Turkey, I do know <eol> that the loss of diversity <eob> is a major, major loss. <eob>
Today, my motherland became <eol> the world's biggest jailer <eob> for journalists, <eob> surpassing even China's sad record. <eob>
And I also believe that what happened <eol> over there in Turkey <eob> can happen anywhere. <eob> It can even happen here. <eob>
So just like solid countries <eol> was an illusion, <eob> singular identities is also an illusion, <eob> because we all have a multiplicity <eol> of voices inside. <eob>
The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz, <eob> used to say, "You carry in your soul <eol> every ingredient necessary <eob> to turn your existence into joy. <eob>
All you have to do is to mix <eol> those ingredients." <eob>
And I think mix we can. <eob>
I am an Istanbulite, <eob> but I'm also attached to the Balkans, <eob> the Aegean, the Mediterranean, <eob> the Middle East, the Levant. <eob>
I am a European by birth, by choice, <eob> the values that I uphold. <eob>
I have become a Londoner over the years. <eob>
I would like to think of myself <eol> as a global soul, as a world citizen, <eob> a nomad and an itinerant storyteller. <eob>
I have multiple attachments, <eol> just like all of us do. <eob>
And multiple attachments mean <eol> multiple stories. <eob>
As writers, we always <eol> chase stories, of course, <eob> but I think we are also interested <eol> in silences, <eob> the things we cannot talk about, <eob> political taboos, cultural taboos. <eob>
We're also interested in our own silences. <eob>
I have always been very vocal <eol> about and written extensively <eob> about minority rights, women's rights, <eob> LGBT rights. <eob>
But as I was thinking about this TED Talk, <eob> I realized one thing: <eob> I have never had the courage <eol> to say in a public space <eob> that I was bisexual myself, <eob> because I so feared the slander <eob> and the stigma <eol> and the ridicule <eob> and the hatred that was sure to follow. <eob>
But of course, one should never, <eol> ever, remain silent <eob> for fear of complexity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And although I am no stranger <eol> to anxieties, <eob> and although I am talking <eol> here about the power of emotions -- <eob> I do know the power of emotions -- <eob> I have discovered over time <eob> that emotions are not limitless. <eob> You know? They have a limit. <eob>
There comes a moment -- <eob> it's like a tipping point <eol> or a threshold -- <eob> when you get tired of feeling afraid, <eob> when you get tired of feeling anxious. <eob>
And I think not only individuals, <eob> but perhaps nations, too, <eol> have their own tipping points. <eob>
So even stronger than my emotions <eob> is my awareness <eob> that not only gender, not only identity, <eob> but life itself is fluid. <eob>
They want to divide us into tribes, <eob> but we are connected across borders. <eob>
They preach certainty, <eob> but we know that life has plenty of magic <eob> and plenty of ambiguity. <eob>
And they like to incite dualities, <eob> but we are far more nuanced than that. <eob>
So what can we do? <eob> I think we need to go back to the basics, <eob> back to the colors of the alphabet. <eob>
The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran used to say, <eob> "I learned silence from the talkative <eob> and tolerance from the intolerant <eob> and kindness from the unkind." <eob> I think it's a great motto for our times. <eob>
So from populist demagogues, <eol> we will learn <eob> the indispensability of democracy. <eob> And from isolationists, <eol> we will learn the need for global solidarity. <eob> And from tribalists, we will learn <eol> the beauty of cosmopolitanism <eob> and the beauty of diversity. <eob>
As I finish, I want to leave you <eol> with one word, or one taste. <eob>
The word "yurt" <eol> in Turkish means "motherland." <eob> It means "homeland." <eob> But interestingly, the word also means <eob> "a tent used by nomadic tribes." <eob> And I like that combination, <eol> because it makes me think <eob> homelands do not need <eol> to be rooted in one place. <eob>
They can be portable. <eob> We can take them with us everywhere. <eob>
And I think for writers, for storytellers, <eob> at the end of the day, <eob> there is one main homeland, <eob> and it's called "Storyland." <eob> And the taste of that word <eob> is the taste of freedom. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, Hegel -- he very famously said <eob> that Africa was a place without history, <eob> without past, without narrative. <eob>
Yet, I'd argue that no other continent <eol> has nurtured, has fought for, <eob> has celebrated its history more concertedly. <eob>
The struggle to keep African narrative alive <eob> has been one of the most consistent <eob> and hard-fought endeavors <eol> of African peoples, <eob> and it continues to be so. <eob>
The struggles endured <eol> and the sacrifices made to hold onto narrative <eob> in the face of enslavement, colonialism, racism, wars and so much else <eob> has been the underpinning narrative <eob> of our history. <eob>
And our narrative has not <eol> just survived the assaults <eob> that history has thrown at it. <eob>
We've left a body of material culture, <eob> artistic magistery and intellectual <eol> output. <eob>
We've mapped and we've charted <eol> and we've captured our histories <eob> in ways that are the measure <eol> of anywhere else on earth. <eob>
Long before the meaningful <eol> arrival of Europeans -- <eob> indeed, whilst Europe was still mired <eol> in its Dark Age -- <eob> Africans were pioneering techniques <eol> in recording, in nurturing history, <eob> forging revolutionary methods <eol> for keeping their story alive. <eob>
And living history, dynamic heritage -- <eob> it remains important to us. <eob>
We see that manifest in so many ways. <eob>
I'm reminded of how, just last year -- <eol> you might remember it -- <eob> the first members <eob> of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine <eob> were indicted for war crimes <eol> and sent to the Hague. <eob> And one of the most notorious <eol> was Ahmad al-Faqi, <eob> who was a young Malian, <eob> and he was charged, not with genocide, <eob> not with ethnic cleansing, <eob> but with being one of the instigators <eol> of a campaign <eob> to destroy some of Mali's most important cultural heritage. <eob>
This wasn't vandalism; <eob> these weren't thoughtless acts. <eob>
One of the things <eol> that al-Faqi said <eob> when he was asked <eol> to identify himself in court <eob> was that he was a graduate, <eol> that he was a teacher. <eob>
Over the course of 2012, <eol> they engaged in a systematic campaign <eob> to destroy Mali's cultural heritage. <eob>
This was a deeply considered <eol> waging of war <eob> in the most powerful way <eol> that could be envisaged: <eob> in destroying narrative, in destroying stories. <eob>
The attempted destruction of nine shrines, <eob> the central mosque <eob> and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts <eob> was a considered act. <eob>
They understood the power <eol> of narrative to hold communities together, <eob> and they conversely understood <eol> that in destroying stories, <eob> they hoped they would destroy a people. <eob>
But just as Ansar Dine <eol> and their insurgency <eob> were driven by powerful narratives, <eob> so was the local population's defense of Timbuktu and its libraries. <eob>
These were communities who've grown up <eol> with stories of the Mali Empire; <eob> lived in the shadow <eol> of Timbuktu's great libraries. <eob>
They'd listened to songs <eol> of its origin from their childhood, <eob> and they weren't about <eol> to give up on that <eob> without a fight. <eob>
Over difficult months of 2012, <eob> during the Ansar Dine invasion, <eob> Malians, ordinary people, <eol> risked their lives <eob> to secrete and smuggle documents to safety, <eob> doing what they could to protect <eol> historic buildings <eob> and defend their ancient libraries. <eob>
And although they weren't always successful, <eob> many of the most important <eol> manuscripts were thankfully saved, <eob> and today each one of the shrines <eol> that was damaged during that uprising <eob> have been rebuilt, <eob> including the 14th-century mosque <eol> that is the symbolic heart of the city. <eob>
It's been fully restored. <eob>
But even in the bleakest periods <eol> of the occupation, <eob> enough of the population <eol> of Timbuktu simply would not bow <eob> to men like al-Faqi. <eob>
They wouldn't allow their history <eol> to be wiped away, <eob> and anyone who has visited <eol> that part of the world, <eob> they will understand why, <eob> why stories, why narrative, <eol> why histories are of such importance. <eob> History matters. <eob> History really matters. <eob> And for peoples of African descent, <eob> who have seen their narrative <eol> systematically assaulted over centuries, <eob> this is critically important. <eob>
This is part of a recurrent echo <eol> across our history <eob> of ordinary people making a stand <eol> for their story, for their history. <eob>
Just as in the 19th century, <eob> enslaved peoples <eol> of African descent in the Caribbean <eob> fought under threat of punishment, <eob> fought to practice their religions, <eol> to celebrate Carnival, <eob> to keep their history alive. <eob>
Ordinary people were prepared <eol> to make great sacrifices, <eob> some even the ultimate sacrifice, <eob> for their history. <eob>
And it was through control of narrative <eob> that some of the most devastating <eol> colonial campaigns were crystallized. <eob>
It was through the dominance <eol> of one narrative over another <eob> that the worst manifestations <eol> of colonialism became palpable. <eob>
When, in 1874, <eol> the British attacked the Ashanti, <eob> they overran Kumasi <eol> and captured the Asantehene. <eob>
They knew that controlling territory <eol> and subjugating the head of state -- <eob> it wasn't enough. <eob>
They recognized that the emotional <eol> authority of state <eob> lay in its narrative <eob> and the symbols that represented it, <eob> like the Golden Stool. <eob>
They understood that control of story <eol> was absolutely critical <eob> to truly controlling a people. <eob>
And the Ashanti understood, too, <eob> and they never were to relinquish <eol> the precious Golden Stool, <eob> never to completely capitulate to the British. <eob> Narrative matters. <eob>
In 1871, Karl Mauch, <eol> a German geologist working in Southern Africa, <eob> he stumbled across an extraordinary complex, <eob> a complex of abandoned stone buildings. <eob>
And he never quite recovered <eol> from what he saw: <eob> a granite, drystone city, <eob> stranded on an outcrop above <eol> an empty savannah: <eob> Great Zimbabwe. <eob>
And Mauch had no idea <eol> who was responsible <eob> for what was obviously <eol> an astonishing feat of architecture, <eob> but he felt sure of one single thing: <eob> this narrative needed to be claimed. <eob>
He later wrote <eol> that the wrought architecture of <eob> Great Zimbabwe <eob> was simply too sophisticated, <eob> too special to have been built <eol> by Africans. <eob>
Mauch, like dozens of Europeans <eol> that followed in his footsteps, <eob> speculated on who might have built the city. <eob>
And one went as far as to posit, <eob> "I do not think that I am far wrong <eol> if I suppose that that ruin on the hill <eob> is a copy of King Solomon's Temple." <eob> And as I'm sure you know, Mauch, <eob> he hadn't stumbled upon King Solomon's Temple, <eob> but upon a purely African complex of buildings <eob> constructed by a purely African civilization <eob> from the 11th century onward. <eob>
But like Leo Frobenius, <eol> a fellow German anthropologist <eob> who speculated some years later, <eob> upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads <eol> for the very first time, <eob> that they must have been artifacts <eol> from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis. <eob> He felt, just like Hegel, <eob> an almost instinctive need <eol> to rob Africa of its history. <eob>
These ideas are so irrational, <eob> so deeply held, <eob> that even when faced <eol> with the physical archaeology, <eob> they couldn't think rationally. <eob>
They could no longer see. <eob>
And like so much of Africa's relationship <eol> with Enlightenment Europe, <eob> it involved appropriation, denigration <eol> and control of the continent. <eob>
It involved an attempt to bend <eol> narrative to Europe's ends. <eob>
And if Mauch had really <eol> wanted to find an answer to his question, <eob> "Where did <eob> Great Zimbabwe <eob> or that great stone building come from?" <eob> he would have needed to begin his quest <eob> a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe, <eob> at the eastern edge of the continent, <eol> where Africa meets the Indian Ocean. <eob>
He would have needed to trace <eol> the gold and the goods <eob> from some of the great trading <eol> emporia of the Swahili coast to <eob> Great Zimbabwe, <eob> to gain a sense of the scale <eol> and influence <eob> of that mysterious culture, <eob> to get a picture of Great Zimbabwe <eol> as a political, cultural entity <eob> through the kingdoms and the civilizations <eob> that were drawn under its control. <eob>
For centuries, traders have been drawn <eol> to that bit of the coast <eob> from as far away as India and China <eol> and the Middle East. <eob>
And it might be tempting to interpret, <eob> because it's exquisitely <eol> beautiful, that building, <eob> it might be tempting to interpret it <eob> as just an exquisite, symbolic jewel, <eob> a vast ceremonial sculpture in stone. <eob>
But the site must have been a complex <eob> at the center of a significant <eol> nexus of economies <eob> that defined this region for a millennium. <eob>
This matters. <eob> These narratives matter. <eob> Even today, the fight to tell <eol> our story is not just against time. <eob>
It's not just against organizations <eol> like Ansar Dine. <eob>
It's also in establishing <eol> a truly African voice <eob> after centuries <eol> of imposed histories. <eob>
We don't just have to recolonize our history, <eob> but we have to find ways to build <eol> back the intellectual underpinning <eob> that Hegel denied was there at all. <eob>
We have to rediscover African philosophy, <eob> African perspectives, African history. <eob>
The flowering of <eob> Great Zimbabwe <eob> — it wasn't a freak moment. <eob>
It was part of a burgeoning change <eol> across the whole of the continent. <eob>
Perhaps the great exemplification <eol> of that was Sundiata Keita, <eob> the founder of the Mali Empire, <eob> probably the greatest empire <eol> that West Africa has ever seen. <eob>
Sundiata Keita was born about 1235, <eob> growing up in a time of profound flux. <eob>
He was seeing the transition <eol> between the Berber dynasties to the north, <eob> he may have heard about the rise <eol> of the Ife to the south <eob> and perhaps even the dominance of the Solomaic Dynasty <eob> in Ethiopia to the east. <eob>
And he must have been aware <eol> that he was living through a moment <eob> of quickening change, <eob> of growing confidence in our continent. <eob>
He must have been aware of new states <eob> that were building their influence <eob> from as far afield as <eob> Great Zimbabwe <eob> and the Swahili sultanates, <eob> each engaged directly or indirectly <eol> beyond the continent itself, <eob> each driven also to invest in securing <eol> their intellectual and cultural legacy. <eob>
He probably would have engaged <eol> in trade with these peer nations <eob> as part of a massive continental nexus <eob> of great medieval African economies. <eob>
And like all of those great empires, <eob> Sundiata Keita invested <eol> in securing his legacy through history <eob> by using story -- <eob> not just formalizing <eol> the idea of storytelling, <eob> but in building a whole convention <eob> of telling and retelling his story <eob> as a key to founding a narrative <eob> for his empire. <eob>
And these stories, in musical form, <eob> are still sung today. <eob>
Now, several decades <eol> after the death of Sundiata, <eob> a new king ascended the throne, <eob> Mansa Musa, its most famous emperor. <eob>
Now, Mansa Musa is famed <eol> for his vast gold reserves <eob> and for sending envoys to the courts <eol> of Europe and the Middle East. <eob>
He was every bit <eol> as ambitious as his predecessors, <eob> but saw a different kind of route <eol> of securing his place in history. <eob>
In 1324, Mansa Musa went on pilgrimage to Mecca, <eob> and he traveled with a retinue of thousands. <eob>
It's been said that 100 camels <eol> each carried 100 pounds of gold. <eob>
It's been recorded that he built <eol> a fully functioning mosque <eob> every Friday of his trip, <eob> and performed so many acts of kindness, <eob> that the great Berber chronicler, <eol> Ibn Battuta, wrote, <eob> "He flooded Cairo with kindness, <eob> spending so much in the markets <eol> of North Africa and the Middle East <eob> that it affected the price of gold <eol> into the next decade." <eob>
And on his return, <eob> Mansa Musa memorialized his journey <eob> by building a mosque <eol> at the heart of his empire. <eob>
And the legacy of what he left behind, <eob> Timbuktu, <eob> it represents one of the great bodies <eol> of written historical material <eob> produced by African scholars: <eob> about 700,000 medieval documents, <eob> ranging from scholarly works to letters, <eob> which have been preserved often <eol> by private households. <eob>
And at its peak, in the 15th <eol> and 16th centuries, <eob> the university there was as influential <eob> as any educational establishment in Europe, <eob> attracting about 25,000 students. <eob>
This was in a city of around <eol> 100,000 people. <eob>
It cemented Timbuktu <eol> as a world center of learning. <eob>
But this was a very particular kind of learning <eob> that was focused and driven by Islam. <eob>
And since I first visited <eob> Timbuktu, <eob> I've visited many other libraries across Africa, <eob> and despite Hegel's view <eol> that Africa has no history, <eob> not only is it a continent <eol> with an embarrassment of history, <eob> it has developed unrivaled systems <eol> for collecting and promoting it. <eob>
There are thousands of small archives, <eob> textile drum stores, <eob> that have become more than repositories <eol> of manuscripts and material culture. <eob>
They have become fonts <eol> of communal narrative, <eob> symbols of continuity, <eob> and I'm pretty sure that many <eol> of those European philosophers <eob> who questioned an African intellectual tradition <eob> must have, beneath their prejudices, <eob> been aware of the contribution <eol> of Africa's intellectuals <eob> to Western learning. <eob>
They must have known <eob> of the great North <eol> African medieval philosophers <eob> who had driven the Mediterranean. <eob>
They must have known <eob> about and been aware of <eob> that tradition that is part of Christianity, <eol> of the three wise men. <eob>
And in the medieval period, <eol> Balthazar, that third wise man, <eob> was represented as an African king. <eob>
And he became hugely popular <eob> as the third intellectual <eol> leg of Old World learning, <eob> alongside Europe and Asia, as a peer. <eob>
These things were well-known. <eob> These communities did not grow up <eol> in isolation. <eob>
Timbuktu's wealth and power <eol> developed because the city became <eob> a hub of lucrative <eol> intercontinental trade routes. <eob>
This was one center <eob> in a borderless, transcontinental, <eob> ambitious, outwardly focused, <eol> confident continent. <eob>
Berber merchants, they carried <eol> salt and textiles <eob> and new precious goods and learning <eol> down into West Africa <eob> from across the desert. <eob>
But as you can see from this map <eob> that was produced a little time <eol> after the life of Mansa Musa, <eob> there was also a nexus <eol> of sub-Saharan trade routes, <eob> along which African ideas and traditions <eob> added to the intellectual worth of Timbuktu <eob> and indeed across the desert to Europe. <eob>
symbols of continuity, <eob> Manuscripts and material culture, <eob> they have become fonts <eol> of communal narrative, <eob>
And I'm pretty sure that those <eol> European intellectuals <eob> who cast aspersions on our history, <eob> they knew fundamentally about our traditions. <eob>
And today, as strident forces <eol> like Ansar Dine and Boko Haram <eob> grow popular in West Africa, <eob> it's that spirit <eol> of truly indigenous, dynamic, intellectual defiance <eob> that holds ancient traditions <eol> in good stead. <eob>
When Mansa Musa made Timbuktu his capital, <eob> he looked upon the city as a Medici looked upon Florence: <eob> as the center of an open, <eol> intellectual, entrepreneurial empire <eob> that thrived on great ideas <eol> wherever they came from. <eob>
The city, the culture, <eob> the very intellectual DNA <eol> of this region <eob> remains so beautifully complex <eol> and diverse, <eob> that it will always remain, in part, <eob> located in storytelling traditions <eol> that derive from indigenous, <eob> pre-Islamic traditions. <eob>
The highly successful form of Islam <eol> that developed in Mali became popular <eob> because it accepted those freedoms <eob> and that inherent cultural diversity. <eob>
And the celebration of that complexity, <eob> that love of rigorously contested discourse, <eob> that appreciation of narrative, <eob> was and remains, in spite of everything, <eob> the very heart of West Africa. <eob>
have been rebuilt, <eob> And today, as the shrines <eol> and the mosque vandalized by Ansar Dine <eob> many of the instigators <eol> of their destruction have been jailed. <eob>
And we are left with powerful lessons, <eob> reminded once again of how <eol> our history and narrative <eob> have held communities <eol> together for millennia, <eob> how they remain vital <eol> in making sense of modern Africa. <eob>
And we're also reminded <eob> of how the roots of this confident, <eol> intellectual, entrepreneurial, <eob> outward-facing, culturally porous, tariff-free Africa <eob> was once the envy of the world. <eob>
But those roots, they remain. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I recognized the roles <eol> that were placed on me very early. <eob>
One persistent concept that I observed -- <eob> existing in our language, in our media -- <eob> was that women are not <eol> only supposed to have children, <eob> they are supposed to want to. <eob> This existed everywhere. <eob> It existed in the ways <eol> that adults spoke to me <eob> when they posed questions in the context <eol> of "when." <eob> "When you get married ..." <eob> "When you have kids ..." <eob> And these future musings were always presented to me <eob> like part of this American dream, <eob> but it always felt to me like someone else's dream. <eob>
You see, a value <eol> that I have always understood about myself <eob> was that I never wanted children. <eob>
And as a kid, when I would try <eol> to explain this, <eob> this disconnect between their roles <eol> and my values, <eob> they often laughed <eob> in the way that adults do <eol> at the absurdities of children. <eob>
And they would tell me knowingly, <eob> "You'll change your mind." <eob>
And people have been saying things <eol> like that to me my whole life. <eob>
Otherwise polite conversation <eol> can turn intrusive fast. <eob> "Does your husband know?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Do your parents know?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> "Don't you want a family?" <eob> "Don't you want to leave anything behind?" <eob> And the primary buzzword <eol> when discussing childlessness, <eob> "That's selfish." <eob>
There are countless reasons a woman may have <eob> for choosing to abstain from motherhood, <eob> the majority of them not self-prioritizing. <eob>
But it is still socially acceptable <eol> to publicly vilify women as such, <eob> because none of these reasons <eol> have made it into the social narrative. <eob>
When I was little and learning <eol> about the inevitability of maternity, <eob> it was never explained to me <eob> the commonness of these factors <eol> that women consider, <eob> like the risk of passing on hereditary illness, <eob> the danger of having <eol> to stop life-saving medication <eob> for the duration of your pregnancy, <eob> concern about overpopulation, <eob> your access to resources, <eob> and the fact that there are 415,000 children <eob> in the foster-care system <eol> in the United States at any given time. <eob>
Reasons like these, many more, <eob> and the fact that I don't like to leave things <eol> of this magnitude to chance, <eob> all informed my decision <eob> to become surgically sterilized. <eob>
I began my research eagerly. <eob>
I wanted to fully understand <eob> all that was going to come <eol> with undergoing a tubal ligation, <eob> which is just another word <eol> for getting your tubes tied. <eob>
I wanted to know approval to aftermath, <eob> satisfaction rates, risks, statistics. <eob>
And at first, I was empowered. <eob>
You see, the way the narrative <eol> has always been taught to me, <eob> I would have thought that women <eol> who didn't want children were so rare, <eob> and then I learned one <eol> in five American women <eob> won't be having a biological child -- <eob> some by choice, some by chance. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But I was not alone. <eob>
But the more I read, <eol> the more disheartened I became. <eob>
I read women's stories, <eob> trying desperately to get this procedure. <eob>
I learned how common it was <eol> for women to exhaust their finances <eob> appealing to dozens of ob-gyns over many years, <eob> only to be turned down so many times, <eob> often with such blatant disrespect <eol> that they just gave up. <eob>
Women reported that medical practitioners were often condescending <eob> and dismissive of their motivations, <eob> being told things like, <eob> "Come back when you're married with a child." <eob> But women who did have children, who went to go get this procedure, <eob> were told they were too young, <eob> or they didn't have enough children, <eob> which is very interesting, <eob> because the legal requirements in my state for getting this kind of surgery were, <eob> "Be at least 21 years old," <eob> "appear of sound mind, acting of your own accord," <eob> and "have a 30-day waiting period." <eob> And I was perplexed that I could meet all of these legal requirements <eob> and still have to face a battle in the exam room <eob> for my bodily autonomy. <eob>
And it was daunting, <eob> but I was determined. <eob>
I remember I dressed so professionally <eol> to that first appointment. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I sat up straight. <eob> I spoke clearly. <eob> I wanted to give that doctor <eol> every piece of evidence <eob> that I was not the date of birth <eol> in that file. <eob>
And I made sure to mention things like, <eob> "I just got my bachelor's degree <eob> and I'm applying to these doctoral programs, <eob> I'm going to study these things." <eob> And "my long-term partner <eol> has this kind of business," <eob> and "I've done research on this for months. <eob>
I understand everything about it, all the risks. <eob> "Because I needed the doctor <eol> to know that this was not a whim, <eob> not reactionary, <eob> not your 20-something looking <eol> to go out and party <eob> without fear of getting knocked up... (Laughter) <eob> that this supported something integral <eol> to who I was. <eob>
And I understand informed consent, <eob> so I fully expected to be reeducated <eol> on how it all worked, but ... <eob> At one point, the information being given to me <eol> started to feel agenda'd, <eob> interlaced with bias <eol> and inflated statistics. <eob>
The questions began to feel interrogative. <eob>
At first they were asking me questions <eob> that seemed to understand <eol> my situation better, <eob> and then it seemed like they were asking questions <eol> to try to trip me up. <eob>
I felt like I was on the witness <eol> stand, being cross-examined. <eob>
The doctor asked me about my partner. <eob> "How does he or she feel <eol> about all of this?" <eob> "Well, I've been with the same man for five years, <eob> and he fully supports any decision <eol> I make for my body." <eob> And he said, "Well, what happens in the future, <eob> if you change partners? <eob>
What happens when that person wants children?" <eob> And I didn't quite know <eol> how to react to that, <eob> because what I was hearing <eob> was this doctor tell me <eol> that I'm supposed to disregard everything I believe <eob> if a partner demands children. <eob>
So I told him not to worry about that. <eob>
My stance on childbearing <eol> has always been first date conversation. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He then asks me to consider <eob> how "in 20 years, <eol> you could really come to regret this" ... <eob> as though I hadn't. <eob>
I told him, <eob> "OK, if I wake up one day <eob> and realize, you know, <eob> I wish I'd made a different decision back then, <eob> the truth is, I'd only removed a single <eol> path to parenthood. <eob>
I never needed biology <eol> to form family anyway." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I would much rather deal with that any day <eob> than deal with one day waking up, <eob> realize I'd had a child <eob> that I didn't really want <eol> or was prepared to care for. <eob>
Because one of these affects only me. <eob>
The other affects a child, <eob> their development, their well-being -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
and human beings are not <eol> to be gambled with. <eob>
He then tells me why no one was going <eol> to approve this procedure, <eob> certainly not he, <eob> because of a concept called medical paternalism, <eob> which allows him, as my well-informed provider, <eob> to make decisions for me ... <eob> based on his perception <eol> of my best interest, <eob> regardless of what I, as the patient, want or believe. <eob>
He takes this opportunity to step out <eob> and discuss my case <eol> with my potential surgeon, <eob> and through the door, I hear him describe me <eol> as a little girl. <eob>
I was so offended. <eob> I wanted to defend myself. <eob>
I wanted to explicitly explain <eol> to each one of these providers <eob> how they were treating me, <eob> that it was belittling and sexist, <eob> and I didn't have to take it. <eob>
But I did take it. <eob>
I swallowed every sharp word in my throat, <eob> clenched my jaw, and instead <eob> answered each one of their condescending questions <eol> and statements. <eob>
I had come here looking <eol> for objectivity and support <eob> and instead I felt dismissed and silenced, <eob> and I hated myself for it. <eob>
I hated that I was letting people <eol> disrespect me repeatedly. <eob>
But this was my one shot. <eob>
That was one of multiple consultations <eol> that I had to go to. <eob>
At one point, I had seen five or six <eol> medical professionals in the same hour. <eob>
The door to the exam room felt <eol> more like the door to a clown car. <eob>
There's my primary, <eob> there's his colleague, <eob> the director, OK. <eob>
It felt like I was asking them <eol> to infect me with smallpox <eob> instead of, I don't know, <eol> obtain birth control. <eob>
But I didn't waver, <eob> and I was persistent, <eob> and I eventually convinced one of them <eol> to allow the procedure. <eob>
"You'll change your mind." <eob> And even as I am in the room, signing the consent forms <eob> and getting the hormone shots <eol> and tying up loose ends ... <eob> my doctor is shaking his head <eol> in disapproval. <eob>
I never really understood <eob> how strongly this society <eol> clings to this role <eob> until I went through this. <eob>
I experienced firsthand, repeatedly, <eob> how people, be it medical providers, <eob> colleagues, strangers, <eob> were literally unable to separate <eol> me being a woman <eob> from me being a mother. <eob>
And I've always believed <eol> that having children <eob> was an extension of womanhood, <eol> not the definition. <eob>
I believe that a woman's value <eob> should never be determined by whether <eol> or not she has a child, <eob> because that strips her of her entire identity <eob> as an adult unto herself. <eob>
Women have this amazing ability to create life, <eob> but when we say that <eol> that is her purpose, <eob> that says that her entire existence <eol> is a means to an end. <eob>
It's so easy to forget the roles <eol> that society places on us <eob> are so much more than mere titles. <eob>
What about the weight <eol> that comes with them, <eob> the pressure to conform <eol> to these standards ... <eob> the fear associated with questioning them, <eob> and the desires that we cast aside to accept them? <eob>
There are many paths to happiness <eol> and fulfillment. <eob>
They all look very different, <eob> but I believe that every one <eob> is paved with the right <eol> to self-determination. <eob>
I want women to know that your choice <eol> to embrace or forego motherhood <eob> is not in any way <eol> tied to your worthiness or identity <eob> as spouses, as adults, <eol> or as women ... <eob> and there absolutely is a choice <eol> behind maternity, <eob> and it is yours <eob> and yours alone. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
According to the UN, <eob> billions of people still live <eol> without an address. <eob>
The economist Hernando de Soto said, <eob> "Without an address, <eob> you live outside the law. <eob>
You might as well not exist." <eob> I'm here to tell you how my team <eol> and I are trying to change that. <eob>
If you go to an online map <eol> and look at a favela in Brazil <eob> or a township in South Africa, <eob> you'll see a few streets <eol> but a lot of empty space. <eob>
But if you flip to satellite view, <eob> there are thousands of people, <eol> homes and businesses <eob> in this vast, unmapped and unaddressed spaces. <eob>
In Ghana's capital, Accra, <eob> there are numbers and letters scrawled <eol> onto the sides of walls, <eob> where they piloted address systems <eol> but not finished them. <eob>
But these places, <eol> these unaddressed places, <eob> hold huge economic potential. <eob>
Here's why the issue <eol> of addressing stuck with me. <eob>
I worked in the music business for 10 years, <eob> and what you may not know <eol> about the music world <eob> is that every day, people <eol> struggle with the problems of addressing. <eob>
So from the musicians <eol> who have to find the gigs <eob> to the production companies <eol> who bring the equipment, <eob> everyone somehow always gets lost. <eob>
We even had to add someone <eol> to our schedules <eob> who was the person you called <eol> when you thought you'd arrived <eob> but then realized you hadn't. <eob>
And we had some pretty bad days, <eob> like in Italy, where a truck driver unloaded all the equipment <eob> an hour north of Rome, <eol> not an hour south of Rome, <eob> and a slightly worse day <eob> where a keyboard player called me and said, <eob> "Chris, don't panic, but we may have just sound-checked <eob> at the wrong people's wedding." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So not long after the fated Rome event, <eob> I chatted this through <eol> with a friend of mine <eob> who is a mathematician, <eob> and we thought it was a problem <eol> we could do something about. <eob>
We thought, well, <eol> we could make a new system, <eob> but it shouldn't look like the old system. <eob>
We agreed that addresses were bad. <eob>
We knew we wanted something <eol> very precise, <eob> but GPS coordinates, latitude <eol> and longitude, <eob> were just too complicated. <eob>
So we divided the world <eol> into three-meter squares. <eob>
The world divides into around 57 trillion <eol> three-meter squares, <eob> and we found that there are enough combinations <eob> of three dictionary words <eob> that we could name every three-meter square in the world <eol> uniquely <eob> with just three words. <eob>
We used 40,000 words, <eob> so that's 40,000 cubed, <eob> 64 trillion combinations of three words, <eob> which is more than enough <eol> for the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares, <eob> with a few spare. <eob>
So that's exactly what we did. <eob>
We divided the world <eol> into three-meter squares, <eob> gave each one a unique, <eol> three-word identifier -- <eob> what we call a three-word address. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So for example, right here, <eob> I'm standing at mustards-coupons-pinup, <eob>
but over here ... <eob> I'm standing at pinched- singularly-tutorial. <eob>
But we haven't just done this in English. <eob>
We thought it was essential <eol> that people should be able to use this system <eob> in their own language. <eob>
So far, we've built it <eol> into 14 languages, <eob> including French, Swahili and Arabic, <eob> and we're working on more now, <eol> like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi. <eob>
But this idea can do a lot more <eob> than just get my musicians <eol> to their gigs on time. <eob>
If the 75 percent of countries <eol> that struggle with reliable addressing <eob> started using three-word addresses, <eob> there's a stack of far more important applications. <eob>
In Durban, South Africa, <eob> an NGO called Gateway Health <eob> have distributed 11,000 three-word <eol> address signs <eob> to their community, <eob> so the pregnant mothers, <eol> when they go into labor, <eob> can call the emergency services <eob> and tell them exactly where to pick them up from, <eob> because otherwise, the ambulances <eol> have often taken hours to find them. <eob>
In Mongolia, the National Post Service have adopted the system <eob> and are now doing deliveries <eol> to many people's houses <eob> for the first time. <eob>
The UN are using it to geotag photos <eol> in disaster zones <eob> so they can deliver aid <eol> to exactly the right place. <eob>
Even Domino's Pizza are using <eol> it in the Caribbean, <eob> because they haven't been able <eol> to find customers' homes, <eob> but they really want to get their pizza <eol> to them while its still hot. <eob>
Shortly, you'll be able <eol> to get into a car, <eob> speak the three words, <eob> and the car will navigate <eol> you to that exact spot. <eob>
In Africa, the continent <eol> has leapfrogged phone lines <eob> to go to mobile phones, <eob> bypassed traditional banks <eol> to go straight to mobile payments. <eob>
We're really proud that the post services <eol> of three African countries -- <eob> Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire, <eob> have gone straight <eol> to adopting three-word addresses, <eob> which means that people in those countries <eob> have a really simple way to explain <eol> where they live, today. <eob>
For me, poor addressing <eol> was an annoying frustration, <eob> but for billions of people, <eob> it's a huge business inefficiency, <eob> severely hampers their infrastructure growth, <eob> and can cost lives. <eob>
We're on a mission to change that, <eob> three words at a time. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Representatives from six European countries <eob> had come to Rome <eob> to sign the treaty that was to create <eol> the European Union. <eob> Europe was destroyed. <eob> A world war had emerged from Europe. <eob>
The human suffering was unbelievable <eob> and unprecedented. <eob>
Those men <eob> wanted to create a peaceful, <eob> democratic Europe, <eob> a Europe that works for its people. <eob>
And one of the many building blocks <eob> in that peace project <eob> was a common European market. <eob>
Already back then, <eob> they saw how markets, <eob> when left to themselves, <eob> can sort of slip into being <eol> just the private property <eob> of big businesses and cartels, <eob> meeting the needs of some businesses <eob> and not the needs of customers. <eob>
So from our very first day, <eob> in 1957, <eob> the European Union had rules <eob> to defend fair competition. <eob>
And that means competition on the merits, <eob> that you compete on the quality <eol> of your products, <eob> the prices you can offer, <eob> the services, the innovation that you produce. <eob>
That's competition on the merits. <eob>
You have a fair chance <eol> of making it on such a market. <eob>
And it's my job, <eob> as Commissioner for Competition, <eob> to make sure that companies <eol> who do business in Europe <eob> live by those rules. <eob>
But let's take a step back. <eob>
Why do we need rules <eol> on competition at all? <eob>
Why not just let businesses compete? <eob>
Isn't that also the best for us <eob> if they compete freely, <eob> since more competition <eob> drives more quality, <eob> lower prices, more innovation? <eob>
Well, mostly it is. <eob>
But the problem is that sometimes, <eol> for businesses, <eob> competition can be inconvenient, <eob> because competition means that the race <eol> is never over, <eob> the game is never won. <eob>
No matter how well <eol> you were doing in the past, <eob> there's always someone <eob> who are out there wanting <eol> to take your place. <eob>
So the temptation to avoid competition <eob> is powerful. <eob>
It's rooted in motives <eol> as old as Adam and Eve: <eob> in greed for yet more money, <eob> in fear of losing your position <eol> in the market <eob> and all the benefits it brings. <eob>
And when greed and fear <eob> are linked to power, <eob> you have a dangerous mix. <eob>
We see that in political life. <eob>
In part of the world, <eob> the mix of greed and fear <eob> means that those who get power <eob> become reluctant to give it back. <eob>
One of the many things <eob> I like and admire in our democracies <eob> are the norms <eob> that make our leaders hand over power <eob> when voters tell them to. <eob>
And competition rules can do <eol> a similar thing in the market, <eob> making sure that greed and fear <eol> doesn't overcome fairness. <eob>
Because those rules mean <eob> that companies cannot misuse <eol> their power to undermine competition. <eob>
Think for a moment about your car. <eob>
It has thousands of parts, <eob> from the foam <eol> that makes the seats <eob> to the electrical wiring to the light bulbs. <eob> And for many of those parts, <eob> the world's carmakers, <eob> they are dependent on only a few suppliers. <eob>
So it's hardly surprising <eob> that it is kind of tempting <eol> for those suppliers <eob> to come together and fix prices. <eob>
But just imagine what that could do <eob> to the final price of your new car <eol> in the market. <eob>
Except, it's not imaginary. <eob>
The European Commission <eob> has dealt with already seven <eol> different car parts cartels, <eob> and we're still investigating some. <eob>
Here, the Department of Justice <eob> are also looking into the market <eol> for car parts, <eob> and it has called it the biggest criminal investigation <eob> it has ever pursued. <eob> But without competition rules, <eob> there would be no investigation, <eob> and there would be nothing to stop this collusion <eol> from happening <eob> and the prices of your car to go up. <eob>
Yet it's not only companies <eob> who can undermine fair competition. <eob>
Governments can do it, too. <eob>
And governments do that <eol> when they hand out subsidies <eob> to just the favorite few, <eol> the selected. <eob>
They may do that when they hand out subsidies -- <eob> and, of course, all financed <eol> by taxpayers -- <eob> to companies. <eob> That may be in the form <eol> of special tax treatments, <eob> like the tax benefits <eob> that firms like Fiat, Starbucks and Apple got <eob> from some governments in Europe. <eob>
Those subsidies stop companies <eol> from competing on equal terms. <eob>
They can mean that the companies that succeed, <eob> well, they are the companies <eol> that got the most subsidy, <eob> the ones that are the best-connected, <eob> and not, as it should be, <eob> the companies that serve consumers the best. <eob>
So there are times when we need to step in <eob> to make sure that competition <eol> works the way it should. <eob>
By doing that, we help <eol> the market to work fairly, <eob> because competition gives consumers <eol> the power to demand a fair deal. <eob>
It means that companies know <eol> that if they cannot offer good prices <eob> or the service that's expected, <eob> well, the customers will go somewhere else. <eob>
And that sort of fairness <eol> is more important <eob> than we may sometimes realize. <eob>
Very few people think <eol> about politics all the time. <eob>
Some even skip it at election time. <eob>
But we are all in the market. <eob>
Every day, we are in the market. <eob>
And we don't want businesses <eol> to agree on prices in the back office. <eob>
We don't want them to divide <eol> the market between them. <eob>
We don't want one big company <eob> just to shut out competitors <eob> from ever showing us what they can do. <eob>
If that happens, <eob> well, obviously, we feel <eol> that someone has cheated us, <eob> that we are being ignored <eol> or taken for granted by the market. <eob>
And that may undermine not <eol> only our trust in the market <eob> but also our trust in the society. <eob>
In a recent survey, <eob> more than two-thirds of Europeans <eob> said that they had felt <eol> the effects of lack of competition: <eob> that the price for electricity <eol> was too high, <eob> that the price for the medicines <eol> they needed was too high, <eob> that they had no real choice <eob> if they wanted to travel by bus or by plane, <eob> or they got poor service <eol> from their internet provider. <eob>
In short, they found that the market <eol> didn't treat them fairly. <eob>
And that might seem <eol> like very small things, <eob> but they can give you this sense <eob> that the world isn't really fair. <eob>
And they see the market, <eol> which was supposed to serve everyone, <eob> become more like the private property <eol> of a few powerful companies. <eob>
The market is not the society. <eob>
Our societies are, of course, <eol> much, much more than the market. <eob>
But lack of trust in the market <eob> can rub off on society <eob> so we lose trust in our society as well. <eob>
And it may be the most important <eol> thing we have, trust. <eob>
We can trust each other <eol> if we are treated as equals. <eob>
If we are all to have the same chances, <eob> well, we all have to follow <eol> the same fundamental rules. <eob>
Of course, some people and some businesses <eol> are more successful than others, <eob> but we do not trust in a society <eob> if the prizes are handed out <eob> even before the contest begins. <eob>
And this is where competition rules come in, <eob> because when we make sure <eol> that markets work fairly, <eob> then businesses compete on the merits, <eob> and that helps to build the trust <eol> that we need as citizens <eob> to feel comfortable and in control, <eob> and the trust that allows our society to work. <eob>
Because without trust, <eol> everything becomes harder. <eob>
Just to live our daily lives, <eol> we need to trust in strangers, <eob> to trust the banks who keep our money, <eob> the builders who build our home, <eob> the electrician who comes to fix the wiring, <eob> the doctor who treats us <eol> when we're ill, <eob> not to mention the other drivers on the road, <eob> and everyone knows that they are crazy. <eob>
And yet, we have to trust them <eob> to do the right thing. <eob>
And the thing is <eol> that the more our societies grow, <eob> the more important trust becomes <eob> and the harder it is to build. <eob>
And that is a paradox of modern societies. <eob>
And this is especially true <eob> when technology changes the way <eol> that we interact. <eob>
Of course, to some degree, <eol> technology can help us <eob> to build trust in one another <eol> with ratings systems and other systems <eob> that enable the sharing economy. <eob>
But technology also creates <eol> completely new challenges <eob> when they ask us <eol> not to trust in other people <eob> but to trust in algorithms and computers. <eob>
Of course, we all see and share and appreciate <eob> all the good that new technology can do us. <eob>
It's a lot of good. <eob>
Autonomous cars <eol> can give people with disabilities new independence. <eob>
It can save us all time, <eob> and it can make a much, much better <eol> use of resources. <eob>
Algorithms that rely on crunching <eol> enormous amounts of data <eob> can enable our doctors <eol> to give us a much better treatment, <eob> and many other things. <eob>
But no one is going to hand <eol> over their medical data <eob> or step into a car <eol> that's driven by an algorithm <eob> unless they trust the companies <eol> that they are dealing with. <eob>
And that trust isn't always there. <eob>
Today, for example, less <eol> than a quarter of Europeans <eob> trust online businesses <eol> to protect their personal information. <eob>
But what if people knew <eob> that they could rely <eol> on technology companies <eob> to treat them fairly? <eob>
What if they knew that those companies <eob> respond to competition <eol> by trying to do better, <eob> by trying to serve consumers better, <eob> not by using their power <eob> to shut out competitors, <eob> say, by pushing their services <eob> far, far down the list of search results <eob> and promoting themselves? <eob>
What if they knew <eol> that compliance with the rules <eob> was built into the algorithms by design, <eob> that the algorithm had to go <eol> to competition rules school <eob> before they were ever allowed to work, <eob> that those algorithms were designed <eob> in a way that meant <eol> that they couldn't collude, <eob> that they couldn't form their own little cartel <eob> in the black box they're working in? <eob>
Together with regulation, <eob> competition rules can do that. <eob>
They can help us to make sure <eob> that new technology treats people fairly <eob> and that everyone can compete <eol> on a level playing field. <eob>
And that can help us build the trust <eob> that we need for real innovation <eob> to flourish <eob> and for societies to develop for citizens. <eob>
Because trust cannot be imposed. <eob> It has to be earned. <eob>
Since the very first days <eol> of the European Union, <eob> 60 years ago, <eob> our competition rules have helped <eob> to build that trust. <eob>
A lot of things have changed. <eob>
It's hard to say what those six <eol> representatives <eob> would have made of a smartphone. <eob>
But in today's world, <eob> as well as in their world, <eob> competition makes the market work <eol> for everyone. <eob>
And that is why I am convinced <eob> that real and fair competition <eob> has a vital role to play <eob> in building the trust we need <eob> to get the best of our societies, <eob> and that starts with enforcing our rules, <eob> actually just to make the market work for everyone. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Bruno Giussani: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
Thank you, <eob> Commissioner. <eob> Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure. <eob>
BG: I want to ask you two questions. <eob>
The first one is about data, <eol> because I have the impression <eob> that technology and data are changing <eol> the way competition takes place <eob> and the way competition regulation <eol> is designed and enforced. <eob>
Can you maybe comment on that? <eob>
MV: Well, yes, it is definitely challenging us, <eob> because we both have to sharpen our tools <eob> but also to develop new tools. <eob>
When we were going through <eol> the Google responses <eob> to our statement of objection, <eob> we were going through 5.2 terabytes of data. <eob> It's quite a lot. <eob> So we had to set up new systems. <eob>
We had to figure out how to do this, <eob> because you cannot work the way <eol> you did just a few years ago. <eob>
So we are definitely sharpening <eol> up our working methods. <eob>
The other thing is <eol> that we try to distinguish <eob> between different kinds of data, <eob> because some data is extremely valuable <eob> and they will form, like, a barrier <eol> to entry in a market. <eob>
Other things you can just -- <eol> it loses its value tomorrow. <eob>
So we try to make sure <eob> that we never, ever underestimate the fact <eob> that data works as a currency in the market <eob> and as an asset that can be <eol> a real barrier for competition. <eob>
BG: Google. You fined them <eol> 2.8 billion euros a few months ago. <eob>
MV: No, that was dollars. <eob>
It's not so strong these days. <eob>
BG: Ah, well, depends on the -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Google appealed the case. The case <eol> is going to court. <eob>
It will last a while. <eob>
Earlier, last year, you asked Apple <eol> to pay 13 billion in back taxes, <eob> and you have also investigated other companies, <eob> including European and Russian companies, <eob> not only American companies, by far. <eob>
Yet the investigations <eol> against the American companies <eob> are the ones that have attracted <eol> the most attention <eob> and they have also attracted some accusations. <eob>
You have been accused, <eol> essentially, of protectionism, of jealousy, <eob> or using legislation <eol> to hit back at American companies <eob> that have conquered European markets. <eob> "The Economist" just this week <eol> on the front page writes, <eob> "Vestager Versus The Valley." <eob> How do you react to that? <eob>
MV: Well, first of all, <eol> I take it very seriously, <eob> because bias has no room <eol> in law enforcement. <eob>
We have to prove our cases <eol> with the evidence and the facts <eob> and the jurisprudence <eob> in order also to present it to the courts. <eob>
The second thing is that Europe <eol> is open for business, <eob> but not for tax evasion. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The thing is that we are changing, <eob> and for instance, <eol> when I ask my daughters — <eob> they use Google as well — <eob> "Why do you do that?" <eob> They say, "Well, because it works. <eob>
It's a very good product. <eob> "They would never, ever, <eol> come up with the answer," <eob> It's because it's a US product. <eob> "It's just because it works. <eob>
And that is of course how it should be. <eob>
But just the same, it is important <eol> that someone is looking after to say, <eob> "Well, we congratulate you <eob> while you grow and grow and grow, <eob> but congratulation stops <eob> if we find that you're misusing your position <eob> to harm competitors so that they cannot serve consumers." <eob>
BG: It will be a fascinating case <eol> to follow. <eob>
Thank you <eob> for coming to TED. <eob>
I'm going to begin with a scary question: <eob> Are we headed toward a future without jobs? <eob>
The remarkable progress <eol> that we're seeing <eob> in technologies like self-driving cars <eob> has led to an explosion <eol> of interest in this question, <eob> but because it's something <eol> that's been asked <eob> so many times in the past, <eob> maybe what we should really be asking <eob> is whether this time is really different. <eob>
The fear that automation <eol> might displace workers <eob> and potentially lead to lots <eol> of unemployment <eob> goes back at a minimum 200 years to the Luddite revolts in England. <eob>
And since then, this concern <eol> has come up again and again. <eob>
I'm going to guess <eob> that most of you have probably <eol> never heard of the Triple Revolution report, <eob> but this was a very prominent report. <eob>
It was put together by a brilliant group of people -- <eob> it actually included two Nobel laureates -- <eob> and this report was presented <eol> to the President of the United States, <eob> and it argued that the US was on the brink <eol> of economic and social upheaval <eob> because industrial automation <eol> was going to put millions of people <eob> out of work. <eob>
Now, that report was delivered <eol> to President Lyndon Johnson <eob> in March of 1964. <eob>
So that's now over 50 years, <eob> and, of course, that hasn't really happened. <eob>
And that's been the story again and again. <eob>
This alarm has been raised repeatedly, <eob> but it's always been a false alarm. <eob>
And because it's been a false alarm, <eob> it's led to a very conventional way <eol> of thinking about this. <eob>
And that says essentially that yes, <eob> technology may devastate <eol> entire industries. <eob>
It may wipe out whole occupations <eol> and types of work. <eob>
But at the same time, of course, <eob> progress is going to lead to entirely new things. <eob>
So there will be new industries <eol> that will arise in the future, <eob> and those industries, of course, <eol> will have to hire people. <eob>
There'll be new kinds <eol> of work that will appear, <eob> and those might be things <eol> that today we can't really even imagine. <eob>
And that has been the story so far, <eob> and it's been a positive story. <eob>
It turns out that the new jobs <eol> that have been created <eob> have generally been a lot better <eol> than the old ones. <eob>
They have, for example, <eol> been more engaging. <eob>
They've been in safer, <eol> more comfortable work environments, <eob> and, of course, they've paid more. <eob>
So it has been a positive story. <eob>
That's the way things <eol> have played out so far. <eob>
But there is one particular class of worker <eob> for whom the story <eol> has been quite different. <eob>
For these workers, <eob> technology has completely decimated their work, <eob> and it really hasn't created <eol> any new opportunities at all. <eob>
And these workers, of course, <eob> are horses. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I can ask a very provocative question: <eob> Is it possible that at some point in the future, <eob> a significant fraction of the human workforce <eol> is going to be made redundant <eob> in the way that horses were? <eob>
Now, you might have a very visceral, <eol> reflexive reaction to that. <eob>
You might say, "That's absurd. <eob>
How can you possibly compare human beings <eol> to horses?" <eob> Horses, of course, are very limited, <eob> and when cars and trucks <eol> and tractors came along, <eob> horses really had nowhere else to turn. <eob>
People, on the other hand, <eol> are intelligent; <eob> we can learn, we can adapt. <eob>
And in theory, <eob> that ought to mean that we can always find <eol> something new to do, <eob> and that we can always remain relevant <eol> to the future economy. <eob>
But here's the really critical <eol> thing to understand. <eob>
The machines that will threaten workers in the future <eob> are really nothing like those cars <eol> and trucks and tractors <eob> that displaced horses. <eob>
The future is going to be full of thinking, <eol> learning, adapting machines. <eob>
And what that really means <eob> is that technology is finally beginning <eol> to encroach <eob> on that fundamental human capability -- <eob> the thing that makes us so different <eol> from horses, <eob> and the very thing that, so far, <eob> has allowed us to stay ahead <eol> of the march of progress <eob> and remain relevant, <eob> and, in fact, indispensable to the economy. <eob>
So what is it that is really so different <eob> about today's information technology <eob> relative to what we've seen in the past? <eob>
I would point to three fundamental things. <eob>
The first thing is that we have seen <eol> this ongoing process <eob> of exponential acceleration. <eob>
I know you all know about Moore's law, <eob> but in fact, it's more <eol> broad-based than that; <eob> it extends in many cases, <eol> for example, to software, <eob> it extends to communications, bandwidth and so forth. <eob>
But the really key thing to understand <eob> is that this acceleration has now been going <eol> on for a really long time. <eob>
In fact, it's been going on for decades. <eob>
If you measure from the late 1950s, <eob> when the first integrated circuits <eol> were fabricated, <eob> we've seen something on the order of 30 doublings <eol> in computational power <eob> since then. <eob>
That's just an extraordinary number <eol> of times to double any quantity, <eob> and what it really means <eob> is that we're now at a point <eol> where we're going to see <eob> just an extraordinary amount <eol> of absolute progress, <eob> and, of course, things <eol> are going to continue to also accelerate <eob> from this point. <eob>
So as we look forward <eol> to the coming years and decades, <eob> I think that means that <eol> we're going to see things <eob> that we're really not prepared for. <eob>
We're going to see things <eol> that astonish us. <eob>
The second key thing <eob> is that the machines are, <eol> in a limited sense, beginning to think. <eob>
And by this, I don't mean <eol> human-level AI, <eob> or science fiction artificial intelligence; <eob> I simply mean that machines and algorithms <eol> are making decisions. <eob>
They're solving problems, <eol> and most importantly, they're learning. <eob>
In fact, if there's one technology <eol> that is truly central to this <eob> and has really become <eol> the driving force behind this, <eob> it's machine learning, <eob> which is just becoming <eol> this incredibly powerful, <eob> disruptive, scalable technology. <eob>
One of the best examples <eol> I've seen of that recently <eob> was what Google's DeepMind division was able to do <eob> with its AlphaGo system. <eob>
Now, this is the system that was able <eol> to beat the best player in the world <eob> at the ancient game of Go. <eob>
Now, at least to me, <eob> there are two things that really stand out <eol> about the game of Go. <eob>
One is that as you're playing the game, <eob> the number of configurations <eol> that the board can be in <eob> is essentially infinite. <eob>
There are actually more possibilities <eol> than there are atoms in the universe. <eob>
So what that means is, <eob> you're never going to be able <eol> to build a computer to win at the game of Go <eob> the way chess was approached, for example, <eob> which is basically to throw brute-force <eol> computational power at it. <eob>
So clearly, a much more sophisticated, <eol> thinking-like approach is needed. <eob>
The second thing <eol> that really stands out is that, <eob> if you talk to one of the championship Go players, <eob> this person cannot necessarily <eol> even really articulate what exactly it is <eob> they're thinking about <eol> as they play the game. <eob>
It's often something <eol> that's very intuitive, <eob> it's almost just like a feeling <eol> about which move they should make. <eob>
So given those two qualities, <eob> I would say that playing Go <eol> at a world champion level <eob> really ought to be something <eol> that's safe from automation, <eob> and the fact that it isn't should really raise <eol> a cautionary flag for us. <eob>
And the reason is that we tend <eol> to draw a very distinct line, <eob> and on one side of that line <eol> are all the jobs and tasks <eob> that we perceive as being on some level <eol> fundamentally routine and repetitive <eob> and predictable. <eob>
And we know that these jobs <eol> might be in different industries, <eob> they might be in different <eol> occupations and at different skill levels, <eob> but because they are innately predictable, <eob> we know they're probably <eol> at some point going to be susceptible <eob> to machine learning, <eob> and therefore, to automation. <eob>
And make no mistake -- <eol> that's a lot of jobs. <eob>
That's probably something <eol> on the order of roughly half <eob> the jobs in the economy. <eob>
But then on the other side of that line, <eob> we have all the jobs <eol> that require some capability <eob> that we perceive as being uniquely human, <eob> and these are the jobs <eol> that we think are safe. <eob>
Now, based on what I know <eol> about the game of Go, <eob> I would've guessed that it really ought <eol> to be on the safe side of that line. <eob>
But the fact that it isn't, <eol> and that Google solved this problem, <eob> suggests that that line is going <eol> to be very dynamic. <eob>
It's going to shift, <eob> and it's going to shift in a way <eol> that consumes more and more jobs and tasks <eob> that we currently perceive as being safe <eol> from automation. <eob>
The other key thing to understand <eob> is that this is by no means just about low-wage jobs <eol> or blue-collar jobs, <eob> or jobs and tasks done by people <eob> that have relatively low <eol> levels of education. <eob>
There's lots of evidence to show <eob> that these technologies <eol> are rapidly climbing the skills ladder. <eob>
So we already see an impact <eol> on professional jobs — <eob> tasks done by people like accountants, <eob> financial analysts, <eob> journalists, <eob> lawyers, radiologists and so forth. <eob>
So a lot of the assumptions that we make <eob> about the kind of occupations <eol> and tasks and jobs <eob> that are going to be threatened <eol> by automation in the future <eob> are very likely to be challenged <eol> going forward. <eob>
So as we put these trends together, <eob> I think what it shows is that we could <eol> very well end up in a future <eob> with significant unemployment. <eob>
Or at a minimum, <eob> we could face lots of underemployment or stagnant wages, <eob> maybe even declining wages. <eob>
And, of course, soaring <eol> levels of inequality. <eob>
All of that, of course, is going <eol> to put a terrific amount of stress <eob> on the fabric of society. <eob>
But beyond that, there's also a fundamental <eol> economic problem, <eob> and that arises because jobs <eol> are currently the primary mechanism <eob> that distributes income, <eol> and therefore purchasing power, <eob> to all the consumers that buy <eol> the products and services we're producing. <eob>
In order to have a vibrant market economy, <eob> you've got to have lots <eol> and lots of consumers <eob> that are really capable of buying the products <eol> and services <eob> that are being produced. <eob>
If you don't have that, then you run <eol> the risk <eob> of economic stagnation, <eob> or maybe even a declining economic spiral, <eob> as there simply aren't enough customers out there <eob> to buy the products <eol> and services being produced. <eob>
It's really important to realize <eob> that all of us as individuals <eol> rely on access to that market economy <eob> in order to be successful. <eob>
You can visualize that by thinking <eol> in terms of one really exceptional person. <eob>
Imagine for a moment <eol> you take, say, Steve Jobs, <eob> and you drop him on an island all by himself. <eob>
On that island, he's going <eol> to be running around, <eob> gathering coconuts just like anyone else. <eob>
He's really not going to be anything special, <eob> and the reason, of course, <eol> is that there is no market <eob> for him to scale his incredible talents across. <eob>
So access to this market <eol> is really critical to us as individuals, <eob> and also to the entire system <eol> in terms of it being sustainable. <eob>
So the question then becomes: <eol> What exactly could we do about this? <eob>
And I think you can view this <eol> through a very utopian framework. <eob>
You can imagine a future <eol> where we all have to work less, <eob> we have more time for leisure, <eob> more time to spend with our families, <eob> more time to do things <eol> that we find genuinely rewarding <eob> and so forth. <eob>
And I think that's a terrific vision. <eob> That's something that we should <eol> absolutely strive to move toward. <eob>
But at the same time, I think <eol> we have to be realistic, <eob> and we have to realize <eob> that we're very likely to face <eol> a significant income distribution problem. <eob>
A lot of people <eol> are likely to be left behind. <eob>
And I think that in order <eol> to solve that problem, <eob> we're ultimately going to have <eol> to find a way <eob> to decouple incomes <eol> from traditional work. <eob>
And the best, more straightforward way <eol> I know to do that <eob> is some kind of a guaranteed income <eol> or universal basic income. <eob>
Now, basic income <eol> is becoming a very important idea. <eob>
It's getting a lot <eol> of traction and attention, <eob> there are a lot of important pilot projects <eob> and experiments going on throughout the world. <eob>
My own view is that a basic income <eol> is not a panacea; <eob> it's not necessarily a plug-and-play solution, <eob> but rather, it's a place to start. <eob>
It's an idea that we can build <eol> on and refine. <eob>
For example, one thing <eol> that I have written quite a lot about <eob> is the possibility of incorporating explicit <eol> incentives into a basic income. <eob>
To illustrate that, <eob> imagine that you are a struggling <eol> high school student. <eob> Imagine that you are at risk <eol> of dropping out of school. <eob>
And yet, suppose you know <eol> that at some point in the future, <eob> no matter what, <eob> you're going to get the same basic income <eol> as everyone else. <eob>
Now, to my mind, that creates <eol> a very perverse incentive <eob> for you to simply give up <eol> and drop out of school. <eob>
So I would say, let's not structure <eol> things that way. <eob>
Instead, let's pay people who graduate <eol> from high school somewhat more <eob> than those who simply drop out. <eob>
And we can take that idea <eol> of building incentives into a basic income, <eob> and maybe extend it to other areas. <eob>
and so forth. <eob> For example, we might create <eol> an incentive to work in the community <eob> to help others, <eob> or perhaps to do positive things <eol> for the environment, <eob>
So by incorporating incentives <eol> into a basic income, <eob> we might actually improve it, <eob> and also, perhaps, take at least a couple of steps <eob> towards solving another problem <eob> that I think we're quite possibly <eol> going to face in the future, <eob> and that is, how do we all find <eol> meaning and fulfillment, <eob> and how do we occupy our time <eob> in a world where perhaps <eol> there's less demand for traditional work? <eob>
So by extending and refining <eol> a basic income, <eob> I think we can make it look better, <eob> and we can also, perhaps, <eol> make it more politically and socially acceptable <eob> and feasible -- <eob> and, of course, by doing that, <eob> we increase the odds that it <eol> will actually come to be. <eob>
I think one of the most fundamental, <eob> almost instinctive objections <eob> that many of us have to the idea <eol> of a basic income, <eob> or really to any significant <eol> expansion of the safety net, <eob> is this fear that we're going <eol> to end up with too many people <eob> riding in the economic cart, <eob> and not enough people pulling <eol> that cart. <eob>
And yet, really, the whole point <eol> I'm making here, of course, <eob> is that in the future, <eob> machines are increasingly going to be capable <eol> of pulling that cart for us. <eob>
That should give us more options <eob> for the way we structure <eol> our society and our economy, <eob> And I think eventually, <eol> it's going to go beyond simply being an option, <eob> and it's going to become an imperative. <eob>
The reason, of course, <eol> is that all of this is going to put <eob> such a degree of stress on our society, <eob> and also because jobs are that mechanism <eob> that gets purchasing power <eol> to consumers <eob> so they can then drive the economy. <eob>
If, in fact, that mechanism <eol> begins to erode in the future, <eob> then we're going to need <eol> to replace it with something else <eob> or we're going to face the risk <eob> that our whole system simply may not be sustainable. <eob>
But the bottom line here <eol> is that I really think <eob> that solving these problems, <eob> and especially finding a way <eol> to build a future economy <eob> that works for everyone, <eob> at every level of our society, <eob> is going to be one of the most important <eol> challenges that we all face <eob> in the coming years and decades. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When you walk around the place <eol> where you live, <eob> most of the times, <eob> you feel pretty safe <eol> and comfortable, right? <eob>
Now imagine if there were land mines <eob> buried right here, <eob> scattered around, <eob> and you'd never know when <eol> you might step on one. <eob>
That's how it is for many in my home <eol> country, Colombia. <eob>
As a result of a 50-year <eol> internal armed conflict, <eob> we have an undetermined <eol> number of land mines <eob> buried throughout the countryside, <eob> affecting more than one third of the Colombian population. <eob>
These anti-personnel mines <eob> are designed to maim, <eol> not to kill their targets. <eob>
The logic behind this, <eol> which is awful, <eob> is that more resources <eol> are taken up caring for an injured soldier <eob> than dealing with a person <eol> who has been killed. <eob>
I met Adriana Rodriguez <eol> about five years ago <eob> while I was working for the Colombian government <eob> as a documentary filmmaker. <eob>
During the conflict, <eob> she was forced to leave her house ... <eob> with her kids in her arms. <eob>
One day, one of her neighbors was killed <eob> while he stepped on a land mine. <eob>
He was actually inside an abandoned <eol> house, not outside, <eob> a house exactly like the one Adriana <eol> was forced to leave. <eob>
Ever since, she has been living <eol> with the fear that she, or her children, <eob> might step on a land mine. <eob>
You know, the Colombian conflict <eol> has been running for so long <eob> that neither me nor my mom <eol> have seen our country in peace, <eob> and for someone like me, <eob> who has been living detached <eol> from all this suffering, there was only two options: <eob> either I get used to it, <eob> or I can try to change it <eol> with all my heart. <eob>
And I have to admit <eol> that for almost 30 years, <eob> I was getting used to it, you know? <eob>
But something changed for me <eol> when I met my wife. <eob>
She is a political scientist <eob> completely passionate <eol> about the Colombian armed conflict. <eob>
She helped me to understand <eob> how deeply our country has been affected <eol> by land mines and by war. <eob>
We decided to come here <eol> to the United States <eob> in search of new skills <eob> that would enable us to contribute <eol> in a fair way to our society, <eob> and maybe even help heal it. <eob>
While in grad school, <eob> I started developing <eob> an augmented reality, <eol> really broad application <eob> to help military personnel to deactivate land mines more safely. <eob>
During that time, I also realized <eob> that Colombia is not <eol> the only country in the world <eob> that has to worry about land mines. <eob>
In fact, more than 58 countries <eob> are still contaminated with any sort <eol> of explosive device. <eob>
Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war <eob> in countries like Libya, <eol> Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, <eob> the number of [land mine casualties] <eol> almost doubled, <eob> from 3,695 to 6,461 people. <eob> Imagine that. <eob> While some countries are trying to get rid of land mines, <eob> some others are increasing their use. <eob>
But what happens when a conflict <eol> that involved land mines <eob> comes to an end? <eob>
There are two consequences. <eob>
On the one hand, <eob> the internally displaced population <eol> will start returning to their lands, <eob> and on the other hand, <eob> hidden land mines are going to start exploding more often <eob> on the civilian side. <eob>
That's the reason why I decided to join <eob> the Computer Science <eol> Department at NYU, <eob> along with Professor Claudio Silva <eob> to start to develop an app called <eol> MineSafe. <eob>
MineSafe uses information <eol> from the community <eob> to suggest paths that have been declared <eol> as the most transited <eob> without accident or incident <eol> caused by a land mine. <eob>
These traffic patterns can also <eol> be used to determine <eob> the top priority zones <eol> to be de-mined. <eob>
Almost 15 million people are living <eol> now in the countryside of Colombia. <eob>
Imagine, for a moment, <eol> if we can crowdsource information from all of them <eob> to help people like Adriana <eol> and her children <eob> to find safe and reliable paths. <eob>
This information <eol> can not only be used for that. <eob>
This information can also help them <eol> to become more productive. <eob>
Farmers will be able to find <eob> which lands have been cleared <eol> from explosive devices, <eob> and in that way, they will be able <eol> to find new, fertile grounds <eob> to start growing food again. <eob>
MineSafe has now a partnership <eol> with the Colombian government <eob> for the initial pilot, <eob> and we have now some connections <eol> with Cambodia and Somalia as well. <eob>
This project is being funded <eol> by private money <eob> here in the United States, <eob> but we don't want to stop here. <eob>
We want to go big, <eob> and we want to scale the project <eol> to every single place <eob> where land mines are still a threat. <eob>
The Colombian armed conflict <eol> is finally coming to an end, <eob> but the consequences of years of war are still buried under our feet. <eob>
We at MineSafe are working <eol> to help both people and land <eob> to find peace. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So last year, I ran for mayor of my hometown, <eol> Tulsa, Oklahoma. <eob>
And I was the underdog. <eob>
I was running against a two-term incumbent, <eob> and my opponent ran <eol> the classic partisan playbook. <eob>
He publicized his endorsement <eol> of Donald Trump. <eob>
He publicized a letter <eol> that he sent to President Obama <eob> protesting Syrian refugees, <eob> even though none of them <eol> were coming to Tulsa. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He ran ads on TV that my kids thought <eol> made me look like Voldemort, <eob> and sent out little gems in the mail, like this. <eob> [America's most liberal <eol> labor union has endorsed] <eob>
Never mind that "America's most liberal <eol> labor union," <eob> as defined by this ad, was actually the Tulsa Firefighters Union, <eob> hardly a famed bastion <eol> of liberalism. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Never mind that while she was running for president <eob> and he was serving in his final year in that office, <eob> Hillary, Barack and I could just <eol> never find the time to get together <eob> and yuck it up about the Tulsa mayor's race. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Never mind that I, like my opponent, <eob> am a Republican. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so when something like this hits <eol> you in a campaign, <eob> you have to decide how you're going to respond, <eob> and we had a novel idea. <eob>
What if, instead of responding <eol> with partisanship, <eob> we responded with a focus on results? <eob>
What if we ran a campaign <eob> that was not about running against someone, <eob> but was about bringing people together <eol> behind a common vision? <eob>
And so we decided to respond not <eol> with a negative ad <eob> but with something people find even sexier -- <eob> data points. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so we emphasized things <eol> like increasing per capita income in our city, <eob> increasing our city's population, <eob> and we stuck to those relentlessly, <eol> throughout the campaign, <eob> always bringing it back to those things <eob> by which our voters could measure, <eol> in a very transparent way, <eob> how we were doing, <eob> and hold me accountable <eol> if I got elected. <eob>
And a funny thing happened <eol> when we did that. <eob>
Tulsa is home to one <eol> of the most vibrant <eob> young professional populations in the country, <eob> and they took notice of this approach. <eob>
We have in our culture in our city, <eob> an ethos where our business leaders <eol> don't just run companies, <eob> they run philanthropic institutions <eol> and nonprofits, <eob> and those folks took notice. <eob>
We have parents <eol> who are willing to sacrifice today <eob> so that their kids can have a better future, <eob> and those people took notice, too. <eob>
And so on election day, <eob> I, G.T. Bynum, <eob> a guy whose name reminds <eol> people of a circus promoter ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a guy with the raw animal magnetism <eol> of a young Orville Redenbacher ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I won the election by 17 points. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And we did it with the support <eol> of Republicans and Democrats. <eob>
Now, why is that story <eol> and that approach so novel? <eob>
Why do we always allow ourselves <eob> to fall back <eol> on philosophical disagreements <eob> that ultimately lead to division? <eob>
I believe it is because politicians <eob> find it easier to throw the red meat out <eol> to the base <eob> than to innovate. <eob>
The conventional wisdom <eol> is that to win an election, <eob> you have to dumb it down <eob> and play to your constituencies' basest, <eol> divisive instincts. <eob>
And when somebody wins <eol> an election like that, <eob> they win, that's true, <eob> but the rest of us lose. <eob>
And so what we need to do is think <eol> about how can we change that dynamic. <eob>
How can we move in a direction <eob> where partisanship <eol> is replaced with policy? <eob>
And fortunately, there's a growing bipartisan movement <eol> across this country <eob> that is doing just that. <eob>
One of its heroes is a guy <eol> named Mitch Daniels. <eob>
Mitch Daniels served as George W. <eol> Bush's budget director, <eob> and during that time, <eob> he created what was called <eol> the PART tool. <eob>
The PART tool allowed people to evaluate <eol> a broad range of federal programs <eob> and apply numerical scoring for them <eob> on things like program management <eol> and project results. <eob>
And using this, they evaluated <eol> over a thousand federal programs. <eob>
Over 150 programs had their funding reduced <eob> because they could not <eol> demonstrate success. <eob>
But unfortunately, <eol> there wasn't ever a well-publicized increase in funding <eob> for those programs <eol> that did demonstrate success, <eob> and because of this, the program <eol> was never really popular with Congress, <eob> and was eventually shuttered. <eob>
But the spirit of that program lived on. <eob>
Mitch Daniels went home to Indiana, <eob> ran for governor, got elected, <eob> and applied the same premise to state programs, <eob> reducing funding for those programs <eol> that could not demonstrate success, <eob> but this time, he very publicly <eol> increased funding for those programs <eob> that could demonstrate success, <eob> things like increasing the number of state troopers <eob> that they needed to have, <eob> reducing wait times at the DMV -- <eob> and today, Mitch Daniels is the president <eol> of Purdue University, <eob> applying yet again the same principles, <eob> this time at the higher ed level, <eob> and he's done that in order to keep tuition levels for students there flat <eob> for half a decade. <eob>
Now, while Mitch Daniels applied this <eol> at the federal level, <eob> the state level, and in higher ed, <eob> the guy that really cracked the code for cities <eob> is a Democrat, Martin O'Malley, <eob> during his time as Mayor <eol> of Baltimore. <eob>
Now, when Mayor O'Malley took office, <eob> he was a big fan of what they'd been able to do <eol> in New York City <eob> when it came to fighting crime. <eob>
When Rudy Giuliani first became <eol> Mayor of New York, <eob> crime statistics were collected <eol> on a monthly, even an annual basis, <eob> and then police resources would be allocated <eol> based on those statistics. <eob>
Giuliani shrunk that time frame, <eol> so that crime statistics <eob> would be collected on a daily, <eol> even hourly basis, <eob> and then police resources would be allocated <eob> to those areas quickly <eol> where crimes were occurring today <eob> rather than where they were occurring <eol> last quarter. <eob>
Well, O'Malley loved that approach, <eol> and he applied it in Baltimore. <eob>
And he applied it to the two areas <eol> that were most problematic for Baltimore <eob> from a crime-fighting standpoint. <eob>
We call these the kidneys <eol> of death. <eob> [Baltimore homicides <eol> and shootings, 1999] <eob> So there they are, the kidneys. <eob> Now watch this. <eob> Watch what happens <eol> when you apply data in real time <eob> and deploy resources quickly. <eob>
In a decade, they reduced <eol> violent crime in Baltimore <eob> by almost 50 percent, using this approach, <eob> but the genius of what O'Malley did <eob> was not that he just did <eol> what some other city was doing. <eob>
Lots of us mayors do that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He realized that the same approach could be <eol> used to all of the problems <eob> that his city faced. <eob>
And so they applied it to issue <eol> after issue in Baltimore, <eob> and today, it's being used <eol> by mayors across the country <eob> to deal with some of our greatest challenges. <eob>
And the overall approach is a very simple one -- <eob> identify the goal that you want to achieve; <eob> identify a measurement <eol> by which you can track progress <eob> toward that goal; <eob> identify a way of testing <eol> that measurement cheaply and quickly; <eob> and then deploy whatever strategies <eol> you think would work, <eob> test them, <eob> reduce funding for the strategies <eol> that don't work, <eob> and put your money <eob> into those strategies <eol> that do. <eob>
Today, Atlanta is using <eol> this to address housing issues <eob> for their homeless population. <eob>
Philadelphia has used <eol> this to reduce their crime rates <eob> to levels not enjoyed since the 1960s. <eob>
Louisville has used this not just for their city <eob> but in a community-wide <eol> effort bringing resources together <eob> to address vacant and abandoned properties. <eob>
And I am using this approach in Tulsa. <eob>
I want Tulsa to be a world-class city, <eob> and we cannot do that if we aren't clear <eol> in what our goals are <eob> and we don't use evidence <eol> and evaluation to accomplish them. <eob>
Now, what's interesting, <eol> and we've found in implementing this, <eob> a lot of people, when you talk about data, <eob> people think of that <eol> as a contrast to creativity. <eob>
What we've found is actually <eol> quite the opposite. <eob>
We've found it to be an engine <eol> for creative problem-solving, <eob> because when you're focused on a goal, <eob> and you can test different strategies quickly, <eob> the sky's the limit <eol> on the different things that you can test out. <eob>
You can come up with any strategy <eol> that you can come up with <eob> and utilize and try and test it <eob> until you find something that works, <eol> and then you double down on that. <eob>
The other area that we've found <eol> that it lends itself to creativity <eob> is that it breaks down those <eol> old silos of ownership <eob> that we run into so often in government. <eob>
It allows you to draw <eol> all the stakeholders in your community <eob> that care about homelessness <eol> or crime-fighting or education <eob> or vacant and abandoned properties, <eob> and bring those people to the table <eob> so you can work together <eol> to address your common goal. <eob>
Now, in Tulsa, we're applying this <eob> to things that are common city initiatives, <eob> things like, as you've heard now repeatedly, <eob> public safety -- that's an obvious one; <eob> improving our employee morale at the city -- <eob> we don't think you could do good things <eol> unless you've got happy employees; <eob> improving the overall street quality <eol> throughout our community. <eob>
But we're also applying it <eol> to things that are not so traditional <eob> when you think <eol> about what cities are responsible for, <eob> things like increasing per capita income, <eob> increasing our population, <eob> improving our high school graduation rates, <eob> and perhaps the greatest challenge <eol> that we face as a city. <eob>
At the dawn of the 1920s, <eob> Tulsa was home to the most vibrant <eol> African American community in the country. <eob>
The Greenwood section of our city <eol> was known as Black Wall Street. <eob>
In 1921, in one night, <eob> Tulsa experienced <eol> the worst race riot in American history. <eob>
Black Wall Street was burned <eol> to the ground, <eob> and today, a child that is born <eob> in the most predominantly <eol> African American part of our city <eob> is expected to live 11 years less than a kid <eol> that's born elsewhere in Tulsa. <eob>
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue. <eob>
Four years from now, we will recognize <eob> the 100th commemoration <eol> of that awful event, <eob> and in Tulsa, we are bringing <eol> every tool that we can <eob> to address that life-expectancy disparity, <eob> and we're not checking party <eol> registration cards <eob> at the door to the meetings. <eob>
We don't care who you voted for for president <eob> if you want to help restore <eol> the decade of life <eob> that's being stolen <eol> from these kids right now. <eob>
And so we've got white folks <eol> and black folks, <eob> Hispanic folks <eol> and Native American folks, <eob> we've got members of Congress, <eol> members of the city council, <eob> business leaders, religious leaders, <eob> Trump people and Hillary people, <eob> all joined by one common belief, <eob> and that is that a kid should have an equal shot <eol> at a good life in our city, <eob> regardless of what part of town they happen to be born in. <eob>
Now, how do we go forward with that? <eob>
Is that easy to accomplish? <eob> Of course not! <eob> If it were easy to accomplish, <eob> somebody would have already done it before us. <eob>
But what I love about city government <eob> is that the citizens can create <eob> whatever kind of city they're willing to build, <eob> and in Tulsa, we have decided <eol> to build a city <eob> where Republicans and Democrats use evidence, <eol> data and evaluation <eob> to solve our greatest challenges together. <eob>
And if we can do this, <eob> if we can set partisanship aside <eob> in the only state in the whole country <eol> where Barack Obama never carried <eob> a single county, <eob> then you can do it <eol> in your town, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Your cities can be saved or squandered <eob> in one generation. <eob>
So let's agree to set aside our philosophical <eol> disagreements <eob> and focus on those aspirations <eol> that unite us. <eob>
Let's grasp the opportunity <eol> that is presented by innovation <eob> to build better communities for our neighbors. <eob>
Let's replace a focus on partisan division <eob> with a focus on results. <eob>
That is the path to a better future <eol> for us all. <eob>
Thank you for your time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A few years ago, <eob> I always had this thing happening to me, <eob> especially at family gatherings <eob> like teas with aunts and uncles <eol> or something like this. <eob>
When people come up to you, <eob> and they ask you, "So, what are you doing?" <eob> And I would have <eol> this magical one-word reply, <eob> which would make everybody happy: <eob> "Medicine. <eob>
I'm going to be a doctor." <eob> Very easy, that's it, <eol> everybody's happy and pleased. <eob>
And it could be so easy, <eob> but this effect really only lasts <eol> for 30 seconds with me, <eob> because that's then the time <eol> when one of them would ask, <eob> "So, in what area of medicine? <eob> What specialty do you <eol> want to go into?" <eob> And then I would have to strip down <eol> in all honesty and just say, <eob> "OK, so I'm fascinated with the colon. <eob>
It all started with the anus, <eob> and now it's basically <eol> the whole intestinal tract." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this would be the moment <eol> when the enthusiasm trickled, <eob> and it would maybe also get, like, awkwardly silent in the room, <eob> and I would think this was terribly sad, <eob> because I do believe <eol> our bowels are quite charming. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And while we're in a time where many people are thinking about <eob> what new superfood smoothie to make <eob> or if gluten is maybe bad for them, <eob> actually, hardly anyone seems to care <eol> about the organ where this happens, <eob> the concrete anatomy and the mechanisms behind it. <eob>
And sometimes it seems to me <eob> like we're all trying <eol> to figure out this magic trick, <eob> but nobody's checking out the magician, <eob> just because he has, like, <eob> an embarrassing hairstyle or something. <eob>
And actually, <eob> there are reasons science disliked the gut <eol> for a long time; <eob> I have to say this. <eob>
So, it's complex. <eob> There's a lot of surface area -- <eob> about 40 times the area of our skin. <eob>
Then, in such a tight pipe, <eob> there are so many immune cells <eol> that are being trained there. <eob>
We have 100 trillion bacteria <eol> doing all sorts of things -- <eob> producing little molecules. <eob>
Then there's about 20 different hormones, <eob> so we are on a very different level <eol> than our genitals, for example. <eob>
And the nervous system <eol> of our gut is so complex <eob> that when we cut out a piece, <eob> it's independent enough that when we poke it, <eob> it mumbles back at us, friendly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But at least those reasons are also <eol> the reasons why it's so fascinating <eob> and important. <eob>
It took me three steps to love the gut. <eob>
So today, I invite you to follow me <eol> on those three steps. <eob>
The very first was just looking at it <eob> and asking questions like, "How does it work?" <eob> and "Why does it have to look <eol> so weird for that sometimes?" <eob> And it actually wasn't me asking <eol> the first kind of these questions, <eob> but my roommate. <eob>
After one heavy night of partying, <eob> he came into our shared-room kitchen, <eob> and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine. <eob>
How does pooping work? " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I did study medicine <eol> but I had no idea, <eob> so I had to go up to my room <eol> and look it up in different books. <eob>
And I found something interesting, <eol> I thought, at that time. <eob>
So it turns out, we don't only have <eol> this outer sphincter, <eob> we also have an inner sphincter muscle. <eob>
The outer sphincter we all know, <eol> we can control it, <eob> we know what's going on there; <eob> the inner one, we really don't. <eob>
So what happens is, <eob> when there are leftovers from digestion, <eob> they're being delivered to <eol> the inner one first. <eob>
This inner one will open in a reflex <eob> and let through a little bit for testing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, there are sensory cells <eob> that will analyze what has been delivered: <eol> Is it gaseous or is it solid? <eob> And they will then send this <eol> information up to our brain, <eob> and this is the moment <eol> when our brain knows, <eob> "Oh, I have to go to the toilet." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The brain will then do <eol> what it's designed to do <eob> with its amazing consciousness. <eob>
It will mediate with our surroundings, <eob> and it will say something like, <eob> "So, I checked. <eob>
We are at this TEDx conference -- " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Gaseous? <eob> Maybe, if you're sitting on the sides, <eob> and you know you can pull it off silently. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But solid -- <eob> maybe later. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Since our outer sphincter and the brain <eol> is connected with nervous cells, <eob> they coordinate, cooperate, <eob> and they put it back in a waiting line -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
for other times, <eob> like, for example, when <eol> we're at home sitting on the couch, <eob> we have nothing better to do, <eob> we are free to go. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Us humans are actually one of the very few <eol> animals that do this <eob> in such an advanced and clean way. <eob>
To be honest, I had some newfound respect <eob> for that nice, inner sphincter dude -- <eob> not connected to nerves <eob> that care too much about <eol> the outer world or the time -- <eob> just caring <eol> about me for once. <eob>
I thought that was nice. <eob>
And I used to not be a great <eol> fan of public restrooms, <eob> but now I can go anywhere, <eob> because I consider it more <eob> when that inner muscle puts <eol> a suggestion on my daily agenda. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And also I learned something else, which was: <eob> looking closely at something <eol> I might have shied away from -- <eob> maybe the weirdest part of myself -- <eob> left me feeling more fearless, <eob> and also appreciating myself more. <eob>
And I think this happens a lot of times <eob> when you look at the gut, actually. <eob>
Like those funny rumbling noises that happen <eob> when you're in a group of friends <eob> or at the office conference table, <eob> going, like, "Merrr, merrr..." <eob> This is not because we're hungry. <eob>
This is because our small intestine <eol> is actually a huge neat freak, <eob> and it takes the time in <eol> between digestion to clean everything up, <eob> resulting in those eight meters <eol> of gut -- really, seven of them -- <eob> being very clean and hardly smelling like anything. <eob>
It will, to achieve this, <eol> create a strong muscular wave <eob> that moves everything forward <eol> that's been leftover after digestion. <eob>
This can sometimes create a sound, <eob> but doesn't necessarily have to always. <eob>
So what we're embarrassed of is really a sign <eob> of something keeping our insides <eol> fine and tidy. <eob>
Or this weird, crooked shape <eol> of our stomach -- <eob> a bit Quasimodo-ish. <eob>
This actually makes us be able <eol> to put pressure on our belly <eob> without vomiting, <eob> like when we're laughing <eob> and when we're doing sports, <eob> because the pressure will go up <eol> and not so much sideways. <eob>
This also creates this air bubble <eob> that's usually always very visible <eol> in X-rays, for example, <eob> and can sometimes, with some people, <eob> when it gets too big, <eob> create discomfort or even some sensations of pain. <eob>
But for most of the people, <eol> is just results <eob> that it's far easier to burp <eol> when you're laying on your left side <eob> instead of your right. <eob>
And soon I moved a bit further <eob> and started to look at the whole picture <eol> of our body and health. <eob>
This was actually after I had heard <eob> that someone I knew <eol> a little bit had killed himself. <eob>
It happened that I had been sitting <eol> next to that person the day before, <eob> and I smelled that he had very bad breath. <eob>
And when I learned <eol> of the suicide the next day, <eob> I thought: Could the gut <eol> have something to do with it? <eob> And I frantically started searching <eol> if there were scientific papers <eob> on the connection <eol> of gut and brain. <eob>
And to my surprise, I found many. <eob>
It turns out it's maybe not as simple <eol> as we sometimes think. <eob>
We tend to think our brain <eol> makes these commands <eob> and then sends them down <eol> to the other organs, <eob> and they all have to listen. <eob>
But really, it's more that 10 percent <eol> of the nerves that connect brain and gut <eob> deliver information <eol> from the brain to the gut. <eob>
We know this, for example, <eol> in stressful situations, <eob> when there are transmitters from the brain <eol> that are being sensed by our gut, <eob> so the gut will try to lower all the work, <eob> and not be working and taking away blood and energy <eob> to save energy for problem-solving. <eob>
This can go as far as nervous vomiting <eol> or nervous diarrhea <eob> to get rid of food that it then <eol> doesn't want to digest. <eob>
Maybe more interestingly, <eob> 90 percent of the nervous fibers <eol> that connect gut and brain <eob> deliver information <eol> from our gut to our brain. <eob>
And when you think about it a little bit, <eob> it does make sense, because our brain <eol> is very isolated. <eob>
It's in this bony skull <eol> surrounded by a thick skin, <eob> and it needs information to put <eol> together a feeling <eob> of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?" <eob> And the gut, actually, <eol> is possibly the most important advisor for the brain <eob> because it's our largest <eol> sensory organ, <eob> collecting information not only on the quality of our nutrients, <eob> but really also on how are so many of our immune cells doing, <eob> or things like the hormones <eol> in our blood that it can sense. <eob>
And it can package this information, <eol> and send it up to the brain. <eob>
It can, there, not reach areas <eol> like visual cortex or word formations -- <eob> otherwise, when we digest, <eob> we would see funny colors or we would <eol> make funny noises -- no. <eob>
But it can reach areas <eol> for things like morality, <eob> fear or emotional processing <eob> or areas for self-awareness. <eob>
of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?" <eob> So it does make sense <eob> that when our body and our brain <eol> are putting together this feeling <eob> that the gut has something <eol> to contribute to this process. <eob>
And it also makes sense <eob> that people who have conditions <eol> like irritable bowel syndrome <eob> or inflammatory bowel disease <eob> have a higher risk <eol> of having anxiety or depression. <eob>
I think this is good information to share, <eob> because many people will think, <eob> "I have this gut thing, <eol> and maybe I also have this mental health thing." <eob> And maybe -- because science <eol> is not clear on that right now -- <eob> it's really just that the brain <eol> is feeling sympathy with their gut. <eob>
This has yet to grow in evidence <eol> until it can come to practice. <eob>
But just knowing about these kinds of research <eob> that's out there at the moment <eob> helps me in my daily life. <eob>
And it makes me think <eol> differently of my moods <eob> and not externalize <eol> so much all the time. <eob>
I feel oftentimes during the day <eol> we are a brain and a screen, <eob> and we will tend to look <eol> for answers right there <eob> and maybe the work is stupid or our neighbor -- <eob> but really, moods can also come from within. <eob>
And just knowing this helped me, <eob> for example, when I sometimes <eol> wake up too early, <eob> and I start to worry and wander around with my thoughts. <eob>
Then I think, "Stop. <eob>
What did I eat yesterday? <eob>
Did I stress myself out too much? <eob>
Did I eat too late or something?" <eob> And then maybe get up <eol> and make myself a tea, <eob> something light to digest. <eob>
And as simple as that sounds, <eob> I think it's been <eol> surprisingly good for me. <eob>
Step three took me further away from our body, <eob> and to really understanding <eol> bacteria differently. <eob>
The research we have today <eol> is creating a new definition <eob> of what real cleanliness is. <eob>
And it's not the hygiene hypothesis -- <eob> I think many maybe know this. <eob>
So it states that when you have too <eol> little microbes in your environment <eob> because you clean all the time, <eob> that's not really a good thing, <eob> because people get more <eol> allergies or autoimmune diseases then. <eob>
So I knew this hypothesis, <eob> and I thought I wouldn't learn so much <eob> from looking at cleanliness in the gut. <eob>
But I was wrong. <eob>
It turns out, <eob> real cleanliness is not <eol> about killing off bacteria right away. <eob>
Real cleanliness is a bit different. <eob>
When we look at the facts, <eob> 95 percent of all bacteria on this planet <eol> don't harm us -- they can't, <eob> they don't have the genes to do so. <eob>
Many, actually, help us a lot, <eob> and scientists at the moment <eol> are looking into things like: <eob> Do some bacteria help us clean the gut? <eob> Do they help us digest? <eob> Do they make us put on weight <eol> or have a lean figure <eob> although we're eating lots? <eob>
Are others making us feel more courageous <eol> or even more resilient to stress? <eob> So you see, there are more questions <eol> when it comes to cleanliness. <eob>
And, actually, <eob> the thing is, it's about <eol> a healthy balance, I think. <eob>
You can't avoid the bad all the time. <eob>
This is simply not possible; <eob> there's always something bad around. <eob>
So what really the whole deal <eol> is when you look at a clean gut, <eob> it's about having good bacteria, <eol> enough of them, <eob> and then some bad. <eob>
Our immune system needs the bad, too, <eob> so it knows what it's looking out for. <eob>
So I started having <eol> this different perspective on cleanliness <eob> and a few weeks later, <eob> I held a talk at my university, <eob> and I made a mistake by 1,000. <eob>
And I went home and I realized <eol> in that moment, <eob> I was like, "Ah! <eob>
I made a mistake by 1,000. <eob>
Oh God, that's so much, <eol> and that's so embarrassing." <eob> And I started to think about this, <eol> I was like, "Ugh!" <eob> And after a while I said, <eob> "OK, I made this one mistake, <eob> but then I also told so many good <eol> and right and helpful things, <eob> so I think it's OK, you know? <eob>
It's a clean thing." <eob> And then I was like, "Oh, wait. <eob>
Maybe I took my perspective <eol> on cleanliness further." <eob> And it's my theory at the moment <eol> that maybe we all do. <eob>
Take it a bit further <eol> than just cleaning our living room, <eob> where maybe we make it <eol> to sort like a life hygiene. <eob>
Knowing that this is about fostering the good <eob> just as much as trying to shelter <eol> yourself from the bad <eob> had a very calming effect on me. <eob>
So in that sense, <eob> I hope today I told you mostly <eol> good and helpful things, <eob> and thank you for your time, <eob> for listening to me. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Fifteen years ago, <eob> I thought that the diversity <eol> stuff was not something I had to worry about. <eob>
It was something an older generation <eol> had to fight for. <eob>
In my university, <eol> we were 50-50, male-female, <eob> and we women often had better grades. <eob>
So while not everything was perfect, <eob> diversity and leadership decisions <eob> was something that would happen <eol> naturally over time, right? <eob>
Well, not quite. <eob> While moving up the ladder <eol> working as a management consultant <eob> across Europe and the US, <eob> I started to realize how often <eol> I was the only woman in the room <eob> and how homogenous leadership still is. <eob>
Many leaders I met <eob> saw diversity as something <eol> to comply with out of political correctness, <eob> or, best case, the right thing to do, <eob> but not as a business priority. <eob>
They just did not have a reason to believe <eob> that diversity would help them <eol> achieve their most immediate, pressing goals: <eob> hitting the numbers, delivering the new product, <eob> the real goals they are measured by. <eob>
My personal experience working with diverse teams <eob> had been that while they require <eol> a little bit more effort at the beginning, <eob> they did bring fresher, more creative ideas. <eob>
So I wanted to know: <eob> Are diverse organizations really more innovative, <eob> and can diversity be more <eol> than something to comply with? <eob>
Can it be a real competitive advantage? <eob>
So to find out, we set up a study <eol> with the Technical University of Munich. <eob>
We surveyed 171 companies <eol> in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, <eob> and as we speak, we're expanding the study <eob> to 1,600 companies <eob> in five additional countries <eol> around the world. <eob>
We asked those companies basically two things: <eob> how innovative they are <eol> and how diverse they are. <eob>
To measure the first one, <eob> we asked them about innovation revenue. <eob>
Innovation revenue is the share <eol> of revenues they've made <eob> from new products and services <eol> in the last three years, <eob> meaning we did not ask them <eol> how many creative ideas they have, <eob> but rather if these ideas <eol> translate into products and services <eob> that really make the company more successful today and tomorrow. <eob>
To measure diversity, we looked <eol> at six different factors: <eob> country of origin, age and gender, amongst others. <eob>
While preparing to go in the field <eol> with those questions, <eob> I sat down with my team <eob> and we discussed what we would expect as a result. <eob>
To put it mildly, we were not optimistic. <eob>
The most skeptical person on the team <eol> thought, or saw a real possibility, <eob> that we would find nothing at all. <eob>
Most of the team was rather <eol> on the cautious side, <eob> so we landed all together at "only if," <eob> meaning that we might find some kind of link <eob> between innovation and diversity, <eob> but not across the board -- <eob> rather <eol> only if certain criteria are met, <eob> for example leadership style, very open leadership style <eob> that allowed people to speak up freely <eol> and safely and contribute. <eob>
A couple of months later, <eol> the data came in, <eob> and the results convinced <eol> the most skeptical amongst us. <eob>
The answer was a clear yes, <eob> no ifs, no buts. <eob>
The data in our sample showed <eob> that more diverse companies <eol> are simply more innovative, period. <eob>
Now, a fair question to ask <eol> is the chicken or the egg question, <eob> meaning, are companies really more innovative <eob> because they have a more diverse leadership, <eob> or the other way around? <eob>
Which way is it? <eob>
Now, we do not know how much <eol> is correlation versus causation, <eob> but what we do know is that clearly, <eob> in our sample, companies <eol> that are more diverse <eob> are more innovative, <eob> and that companies <eol> that are more innovative <eob> have more diverse leadership, too. <eob>
So it's fair to assume that it works both ways, <eob> diversity driving innovation and innovation <eol> driving diversity. <eob>
Now, once we published the results, <eob> we were surprised <eol> about the reactions in the media. <eob>
We got quite some attention. <eob>
And it went from quite factual, <eob> like "Higher Female Share Boosts Innovation" <eob> to a little bit more sensationalist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As you can see, <eob> "Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions," <eob> and, my personal favorite, <eob> "Housewives Kill Innovation." <eob> Well, there's no such thing <eol> as bad publicity, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
On the back of that coverage, <eob> we started to get calls <eol> from senior executives <eob> wanting to understand more, <eob> especially -- surprise, surprise -- <eol> about gender diversity. <eob>
I tend to open up <eol> those discussions by asking, <eob> "Well, what do you think <eol> of the situation in your organization today?" <eob> And a frequent reaction to that is, <eob> "Well, we're not yet there, <eol> but we're not that bad." <eob> One executive told me, for example, <eob> "Oh, we're not that bad. <eob>
We have one member in our board <eol> who is a woman." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you laugh -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, you laugh, but he had a point <eol> in being proud about it, <eob> because in Germany, <eob> if you have a company <eob> and it has one member on the board <eol> who is a woman, <eob> you are part of a select group of 30 <eob> out of the 100 largest publicly listed companies. <eob>
The other 70 companies <eol> have an all-male board, <eob> and not even one of these hundred <eol> largest publicly listed companies <eob> have, as of today, a female CEO. <eob>
But here's the critically <eol> important insight. <eob>
Those few female board members alone, <eob> they won't make a difference. <eob>
Our data shows that for gender diversity <eol> to have an impact on innovation, <eob> you need to have more than 20 percent <eol> women in leadership. <eob>
Let's have a look at the numbers. <eob>
As you can see, <eob> we divided the sample into three groups, <eob> and the results are quite dramatic. <eob>
Only in the group where you have more <eol> than 20 percent women in leadership, <eob> only then you see a clear <eol> jump in innovation revenue <eob> to above-average levels. <eob>
So experience and data shows <eol> that you do need critical mass <eob> to move the needle, <eob> and companies like Alibaba, <eol> JP Morgan or Apple <eob> have as of today already achieved that threshold. <eob>
Another reaction I got quite a lot was, <eob> "Well, it will get solved <eol> over time." <eob> And I have all the sympathy in the world <eol> for that point of view, <eob> because I used to think like that, too. <eob>
Now, let's have a look here again and look at the numbers, <eob> taking Germany as an example. <eob>
Let me first give you the good news. <eob>
So the share of women who are college graduates <eob> and have at least 10 years <eol> of professional experience <eob> has grown nicely over the last 20 years, <eob> which means the pool in which to fish <eol> for female leaders <eob> has increased over time, <eob> and that's great. <eob>
Now, according <eol> to my old theory, <eob> the share of women in leadership <eob> would have grown more or less in parallel, right? <eob>
Now, let's have a look <eol> at what happened in reality. <eob>
It's not even close, <eob> which means I was so wrong <eob> and which means that my generation, <eob> your generation, <eob> the best-educated <eol> female generation in history, <eob> we have just not made it. <eob>
We have failed to achieve leadership <eol> in significant numbers. <eob>
Education just did not translate <eol> into leadership. <eob>
Now, that was a painful realization for me <eob> and made me realize, <eob> if we want to change this, <eob> we need to engage, and we need to do better. <eob>
Now, what to do? <eob>
Achieving more than 20 percent <eol> women in leadership <eob> seems like a daunting task to many, <eob> understandably, given the track record. <eob>
But it's doable, <eob> and there are many companies today <eol> that are making progress there <eob> and doing it successfully. <eob>
Let's take SAP, the software <eol> company, as an example. <eob>
They had, in 2011, 19 percent <eol> women in leadership, <eob> yet they decided to do better, <eob> and they did what you do in any other area <eol> of business <eob> where you want to improve. <eob>
They set themselves a measurable target. <eob>
So they set themselves a target <eol> of 25 percent for 2017, <eob> which they have just achieved. <eob>
The goals made them think <eol> more creatively about developing leaders <eob> and tapping new recruiting pools. <eob>
They now even set a target of 30 percent women <eol> in leadership for 2022. <eob>
So experience shows it's doable, <eob> and at the end of the day, <eob> it all boils down to two decisions <eol> that are taken every day <eob> in every organization by many of us: <eob> who to hire and who to develop <eol> and promote. <eob>
Now, nothing against women's programs, <eob> networks, mentoring, trainings. <eob> All is good. <eob> But it is these two decisions <eob> that at the end of the day <eol> send the most powerful change signal <eob> in any organization. <eob>
Now, I never set out <eol> to be a diversity advocate. <eob>
I am a business advisor. <eob>
But now my goal is to change <eol> the face of leadership, <eob> to make it more diverse -- <eob> and not so that leaders can check a box <eob> and feel like they have complied with something <eob> or they have been politically correct. <eob>
But because they understand, <eob> they understand that diversity <eol> is making their organization <eob> more innovative, better. <eob>
And by embracing diversity, <eol> by embracing diverse talent, <eob> we are providing true opportunity for everyone. <eob>
Thank you. Thank you so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Congratulations. <eob> By being here, <eob> listening, alive, <eob> a member of a growing species, <eob> you are one of history's greatest winners -- <eob> the culmination of a success story <eol> four billion years in the making. <eob>
You are life's one percent. <eob>
The losers, <eob> the 99 percent of species <eol> who have ever lived, <eob> are dead -- <eob> killed by fire, flood, asteroids, <eob> predation, starvation, ice, heat <eob> and the cold math of natural selection. <eob>
Your ancestors, <eob> back to the earliest fishes, <eob> overcame all these challenges. <eob>
You are here because <eol> of golden opportunities <eob> made possible by mass extinction. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's true. <eob> The same is true <eol> of your co-winners and relatives. <eob>
The 34,000 kinds of fishes. <eob>
How did we all get so lucky? <eob> Will we continue to win? <eob> I am a fish paleobiologist <eol> who uses big data -- <eob> the fossil record -- <eob> to study how some species win <eol> and others lose. <eob>
The living can't tell us; <eob> they know nothing but winning. <eob>
So, we must speak with the dead. <eob>
How do we make dead fishes talk? <eob>
Museums contain multitudes <eol> of beautiful fish fossils, <eob> but their real beauty emerges <eob> when combined with the larger number <eol> of ugly, broken fossils, <eob> and reduced to ones and zeros. <eob>
I can trawl a 500-million-year database <eol> for evolutionary patterns. <eob>
For example, <eob> fish forms can be captured <eol> by coordinates <eob> and transformed to reveal <eol> major pathways of change <eob> and trends through time. <eob>
Here is the story <eol> of the winners and losers <eob> of just one pivotal event <eol> I discovered using fossil data. <eob>
Let's travel back 360 million years -- <eob> six times as long ago <eol> as the last dinosaur -- <eob> to the Devonian period; <eob> a strange world. <eob>
Armored predators with razor-edge <eol> jaws dominated <eob> alongside huge fishes with arm bones <eol> in their fins. <eob>
Crab-like fishes scuttled <eol> across the sea floor. <eob>
The few ray-fin relatives <eol> of salmon and tuna <eob> cowered at the bottom <eol> of the food chain. <eob>
The few early sharks lived <eol> offshore in fear. <eob>
Your few four-legged ancestors, <eol> the tetrapods, <eob> struggled in tropical river plains. <eob> Ecosystems were crowded. <eob> There was no escape, <eob> no opportunity in sight. <eob>
Then the world ended. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, it is a good thing. <eob>
96 percent of all fish species died <eob> during the Hangenberg event, <eol> 359 million years ago: <eob> an interval of fire and ice. <eob>
A crowded world <eol> was disrupted and swept away. <eob>
Now, you might think <eol> that's the end of the story. <eob>
The mighty fell, the meek <eol> inherited the earth, <eob> and here we are. <eob>
But winning is not that simple. <eob>
The handful of survivors <eol> came from many groups -- <eob> all greatly outnumbered <eol> by their own dead. <eob>
They ranged from top predator <eol> to bottom-feeder, <eob> big to small, <eob> marine to freshwater. <eob>
The extinction was a filter. <eob>
It merely leveled the playing field. <eob>
What really counted was what survivors <eol> did over the next several million years <eob> in that devastated world. <eob>
The former overlords should <eol> have had an advantage. <eob>
They became even larger, <eob> storing energy, <eob> investing in their young, <eob> spreading across the globe, <eob> feasting on fishes, <eob> keeping what had always worked, <eol> and biding their time. <eob>
Yet they merely persisted for a while, <eob> declining without innovating, <eob> becoming living fossils. <eob>
They were too stuck in their ways <eob> and are now largely forgotten. <eob>
A few of the long-suffering ray-fins, sharks <eol> and four-legged tetrapods <eob> went the opposite direction. <eob> They became smaller -- <eob> living fast, dying young, <eob> eating little and reproducing rapidly. <eob>
They tried new foods, <eob> different homes, <eob> strange heads and weird bodies. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they found opportunity, proliferated, <eob> and won the future for their 60,000 living species, <eob> including you. <eob>
That's why they look familiar. <eob>
You know their names. <eob>
Winning is not about random events <eob> or an arms race. <eob>
Rather, survivors went down alternative, <eol> evolutionary pathways. <eob>
Some found incredible success, <eob> while others became dead fish walking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A real scientific term. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am now investigating <eob> how these pathways <eol> to victory and defeat repeat across time. <eob>
My lab has already compiled thousands <eol> upon thousands of dead fishes, <eob> but many more remain. <eob>
However, it is already clear <eob> that your ancestors' survival through mass extinction, <eob> and their responses in the aftermath <eob> made you who you are today. <eob>
What does this tell us for the future? <eob>
As long as a handful of species survive, <eob> life will recover. <eob>
The versatile and the lucky <eol> will not just replace what was lost, <eob> but win in new forms. <eob> It just might take several million years. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
With me here today <eob> I brought something beautiful. <eob>
This is a feather from one of the most beautiful <eol> birds we have in Kenya, <eob> the crested guinea fowl. <eob>
But this feather is more than just that. <eob>
If you've taken time <eol> when you are outdoors <eob> to look at the feathers around you, <eob> you'll have noticed <eob> that there is this huge variety <eol> of different sizes, <eob> shapes and even colors. <eob>
The feather is one of the most <eol> astonishing pieces of technology <eob> invented by the natural world, <eob> and for centuries, this feather <eol> has helped birds to keep dry, <eob> to keep warm and even power flight. <eob> Only one section of the tree <eol> of life can actually make a feather. <eob>
Among all the world's animals, <eob> birds are the only ones <eol> who can make something <eob> like what I'm holding today. <eob>
I personally have given them a nickname, <eob> and I like to call them the feathermakers. <eob>
It is the major difference between birds <eol> and any other animals we have on earth, <eob> and if you can't make a feather, <eol> you cannot call yourself a bird. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
For us humans, who are earthbound, <eob> birds represent freedom. <eob>
This feather has enabled birds <eol> to conquer gravity <eob> and take to the air in an extraordinary way. <eob>
Don't you sometimes wish <eol> you could fly like a bird? <eob>
Birds are my passion, <eob> and I want to change the way <eol> each one of you thinks about them. <eob>
The easiest reason I love them <eol> so much is because they are beautiful. <eob>
There are 10,000 species in the world, <eob> and each one of them <eol> is uniquely beautiful. <eob>
Birds are amazing, <eob> and this talk is dedicated <eol> to all the birds of the world. <eob>
Indeed, these birds have been <eol> part of our lives and cultures <eob> all over the world for centuries, <eob> and every society has a story about birds. <eob>
You probably have heard <eol> childhood stories of different birds <eob> and how they relate <eol> with man. <eob>
I personally recently learned <eob> that our human ancestors <eol> would follow flocks of vultures <eob> and then they would help them <eob> to identify where carcasses have been dropped <eol> by large carnivores, <eob> and these humans will scavenge <eol> and eat part of that meat. <eob>
Birds have been used as brands <eol> and labels all over the world. <eob>
You know the bald eagle? <eob> It was chosen as the national <eol> emblem for the US <eob> because of its majestic strength, <eob> beautiful looks <eob> and even a long lifespan. <eob>
And just like us humans <eob> who have managed to live <eol> in virtually all habitats of this earth, <eob> birds have also conquered the world. <eob> From birds such as these beautiful penguins <eob> that live in the cold ice caps <eob> to even others like the larks, <eob> who live in the hottest deserts you can imagine. <eob>
Indeed, these species <eol> have conquered this world. <eob>
Birds also build houses like us. <eob>
The real pros in housebuilding <eob> are a group of birds <eol> we call the weaverbirds, <eob> and this name they were given <eob> because of the way in which <eol> they weave their nests. <eob>
An interesting one: <eob> birds also love and date <eol> just like us humans. <eob>
In fact, you'll be surprised to know <eol> that males dress to impress the women, <eob> and I'll show you how. <eob>
So here we have a long-tailed widowbird, <eob> and this is how they would normally look. <eob>
But when it comes to the breeding season, <eob> everything changes, <eob> and this is how he looks. <eob>
(Audience murmurs) <eob>
Yeah? <eob> Birds also, multiple species of them, <eob> do love to touch and cuddle <eol> just like humans. <eob>
And I know you're wondering <eol> about this one. <eob> Yes, they kiss too, <eob> sometimes very deeply. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Some have even learned <eol> to cheat on their spouses. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
For example, the African jacana: <eob> the females will mate <eol> with multiple males <eob> and then she takes off to find <eol> other males to mate with <eob> and she leaves the male behind <eol> to take care of the chicks. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And birds help us so much, <eob> and they play very crucial roles <eol> in our ecosystems each day. <eob>
Vultures clean up our environment <eob> by literally digesting <eol> disease-causing pathogens, <eob> and they finish carcasses <eol> that would otherwise cost us lots of money <eob> to clear from the environment. <eob>
A sizable flock of vultures is capable <eol> of bringing down a carcass <eob> the size of a zebra straight to the bone <eob> within just about 30 minutes. <eob>
Owls help to rid <eol> the environments of rodents <eob> and this helps us a lot <eol> because it saves us money -- <eob> we don't lose our crops -- <eob> and secondly, we don't have to buy harmful chemicals <eob> to handle these rodents. <eob>
The beautiful sunbirds <eol> we see in our environments <eob> are part of nature's pollination crew, <eob> and they help our plants <eol> to form fruits. <eob>
Together with other pollinators like insects, <eob> they have actually helped us <eob> to get most of the food crops <eol> that we depend on for many years. <eob>
Unfortunately, the story of birds <eol> is by far not perfect. <eob>
They are faced by numerous challenges <eol> every day wherever they live. <eob>
Top on the threats facing birds <eob> is habitat loss <eob> and reduced food availability. <eob>
Birds are also hunted, especially migratory species <eob> and ducks that congregate in water bodies. <eob>
Poisoning is happening <eol> to flocks that like to stick together, <eob> especially in places like rice schemes. <eob>
Moreover, power lines <eol> are electrocuting birds <eob> and wind farms <eol> are slicing birds <eob> when they fly through the blades. <eob>
Recently, we've heard the talk <eol> of climate change <eob> making a lot of headlines, <eob> and it's also affecting birds, <eob> because birds are being forced <eol> to migrate to better breeding and feeding grounds <eob> because unfortunately <eol> where they used to live <eob> is no longer habitable. <eob>
My own perspective <eol> towards birds was changed <eob> when I was a small boy <eol> in high school, <eob> and there was this boy who struck, <eob> injuring the wing <eol> and the leg of a bird we called the augur buzzard. <eob>
I was standing there, <eob> just a mere 14-year-old, <eob> and I imagined a human being <eol> in a similar situation, <eob> because this bird could not help itself. <eob>
So even if I was hardly any biologist by then, <eob> I gathered with three of my friends <eol> and we decided to house the bird <eob> until it had regained strength <eol> and then let it free. <eob>
Interestingly, it accepted <eol> to feed on beef from our school kitchen, <eob> and we hunted termites <eol> around the compound for its dinner every day. <eob>
After a few days, it had regained strength <eob> and we released it. <eob>
We were so happy to see it flap its wings <eob> and fly off gracefully. <eob>
And that experience changed the way <eol> we looked at birds. <eob>
We went on to actually make a magazine, <eob> and we called it <eol> the Hawk Magazine, <eob> and this was in honor of this bird <eob> that we had helped within our own high school. <eob>
Those experiences in high school <eol> made me the conservationist I am today. <eob>
And a passion for birds <eol> should especially matter for Africa <eob> and all Africans, <eob> because among all other continents, <eob> Africa hosts some of the most <eol> amazing bird species <eob> you can find anywhere in the world. <eob>
Imagine having a name like "shoebill." <eob> That's the name of that bird. <eob>
And there are countries like DR Congo, <eob> Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya <eob> who are leading the continent <eol> in highest numbers of diversity <eob> when it comes to the species. <eob>
These birds continue to provide the continent <eob> with very crucial ecosystem services that Africa needs. <eob>
Moreover, there is huge potential <eob> for Africa to lead the world <eol> in avian tourism. <eob>
The economy will definitely benefit. <eob>
Imagine how many communities <eol> will benefit from groups of tourists <eob> visiting their villages just to see <eol> the endemic birds <eob> that can only be found <eol> in those villages. <eob>
How can we help birds together? <eob>
There is now a chance for all of you <eob> to turn your passion for birds <eob> into contributing to their continued survival, <eob> and you can do that <eol> by becoming a citizen scientist. <eob>
Citizen science is a growing trend <eol> around the world, <eob> and we are having scenarios where <eol> people are sharing information <eob> with the rest of the community <eol> about traffic updates, <eob> security alerts and so on. <eob>
That is exactly what we realized <eol> as bird-watchers, <eob> and we thought, because birds <eol> are found everywhere, <eob> if we've got all of you <eol> and everyone else in Africa <eob> to tell us the birds <eol> they find where they live, <eob> where they school, or even where they work, <eob> then we can be able to come up <eol> with a map of every single species, <eob> and from there scientists will be able <eob> to actually prioritize conservation efforts <eob> to those habitats that matter the most. <eob>
Take for example these two projects, <eob> the Africa Raptor DataBank, <eob> which is mapping all birds of prey <eol> in the continent of Africa, <eob> and the Kenya Bird Map, <eob> which is mapping about 1,100 species <eol> that occur in my country, Kenya. <eob>
These two projects now have online databases <eob> that are allowing people to submit data, <eob> and this is converted <eol> into very interactive websites <eob> that the public can consume <eol> and make decisions from. <eob>
But when we started, <eol> there was a big challenge. <eob>
We received many complaints <eol> from bird-watchers, <eob> and they will say, <eob> "I'm in a village, <eol> and I cannot access a computer. <eob>
How do I tell you what birds <eol> live in my home, <eob> or where I school, or where I work?" <eob> So we were forced to renovate our strategy <eol> and come up with a sustainable solution. <eob>
It was easy: <eob> we immediately realized <eol> that mobile phones <eob> were becoming increasingly common in Africa <eob> and most of the regions <eol> could get access to one. <eob>
So we came up with mobile phone applications <eob> that you can use on your iPhone <eol> and on your Android phone, <eob> and we made them freely available <eob> for every bird-watching enthusiast out there. <eob>
So we came up with BirdLasser, <eol> which is used by the Kenya Bird Map, <eob> and also we have the African Raptor Observations, <eob> which is now used by the African Raptor DataBank. <eob>
This was a huge breakthrough in our work <eob> and it made us get enormous <eol> amounts of data <eob> from every birder out there in the regions. <eob>
With this, we realized that citizen science <eob> is indeed very powerful, <eob> the reason being, citizen science is adaptive. <eob>
And we were able to actually <eol> convert many bird-watchers <eob> to start sharing new information with us. <eob>
When we were starting, <eob> we didn't know that birds <eol> could be a huge gateway <eob> to approaching conservation <eol> of other forms of animals. <eob>
Interestingly, now in the Virtual Museum for Africa, <eob> we have maps for dragonflies <eol> and damselflies, <eob> butterflies and moths, <eob> reptiles, frogs, <eol> orchids, spiders, <eob> scorpions, and yes, we are even mapping mushrooms. <eob>
Who could have imagined mapping mushrooms? <eob>
So this showed us that indeed <eol> we've created a community of people <eob> who care about nature in Africa. <eob>
I hereby call upon all of you <eob> to join me in promoting the value of birds <eob> within your communities. <eob>
Please just tell your friends about birds, <eob> for we are always inclined to love <eol> and care for that which we know. <eob>
Please spend a few minutes in your free time <eob> when you are at work, <eol> at school, or maybe at home, <eob> to at least look around you <eol> and see which beautiful birds are there. <eob>
Come join us in citizen science <eob> and tell us the birds <eol> you're finding in the places where you visit. <eob>
Even simpler, <eob> you could buy your child <eol> or your sibling <eob> a pair of binoculars <eob> or a bird book <eob> and let them just appreciate <eol> how beautiful these birds are. <eob> Because maybe one day <eol> they will want to care <eob> for that one which they know and love. <eob>
The children indeed are our future. <eob>
Let us please teach them <eol> to love our feathermakers, <eob> because the love of birds <eob> can be a huge gateway <eol> to appreciating all forms of nature. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I'm the product of a bold leadership decision. <eob>
After 1956, when Tunisia <eol> became independent, <eob> our first president, Habib Bourguiba, <eob> decided to invest 20 percent <eol> of the country's national budget <eob> in education. <eob>
Yes, 20 percent, <eob> on the high end of the spectrum <eol> even by today's standards. <eob> Some people protested. <eob> What about infrastructure? <eob> What about electricity, roads and running water? <eob>
Are these not important? <eob>
I would argue <eob> that the most important <eol> infrastructure we have are minds, <eob> educated minds. <eob>
President Bourguiba helped establish <eol> free, high-quality education <eob> for every boy and every girl. <eob>
And together with millions of other Tunisians, <eob> I'm deeply indebted <eol> to that historic decision. <eob>
And that's what brought me here today, <eob> because today, we are facing <eol> a global learning crisis. <eob>
I call it learning crisis <eol> and not education crisis, <eob> because on top of the quarter <eol> of a billion children <eob> who are out of school today, <eob> even more, 330 million children, <eob> are in school but failing to learn. <eob>
And if we do nothing, <eob> if nothing changes, <eob> by 2030, <eol> just 13 years from now, <eob> half of the world's children <eol> and youth, <eob> half of 1.6 billion children <eol> and youth, <eob> will be either out of school <eol> or failing to learn. <eob>
So two years ago, <eol> I joined the Education Commission. <eob>
It's a commission brought together <eol> by former UK Prime Minister <eob> and UN Special Envoy <eol> for Global Education Gordon Brown. <eob>
Our first task was to find out: <eob> How big is the learning crisis? <eob> What's actually the scope of the problem? <eob>
Today we know: <eob> half of the world's children by 2030 <eob> will be failing to learn. <eob>
And that's how actually we discovered <eob> that we need to change <eol> the world's focus from schooling to learning, <eob> from just counting how many bodies <eol> are in classrooms <eob> to actually how many are learning. <eob>
And the second big task was, <eob> can we do anything about this? <eob>
Can we do anything <eol> about this big, vast, silent, <eob> maybe most-neglected international crisis? <eob>
And what we found out is, we can. <eob> It's actually amazing. <eob> We can, for the first time, <eob> have every child in school and learning <eob> within just one generation. <eob>
And we don't even have to really <eol> invent the wheel to do so. <eob>
We just need to learn <eol> from the best in class, <eob> but not any best in class -- <eob> the best in your own class. <eob>
What we did is actually <eol> we looked at countries by income level: <eob> low-income, mid-income, high-income. <eob>
We looked at what the 25 <eol> percent fastest improvers in education do, <eob> and what we found out is <eob> that if every country moves <eol> at the same rate as the fastest improvers <eob> within their own income level, <eob> then <eob> within just one generation <eob> we can <eob> have every child in school and learning. <eob>
Let me give you an example. <eob>
Let's take Tunisia for example. <eob>
We're not telling Tunisia, <eol> "You should move as fast as Finland." <eob> No disrespect, Finland. <eob>
We're telling Tunisia, <eob> "Look at Vietnam." <eob> They spend similar amounts <eol> for primary and secondary pupils <eob> as percentage <eol> of GDP per capita, <eob> but achieves today higher results. <eob>
Vietnam introduced a standardized <eol> assessment for literacy and numeracy, <eob> teachers in Vietnam are better monitored <eol> than in other developing countries, <eob> and students' achievements <eol> are made public. <eob>
And it shows in the results. <eob>
In the 2015 PISA -- <eob> Program for International Student Assessment -- <eob> Vietnam outperformed <eol> many wealthy economies, <eob> including the United States. <eob>
Now, if you're not an education expert, <eob> you may ask, "What's new and different? <eob>
Don't all countries track student <eol> progress and make those achievements public? <eob> "No. <eob>
The sad answer is no. <eob>
We are very far from it. <eob>
Only half of the developing countries <eob> have systematic learning <eol> assessment at primary school, <eob> and even less so at lower secondary school. <eob>
So if we don't know <eob> if children are learning, <eob> how are teachers supposed <eol> to focus their attention on delivering results, <eob> and how are countries supposed <eol> to prioritize education spending <eob> actually to delivering results, <eob> if they don't know if children <eol> are learning? <eob>
That's why the first big transformation <eob> before investing <eob> is to make the education <eol> system deliver results. <eob>
Because pouring more money <eol> into broken systems <eob> may only fund more inefficiencies. <eob>
And what deeply worries me -- <eob> if children go to school and don't learn, <eob> it devalues education, <eob> and it devalues spending on education, <eob> so that governments and political parties can say, <eob> "Oh, we are spending so much money <eol> on education, <eob> but children are not learning. <eob>
They don't have the right skills. <eob>
Maybe we should spend less." <eob>
Now, improving current education systems <eol> to deliver results <eob> is important, but won't be enough. <eob>
What about countries where we won't have <eol> enough qualified teachers? <eob> Take Somalia, for example. <eob> If every student in Somalia <eol> became a teacher -- <eob> every person who finishes <eol> tertiary education became a teacher -- <eob> we won't have enough teachers. <eob>
And what about children in refugee camps, <eob> or in very remote rural areas? <eob>
Take Filipe, for example. <eob> Filipe lives in one <eol> of the thousands of communities <eob> alongside the Amazonas rivers. <eob>
His village of 78 people has 20 families. <eob>
Filipe and a fellow student <eob> were the only two attending grade <eol> 11 in 2015. <eob>
Now, the Amazonas is a state <eol> in the northwest of Brazil. <eob>
It's four and a half times <eol> the size of Germany, <eob> and it's fully covered in jungle and rivers. <eob>
A decade ago, Filipe <eol> and his fellow student <eob> would have had just two alternatives: <eob> moving to Manaus, the capital, <eol> or stopping studying altogether, <eob> which most of them did. <eob>
In 2009, however, Brazil passed a new law <eob> that made secondary education <eol> a guarantee for every Brazilian <eob> and an obligation <eol> for every state to implement this by 2016. <eob>
But giving access <eol> to high-quality education, <eob> you know, in the Amazonas state, <eol> is huge and expensive. <eob>
How are you going to get, you know, math <eol> and science and history teachers <eob> all over those communities? <eob>
And even if you find them, <eob> many of them would not want to move there. <eob>
So faced with this impossible task, <eob> civil servants and state officials <eob> developed amazing creativity and entrepreneurship. <eob>
They developed the media center solution. <eob> It works this way. <eob> You have specialized, trained content teachers in Manaus <eob> delivering classroom via livestream <eob> to over a thousand classrooms <eol> in those scattered communities. <eob>
Those classrooms <eol> have five to 25 students, <eob> and they're supported by a more generalist <eol> tutoring teacher <eob> for their learning and development. <eob>
The 60 content teachers in Manaus <eob> work with over 2,200 tutoring teachers <eol> in those communities <eob> to customize lesson plans <eol> to the context and time. <eob>
Now, why is this division <eob> between content teacher <eol> and tutoring teacher important? <eob>
First of all, as I told you, <eol> because in many countries, <eob> we just don't have enough qualified teachers. <eob>
But secondly also because teachers <eol> do too many things <eob> they're either not trained <eol> for or not supposed to do. <eob>
Let's look at Chile, for example. <eob>
In Chile, for every doctor, <eob> you have four and a half people, <eob> four and a half staff supporting them, <eob> and Chile is on the low end <eol> of the spectrum here, <eob> because in developing countries, <eol> on average, every doctor <eob> has 10 people supporting them. <eob>
A teacher in Chile, however, <eob> has less than half a person, <eob> 0.3 persons, supporting them. <eob>
Imagine a hospital ward <eol> with 20, 40, 70 patients <eob> and you have a doctor <eol> doing it all by themselves: <eob> no nurses, no medical assistants, <eob> no one else. <eob>
You will say this is absurd and impossible, <eob> but this is what teachers <eol> are doing all over the world every day <eob> with classrooms of 20, 40, <eol> or 70 students. <eob>
So this division between content <eol> and tutoring teachers is amazing <eob> because it is changing <eol> the paradigm of the teacher, <eob> so that each does what they can do best <eob> and so that children <eol> are not just in school <eob> but in school and learning. <eob>
And some of these content teachers, <eob> they became celebrity teachers. <eob>
You know, some of them <eol> run for office, <eob> and they helped raise the status <eol> of the profession <eob> so that more students <eol> wanted to become teachers. <eob>
And what I love about this example <eob> is beyond changing the paradigm <eol> of the teacher. <eob>
It teaches us how <eol> we can harness technology for learning. <eob>
The live-streaming is bidirectional, <eob> so students like Filipe <eol> and others can present information back. <eob>
And we know technology <eol> is not always perfect. <eob>
You know, state officials expect <eob> between five to 15 percent <eol> of the classrooms <eob> every day to be off live-stream <eob> because of flood, broken antennas <eol> or internet not working. <eob>
And yet, Filipe is one <eol> of over 300,000 students <eob> that benefited <eol> from the media center solution <eob> and got access <eol> to postprimary education. <eob>
This is a living example <eob> how technology <eol> is not just an add-on <eob> but can be central to learning <eol> and can help us bring school to children <eob> if we cannot bring children to school. <eob>
Now, I hear you. <eob> You're going to say, <eob> "How are we going to implement this all over the world?" <eob> I've been in government myself <eob> and have seen how difficult it is even <eol> to implement the best ideas. <eob>
So as a commission, <eol> we started two initiatives <eob> to make the "Learning Generation" a reality. <eob>
The first one is called <eol> the Pioneer Country Initiative. <eob>
Over 20 countries from Africa and Asia <eob> have committed to make education <eol> their priority <eob> and to transform their education systems <eol> to deliver results. <eob>
We've trained country leaders <eob> in a methodology called the delivery approach. <eob>
What this does is basically two things. <eob>
In the planning phase, <eol> we take everyone into a room -- <eob> teachers, teacher unions, parent associations, <eob> government officials, NGOs, everyone -- <eob> so that the reform and the solution <eol> we come up with <eob> are shared by everyone <eol> and supported by everyone. <eob>
And in the second phase, <eob> it does something special. <eob>
It's kind of a ruthless focus <eol> on follow-up. <eob>
So week by week you check, <eob> has that been done, <eol> what was supposed to be done, <eob> and even sometimes sending a person <eol> physically to the district or school <eob> to check that versus just hoping <eol> that it happened. <eob>
It may sound for many common sense, <eob> but it's not common practice, <eob> and that's why actually many reforms fail. <eob>
It has been piloted in Tanzania, <eob> and there the pass rate <eol> for students in secondary education <eob> was increased by 50 percent in just over two years. <eob>
Now, the next initiative to make <eol> the Learning Generation a reality <eob> is financing. Who's going <eol> to pay for this? <eob>
So we believe and argue <eob> that domestic financing has to be <eol> the backbone of education investment. <eob>
Do you remember when I told you <eol> about Vietnam earlier <eob> outperforming the United States in PISA? <eob>
That's due to a better education system, <eob> but also to Vietnam increasing <eol> their investment <eob> from seven to 20 percent of their national budget <eol> in two decades. <eob>
But what happens if countries <eol> want to borrow money for education? <eob>
If you wanted to borrow money <eol> to build a bridge or a road, <eob> it's quite easy and straightforward, <eob> but not for education. <eob>
It's easier to make a shiny picture <eol> of a bridge and show it to everyone <eob> than one of an educated mind. <eob>
That's kind of a longer term commitment. <eob>
So we came up with a solution <eob> to help countries escape <eol> the middle income trap, <eob> countries that are not poor enough or not poor, <eol> thankfully, anymore, <eob> that cannot profit from grants <eol> or interest-free loans, <eob> and they're not rich enough <eob> to be able to have attractive <eol> interests on their loans. <eob>
So we're pooling donor money <eol> in a finance facility for education, <eob> which will provide more finance <eol> for education. <eob>
We will subsidize, or even eliminate completely, <eob> interest payments on the loans <eob> so that countries <eol> that commit to reforms <eob> can borrow money, <eob> reform their education system, <eol> and pay this money over time <eob> while benefiting <eol> from a better-educated population. <eob>
This solution has been recognized <eol> in the last G20 meeting in Germany, <eob> and so finally today education <eol> is on the international agenda. <eob>
But let me bring this back <eol> to the personal level, <eob> because this is where the impact lands. <eob>
Without that decision <eol> to invest a young country's budget, <eob> 20 percent of a young country's budget in education, <eob> I would have never been able to go to school, <eob> let alone in 2014 <eob> becoming a minister in the government <eob> that successfully ended <eol> the transition phase. <eob>
Tunisia's Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 <eob> as the only democracy that emerged <eol> from the Arab Spring <eob> is a legacy to that bold leadership decision. <eob>
Education is the civil rights struggle, <eob> it's the human rights struggle <eol> of our generation. <eob>
Quality education for all: <eob> that's the freedom fight <eol> that we've got to win. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As you've probably noticed, <eob> in recent years, a lot <eol> of western forests have burned <eob> in large and destructive wildfires. <eob>
If you're like me -- <eob> this western landscape is actually <eol> why my family and I live here. <eob>
And as a scientist and a father, <eob> I've become deeply concerned <eol> about what we're leaving behind <eob> for our kids, and now my five grandkids. <eob>
In the US, an area that's larger <eol> than the state of Oregon has burned <eob> in just the last 10 years, <eob> and tens of thousands of homes <eol> have been destroyed. <eob>
Acres burned and homes <eol> destroyed have steadily increased <eob> over the last three decades, <eob> and individual fires that are bigger <eol> than 100,000 acres -- <eob> they're actually on the rise. <eob>
These are what we call "megafires." <eob> Megafires are the result of the way we've managed <eol> this western landscape <eob> over the last 150 years <eob> in a steadily warming climate. <eob>
Much of the destruction <eol> that we are currently seeing <eob> could actually have been avoided. <eob>
I've spent my entire career <eol> studying these western landscapes, <eob> and the science is pretty clear: <eob> if we don't change a few of our fire-management habits, <eob> we're going to lose many more <eol> of our beloved forests. <eob>
Some won't recover in our lifetime <eob> or my kids' lifetime. <eob>
It's time we confront <eol> some tough truths about wildfires, <eob> and come to understand <eol> that we need to learn to better live with them <eob> and change how they come to our forests, <eob> our homes <eob> and our communities. <eob>
So why is this happening? <eob>
Well, that's what I want <eol> to talk to you about today. <eob>
You see this forest? <eob>
Isn't it beautiful? <eob>
Well, the forests that we see today <eob> look nothing like the forests <eol> of 100 or 150 years ago. <eob>
Thankfully, panoramic photos <eol> were taken in the 1930s <eob> from thousands of western mountaintop lookouts, <eob> and they show a fair approximation <eob> of the forest that we inherited. <eob>
The best word to describe <eol> these forests of old is "patchy." <eob> The historical forest landscape <eol> was this constantly evolving patchwork <eob> of open and closed canopy forests of all ages, <eob> and there was so much evidence of fire. <eob>
And most fires were pretty small <eol> by today's standards. <eob>
And it's important to understand <eol> that this landscape was open, <eob> with meadows and open canopy forests, <eob> and it was the grasses of the meadows <eob> and in the grassy understories of the open forest <eob> that many of the wildfires were carried. <eob>
There were other forces at work, too, <eol> shaping this historical patchwork: <eob> for example, topography, whether <eol> a place faces north or south <eob> or it's on a ridge top or in a valley bottom; <eob> elevation, how far up the mountain it is; <eob> and weather, whether a place gets a lot <eol> of snow and rain, <eob> sunlight and warmth. <eob>
These things all worked together <eob> to shape the way the forest grew. <eob>
And the way the forest grew shaped <eol> the way fire behaved <eob> on the landscape. <eob>
There was crosstalk between the patterns <eol> and the processes. <eob>
You can see the new dry forest. <eob>
Trees were open grown <eol> and fairly far apart. <eob>
Fires were frequent here, <eol> and when they occurred, <eob> they weren't that severe, <eob> while further up the mountain, <eob> in the moist and the cold forests, <eob> trees were more densely grown <eol> and fires were less frequent, <eob> but when they occurred, <eol> they were quite a bit more severe. <eob>
These different forest types, <eol> the environments that they grew in <eob> and fire severity -- they all worked together <eob> to shape this historical patchwork. <eob>
And there was so much power <eob> in this patchwork. <eob>
It provided a natural mechanism <eob> to resist the spread of future fires <eol> across the landscape. <eob>
Once a patch of forest burned, <eob> it helped to prevent the flow <eol> of fire across the landscape. <eob>
A way to think about it is, <eob> the burned patches <eol> helped the rest of the forest <eob> to be forest. <eob>
Let's add humans to the mix. <eob>
For 10,000 years, Native Americans <eol> lived on this landscape, <eob> and they intentionally burned it -- a lot. <eob>
They used fire to burn meadows <eol> and to thin certain forests <eob> so they could grow more food. <eob>
They used fire to increase graze <eob> for the deer and the elk <eol> and the bison that they hunted. <eob>
And most importantly, they figured out <eob> if they burned <eol> in the spring and the fall, <eob> they could avoid the out-of-control <eol> fires of summer. <eob>
European settlement -- <eol> it occurred much later, in the mid-1800s, <eob> and by the 1880s, <eol> livestock grazing was in high gear. <eob>
I mean, if you think about it, the cattle <eol> and the sheep ate the grasses <eob> which had been the conveyer belt <eol> for the historical fires, <eob> and this prevented once-frequent fires <eol> from thinning out trees <eob> and burning up dead wood. <eob>
Later came roads and railroads, <eol> and they acted as potent firebreaks, <eob> interrupting further the flow <eol> of fire across this landscape. <eob>
And then something happened <eol> which caused a sudden pivot <eob> in our society. <eob>
In 1910, we had a huge wildfire. <eob>
It was the size <eol> of the state of Connecticut. <eob>
We called it "the Big Burn." <eob> It stretched from eastern Washington <eol> to western Montana, <eob> and it burned, in a few days, <eol> three million acres, <eob> devoured several towns, and it killed 87 people. <eob>
Most of them were firefighters. <eob>
in our society. <eob> Because of the Big Burn, wildfire became <eol> public enemy number one, <eob> and this would shape the way <eol> that we would think about wildfire <eob> for the next hundred years. <eob>
Thereafter, the Forest Service, <eol> just five years young at the time, <eob> was tasked with the responsibility <eol> of putting out all wildfires <eob> on 193 million acres <eol> of public lands, <eob> and they took this responsibility <eob> very seriously. <eob>
They developed this unequaled ability <eol> to put fires out, <eob> and they put out 95 to 98 percent <eob> of all fires every single year <eol> in the US. <eob>
And from this point on, <eol> it was now fire suppression <eob> and not wildfires <eob> that would become a prime shaper of our forests. <eob>
After World War II, timber <eol> harvesting got going in the west, <eob> and the logging removed <eol> the large and the old trees. <eob>
These were survivors <eol> of centuries of wildfires. <eob>
And the forest filled in. <eob>
Thin-barked, fire-sensitive small trees <eol> filled in the gaps, <eob> and our forests became dense, <eol> with trees so layered and close together <eob> that they were touching each other. <eob>
So fires were unintentionally blocked <eol> by roads and railroads, <eob> the cattle and sheep <eol> ate the grass, <eob> then along comes fire suppression <eol> and logging, removing the big trees, <eob> and you know what happened? <eob>
All these factors worked together <eob> to allow the forest to fill in, <eob> creating what I call the current epidemic of trees. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Go figure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
More trees than the landscape can support. <eob>
So when you compare what forests <eol> looked like 100 years ago and today, <eob> the change is actually remarkable. <eob>
Notice how the patchwork has filled in. <eob>
Dry south slopes -- <eob> they're now covered with trees. <eob>
A patchwork that was once sculptured <eol> by mostly small <eob> and sort of medium-sized fires <eob> has filled in. <eob>
Do you see the blanket of trees? <eob>
After just 150 years, <eob> we have a dense carpet of forest. <eob>
But there's more. <eob> Because trees are growing so close together, <eob> and because tree species, <eol> tree sizes and ages <eob> are so similar across large areas, <eob> fires not only move easily <eol> from acre to acre, <eob> but now, so do diseases <eol> and insect outbreaks, <eob> which are killing or reducing the vitality <eob> of really large sections of forest now. <eob>
And after a century without fire, <eob> dead branches and downed trees <eol> on the forest floor, <eob> they're at powder-keg levels. <eob>
What's more, our summers <eol> are getting hotter <eob> and they're getting drier <eob> and they're getting windier. <eob>
And the fire season is now <eol> 40 to 80 days longer each year. <eob>
Because of this, climatologists <eol> are predicting <eob> that the area burned since 2000 <eob> will double or triple <eob> in the next three decades. <eob>
And we're building houses <eol> in the middle of this. <eob>
Two recently published studies tell us <eob> that more than 60 percent of all new housing <eol> starts are being built <eob> in this flammable and dangerous mess. <eob>
So when we do get a fire, <eob> large areas can literally go up in smoke. <eob>
How do you feel now <eob> about the forest image <eob> that I first showed you? <eob> It scares the heck out of me. <eob>
So what do we do? <eob> We need to restore the power <eol> of the patchwork. <eob>
We need to put the right kind of fire <eob> back into the system again. <eob>
It's how we can resize the severity of many of our future fires. <eob>
And the silver lining <eol> is that we have tools <eob> and we have know-how to do this. <eob>
Let's look at some of the tools. <eob>
We can use prescribed <eol> burning to intentionally thin out trees <eob> and burn up dead fuels. <eob> We do this to systematically reduce them <eol> and keep them reduced. <eob>
And what is that going to do? <eob>
It's going to create already-burned patches <eob> on the landscape <eob> that will resist the flow <eol> of future fires. <eob>
We can combine mechanical <eol> thinning with some of these treatments <eob> where it's appropriate to do so, <eob> and capture some commercial value <eob> and perhaps underwrite some of these treatments, <eob> especially around urban areas. <eob>
And the best news of all <eol> is that prescribed burning produces <eob> so much less smoke than wildfires do. <eob>
It's not even close. <eob>
But there's a hitch: <eob> prescribed burning smoke is currently <eol> regulated under air quality rules <eob> as an avoidable nuisance. <eob> But wildfire smoke? <eob> It simply gets a pass. <eob>
Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs) <eob> So you know what happens? <eob>
We do far too little prescribed burning, <eob> and we continually eat smoke <eol> in the summers <eob> from megafires. <eob>
We all need to work together <eol> to get this changed. <eob>
And finally, there's managed wildfires. <eob>
Instead of putting all the fires out, <eob> we need to put some of them back to work <eob> thinning forests and reducing dead fuels. <eob>
We can herd them around the landscape <eob> when it's appropriate to do so <eob> to help restore the power <eol> of the patchwork. <eob>
And as you've probably figured out by now, <eob> this is actually a social problem. <eob>
It's got ecological and climate <eol> explanations, <eob> but it's a social problem, <eol> and it will take us humans to solve it. <eob>
Public support for these tools is poor. <eob>
Prescribed burning and managed wildfires <eol> are not well-supported. <eob>
We actually all simply want <eol> fires to magically go away <eob> and take that pesky smoke <eol> with them, don't we? <eob>
But there is no future without lots <eol> of fire and lots of smoke. <eob>
That option is actually not on the table. <eob>
Until we, the owners of public <eol> lands, make it our high priority <eob> to do something about <eol> the current situation, <eob> we're going to experience continued <eol> losses to megafires. <eob>
So it's up to us. <eob> We can spread this message <eol> to our lawmakers, <eob> folks who can help us manage our fires <eob> and our forests. <eob>
If we're unsuccessful, <eob> where will you go to play <eob> when your favorite places <eol> are burned black? <eob>
Where will you go <eob> to breathe deep <eob> and slow? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So when people voice fears <eol> of artificial intelligence, <eob> very often, they invoke <eol> images of humanoid robots run amok. <eob> You know? Terminator? <eob> You know, that might be something <eol> to consider, <eob> but that's a distant threat. <eob>
Or, we fret about digital surveillance <eob> with metaphors from the past. <eob> "1984," George Orwell's "1984," <eob> it's hitting the bestseller lists again. <eob>
It's a great book, <eob> but it's not the correct dystopia <eol> for the 21st century. <eob>
What we need to fear most <eob> is not what artificial intelligence <eol> will do to us on its own, <eob> but how the people in power <eol> will use artificial intelligence <eob> to control us and to manipulate us <eob> in novel, sometimes hidden, <eob> subtle and unexpected ways. <eob>
Much of the technology <eob> that threatens our freedom and our dignity <eol> in the near-term future <eob> is being developed by companies <eob> in the business of capturing <eol> and selling our data and our attention <eob> to advertisers and others: <eob> Facebook, Google, Amazon, <eob> Alibaba, Tencent. <eob>
Now, artificial intelligence has started <eol> bolstering their business as well. <eob>
And it may seem like artificial intelligence <eob> is just the next thing <eol> after online ads. <eob> It's not. <eob> It's a jump in category. <eob>
It's a whole different world, <eob> and it has great potential. <eob>
It could accelerate our understanding <eol> of many areas of study and research. <eob>
But to paraphrase a famous Hollywood philosopher, <eob> "With prodigious potential <eol> comes prodigious risk." <eob>
Now let's look at a basic fact <eol> of our digital lives, online ads. <eob> Right? We kind of dismiss them. <eob> They seem crude, ineffective. <eob>
We've all had the experience <eol> of being followed on the web <eob> by an ad based on something <eol> we searched or read. <eob>
You know, you look up a pair of boots <eob> and for a week, those boots <eol> are following you around everywhere you go. <eob>
Even after you succumb and buy them, <eol> they're still following you around. <eob>
We're kind of inured to that kind <eol> of basic, cheap manipulation. <eob>
We roll our eyes and we think, <eol> "You know what? These things don't work." <eob> Except, online, <eob> the digital technologies <eol> are not just ads. <eob>
Now, to understand that, <eol> let's think of a physical world example. <eob>
You know how, at the checkout counters <eol> at supermarkets, near the cashier, <eob> there's candy and gum <eol> at the eye level of kids? <eob>
That's designed to make them <eol> whine at their parents <eob> just as the parents are about <eol> to sort of check out. <eob>
Now, that's a persuasion architecture. <eob>
It's not <eob> nice, but it kind of works. <eob>
That's why you see it <eol> in every supermarket. <eob>
Now, in the physical world, <eob> such persuasion architectures <eol> are kind of limited, <eob> because you can only put so many things <eol> by the cashier. Right? <eob> And the candy and gum, it's the same for everyone, <eob> even though it mostly works <eob> only for people who have whiny <eol> little humans beside them. <eob>
In the physical world, <eol> we live with those limitations. <eob>
In the digital world, though, <eob> persuasion architectures <eol> can be built at the scale of billions <eob> and they can target, infer, understand <eob> and be deployed at individuals <eob> one by one <eob> by figuring out your weaknesses, <eob> and they can be sent to everyone's phone private screen, <eob> so it's not visible to us. <eob> And that's different. <eob> And that's just one of the basic things <eol> that artificial intelligence can do. <eob>
Now, let's take an example. <eob>
Let's say you want to sell plane <eol> tickets to Vegas. Right? <eob> So in the old world, you could <eol> think of some demographics to target <eob> based on experience and what you can guess. <eob>
You might try to advertise to, oh, <eob> men between the ages <eol> of 25 and 35, <eob> or people who have a high limit <eol> on their credit card, <eob> or retired couples. Right? <eob> That's what you <eol> would do in the past. <eob>
With big data and machine learning, <eob> that's not how it works anymore. <eob>
So to imagine that, <eob> think of all the data <eol> that Facebook has on you: <eob> every status update you ever typed, <eob> every Messenger conversation, <eob> every place you logged in from, <eob> all your photographs <eol> that you uploaded there. <eob>
If you start typing something <eol> and change your mind and delete it, <eob> Facebook keeps those and analyzes them, too. <eob>
Increasingly, it tries to match you <eol> with your offline data. <eob>
It also purchases a lot of data <eol> from data brokers. <eob>
It could be everything <eol> from your financial records <eob> to a good chunk of your browsing history. <eob> Right? In the US, such data <eol> is routinely collected, <eob> collated and sold. <eob>
In Europe, they have tougher rules. <eob>
So what happens then is, <eob> by churning through all that data, <eol> these machine-learning algorithms -- <eob> that's why they're called learning algorithms -- <eob> they learn to understand <eol> the characteristics of people <eob> who purchased tickets <eol> to Vegas before. <eob>
When they learn this from existing data, <eob> they also learn how to apply <eol> this to new people. <eob>
So if they're presented with a new person, <eob> they can classify whether <eol> that person is likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not. <eob> Fine. You're thinking, <eol> an offer to buy tickets to Vegas. <eob> I can ignore that. <eob>
But the problem isn't that. <eob>
The problem is, <eob> we no longer really understand <eol> how these complex algorithms work. <eob>
We don't understand <eol> how they're doing this categorization. <eob>
It's giant matrices, thousands <eol> of rows and columns, <eob> maybe millions of rows and columns, <eob> and not the programmers <eob> and not anybody who looks at it, <eob> even if you have all the data, <eob> understands anymore how exactly it's operating <eob> any more than you'd know <eol> what I was thinking right now <eob> if you were shown a cross section of my brain. <eob>
It's like we're not programming anymore, <eob> we're growing intelligence <eol> that we don't truly understand. <eob>
And these things only work if there's <eol> an enormous amount of data, <eob> so they also encourage deep surveillance <eol> on all of us <eob> so that the machine <eol> learning algorithms can work. <eob>
That's why Facebook wants to collect <eol> all the data it can about you. <eob>
The algorithms work better. <eob>
So let's push that Vegas example a bit. <eob>
What if the system that we do not understand <eob> was picking up that <eol> it's easier to sell Vegas tickets <eob> to people who are bipolar and about <eol> to enter the manic phase. <eob>
Such people tend to become <eol> overspenders, compulsive gamblers. <eob>
They could do this, <eol> and you'd have no clue that's what they were picking up on. <eob>
I gave this example <eol> to a bunch of computer scientists once <eob> and afterwards, one of them came up to me. <eob>
He was troubled and he said, "That's why I couldn't publish it." <eob> I was like, "Couldn't <eol> publish what?" <eob> He had tried to see whether <eol> you can indeed figure out the onset of mania <eob> from social media <eol> posts before clinical symptoms, <eob> and it had worked, <eob> and it had worked very well, <eob> and he had no idea how it worked <eol> or what it was picking up on. <eob>
Now, the problem isn't solved <eol> if he doesn't publish it, <eob> because there are already companies <eob> that are developing this kind of technology, <eob> and a lot of the stuff <eol> is just off the shelf. <eob>
This is not very difficult anymore. <eob>
Do you ever go on YouTube meaning <eol> to watch one video <eob> and an hour later you've watched 27? <eob>
You know how YouTube has this column <eol> on the right <eob> that says, "Up next" <eob> and it autoplays something? <eob>
It's an algorithm <eob> picking what it thinks <eol> that you might be interested in <eob> and maybe not find on your own. <eob>
It's not <eob> a human editor. <eob> It's what algorithms do. <eob>
It picks up on what you have watched <eol> and what people like you have watched, <eob> and infers that that must be what <eol> you're interested in, <eob> what you want more of, <eob> and just shows you more. <eob>
It sounds like a benign <eol> and useful feature, <eob> except when it isn't. <eob>
So in 2016, I attended <eol> rallies of then-candidate Donald Trump <eob> to study as a scholar <eol> the movement supporting him. <eob>
I study social movements, <eol> so I was studying it, too. <eob>
And then I wanted to write something <eol> about one of his rallies, <eob> so I watched it a few times on YouTube. <eob>
YouTube started recommending to me <eob> and autoplaying to me white supremacist videos <eob> in increasing order of extremism. <eob>
If I watched one, <eob> it served up one even more extreme <eob> and autoplayed that one, too. <eob>
If you watch Hillary Clinton <eol> or Bernie Sanders content, <eob> YouTube recommends and autoplays <eol> conspiracy left, <eob> and it goes downhill from there. <eob>
Well, you might be thinking, <eol> this is politics, but it's not. <eob>
This isn't about politics. <eob>
This is just the algorithm figuring <eol> out human behavior. <eob>
I once watched a video <eol> about vegetarianism on YouTube <eob> and YouTube recommended <eob> and autoplayed a video <eol> about being vegan. <eob>
It's like you're never hardcore <eol> enough for YouTube. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So what's going on? <eob> Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary, <eob> but here's what I think is going on. <eob>
The algorithm has figured out <eob> that if you can entice people <eob> into thinking that you can show them <eol> something more hardcore, <eob> they're more likely to stay on the site <eob> watching video after video <eol> going down that rabbit hole <eob> while Google serves them ads. <eob>
Now, with nobody minding <eol> the ethics of the store, <eob> these sites can profile people <eob> who are Jew haters, <eob> who think that Jews <eol> are parasites <eob> and who have such explicit <eol> anti-Semitic content, <eob> and let you target them with ads. <eob>
They can also mobilize algorithms <eob> to find for you look-alike audiences, <eob> people who do not have <eol> such explicit anti-Semitic content on their profile <eob> but who the algorithm detects may be susceptible <eol> to such messages, <eob> and lets you target them <eol> with ads, too. <eob>
Now, this may sound <eol> like an implausible example, <eob> but this is real. <eob>
ProPublica investigated this <eob> and found that you <eol> can indeed do this on Facebook, <eob> and Facebook helpfully <eol> offered up suggestions <eob> on how to broaden that audience. <eob>
BuzzFeed tried it for Google, <eol> and very quickly they found, <eob> yep, you can do it on Google, too. <eob>
And it wasn't even expensive. <eob>
The ProPublica reporter <eol> spent about 30 dollars <eob> to target this category. <eob>
So last year, Donald Trump's social media manager disclosed <eob> that they were using Facebook dark posts <eol> to demobilize people, <eob> not to persuade them, <eob> but to convince them not to vote at all. <eob>
And to do that, they targeted specifically, <eob> for example, African-American <eol> men in key cities like Philadelphia, <eob> and I'm going to read <eol> exactly what he said. <eob> I'm quoting. <eob>
They were using "nonpublic posts <eob> whose viewership <eol> the campaign controls <eob> so that only the people we want <eol> to see it see it. <eob> We modeled this. <eob> It will dramatically affect her ability <eol> to turn these people out." <eob>
What's in those dark posts? <eob>
We have no idea. <eob> Facebook won't tell us. <eob>
So Facebook also algorithmically <eol> arranges the posts <eob> that your friends put on Facebook, <eol> or the pages you follow. <eob>
It doesn't show you everything <eol> chronologically. <eob>
It puts the order in the way <eol> that the algorithm thinks will entice you <eob> to stay on the site longer. <eob>
Now, so this has a lot of consequences. <eob>
You may be thinking somebody <eol> is snubbing you on Facebook. <eob>
The algorithm may never be showing <eol> your post to them. <eob>
The algorithm is prioritizing <eol> some of them and burying the others. <eob>
Experiments show <eob> that what the algorithm picks <eol> to show you can affect your emotions. <eob>
But that's not all. <eob>
It also affects political behavior. <eob>
So in 2010, in the midterm elections, <eob> Facebook did an experiment on 61 million people in the US <eob> that was disclosed after the fact. <eob>
So some people were shown, "Today is election day," <eob> the simpler one, <eob> and some people were shown <eol> the one with that tiny tweak <eob> with those little thumbnails <eob> of your friends <eol> who clicked on "I voted." <eob> This simple tweak. <eob> OK? So the pictures were the only change, <eob> and that post shown just once <eob> turned out an additional <eol> 340,000 voters <eob> in that election, <eob> according to this research <eob> as confirmed by the voter rolls. <eob> A fluke? No. <eob> Because in 2012, they repeated the same experiment. <eob>
And that time, <eob> that civic message shown just once <eob> turned out an additional 270,000 voters. <eob>
For reference, the 2016 US presidential election <eob> was decided by about 100,000 votes. <eob>
Now, Facebook can also very easily <eol> infer what your politics are, <eob> even if you've never disclosed them on the site. <eob> Right? These algorithms can do that quite easily. <eob>
What if a platform <eol> with that kind of power <eob> decides to turn out supporters of one candidate over the other? <eob> How would we even know about it? <eob>
Now, we started from someplace <eol> seemingly innocuous -- <eob> online adds following us around -- <eob> and we've landed someplace else. <eob>
As a public and as citizens, <eob> we no longer know if we're seeing <eol> the same information <eob> or what anybody else is seeing, <eob> and without a common basis of information, <eob> little by little, <eob> public debate <eol> is becoming impossible, <eob> and we're just at the beginning <eol> stages of this. <eob>
These algorithms can quite easily infer <eob> things like your people's ethnicity, <eob> religious and political views, personality traits, <eob> intelligence, happiness, <eol> use of addictive substances, <eob> parental separation, age and genders, <eob> just from Facebook likes. <eob>
These algorithms can identify protesters <eob> even if their faces <eol> are partially concealed. <eob>
These algorithms may be able to detect <eol> people's sexual orientation <eob> just from their dating profile pictures. <eob>
Now, these are probabilistic guesses, <eob> so they're not going to be 100 percent right, <eob> but I don't see the powerful <eob> resisting the temptation <eol> to use these technologies <eob> just because there are some false positives, <eob> which will of course create <eol> a whole other layer of problems. <eob>
Imagine what a state can do <eob> with the immense amount of data <eol> it has on its citizens. <eob>
China is already using face detection technology <eob> to identify and arrest people. <eob>
And here's the tragedy: <eob> we're building this infrastructure <eol> of surveillance authoritarianism <eob> merely to get people to click on ads. <eob>
And this won't be Orwell's <eol> authoritarianism. <eob>
This isn't "1984." <eob> Now, if authoritarianism <eol> is using overt fear to terrorize us, <eob> we'll all be scared, <eol> but we'll know it, <eob> we'll hate it and we'll resist it. <eob>
But if the people in power <eol> are using these algorithms <eob> to quietly watch us, <eob> to judge us and to nudge us, <eob> to predict and identify <eol> the troublemakers and the rebels, <eob> to deploy persuasion architectures at scale <eob> and to manipulate individuals one by one <eob> using their personal, individual weaknesses <eol> and vulnerabilities, <eob> and if they're doing it at scale <eob> through our private screens <eob> so that we don't even know <eob> what our fellow citizens and neighbors <eol> are seeing, <eob> that authoritarianism will envelop us like a spider's web <eob> and we may not even know we're in it. <eob>
So Facebook's market capitalization <eob> is approaching half a trillion dollars. <eob>
It's because it works great <eol> as a persuasion architecture. <eob>
But the structure of that architecture <eob> is the same whether you're selling shoes <eob> or whether you're selling politics. <eob>
The algorithms do not know the difference. <eob>
The same algorithms set loose upon us <eob> to make us more pliable <eol> for ads <eob> are also organizing our political, <eol> personal and social information flows, <eob> and that's what's got to change. <eob>
Now, don't get me wrong, <eob> we use digital platforms <eol> because they provide us with great value. <eob>
I use Facebook to keep in touch <eol> with friends and family around the world. <eob>
I've written about how crucial social media <eol> is for social movements. <eob>
I have studied <eol> how these technologies can be used <eob> to circumvent censorship around the world. <eob>
But it's not that the people who run, <eol> you know, Facebook or Google <eob> are maliciously and deliberately trying <eob> to make the country or the world <eol> more polarized <eob> and encourage extremism. <eob>
I read the many well-intentioned statements <eob> that these people put out. <eob>
But it's not the intent or the statements <eol> people in technology make that matter, <eob> it's the structures and business models <eol> they're building. <eob>
And that's the core of the problem. <eob>
Either Facebook is a giant con <eol> of half a trillion dollars <eob> and ads don't work on the site, <eob> it doesn't work as a persuasion architecture, <eob> or its power of influence <eol> is of great concern. <eob>
It's either one or the other. <eob>
It's similar for Google, too. <eob>
So what can we do? <eob> This needs to change. <eob> Now, I can't offer a simple recipe, <eob> because we need to restructure <eob> the whole way our digital <eol> technology operates. <eob>
Everything from the way technology is developed <eob> to the way the incentives, <eol> economic and otherwise, <eob> are built into the system. <eob>
We have to face and try to deal with <eob> the lack of transparency <eol> created by the proprietary algorithms, <eob> the structural challenge of machine <eol> learning's opacity, <eob> all this indiscriminate data <eol> that's being collected about us. <eob>
We have a big task in front of us. <eob>
We have to mobilize our technology, <eob> our creativity <eob> and yes, our politics <eob> so that we can build artificial intelligence <eob> that supports us in our human goals <eob> but that is also constrained <eol> by our human values. <eob>
And I understand this won't be easy. <eob>
We might not even easily agree <eol> on what those terms mean. <eob>
But if we take seriously <eob> how these systems that we depend <eol> on for so much operate, <eob> I don't see how we can postpone <eol> this conversation anymore. <eob>
These structures <eob> are organizing how we function <eob> and they're controlling <eob> what we can and we cannot do. <eob>
And many of these ad-financed platforms, <eob> they boast that they're free. <eob>
In this context, it means that we are <eol> the product that's being sold. <eob>
We need a digital economy <eob> where our data and our attention <eob> is not for sale to the highest-bidding <eol> authoritarian or demagogue. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So to go back to that Hollywood paraphrase, <eob> we do want the prodigious potential <eob> of artificial intelligence <eol> and digital technology to blossom, <eob> but for that, we must face <eol> this prodigious menace, <eob> open-eyed and now. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if an African girl from a traditional family <eob> in a part of future Africa <eob> is accepted into the finest university <eol> in the galaxy, <eob> planets away? <eob>
What if she decides to go? <eob>
This is an excerpt from my "Binti" <eol> novella trilogy: <eob>
I powered up the transporter <eol> and said a silent prayer. <eob>
I had no idea what I was going <eol> to do if it didn't work. <eob>
My transporter was cheap, <eob> so even a droplet of moisture <eol> or, more likely, a grain of sand, <eob> would cause it to short. <eob>
It was faulty, and most of the time <eol> I had to restart it over and over <eob> before it worked. <eob> "Please not now, please not now," I thought. <eob>
The transporter shivered <eol> in the sand and I held my breath. <eob>
Tiny, flat and black <eol> as a prayer stone, <eob> it buzzed softly and then slowly <eol> rose from the sand. <eob>
Finally, it produced the baggage-lifting force. <eob> I grinned. <eob> Now I could make it <eol> to the shuttle on time. <eob>
I swiped otjize from my forehead <eol> with my index finger and knelt down, <eob> then I touched the finger to the sand, <eob> grounding the sweet-smelling red clay into it. <eob>
"Thank you," I whispered. <eob>
It was a half-mile walk <eol> along the dark desert road. <eob>
With the transporter working <eol> I would make it there on time. <eob>
Straightening up, I paused <eol> and shut my eyes. <eob>
Now, the weight of my entire life <eol> was pressing on my shoulders. <eob>
I was defying the most traditional part <eol> of myself for the first time <eob> in my entire life. <eob>
I was leaving in the dead of night, <eol> and they had no clue. <eob>
My nine siblings, all older than me except <eol> for my younger sister and brother, <eob> would never see this coming. <eob>
My parents would never imagine <eol> I'd do such a thing in a million years. <eob>
By the time they all realized <eol> what I'd done and where I was going, <eob> I'd have left the planet. <eob>
In my absence, my parents <eol> would growl to each other <eob> that I was never to set foot in their home again. <eob>
My four aunties and two <eol> uncles who lived down the road <eob> would shout and gossip <eol> amongst themselves <eob> about how I had scandalized the entire bloodline. <eob>
I was going to be a pariah. <eob>
"Go," I softly whispered <eol> to the transporter, <eob> stamping my foot. <eob>
The thin metal rings I wore around each ankle <eol> jingled noisily, <eob> but I stamped my foot again. <eob>
Once on, the transporter worked best <eol> when I didn't touch it. <eob>
"Go," I said again, sweat <eol> forming on my brow. <eob>
When nothing moved, <eob> I chanced giving the two large <eol> suitcases sitting atop the force field a shove. <eob>
They moved smoothly, and I breathed <eol> another sigh of relief. <eob>
At least some luck was on my side. <eob>
So, in a distant future part of Africa, <eob> Binti is a mathematical genius <eol> of the Himba ethnic group. <eob>
She's been accepted into a university <eol> on another planet, <eob> and she's decided to go. <eob>
Carrying the blood <eol> of her people in her veins, <eob> adorned with the teachings, ways, <eol> even the land on her very skin, <eob> Binti leaves the earth. <eob>
As the story progresses, <eol> she becomes not other, but more. <eob>
This idea of leaving <eol> but bringing and then becoming more <eob> is at one of the hearts <eol> of Afrofuturism, <eob> or you can simply call it a different <eol> type of science fiction. <eob>
I can best explain the difference <eol> between classic science fiction and Afrofuturism <eob> if I used the octopus analogy. <eob>
Like humans, <eob> octopuses are some of the most <eol> intelligent creatures on earth. <eob>
However, octopus intelligence <eol> evolved from a different evolutionary line, <eob> separate from that of human beings, <eob> so the foundation is different. <eob>
The same can be said about the foundations <eol> of various forms of science fiction. <eob>
So much of science fiction speculates <eob> about technologies, societies, social issues, <eob> what's beyond our planet, <eol> what's within our planet. <eob>
Science fiction is one of the greatest <eol> and most effective forms <eob> of political writing. <eob>
It's all about the question, <eol> "What if?" <eob> Still, not all science fiction <eol> has the same ancestral bloodline, <eob> that line being Western-rooted science fiction, <eob> which is mostly white and male. <eob>
We're talking Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne, <eob> H.G. Wells, George Orwell, <eol> Robert Heinlein, etc. <eob>
So what if a Nigerian-American wrote science fiction? <eob>
Growing up, I didn't read <eol> much science fiction. <eob>
I couldn't relate to these stories <eob> preoccupied with xenophobia, colonization <eol> and seeing aliens as others. <eob>
And I saw no reflection of anyone <eol> who looked like me in those narratives. <eob>
In the "Binti" novella trilogy, <eob> Binti leaves the planet to seek education <eol> from extraterrestrials. <eob>
She goes out as she is, <eob> looking the way she looks, <eob> carrying her cultures, <eob> being who she is. <eob>
I was inspired to write this story <eob> not because I was following a line <eol> of classic space opera narratives, <eob> but because of blood that runs deep, <eob> family, cultural conflict <eob> and the need to see an African girl <eol> leave the planet on her own terms. <eob>
My science fiction had <eol> different ancestors, <eob> African ones. <eob>
So I'm Nigerian-American. <eob> I was born to two Nigerian <eol> immigrant parents <eob> and raised in the United States, <eob> one of the birthplaces <eol> of classic science fiction. <eob>
However, it was my Nigerian heritage <eol> that led me to write science fiction. <eob>
Specifically I cite those family <eol> trips to Nigeria in the late '90s. <eob>
I'd been taking trips back to Nigeria <eol> with my family since I was very young. <eob>
These early trips inspired me. <eob>
Hence the first story that I ever even wrote <eol> took place in Nigeria. <eob>
I wrote mainly magical realism and fantasy <eob> inspired by my <eol> love of Igbo <eob> and other West African traditional <eol> cosmologies and spiritualities. <eob>
However, in the late '90s, <eob> I started noticing the role <eol> of technology in Nigeria: <eob> cable TV and cell phones in the village, <eob> 419 scammers occupying <eol> the cybercafes, <eob> the small generator connected <eol> to my cousin's desktop computer <eob> because the power was always <eol> going on and off. <eob>
And my Americanness othered me enough <eob> to be intrigued by these things <eol> that most Nigerians saw as normal. <eob>
My intrigue eventually gave birth to stories. <eob>
I started opening strange doors. <eob>
What if aliens came to Lagos, Nigeria? <eob>
This is an excerpt <eol> from my novel, "Lagoon." <eob>
Everybody saw it, <eob> all over the world. <eob>
That was a real introduction to the great mess <eol> happening in Lagos, <eob> Nigeria, West Africa, Africa, here. <eob>
Because so many people in Lagos <eol> had portable, chargeable, <eob> glowing, vibrating, chirping, <eol> tweeting, communicating, connected devices, <eob> practically everything was recorded <eol> and posted online in some way, <eob> somehow, <eob> quickly. <eob>
The modern human world <eol> is connected like a spider's web. <eob>
The world was watching. <eob> It watched in fascinated horror <eob> for information, <eob> but mostly for entertainment. <eob>
Footage of what was happening dominated <eol> every international news source, <eob> video-sharing website, social network, <eol> circle, pyramid and trapezoid. <eob>
But the story goes deeper. <eob>
It is in the mud, <eob> the dirt, <eob> the earth, <eob> in the fond memory of the soily cosmos. <eob>
It is in the always mingling <eol> past, present and future. <eob>
It is in the water. <eob>
It is in the powerful spirits <eol> and ancestors who dwelled in Lagos. <eob>
It is in the hearts and minds <eol> of the people of Lagos. <eob> Change begets change. <eob> The alien Ayodele knew it. <eob>
All her people know it. <eob>
So, this is a voice of Udide, <eol> the supreme spider artist, <eob> who is older than dirt <eob> and lives in the dirt beneath <eol> the city of Lagos, <eob> listening and commenting <eob> and weaving the story <eol> of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos. <eob>
In the end, the great spider <eol> who was the size of a house <eob> and responsible for weaving the past, <eol> present and future <eob> decides to come forth <eol> and be a part of the story. <eob>
Like Udide, the spider artist, <eob> African science fiction's blood runs deep <eob> and it's old, <eob> and it's ready to come forth, <eob> and when it does, <eob> imagine the new technologies, ideas <eol> and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire. <eob>
For Africans, homegrown science <eol> fiction can be a will to power. <eob>
What if? <eob> It's a powerful question. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever heard of typosquatting? <eob> Well, typosquatting is where companies like Google <eob> post advertisements on websites <eol> that are commonly miskeyed, <eob> and then they sit back and rake in millions <eob> banking on the fact that you're visiting <eol> something like gmale.com <eob> or mikerowesoft.com. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It just seems kind of silly, doesn't it? <eob>
How about this? <eob> On February 28, an engineer at Amazon <eob> made a similar, seemingly small key error. <eob>
Only I say seemingly small <eob> because this one little typo <eol> on Amazon's supercode <eob> produced a massive internet slowdown <eob> that cost the company over 160 million dollars <eob> in the span of just four hours. <eob>
But this is actually really scary. <eob>
You see, recently, an employee <eol> at the New England Compound, <eob> which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer, <eob> didn't clean a lab properly <eob> and now 76 people have died <eob> and 700 more <eol> have contracted meningitis. <eob>
I mean, these examples are crazy, right? <eob>
When did we come to live in a world <eol> where these types of typos, <eob> common errors, this do-your-best attitude <eol> or just good enough was acceptable? <eob>
At some point, we've stopped <eol> valuing perfection, <eob> and now, these are the type <eol> of results that we get. <eob>
You see, I think that we should <eol> all seek perfection, <eob> all the time, <eob> and I think we need <eol> to get to it quick. <eob>
You see, I run a training facility <eob> where I'm responsible for the education <eol> of professional delivery drivers, <eob> and in my line of work, <eob> we have a unique understanding <eol> of the cost of failure, <eob> the cost of just 99 percent, <eob> because in the world <eol> of professional driving, <eob> just 99 percent of the job means somebody dies. <eob>
Look, a hundred people die every day <eob> due to vehicular crashes. <eob> Think about that for a second. <eob> That's like the equivalent <eol> of four commercial airliners <eob> crashing every week, <eob> yet we still can't convince ourselves <eol> to pay perfect attention behind the wheel. <eob>
So I teach my drivers to value perfection. <eob>
It's why I have them memorize <eob> our 131-word defensive driving program <eob> perfectly, <eob> and then I have them rewrite it. <eob>
One wrong word, one misspelled word, <eol> one missing comma, it's a failed test. <eob>
It's why I do uniform inspections daily. <eob>
Undershirts are white <eol> or brown only, <eob> shoes are black or brown polished leather <eob> and frankly, don't come to my class wrinkled <eol> and expect me to let you stay. <eob>
It's why I insist <eol> that my drivers are on time. <eob>
Don't be late, not to class, <eol> not to break, not to lunch. <eob>
When you're supposed <eol> to be somewhere, be there. <eob>
You see, I do this so that my students understand <eob> that when I'm training them <eol> to drive a car and I say, <eob> "Clear every intersection," <eob> they understand that I mean every traffic <eol> signal, every cross street, <eob> every side street, every parking lot, <eol> every dirt road, every crosswalk, <eob> every intersection without fail. <eob>
Now, new students will often ask me <eob> why my class is so difficult, <eol> strict, or uniform, <eob> and the answer is simple. <eob>
You see, perfectionism is an attitude <eol> developed in the small things <eob> and then applied to the larger job. <eob>
So basically, if you can't get <eol> the little things right, <eob> you're going to fail when it counts, <eob> and when you're driving a car, it counts. <eob>
A car traveling at 55 miles an hour <eob> covers the length <eol> of an American football field <eob> in just under four and a half seconds, <eob> but just so happens to be <eol> the same amount of time <eob> it takes the average person <eol> to check a text message. <eob>
So I don't allow my drivers <eol> to lose focus, <eob> and I don't accept anything less <eol> than perfection out of them. <eob>
And you know what? <eob> I'm tired of everybody else accepting <eol> 99 percent as good enough. <eob>
I mean, being less than perfect <eol> has real consequences, doesn't it? <eob> Think about it. <eob> If the makers of our credit cards <eol> were only 99.9 percent effective, <eob> there would be over a million cards in circulation today <eob> that had the wrong information <eol> on the magnetic strip on the back. <eob>
How about this? <eob> Or, if the Webster's Dictionary <eol> was only 99.9 percent accurate, <eob> it would have 470 <eol> misspelled words in it. <eob> If our doctors were only 99.9 percent correct, <eob> then every year, 4,453,000 prescriptions would be written incorrectly, <eob> and probably even scarier, <eob> 11 newborns would be given to the wrong parents every day <eob> in the United States. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And those are just the odds, thank you. <eob>
The reality is that the US government <eol> crashed a 1.4-billion-dollar aircraft <eob> because the maintenance crew only did <eol> 99 percent of their job. <eob>
Someone forgot to check a sensor. <eob>
The reality is that 16 people <eol> are now dead, <eob> 180 have now been injured, <eob> and 34 million cars are being recalled <eob> because the producers of a car airbag produced <eol> and distributed a product <eob> that they thought was, <eol> you know, good enough. <eob>
The reality is that medical errors <eob> are now the third leading <eol> cause of death in America. <eob>
250,000 people die each year <eob> because somebody who probably thought <eol> they were doing their job good enough <eob> messed up. <eob>
And you don't believe me? <eob>
Well, I can certainly understand why. <eob>
You see, it's hard for us <eol> to believe anything these days <eob> when less than 50 percent <eol> of what news pundits say <eob> is actually grounded in fact. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So it comes down to this: <eob> trying our best is not good enough. <eob> So how do we change? <eob> We seek perfection <eob> and settle for nothing less. <eob>
Now, I know. I need to give you a minute on that, <eob> because I know what you've been told. <eob>
It probably goes something like, <eol> perfection is impossible for humans, <eob> so therefore, seeking perfection <eol> will not only ruin your self-esteem <eob> but it will render you a failure. <eob>
But there's the irony. <eob>
See, today we're all so afraid <eol> of that word failure, <eob> but the truth is, we need to fail. <eob> Failure is a natural stepping stone <eol> towards perfection, <eob> but at some point, because we became <eol> so afraid of that idea of failure <eob> and so afraid of that idea <eol> of perfection, <eob> we dismissed it because of what might happen <eol> to our egos when we fall short. <eob>
I mean, do you really think <eol> that failure's going to ruin you? <eob>
Or is that just the easy answer <eol> that gets us slow websites, <eob> scary healthcare <eol> and dangerous roads? <eob>
I mean, are you ready <eol> to make perfection the bad guy in all this? <eob>
Look, failure and imperfection <eol> are basically the same thing. <eob>
We all know that imperfection <eol> exists all around us. <eob>
Nothing and nobody is perfect. <eob>
But at some point, because <eol> it was too difficult or too painful, <eob> we decided to dismiss our natural ability <eol> to deal with failure <eob> and replace it with a lower acceptance level. <eob>
And now we're all forced to sit back <eob> and just accept this new norm <eol> or good-enough attitude <eob> and the results that come with it. <eob>
So even with all that said, <eob> people will still tell me, you know, <eob> "Didn't the medical staff, <eol> the maintenance crew, the engineer, <eob> didn't they try their best, <eol> and isn't that good enough?" <eob> Well, truthfully, not for me <eol> and especially not in these examples. <eob>
Yeah, but, you know, trying to be <eol> perfect is so stressful, right? <eob>
And, you know, Oprah talked about it, <eol> universities study it, <eob> I bet your high school counselor <eol> even warned you about it. <eob>
Stress is bad for us, isn't it? <eob>
Well, maybe, <eob> but to say that seeking perfection <eol> is too stressful <eob> is like saying that exercise <eol> is too exhausting. <eob>
In both cases, if you want the results, <eol> you've got to endure the pain. <eob>
So truthfully, saying that seeking <eol> perfection is too stressful <eob> is just an excuse to be lazy. <eob>
But here's the really scary part. <eob>
Today, doctors, therapists <eob> and the nearly 10-billion- dollar-a-year self-help industry <eob> are all advocating against the idea <eol> of perfection <eob> under this guise that somehow <eol> not trying to be perfect <eob> will save your self-esteem <eol> and protect your ego. <eob>
But, see, it's not working, <eob> because the self-help industry <eol> today has a higher recidivism rate <eob> because it's more focused on teaching <eol> you how to accept being a failure <eob> and lower your acceptance level <eob> than it is about pushing you <eol> to be perfect. <eob>
See, these doctors, therapists <eol> and self-help gurus <eob> are all focused on a symptom <eol> and not the illness. <eob>
The true illness in our society today <eol> is our unwillingness to confront failure. <eob>
See, we're more comfortable <eol> resting on our efforts <eob> than we are with focusing <eol> on our results. <eob>
Like at Dublin Jerome High School in Ohio, <eob> where they name 30 percent of a graduating <eol> class valedictorian. <eob>
I mean, come on, right? <eob>
Somebody had the highest GPA. <eob>
I guarantee you it wasn't a 72-way tie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But, see, we're more comfortable <eol> offering up an equal outcome <eob> than we are with confronting the failure, <eol> the loser or the underachiever. <eob>
And when everybody gets a prize, <eol> everybody advances, <eob> or everybody gets a pay raise despite results, <eob> the perfectionist in all of us <eol> is left to wonder, <eob> what do I have to do to get better? <eob>
How do I raise above the crowd? <eob>
And see, if we continue <eol> to cultivate this culture, <eob> where nobody fails or nobody is told <eol> that they will fail, <eob> then nobody's going to reach <eol> their potential, either. <eob>
Failure and loss <eol> are necessary for success. <eob>
It's the acceptance of failure that's not. <eob>
Michelangelo is credited with saying <eol> that the greatest danger for most of us <eob> is not that our aim is too high <eol> and we miss it, <eob> but it's too low and we reach it. <eob>
Failure should be a motivating force, <eob> not some type of pathetic excuse to give up. <eob>
So I have an idea. <eob>
Instead of defining perfectionism <eol> as a destructive intolerance for failure, <eob> why don't we try <eol> giving it a new definition? <eob>
Why don't we try defining perfectionism <eol> as a willingness to do what is difficult <eob> to achieve what is right? <eob>
You see, then we can agree <eob> that failure is a good thing <eol> in our quest for perfection, <eob> and when we seek perfection <eol> without fear of failure, <eob> just think about what we can accomplish. <eob>
Like NBA superstar Steph Curry: <eob> he hit 77 three-point shots in a row. <eob> Think about that. <eob> The guy was able to accurately <eol> deliver a nine-and-a-half inch ball <eob> through an 18-inch rim that's suspended 10 feet in the air <eob> from nearly 24 feet away <eob> almost 80 times without failure. <eob>
Or like the computer programmers <eob> at the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, <eob> who have now written a program <eob> that uses 420,000 lines <eol> of near-flawless code <eob> to control every aspect of igniting <eol> four million pounds of rocket fuel <eob> and putting a 120-ton spaceship into orbit. <eob>
Or maybe like the researchers <eob> at the Children's Mercy Hospital <eol> in Kansas City, Missouri, <eob> who have now developed a device <eob> that can complete human genome <eol> coding in just 26 hours. <eob>
So this device is able <eol> to diagnose genetic diseases <eob> in babies and newborns sooner, <eob> giving doctors an opportunity <eol> to start treatments earlier <eob> and potentially save the baby's life. <eob>
See, that's what happens <eol> when we seek perfection. <eob>
So maybe we should be more <eol> like the professional athlete, <eob> or we should be more like <eol> that tireless programmer, <eob> or like that passionate researcher. <eob>
Then we could stop fearing failure <eob> and we could stop living in a world <eol> filled with the consequences <eob> of good enough. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"Judge, I want to tell you something. <eob>
I want to tell you something. <eob>
I been watching you <eob> and you're not two-faced. <eob>
You treat everybody the same." <eob>
That was said to me <eol> by a transgender prostitute <eob> who before I had gotten on the bench <eob> had fired her public defender, <eob> insulted the court officer <eob> and yelled at the person <eol> sitting next to her, <eob> "I don't know what you're looking at. <eob>
I look better than the girl you're <eol> with. "(Laughter) <eob> She said this to me <eob> after I said her male name low enough <eob> so that it could be picked up by the record, <eob> but I said her female name loud enough <eob> so that she could walk down the aisle <eol> towards counselor's table with dignity. <eob>
This is procedural justice, <eol> also known as procedural fairness, <eob> at its best. <eob>
You see, I am the daughter <eol> of an African-American garbageman <eob> who was born in Harlem <eob> and spent his summers in the segregated South. <eob>
Soy la hija de una peluquera dominicana. <eob>
I do that to make sure <eol> you're still paying attention. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I'm the daughter of a Dominican beautician <eob> who came to this country <eol> for a better life for her unborn children. <eob>
My parents taught me, you treat everyone <eol> you meet with dignity and respect, <eob> no matter how they look, <eol> no matter how they dress, <eob> no matter how they spoke. <eob>
You see, the principles of fairness <eob> were taught to me at an early age, <eob> and unbeknownst to me, <eol> it would be the most important lesson <eob> that I carried with me <eol> to the Newark Municipal Court bench. <eob>
And because I was dragged <eol> off the playground <eob> at the early age of 10 <eol> to translate for family members <eob> as they began to migrate <eol> to the United States, <eob> I understand how daunting it <eol> can be for a person, a novice, <eob> to navigate any government system. <eob>
Every day across America <eol> and around the globe, <eob> people encounter our courts, <eob> and it is a place that is foreign, intimidating <eob> and often hostile towards them. <eob>
They are confused <eol> about the nature of their charges, <eob> annoyed about their encounters with the police <eob> and facing consequences <eol> that might impact their relationships, their finances <eob> and even their liberty. <eob>
Let me paint a picture for you <eob> of what it's like for the average <eol> person who encounters our courts. <eob>
First, they're annoyed as they're <eol> probed going through court security. <eob>
They finally get through court security, <eol> they walk around the building, <eob> they ask different people the same question <eob> and get different answers. <eob>
When they finally get to where <eol> they're supposed to be, <eob> it gets really bad <eol> when they encounter the courts. <eob>
What would you think if I told you <eob> that you could improve <eol> people's court experience, <eob> increase their compliance with the law <eob> and court orders, <eob> all the while increasing <eol> the public's trust <eob> in the justice system <eob> with a simple idea? <eob>
Well, that simple idea is procedural justice <eob> and it's a concept that says <eob> that if people perceive <eol> they are treated fairly <eob> and with dignity and respect, <eob> they'll obey the law. <eob>
Well, that's what Yale professor Tom Tyler found <eob> when he began to study <eol> as far back in the '70s <eob> why people obey the law. <eob>
He found that if people <eol> see the justice system <eob> as a legitimate authority <eol> to impose rules and regulations, <eob> they would follow them. <eob>
and with dignity and respect, <eob> His research concluded <eob> that people would be satisfied <eob> with the judge's rulings, <eob> even when the judge ruled against them, <eob> if they perceived that they were treated fairly <eob>
And that perception <eol> of fairness begins with what? <eob>
Begins with how judges <eol> speak to court participants. <eob>
Now, being a judge <eob> is sometimes like having a reserve seat <eol> to a tragic reality show <eob> that has no commercial interruptions <eob> and no season finale. <eob> It's true. <eob> People come before me handcuffed, <eob> drug-sick, depressed, hungry <eob> and mentally ill. <eob>
When I saw that their need for help <eob> was greater than my fear <eol> of appearing vulnerable on the bench, <eob> I realized that not only did <eol> I need to do something, <eob> but that in fact I could do something. <eob>
The good news is is that the principles <eol> of procedural justice are easy <eob> and can be implemented <eol> as quickly as tomorrow. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> The even better news, <eol> that it can be done for free. <eob> The first principle is voice. <eob>
Give people an opportunity to speak, <eob> even when you're not <eol> going to let them speak. <eob>
Explain it. <eob> "Sir, I'm not letting you speak right now. <eob>
You don't have an attorney. <eob>
I don't want you to say anything <eol> that's going to hurt your case." <eob> For me, assigning essays <eol> to defendants <eob> has been a tremendous way <eol> of giving them voice. <eob>
I recently gave an 18-year-old <eol> college student an essay. <eob>
He lamented his underage drinking charge. <eob>
As he stood before me reading his essay, <eob> his voice cracking <eol> and his hands trembling, <eob> he said that he worried <eol> that he had become an alcoholic like his mom, <eob> who had died a couple of months <eol> prior due to alcohol-related liver disease. <eob>
You see, assigning a letter <eol> to my father, a letter to my son, <eob> "If I knew then what I know now ..." <eob> "If I believed one positive thing about myself, <eob> how would my life be different?" <eob> gives the person an opportunity <eol> to be introspective, <eob> go on the inside, <eob> which is where all the answers are anyway. <eob>
But it also gives them an opportunity <eob> to share something with the court <eol> that goes beyond their criminal record <eob> and their charges. <eob>
The next principle is neutrality. <eob>
When increasing public trust <eob> in the justice system, <eob> neutrality is paramount. <eob>
The judge cannot be perceived <eol> to be favoring one side over the other. <eob>
The judge has to make a conscious decision <eol> not to say things like, <eob> "my officer," "my prosecutor," <eol> "my defense attorney." <eob> And this is challenging <eol> when we work in environments <eob> where you have people assigned to your courts, <eob> the same people coming in <eol> and out of your courts as well. <eob>
When I think of neutrality, <eob> I'm reminded of when I was <eol> a new Rutgers Law grad <eob> and freshly minted attorney, <eob> and I entered an arbitration <eol> and I was greeted by two grey-haired men <eob> who were joking about the last game <eol> of golf they played together <eob> and planning future social outings. <eob>
I knew my client couldn't get <eol> a fair shot in that forum. <eob>
The next principle is understand. <eob>
It is critical that court participants <eol> understand the process, <eob> the consequences of the process <eob> and what's expected of them. <eob>
I like to say that legalese <eol> is the language we use to confuse. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I am keenly aware <eol> that the people who appear before me, <eob> many of them have very little education <eob> and English is often their second language. <eob>
So I speak plain English in court. <eob>
A great example of this was when <eol> I was a young judge — <eob> oh no, I mean younger judge. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> When I was a younger judge, <eol> a senior judge comes to me, <eob> gives me a script <eol> and says, <eob> "If you think somebody <eol> has mental health issues, <eob> ask them these questions <eol> and you can get your evaluation." <eob> So the first time I saw someone <eob> who had what I thought <eol> was a mental health issue, <eob> I went for my script <eol> and I started to ask questions. <eob> "Um, sir, do you take psycho — um, psychotrop — <eob> psychotropic medication?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> You see, once people understand the question, <eob> they can give you valuable information <eob> that allows the court to make meaningful decisions <eob> about the cases that are before them. <eob>
The last principle is respect, <eob> that without it none of the other <eol> principles can work. <eob>
Now, respect can be as simple as, <eob> "Good afternoon, sir." <eol> "Good morning, ma'am." <eob> It's looking the person in the eye <eol> who is standing before you, <eob> especially when you're sentencing them. <eob>
It's when I say, "Um, <eol> how are you doing today? <eob>
And what's going on with you?" <eob> And not as a greeting, <eob> but as someone who is <eol> actually interested in the response. <eob>
Respect is the difference between saying, <eob> "Ma'am, are you having difficulty <eob> understanding the information in the paperwork?" <eob> versus, "You can read <eol> and write, can't you?" <eob> when you've realized <eol> there's a literacy issue. <eob>
And the good thing about respect <eol> is that it's contagious. <eob>
People see you being respectful <eol> to other folks <eob> and they impute that respect to themselves. <eob>
You see, that's what the transgender <eol> prostitute was telling me. <eob>
I'm judging you just as much as you think <eol> you may be judging me. <eob>
Now, I am not telling you what I think, <eob> I am telling you what I have lived, <eob> using procedural justice to change <eol> the culture at my courthouse <eob> and in the courtroom. <eob>
After sitting comfortably for seven months <eob> as a traffic court judge, <eob> I was advised that I was being moved <eol> to the criminal court, <eob> Part Two, criminal courtroom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, I need you to understand, <eob> this was not good news. <eob>
It was not. <eob> Part Two was known as <eol> the worst courtroom in the city, <eob> some folks would even say in the state. <eob>
It was your typical urban courtroom <eol> with revolving door justice, <eob> you know, your regular lineup <eol> of low-level offenders -- <eob> you know, the low-hanging fruit, <eob> the drug-addicted prostitute, <eob> the mentally ill homeless person <eol> with quality-of-life tickets, <eob> the high school dropout petty drug <eol> dealer and the misguided young people -- <eob> you know, those folks doing a life sentence <eob> 30 days at a time. <eob>
Fortunately, the City of Newark <eol> decided that Newarkers deserved better, <eob> and they partnered with the Center <eol> for Court Innovation <eob> and the New Jersey Judiciary <eob> to create Newark Community Solutions, <eob> a community court program <eob> that provided alternative sanctions. <eob>
This means now a judge <eob> can sentence a defendant to punishment <eol> with assistance. <eob>
So a defendant who would otherwise <eol> get a jail sentence <eob> would now be able to get <eol> individual counseling sessions, <eob> group counseling sessions <eol> as well as community giveback, <eob> which is what we call community service. <eob>
The only problem is <eol> that this wonderful program <eob> was now coming to Newark <eol> and was going to be housed where? <eob>
Part Two, criminal courtroom. <eob>
And the attitudes there were terrible. <eob>
And the reason that the attitudes <eol> were terrible there <eob> was because everyone <eol> who was sent there <eob> understood they were <eol> being sent there as punishment. <eob>
The officers who were facing <eol> disciplinary actions at times, <eob> the public defender and prosecutor <eob> felt like they were doing a 30-day jail sentence <eol> on their rotation, <eob> the judges understood <eol> they were being hazed <eob> just like a college sorority or fraternity. <eob>
I was once told <eol> that an attorney who worked there <eob> referred to the defendants <eol> as "the scum of the earth" <eob> and then had to represent them. <eob>
I would hear things from folks like, <eob> "Oh, how could you work with those people? <eob>
They're so nasty. <eob>
You're a judge, not a social worker." <eob> But the reality is that as a society, <eol> we criminalize social ills, <eob> then sent people to a judge and say, "Do something." <eob> I decided that I was going <eol> to lead by example. <eob>
So my first foray into the approach <eol> came when a 60-something-year-old man <eob> appeared before me handcuffed. <eob>
His head was lowered and his body <eol> was showing the signs of drug withdrawal. <eob>
I asked him how long he had been addicted, <eol> and he said, "30 years." <eob> And I asked him, "Do you have any kids?" <eob> And he said, "Yeah, <eol> I have a 32-year-old son." <eob> And I said, "Oh, so you've never had the opportunity <eob> to be a father to your son <eol> because of your addiction." <eob> He began to cry. <eob>
I said, "You know what, <eol> I'm going to let you go home, <eob> and you'll come back in two weeks, <eob> and when you come back, we'll give you some assistance <eol> for your addiction." <eob> Surprisingly, two weeks passed <eol> and he was sitting the courtroom. <eob>
When he came up, he said, "Judge, <eol> I came back to court <eob> because you showed me more love <eol> than I had for myself." <eob> And I thought, my God, <eol> he heard love from the bench? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I could do this all day. <eob> Because the reality is that when <eol> the court behaves differently, <eob> then naturally people <eol> respond differently. <eob>
The court becomes a place <eol> you can go to for assistance, <eob> like the 60-something-year-old <eol> schizophrenic homeless woman <eob> who was in distress <eob> and fighting with the voices in her head, <eob> and barges into court, <eol> and screams, "Judge! <eob>
I just came by to see how you were doing." <eob> I had been monitoring her case <eol> for a couple of months, <eob> her compliance with her medication, <eob> and had just closed out her case <eol> a couple of weeks ago. <eob>
On this day she needed help, <eob> and she came to court. <eob>
And after four hours of coaxing <eol> by the judge, <eob> the police officers and the staff, <eob> she is convinced to get into the ambulance <eob> that will take her to crisis unit <eob> so that she can get her medication. <eob>
People become connected <eol> to their community <eob> when the court changes, <eob> like the 50-something-year-old man <eob> who told me, "Community service <eol> was terrible, Judge. <eob>
I had to clean the park, <eol> and it was full of empty heroin envelopes, <eob> and the kids had to play there." <eob> As he wrung his hands, he confessed, <eob> "Judge, I realized that it was my fault, <eob> because I used that same park <eol> to get high, <eob> and before you sent me there <eol> to do community service, <eob> I had never gone to the park <eol> when I wasn't high, <eob> so I never noticed the children playing there." <eob> Every addict in the courtroom lowered their head. <eob>
Who better to teach that lesson? <eob>
It helps the court reset its relationship <eol> with the community, <eob> like with the 20-something-year-old guy <eob> who gets a job interview <eol> through the court program. <eob>
He gets a job interview <eol> at an office cleaning company, <eob> and he comes back <eol> to court to proudly say, <eob> "Judge, I even worked <eol> in my suit after the interview, <eob> because I wanted the guy <eol> to see how bad I wanted the job." <eob> It's what happens when a person <eol> in authority <eob> treats you with dignity and respect, <eob> like the 40-something-year-old guy <eol> who struts down the aisle <eob> and says, "Judge, do you notice anything different?" <eob> And when I look up, <eob> he's pointing at his new teeth <eob> that he was able to get after getting a referral from the program, <eob> but he was able to get them to replace the old teeth <eob> that he lost as a result of years of heroin addiction. <eob>
When he looks in the mirror, <eob> now he sees somebody who is worth saving. <eob>
You see, I have a dream <eob> and that dream is that judges <eol> will use these tools <eob> to revolutionize the communities <eol> that they serve. <eob>
Now, these tools are not miracle <eol> cure-alls, <eob> but they get us light-years closer <eol> to where we want to be, <eob> and where we want to be is a place <eol> that people enter our halls of justice <eob> and believe they will be treated <eol> with dignity and respect <eob> and know that justice <eol> will be served there. <eob>
Imagine that, a simple idea. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Hi, I'm Jack, <eob> and I'm transgender. <eob>
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts <eob> that might be running <eol> through your head right now. <eob> "Transgender? <eob>
Wait, does that mean that they're actually <eol> a man or actually a woman?" <eob> "I wonder if he's had the surgery yet ... <eob> Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch. <eob>
Look to the right, <eol> that's a safe place to look. <eob> "" Yes, I knew it! <eob>
No real man has hips like those. "" <eob> My friend's daughter is transgender — <eob> I wonder if they know each other. <eob> "" <eob> Oh my gosh, he is so brave. <eob>
I would totally support his right <eol> to use the men's bathroom. <eob>
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom? <eob>
How does he have sex?" <eob>
OK, OK, let's stop <eol> those hypothetical questions <eob> before we get too close for my comfort. <eob>
I mean, don't get me wrong, <eob> I did come here today to share <eol> my personal experiences being transgender, <eob> but I did not wake up this morning <eol> wanting to tell an entire audience <eob> about my sex life. <eob>
Of course, that's the problem <eol> with being trans, right? <eob>
People are pretty much always wondering <eol> how we have sex <eob> and what kind of equipment we're <eol> working with below the belt. <eob>
Being trans is awkward. <eob>
And not just because the gender <eol> I was assigned at birth <eob> mismatches the one I really am. <eob>
Being trans is awkward. <eob> because everyone else gets awkward <eol> when they're around me. <eob>
People who support me and all other trans <eol> people wholeheartedly <eob> are often so scared <eol> to say to wrong thing, <eob> so embarrassed to not know <eol> what they think they should, <eob> that they never ask. <eob>
Part of what was so nerve-racking about coming <eol> out as transgender <eob> was knowing that people wouldn't know what I meant. <eob>
And when someone comes out as gay, <eob> people know what that means, <eob> but when you come out as trans, <eob> you have to face the misconceptions <eob> that will color other <eol> people's impressions of you <eob> even after you've educated them ... <eob> And you will have to educate them. <eob>
When I came out, <eob> I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document <eob> with a zip-file attachment <eol> of music and videos <eob> that I sent to every single person <eol> I came out to. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I kept it in my email signature <eol> for months afterwards, <eob> because you also don't ever stop coming out. <eob>
I came out to the accountant <eol> helping me with my taxes <eob> and the TSA agents who didn't know <eol> which one of them should pat me down, <eob> the man or the woman. <eob>
I mean, I just came out <eol> to everyone watching this. <eob>
When I came out <eob> to my dad, <eob> to my great relief, he was totally cool <eol> with me being trans, <eob> but as soon as I started talking <eol> about physically transitioning, <eob> he freaked. <eob>
And I quickly realized it was because <eol> he, like so many other people, <eob> think that physical transition <eol> means just one thing: <eob> the surgery. <eob>
Now, listen, <eob> if there were one magical surgery <eob> that could turn me into a tall, muscular, <eob> societally perfect image of a man overnight, <eob> I'd sign up in a heartbeat. <eob>
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. <eob>
There are dozens of different <eol> gender-affirming surgeries <eob> from chest surgeries <eol> to bottom surgeries <eob> to facial feminization <eol> and mansculpting. <eob>
Many trans people will only ever undergo <eol> one procedure in their lifetime, if that. <eob>
Maybe because they don't personally <eol> feel the need <eob> but also because they're expensive, <eob> and health insurance is only beginning to cover them. <eob>
Instead, the first step for a trans person <eol> seeking physical transition <eob> is usually hormone replacement therapy. <eob>
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice <eol> and some sparse whiskers on my neck <eob> and a giant pimple on my chin. <eob>
Basically, they put you through <eol> a second puberty ... <eob> it's a blast. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, because our transitions <eol> are slower and steadier <eob> than historic misconceptions <eol> can lead people to believe, <eob> there can be some confusion <eob> about when to call someone <eol> by their new name and pronouns. <eob>
There's no distinct point <eol> in physical transition <eob> at which a trans person becomes <eol> their true gender. <eob>
As soon as they tell you <eol> their new name and pronouns, <eob> that's when you start using them. <eob>
It can be difficult to make the change. <eob>
You might slip up here and there; <eob> I've slipped up myself <eol> with other trans people. <eob>
But I always think to myself, <eob> if we can change <eol> from calling Puff Daddy to P. Diddy, <eob> and if we apologize profusely <eol> when we've used the wrong gender pronoun <eob> for someone's pet cat -- <eob> I mean, I think we can make the same effort <eob> for the real humans in our lives. <eob>
Now, there is no topic that makes <eol> other people more awkward about trans people <eob> than public bathrooms. <eob>
Ah, the bathrooms -- <eob> the latest political flash point <eol> for LGBT opponents. <eob>
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms: <eob> more US congressmen <eol> have been convicted of assaulting someone in a public bathroom <eob> than trans people have been. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The truth is we trans people are so much more scared <eol> of you than you are of us. <eob>
It's a huge point of discussion <eol> in trans communities <eob> about which bathroom <eol> to start using and when, <eob> so we don't attract attention <eol> that could lead to violence against us. <eob>
I personally started using the men's room <eob> when I started getting confused <eol> and frightened looks in the women's room, <eob> even though I was petrified <eol> to start going into the men's room. <eob>
And often we opt to just not <eol> go to the bathroom at all. <eob>
A 2015 national survey <eol> of trans people <eob> found that eight percent of us <eol> had had a urinary tract infection <eob> in the past year <eob> as a result of avoiding restrooms. <eob>
These bathroom bills <eol> aren't protecting anyone. <eob>
All they're doing <eob> is ensuring that when trans people <eol> are assaulted in bathrooms, <eob> the law will no longer be on our side <eol> when we report it. <eob>
Being trans means a daily onslaught <eol> of these misconceptions. <eob>
And I have it pretty easy. <eob>
I am a white, able-bodied guy <eob> sitting nearly at the peak <eol> of privilege mountain. <eob>
For non-binary people, <eob> for trans women, <eob> for trans people of color, <eob> it is so much harder. <eob>
So I've given you a starter pack <eol> of trans knowledge <eob> that I hope will lead <eol> to more learning on your own. <eob>
Talk to trans people. <eob> Listen to us. <eob> Amplify our voices. <eob> Take the heat off of us and educate those around you <eob> so we don't have to every time. <eob>
Maybe someday, when I say, <eob> "Hi, I'm Jack, <eob> and I'm transgender," <eob> the only response I'll get is, <eob> "Hi, nice to meet you." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I've been doing some thinking. <eob> I'm going to kill my dad. <eob>
I called my sister. <eob>
I've been doing some thinking. <eob> "Listen, <eob>
I'm going to kill Dad. <eob>
I'm going to take him to Oregon, <eob> find some heroin, <eob> and give it to him." <eob>
My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia, <eob> or FTD. <eob>
It's a confusing disease <eol> that hits people in their 50s or 60s. <eob>
It can completely change <eol> someone's personality, <eob> making them paranoid and even violent. <eob>
My dad's been sick for a decade, <eob> but three years ago <eol> he got really sick, <eob> and we had to move him out of his house -- <eob> the house that I grew up in, <eob> the house that he built <eol> with his own hands. <eob>
My strapping, cool dad <eol> with the falsetto singing voice <eob> had to move into a facility <eol> for round-the-clock care <eob> when he was just 65. <eob>
At first my mom and sisters <eol> and I made the mistake <eob> of putting him <eol> in a regular nursing home. <eob>
It was really pretty; <eob> it had plush carpet <eol> and afternoon art classes <eob> and a dog named Diane. <eob>
But then I got a phone call. <eob>
"Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father." <eob>
"What?" <eob>
"Well, he threatened everybody <eol> with cutlery. <eob>
And then he yanked <eol> the curtains off the wall, <eob> and then he tried to throw plants <eol> out the window. <eob>
And then, well, he pulled all the old ladies <eol> out of their wheelchairs." <eob>
"All the old ladies?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"What <eob> a cowboy." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
After he got kicked out of there, <eob> we bounced him between <eol> a bunch of state-run facilities <eob> before finding a treatment center specifically <eol> for people with dementia. <eob>
At first, he kind of liked it, <eob> but over time his health declined, <eob> and one day I walked in <eob> and found him sitting hunched over <eol> on the ground wearing a onesie — <eob> those kinds of outfits <eol> that zip in the back. <eob>
I watched him for about an hour <eol> as he yanked at it, <eob> trying to find a way out of this thing. <eob>
And it's supposed to be practical, <eob> but to me it looked like a straightjacket. <eob>
And so I ran out. <eob>
I left him there. <eob>
I sat in my truck -- his old truck -- <eob> hunched over, <eob> this really deep guttural cry <eol> coming out of the pit of my belly. <eob>
I just couldn't believe that my father, <eob> the Adonis of my youth, <eob> my really dear friend, <eob> would think that this kind of life <eol> was worth living anymore. <eob>
We're programmed <eol> to prioritize productivity. <eob>
So when a person -- an Adonis in this case -- <eob> is no longer productive <eol> in the way we expect him to be, <eob> the way that he expects himself to be, <eob> what value does that life have left? <eob>
That day in the truck, <eob> all I could imagine <eol> was that my dad was being tortured <eob> and his body was the vessel <eol> of that torture. <eob>
I've got to get him out of that body. <eob>
I've got to get him out of that body; <eob> I'm going to kill Dad. <eob>
I call my sister. <eob>
"Beth," she said. <eob> "You don't want to live <eol> the rest of your life <eob> knowing that you killed your father. <eob>
And you'd be arrested I think, <eob> because he can't condone it. <eob>
And you don't even know <eol> how to buy heroin." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's true, I don't. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> The truth is we talk <eol> about his death a lot. <eob> When will it happen? What <eol> will it be like? <eob> But I wish that we would have talked about death <eol> when we were all healthy. <eob>
What does my best death look like? <eob> What does your best death look like? <eob> But my family didn't know to do that. <eob>
And my sister was right. <eob>
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin, <eob> but <eob> I've got to get him out of that body. <eob>
So I went to a psychic. <eob>
And then a priest, <eol> and then a support group, <eob> and they all said the same thing: <eob> sometimes people hang on when <eol> they're worried about loved ones. <eob>
Just tell them you're safe, and it's OK <eol> to go when you're ready. <eob>
So I went to see Dad. <eob> I found him <eob> hunched over <eob> on the ground in the onesie. <eob>
He was staring past me <eol> and just kind of looking at the ground. <eob>
I gave him a ginger ale <eob> and just started talking <eol> about nothing in particular, <eob> but as I was talking, he sneezed <eol> from the ginger ale. <eob> And the sneeze -- it jerked his body upright, <eob> sparking him back to life a little bit. <eob>
And he just kept drinking and sneezing and sparking, <eol> over and over and over again <eob> until it stopped. <eob>
And I heard, <eob> "Heheheheheh, <eob> heheheheheh... <eob> this is so fabulous. <eob>
This is so fabulous." <eob>
His eyes were open <eol> and he was looking at me, <eob> and I said, "Hi, Dad!" <eob> and he said, "Hiya, Beth." <eob> And I opened my mouth <eol> to tell him, right? <eob> "Dad, if you want to die, you can die. <eob>
We're all OK." <eob> But as I opened my mouth to tell him, <eob> all I could say was, "Dad! <eob>
I miss you." <eob> And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too." <eob> And then I just fell over <eol> because I'm just a mess. <eob>
So I fell over and I sat there with him <eob> because for the first time in a long time <eol> he seemed kind of OK. <eob>
And I memorized his hands, <eob> feeling so grateful that his spirit <eol> was still attached to his body. <eob>
And in that moment I realized <eob> I'm not responsible for this person. <eob>
I'm not his doctor, <eob> I'm not his mother, <eob> I'm certainly not his God, <eob> and maybe the best way to help him and me <eob> is to resume our roles <eol> as father and daughter. <eob>
And so we just sat there, <eob> calm and quiet like we've always done. <eob> Nobody was productive. <eob> Both of us are still strong. <eob>
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go, <eob> but I'll see you tomorrow." <eob>
"OK," he said. <eob> "Hey, <eob> this is a pretty nice hacienda." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, here's a prediction. <eob> If we get our cities right, <eob> we just might survive the 21st century. <eob>
We get them wrong, <eob> and we're done for. <eob>
Cities are the most extraordinary <eol> experiment in social engineering <eob> that we humans have ever come up with. <eob>
If you live in a city, <eob> and even if you live in a slum -- <eob> which 20 percent of the world's <eol> urban population does -- <eob> you're likely to be healthier, wealthier, better educated <eob> and live longer than your country cousins. <eob>
There's a reason why three million people <eol> are moving to cities <eob> every single week. <eob>
Cities are where the future happens first. <eob>
They're open, they're creative, <eol> they're dynamic, they're democratic, <eob> they're cosmopolitan, <eob> they're sexy. <eob>
They're the perfect antidote <eol> to reactionary nationalism. <eob>
But cities have a dark side. <eob>
They take up just three percent <eol> of the world's surface area, <eob> but they account for more than 75 percent <eol> of our energy consumption, <eob> and they emit 80 percent <eol> of our greenhouse gases. <eob>
There are hundreds of thousands <eol> of people who die in our cities <eob> every single year from violence, <eob> and millions more who are killed <eol> as a result of car accidents <eob> and pollution. <eob>
In Brazil, where I live, <eob> we've got 25 of the 50 most <eol> homicidal cities on the planet. <eob>
And a quarter of our cities <eol> have chronic water shortages -- <eob> and this, in a country with 20 percent <eol> of the known water reserves. <eob>
So cities are dual-edged. <eob> Part of the problem is that, <eob> apart from a handful <eol> of megacities in the West and the Far East, <eob> we don't know that much <eol> about the thousands of cities <eob> in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, <eob> where 90 percent of all future population <eol> growth is set to take place. <eob>
So why this knowledge gap? <eob>
Well, part of the problem <eob> is that we still see the world <eol> through the lens of nation-states. <eob>
We're still locked in a 17th-century paradigm <eob> of parochial national sovereignty. <eob>
And yet, in the 1600's, <eob> when nation-states were really <eol> coming into their own, <eob> less than one percent of the world's population <eob> resided in a city. <eob>
Today, it's 54 percent. <eob>
And by 2050, it will be closer <eol> to 70 percent. <eob>
So the world has changed. <eob>
We have these 193 nation-states, <eob> but we have easily as many cities <eol> that are beginning to rival them <eob> in power and influence. <eob>
Just look at New York. <eob> The Big Apple has 8.5 million people <eob> and an annual budget <eol> of 80 billion dollars. <eob>
Its GDP is 1.5 trillion, <eob> which puts it higher <eol> than Argentina and Australia, <eob> Nigeria and South Africa. <eob>
Its roughly 40,000 police officers <eob> means it has one of the largest police <eol> departments in the world, <eob> rivaling all but the largest nation-states. <eob>
But cities like New York <eob> or São Paulo <eob> or Johannesburg <eob> or Dhaka <eob> or Shanghai -- <eob> they're punching <eol> above their weight economically, <eob> but below their weight politically. <eob>
And that's going to have to change. <eob>
Cities are going to have <eol> to find their political voice <eob> if we want to change things. <eob>
Now, I want to talk to you <eol> a little bit about the risks <eob> that cities are facing -- <eob> some of the big mega-risks. <eob>
I'm also going to talk to you briefly <eol> about some of the solutions. <eob>
I'm going to do this <eol> using a big data visualization <eob> that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab <eol> and my institute, <eob> along with many, many others. <eob>
I want you to first imagine the world <eol> not as made up of nation-states, <eob> but as made up of cities. <eob>
What you see here is every single city <eob> with a population of a quarter million <eol> people or more. <eob>
Now, without going into technical detail, <eob> the redder the circle, <eol> the more fragile that city is, <eob> and the bluer the circle, <eol> the more resilient. <eob>
Fragility occurs when the social contract <eol> comes unstuck. <eob>
And what we tend to see is a convergence <eol> of multiple kinds of risks: <eob> income inequality, <eob> poverty, <eob> youth unemployment, <eob> different issues around violence, <eob> even exposure to droughts, cyclones and earthquakes. <eob>
Now obviously, some cities <eol> are more fragile than others. <eob>
The good news, if there is any, <eob> is that fragility is not <eol> a permanent condition. <eob>
Some cities that were once <eol> the most fragile cities in the world, <eob> like Bogotá in Colombia <eob> or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, <eob> have now fallen more <eol> around the national average. <eob>
The bad news is that <eol> fragility is deepening, <eob> especially in those parts of the world <eol> that are most vulnerable, <eob> in North Africa, the Middle East, <eob> in South Asia and Central Asia. <eob>
There, we're seeing fragility rising <eol> way beyond scales we've ever seen before. <eob>
When cities become too fragile <eol> they can collapse, <eob> tip over and fail. <eob>
And when that happens, <eob> we have explosive forms of migration: <eob> refugees. <eob>
There are more than 22 million refugees <eol> in the world today, <eob> more than at any other time <eol> since the second world war. <eob>
Now, there's not one refugee crisis; <eob> there are multiple refugee crises. <eob>
And contrary to what you might read in the news, <eob> the vast majority of refugees <eol> aren't fleeing from poor countries <eob> to wealthy countries, <eob> they're moving from poor cities <eol> into even poorer cities -- <eob> often, cities nearby. <eob>
Every single dot on this map <eol> represents an agonizing story <eob> of struggle and survival. <eob>
But I want to briefly tell you <eol> about what's not on that map, <eob> and that's internal displacement. <eob> There are more than 36 million people <eol> who have been internally displaced <eob> around the world. <eob>
These are people living <eol> in refugee-like conditions, <eob> but lacking the equivalent <eol> international protection and assistance. <eob>
And to understand their plight, <eob> I want to zoom in briefly on Syria. <eob>
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts <eol> in its history between 2007 and 2010. <eob>
More than 75 percent of its agriculture <eol> and 85 percent of its livestock <eob> were wiped out. <eob>
And in the process, over a million people <eol> moved into cities <eob> like Aleppo, <eol> Damascus and Homs. <eob>
As food prices began to rise, <eob> you also had equivalent levels <eol> of social unrest. <eob>
And when the regime <eol> of President Assad began cracking down, <eob> you had an explosion of <eob> refugees. <eob>
You also had over six million <eol> internally displaced people, <eob> many of whom when on to become <eob> refugees. <eob>
And they didn't just move <eol> to neighboring countries like Jordan <eob> or Lebanon or Turkey. <eob>
They also moved up north <eol> towards Western Europe. <eob>
See, over 1.4 million Syrians <eol> made the perilous journey <eob> through the Mediterranean and up through Turkey <eob> to find their way into two countries, primarily: <eob> Germany and Sweden. <eob>
Now, climate change -- <eob> not just drought, but also sea level rise, <eob> is probably one of the most severe <eol> existential threats <eob> that cities face. <eob>
That's because two-thirds <eol> of the world's cities are coastal. <eob>
Over 1.5 billion people live <eol> in low-lying, flood-prone coastal areas. <eob>
What you see here is a map <eol> that shows sea level rise <eob> in relation to changes in temperature. <eob>
Climate scientists predict <eol> that we're going to see <eob> anywhere between three and 30 feet <eol> of sea level rise <eob> this side of the century. <eob>
And it's not just low island nation-states <eol> that are going to suffer -- <eob> Kiribati or the Maldives <eol> or the Solomons or Sri Lanka -- <eob> and they will suffer, <eob> but also massive cities like Dhaka, <eob> like Hong Kong, <eob> like Shanghai. <eob>
Cities of 10, 20, <eol> 30 million people or more <eob> are literally going to be wiped off <eol> the face of this earth. <eob>
They're going to have to adapt, <eol> or they're going to die. <eob>
I want to take you also all the way <eol> over to the West, <eob> because this isn't just a problem <eol> in Asia or Africa or Latin America, <eob> this is a problem also in the West. <eob> This is Miami. <eob> Many of you know Miami <eol> is one of the wealthiest cities <eob> in the United States; <eob> it's also one of the most flood-prone. <eob>
That's been made painfully evident <eol> by natural disasters throughout 2017. <eob>
But Miami is built on porous limestone -- <eol> a swamp. <eob>
There's no way any kind of flood barrier <eob> is going to keep the water <eol> from seeping in. <eob>
As we scroll back, <eob> and we look across the Caribbean <eol> and along the Gulf, <eob> we begin to realize <eob> that those cities that have suffered <eol> worst from natural crises -- <eob> Port-au-Prince, <eol> New Orleans, Houston -- <eob> as severe and as awful <eol> as those situations have been, <eob> they're a dress rehearsal for what's to come. <eob>
No city is an island. <eob>
Every city is connected to its rural hinterland <eob> in complex ways -- <eob> often, in relation <eol> to the production of food. <eob>
I want to take you to the northern part <eol> of the Amazon, in Rondônia. <eob>
This is one of the world's largest <eol> terrestrial carbon sinks, <eob> processing millions of carbon every single year. <eob>
What you see here is a single road <eol> over a 30-year period. <eob>
On either side you see land <eol> being cleared for pasture, for cattle, <eob> but also for soy and sugar production. <eob>
You're seeing deforestation <eol> on a massive scale. <eob>
The red area here implies a net loss <eol> of forest over the last 14 years. <eob>
The blue, if you could see it -- <eol> there's not much -- <eob> implies there's been <eol> an incremental gain. <eob>
Now, as grim and gloomy <eol> as the situation is -- and it is -- <eob> there is a little bit of hope. <eob>
See, the Brazilian government, <eob> from the national to the state <eol> to the municipal level, <eob> has also introduced a whole range -- a lattice -- <eol> of parks and protected areas. <eob>
And while not perfect, <eol> and not always limiting encroachment, <eob> they have served to tamp back deforestation. <eob>
The same applies not just in Brazil <eol> but all across the Americas, <eob> into the United States, Canada and <eob> around the world. <eob>
So let's talk about solutions. <eob>
Despite climate denial <eol> at the highest levels, <eob> cities are taking action. <eob>
You know, when the US pulled <eol> out of the Paris Climate Agreement, <eob> hundreds of cities <eob> in the United States <eob> and thousands more <eob> around the world <eob> doubled down on their climate commitments. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And when the White House cracked down <eol> on so-called "undocumented migrants" <eob> in sanctuary cities, <eob> hundreds of cities and counties <eol> and states sat up in defiance <eob> and refused to enact that order. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So cities are and can take action. <eob>
But we're going to need <eol> to see a lot more of it, <eob> especially in the global south. <eob>
You see, parts of Africa <eol> and Latin America are urbanizing <eob> before they industrialize. <eob>
They're growing at three times <eol> the global average <eob> in terms their population. <eob>
And this is putting enormous strain <eol> on infrastructure and services. <eob>
Now, there is a golden opportunity. <eob>
It's a small opportunity but a golden one: <eol> in the next 10 to 20 years, <eob> to really start designing <eol> in principles of resilience into our cities. <eob>
There's not one single way of doing this, <eob> but there are a number of ways <eol> that are emerging. <eob>
And I've spoken with hundreds <eol> of urban planners, <eob> development specialists, <eob> architects and civic activists, <eob> and a number of recurring principles <eol> keep coming out. <eob>
I just want to pass on six. <eob>
First: cities need a plan <eob> and a strategy to implement it. <eob>
I mean, it sounds crazy, <eob> but the vast majority of world <eol> cities don't actually have a plan <eob> or a vision. <eob>
They're too busy putting out daily <eol> fires to think ahead strategically. <eob>
I mean, every city wants to be creative, <eob> happy, liveable, resilient -- <eob> who doesn't? <eob>
The challenge is, how do you get there? <eob>
And urban governance plays a key role. <eob>
You could do worse than take a page <eol> from the book of Singapore. <eob>
In 1971, Singapore <eol> set a 50-year urban strategy <eob> and renews it every five years. <eob>
What Singapore teaches us <eol> is not just the importance of continuity, <eob> but also the critical role of autonomy <eol> and discretion. <eob>
Cities need the power <eol> to be able to issue debt, <eob> to raise taxes, <eob> to zone effectively, <eob> to build affordable housing. <eob>
What cities need is nothing <eol> less than a devolution revolution, <eob> and this is going to require <eol> renegotiating the terms of the contract <eob> with a nation-state. <eob>
Second: <eob> you've got to go green. <eob>
Cities are already leading <eol> global decarbonization efforts. <eob>
They're investing in congestion <eol> pricing schemes, <eob> in climate reduction emission targets, <eob> in biodiversity, in parks <eol> and bikeways and walkways <eob> and everything in between. <eob>
There's an extraordinary menu of options <eol> they have to choose from. <eob>
One of the great things is, <eob> cities are already investing heavily <eol> in renewables — in solar and wind — <eob> not just in North America, but especially in Western <eol> Europe and parts of Asia. <eob>
There are more than 8,000 cities <eol> right now in the world today <eob> with solar plants. <eob>
There are 300 cities <eol> that have declared complete energy autonomy. <eob>
One of my favorite stories comes from Medellín, <eob> which invested in a municipal hydroelectric plant, <eob> which doesn't only service its local needs, <eob> but allows the city to sell excess energy <eol> back onto the national grid. <eob>
And it's not alone. <eob>
There are a thousand other cities <eol> just like it. <eob>
Third: invest in integrated <eol> and multi-use solutions. <eob>
The most successful cities <eol> are those that are going to invest in solutions <eob> that don't solve just one problem, <eol> but that solve multiple problems. <eob>
Take the case of integrated <eol> public transport. <eob>
When done well -- <eob> rapid bus transit, <eob> light rail, <eob> bikeways, walkways, boatways -- <eob> these can dramatically reduce emissions <eol> and congestion. <eob>
But they can do a lot more than that. <eob>
They can improve public health. <eob> They can reduce dispersion. <eob>
They can even increase safety. <eob>
A great example of this comes from Seoul. <eob>
You see, Seoul's population <eol> doubled over the last 30 years, <eob> but the footprint barely changed. <eob> How? <eob> Well, 75 percent of Seoul's residents get to work <eob> using what's been described as <eob> one of the most extraordinary <eol> public transport systems <eob> in the world. <eob>
And Seoul used to be car country. <eob>
Next, fourth: <eob> build densely but also sustainably. <eob>
The death of all cities is the sprawl. <eob>
Cities need to know <eol> how to build resiliently, <eob> but also in a way that's inclusive. <eob>
This is a picture right here <eol> of Dallas-Fort Worth. <eob>
And what you see is its population <eol> also doubled over the last 30 years. <eob>
But as you can see, it spread <eol> into edge cities and suburbia <eob> as far as the eye can see. <eob>
Cities need to know when not to build, <eob> so as not to reproduce urban sprawl <eob> and slums of downward accountability. <eob>
The problem with Dallas-Forth Worth is <eob> just five percent of its residents <eol> get to work using public transport -- five. <eob>
Ninety-five percent use cars, <eob> which partly explains <eol> why it's got some of the longest commuting times <eob> in North America. <eob>
Singapore, by contrast, got it right. <eob>
They built vertically <eob> and built in affordable housing to boot. <eob>
Fifth: steal. <eob> The smartest cities <eol> are nicking, pilfering, stealing, <eob> left, right and center. <eob> They don't have time to waste. <eob> They need tomorrow's technology today, <eob> and they're going to leapfrog <eol> to get there. <eob>
This is New York, <eob> but it's not just New York <eol> that's doing a lot of stealing, <eob> it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín. <eob>
The urban renaissance <eol> is only going to be enabled <eob> when cities start borrowing <eol> from one another. <eob>
And finally: work in global coalitions. <eob>
You know, there are more <eol> than 200 inner-city coalitions <eob> in the world <eob> today. <eob>
There are more city coalitions <eob> than there are coalitions for nation-states. <eob>
Just take a look <eol> at the Global Parliament of Mayors, <eob> set up by the late Ben Barber, <eob> who was driving an urban rights movement. <eob>
Or consider the C40, <eob> a marvelous network of cities <eol> that has gathered thousands together <eob> to deliver clean energy. <eob>
Or look at the World Economic Forum, <eob> which is developing smart city protocols. <eob> Or the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, <eob> which is leading a resilience revival. <eob>
ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis -- <eob> these are the movements of the future. <eob>
What they all realize <eol> is that when cities work together, <eob> they can amplify their voice, <eob> not just on the national stage, <eol> but on the global stage. <eob>
And with a voice comes, <eol> potentially, a vote -- <eob> and then maybe even a veto. <eob>
When nation-states default <eol> on their national sovereignty, <eob> cities have to step up. <eob>
They can't wait. <eob>
And they don't need to ask for permission. <eob>
They can exert their own sovereignty. <eob>
They understand that the local and the global <eob> have really, truly come together, <eob> that we live in a global, local world, <eob> and we need to adjust our politics accordingly. <eob>
As I travel around the world <eol> and meet mayors and civic leaders, <eob> I'm amazed by the energy, enthusiasm and effectiveness <eob> they bring to their work. <eob> They're pragmatists. <eob> They're problem-solvers. <eob> They're para-diplomats. <eob> And in this moment of extraordinary <eol> international uncertainty, <eob> when our multilateral institutions are paralyzed <eob> and our nation-states are in retreat, <eob> cities and their leaders are our new 21st-century visionaries. <eob>
They deserve -- no, they have a right <eol> to -- a seat at the table. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I was four years old, <eob> my dad taught me the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance, <eob> a traditional dance born hundreds of years ago <eol> in Southwestern USA. <eob>
A series of hoops are created <eol> out of willow wood, <eob> and they're threaded together <eol> to create formations of the natural world, <eob> showing the many beauties of life. <eob>
In this dance, <eol> you're circling in a constant spin, <eob> mimicking the movement of the Sun <eob> and the passage of time. <eob>
Watching this dance was magic to me. <eob>
Like with a time capsule, <eob> I was taking a look through <eol> a cultural window to the past. <eob>
I felt a deeper connection <eob> to how my ancestors used to look <eol> at the world around them. <eob>
Since then, I've always been obsessed <eol> with time capsules. <eob>
They take on many forms, <eob> but the common thread is that <eol> they're uncontrollably fascinating <eob> to us as human beings, <eob> because they're portals to a memory, <eob> and they hold the important <eol> power of keeping stories alive. <eob>
As a filmmaker and composer, <eob> it's been my journey <eol> to find my voice, <eob> reclaim the stories of my heritage and the past <eob> and infuse them into music and film <eol> time capsules to share. <eob>
To tell you a bit <eol> about how I found my voice, <eob> I'd like to share a bit <eol> about how I grew up. <eob>
In Southern California, I grew up <eol> in a multigenerational home, <eob> meaning I lived under the same roof <eob> as my parents, aunts, <eol> uncles and grandparents. <eob>
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian <eol> and Chinese with immigrant parents, <eob> and my father is Ojibwe <eob> and an enrolled tribal member <eob> of the Prairie Band's Potawatomi Tribe <eol> in Northeastern Kansas. <eob>
So one weekend I'd be learning <eol> how to fold dumplings, <eob> and the next, I'd be traditional-style dancing <eob> at a powwow, <eob> immersed in the powerful sounds <eol> of drums and singers. <eob>
Being surrounded by many cultures <eol> was the norm, <eob> but also a very confusing experience. <eob>
It was really hard for me <eol> to find my voice, <eob> because I never felt <eol> I was enough -- <eob> never Chinese, Dutch-Indonesian <eol> or Native enough. <eob>
Because I never felt <eol> I was a part of any community, <eob> I sought to learn <eol> the stories of my heritage <eob> and connect them together to rediscover my own. <eob>
The first medium I felt gave me <eol> a voice was music. <eob>
With layers of sounds <eol> and multiple instruments, <eob> I could create soundscapes <eol> and worlds that were much bigger than my own. <eob>
Through music, I'm inviting you <eol> into a sonic portal <eob> of my memories and emotions, <eob> and I'm holding up a mirror to yours. <eob>
One of my favorite instruments <eol> to play is the guzheng zither, <eob> a Chinese harp-like instrument. <eob>
While the hoop dance <eol> is hundreds of years old, <eob> the guzheng has more <eol> than 2,000 years of history. <eob>
I'm playing the styles <eol> that greatly influence me today, <eob> like electronic music, <eob> with an instrument that was used <eol> to play traditional folk music long ago. <eob>
And I noticed an interesting connection: <eob> the zither is tuned <eol> to the pentatonic scale, <eob> a scale that is universally known in <eol> so many parts of music <eob> around the world, <eob> including Native American folk songs. <eob>
In both Chinese and Native folk, <eob> I sense this inherent sound <eol> of longing and holding onto the past, <eob> an emotion that greatly drives <eol> the music I create today. <eob>
At the time, I wondered <eol> if I could make this feeling of immersion <eob> even more powerful, <eob> by layering visuals and music -- <eob> visuals and images <eol> on top of the music. <eob>
So I turned to internet tutorials <eol> to learn editing software, <eob> went to community college to save money <eob> and created films. <eob>
After a few years experimenting, <eob> I was 17 and had something <eol> I wanted to tell and preserve. <eob>
It started with a question: <eob> What happens when a story is forgotten? <eob>
I lead with this in my latest documentary film, <eob> "Smoke That Travels," <eob> which immerses people into the world <eol> of music, song, color and dance, <eob> as I explore my fear that a part of my identity, <eol> my Native heritage, <eob> will be forgotten in time. <eob>
Many indigenous languages are dying due to historically <eol> forced assimilation. <eob>
From the late 1800s <eol> to the early 1970s, <eob> Natives were forced into boarding schools, <eob> where they were violently punished <eol> if they practiced traditional ways <eob> or spoke their native language, <eob> most of which <eol> were orally passed down. <eob>
As of now, there are 567 federally <eol> recognized tribes in the United States, <eob> when there used to be countless more. <eob>
In my father's words, <eob> "Being Native is not <eol> about wearing long hair in braids. <eob>
It's not about feathers or beadwork. <eob>
It's about the way we all center ourselves <eol> in the world as human beings. <eob> "After traveling with this film <eol> for over a year, <eob> I met indigenous people <eol> from <eob> around the world, <eob> from the Ainu of Japan, <eob> Sami of Scandinavia, <eob> the Maori <eob> and many more. <eob>
And they were all dealing <eol> with the exact same struggle <eob> to preserve <eol> their language and culture. <eob>
At this moment, I not only realize <eol> the power storytelling has <eob> to connect all of us as human beings <eob> but the responsibility <eol> that comes with this power. <eob>
It can become incredibly dangerous <eol> when our stories are rewritten or ignored, <eob> because when we are denied identity, <eob> we become invisible. <eob>
We're all storytellers. <eob>
Reclaiming our narratives <eol> and just listening to each other's <eob> can create a portal that can transcend time itself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I come from a family of five brothers, <eob> all scientists and engineers. <eob>
A few years ago, <eol> I sent them the following email: <eob> "Dear brothers, I hope <eol> this message finds you well. <eob>
I am emailing to let you know <eob> that I'm dropping out <eol> of my master's program in engineering <eob> to pursue a career as a full-time musician. <eob>
All that I ask from you <eol> is not to worry about me." <eob>
Brother number one replied. <eob> He was encouraging but a bit skeptical. <eob>
He said, "I wish you the best of luck. <eob>
You're going to need it." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Brother number two was a little bit <eol> more skeptical. <eob>
He said, "Don't do it! <eob>
This will be the worst mistake <eol> of your life. <eob>
Find a real career." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, the rest of my brothers <eol> were so enthusiastic about my decision, <eob> they didn't even respond. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I know that the skepticism <eol> coming from my brothers <eob> is out of care and concern for me. <eob> They were worried. <eob> They thought it would be difficult <eol> to make it as an artist, <eob> that it will be a challenge. <eob> And you know what? They were right. <eob> It is such a challenge to be a full-time artist. <eob>
I have so many friends <eol> who need to have a second job <eob> as a plan B in order to pay for the bills, <eob> except that plan B sometimes becomes <eol> their plan A. <eob> And it's not just my friends <eol> and I who experience this. <eob>
The US Census Bureau states <eol> that only 10 percent of art school graduates <eob> end up working as full-time artists. <eob>
The other 90 percent, they change careers, <eob> they work in marketing, sales, <eol> education and other fields. <eob>
But this is not news, right? <eob> We almost expect the artist <eol> to be a struggling artist. <eob> But why should we expect that? <eob>
I read an article in the <eol> "Huffington Post" <eob> saying that four years ago, <eol> the European Union <eob> began the world's largest ever <eol> arts funding initiative. <eob>
Creative Europe will give 2.4 billion dollars <eob> to over 300,000 artists. <eob>
In contrast, the US budget <eol> for our National Endowment for the Arts, <eob> the largest single funder for the arts <eol> across the United States, <eob> is merely 146 million dollars. <eob>
To put things into perspective, <eob> the US budget for the military <eol> marching bands alone <eob> is almost twice as much as the entire NEA. <eob>
Another striking image comes from Brendan McMahon <eol> for the "Huffington Post," <eob> saying that out of the one trillion dollar budget <eob> for military and defense-related spending, <eob> if only 0.05 percent <eol> were allocated to the arts, <eob> we would be able to pay for 20 full-time symphony <eol> orchestras <eob> at 20 million dollars apiece, <eob> and give over 80,000 artists <eob> an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each. <eob> If that's only 0.05 percent, <eob> imagine what a full one percent could do. <eob>
Now, I know we live <eol> in a capitalist society, <eob> and profits matter a lot. <eob>
So let's look at it <eol> from a financial angle, shall we? <eob>
The US nonprofit arts industry <eob> generates more than 166 billion dollars <eol> in economic activity, <eob> it employs 5.7 million people <eob> and it returns 12.6 billion dollars <eob> in tax revenue. <eob>
But this is only a financial angle, right? <eob>
We all know that the arts is way more <eol> than just an economic value. <eob>
The arts brings meaning to life. <eob>
It's the spirit of our culture. <eob>
It brings people together <eol> and it supports creativity <eob> and social cohesion. <eob>
But if the arts contributes <eol> this much to our economy, <eob> why then do we still invest <eol> so little in arts and artists? <eob>
Why do more than 80 percent <eol> of our schools nationwide <eob> still experience budget cuts <eol> in arts education programs? <eob>
What is it about the value <eol> of arts and artists <eob> that we still don't understand? <eob>
I believe the system is flawed <eol> and far from being fair, <eob> and I want to help change that. <eob>
I want to live in a society <eob> where artists are more valued <eob> and have more cultural <eol> and financial support <eob> so they can focus on creating arts instead <eol> of being forced to drive Ubers <eob> or take corporate jobs <eol> they'd rather not have. <eob>
There are other sources of income <eol> for artists, however. <eob>
There are private foundations, <eob> grants and patrons <eol> who give money, <eob> except a vast majority of artists <eol> don't know about these opportunities. <eob>
On one side you have institutions <eol> and people with money. <eob>
On the other side <eol> you have artists seeking funding, <eob> but the artists don't know <eol> about the people with the money, <eob> and the people with the money <eol> don't necessarily know <eob> about the artists out there. <eob>
This is why I am very excited <eol> to share "Grantpa," <eob> an online platform that uses technology <eob> to match artists with grants <eol> and funding opportunities <eob> in a way that is easy, fast and less intimidating. <eob>
Grantpa is only one step towards solving <eol> an existing problem <eob> of funding inequality, <eob> but we need to work collectively <eol> on multiple fronts <eob> to reevaluate how we view <eol> the artists in our society. <eob>
Do we think of arts as a luxury <eol> or a necessity? <eob>
Do we understand what goes <eol> on in the day-to-day life of an artist, <eob> or do we still believe that artists, <eol> no matter how struggling they are, <eob> are happy simply because they're <eol> following their passion? <eob>
"Dear brothers, I hope this message <eol> finds you well. <eob> In a few years, I plan <eol> to send my brothers the following email: <eob>
I am emailing to let you know <eob> that I am doing great <eob> and so are hundreds of thousands <eol> of artists <eob> who are being valued more culturally <eol> and financially <eob> and getting enough funding <eol> to focus on their crafts <eob> and create more art. <eob>
I appreciate all of your support. <eob>
Couldn't have done it without you." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Cyndi Stivers: So, future of storytelling. <eob>
Before we do the future, <eob> let's talk about what is never <eol> going to change about storytelling. <eob>
Shonda Rhimes: What's never <eol> going to change. <eob>
Obviously, I think good stories <eol> are never going to change, <eob> the need for people to gather <eol> together and exchange their stories <eob> and to talk about the things <eol> that feel universal, <eob> the idea that we all feel a compelling <eol> need to watch stories, <eob> to tell stories, to share stories -- <eob> sort of the gathering <eol> around the campfire <eob> to discuss the things that tell each one of us <eob> that we are not alone in the world. <eob>
Those things to me <eol> are never going to change. <eob>
That essence of storytelling <eol> is never going to change. <eob>
CS: OK. In preparation <eol> for this conversation, <eob> I checked in with Susan Lyne, <eob> who was running ABC Entertainment <eob> when you were working on "Grey's Anatomy" -- <eob>
SR: Yes. <eob>
CS: And she said that there was this indelible memory she had <eob> of your casting process, <eob> where without discussing it <eol> with any of the executives, <eob> you got people coming in to read <eol> for your scripts, <eob> and every one of them <eol> was the full range of humanity, <eob> you did not type anyone in any way, <eob> and that it was completely surprising. <eob>
So she said, in addition <eol> to retraining the studio executives, <eob> you also, she feels, <eob> and I think this is -- I agree, <eob> retrained the expectations <eol> of the American TV audience. <eob>
So what else does the audience <eol> not yet realize that it needs? <eob>
SR: What else does it not yet realize? <eob>
Well, I mean, I don't think <eol> we're anywhere near there yet. <eob>
I mean, we're still in a place <eob> in which we're far, far behind what looks <eol> like the real world in actuality. <eob>
I wasn't bringing in a bunch of actors <eob> who looked very different <eol> from one another <eob> simply because I was trying <eol> to make a point, <eob> and I wasn't trying to do anything special. <eob>
It never occurred to me that <eol> that was new, different or weird. <eob>
I just brought in actors <eol> because I thought they were interesting <eob> and to me, the idea <eol> that it was completely surprising to everybody -- <eob> I didn't know that for a while. <eob>
I just thought: these are the actors <eol> I want to see play these parts. <eob>
I want to see <eol> what they look like if they read. <eob>
We'll see what happens. <eob>
So I think the interesting thing that happens is <eob> that when you look at the world <eol> through another lens, <eob> when you're not the person <eol> normally in charge of things, <eob> it just comes out a different way. <eob>
CS: So you now have this big <eol> machine that you run, <eob> as a titan -- as you know, last year <eol> when she gave her talk -- <eob> she's a titan. <eob>
So what do you think is going <eol> to happen as we go on? <eob>
There's a huge amount of money <eol> involved in producing these shows. <eob>
While the tools of making stories have gone <eol> and gotten greatly democratized, <eob> there's still this large distribution: <eob> people who rent networks, who rent <eol> the audience to advertisers <eob> and make it all pay. <eob>
How do you see the business model <eol> changing now that anyone can be a storyteller? <eob>
SR: I think it's changing every day. <eob>
I mean, the rapid, rapid change <eol> that's happening is amazing. <eob>
And I feel -- the panic is palpable, <eob> and I don't mean that in a bad way. <eob>
I think it's kind of exciting. <eob>
The idea that there's sort <eol> of an equalizer happening, <eob> that sort of means that anybody <eol> can make something, is wonderful. <eob>
I think there's some scary in the idea <eol> that you can't find the good work now. <eob>
There's so much work out there. <eob>
I think there's something <eol> like 417 dramas on television right now <eob> at any given time <eol> in any given place, <eob> but you can't find them. <eob>
You can't find the good ones. <eob>
So there's a lot of bad stuff <eol> out there because everybody can make something. <eob>
It's like if everybody painted a painting. <eob>
You know, there's not <eol> that many good painters. <eob>
But finding the good stories, <eol> the good shows, <eob> is harder and harder and harder. <eob>
Because if you have one tiny show <eol> over here on AMC <eob> and one tiny show over here over there, <eob> finding where they are becomes much harder. <eob>
So I think that ferreting out the gems <eob> and finding out who made the great webisode <eol> and who made this, <eob> it's -- I mean, think about the poor critics <eob> who now are spending 24 hours a day <eob> trapped in their homes <eol> watching everything. <eob>
It's not an easy job right now. <eob>
So the distribution engines <eol> are getting more and more vast, <eob> but finding the good programming <eol> for everybody in the audience <eob> is getting harder. <eob>
And unlike the news, <eob> where everything's getting winnowed down <eol> to just who you are, <eob> television seems to be getting -- <eob> and by television I mean anything <eol> you can watch, television shows on -- <eob> seems to be getting wider <eol> and wider and wider. <eob>
And so anybody's making stories, <eob> and the geniuses are sometimes hidden. <eob>
But it's going to be harder to find, <eob> and at some point that will collapse. <eob>
People keep talking about peak TV. <eob>
I don't know when that's going to happen. <eob>
I think at some point <eol> it'll collapse a little bit <eob> and we'll, sort of, come back together. <eob>
I don't know if it will be <eol> network television. <eob>
I don't know if that model is sustainable. <eob>
CS: What about the model <eob> that Amazon and Netflix are throwing <eol> a lot of money around right now. <eob>
SR: That is true. <eob>
I think it's an interesting model. <eob>
I think there's something <eol> exciting about it. <eob>
For content creators, <eob> I think there's something exciting about it. <eob>
For the world, <eob> I think there's something exciting about it. <eob>
The idea that there are programs now <eob> that can be in multiple languages <eol> with characters from all over the world <eob> that are appealing and come out <eol> for everybody at the same time <eob> is exciting. <eob>
I mean, I think the international sense <eol> that television can now take on <eob> makes sense to me, <eob> that programming can now take on. <eob>
Television so much is made for, like -- <eol> here's our American audience. <eob>
We make these shows, <eob> and then they shove them <eol> out into the world <eob> and hope for the best, <eob> as opposed to really thinking about the fact <eol> that America is not it. <eob>
I mean, we love ourselves and everything, <eol> but it's not i. <eob>
And we should be taking into account the fact <eob> that there are all of these other places in the world <eob> that we should be interested in <eol> while we're telling stories. <eob>
It makes the world smaller. <eob>
I don't know. <eob>
I think it pushes forward the idea <eol> that the world is a universal place, <eob> and our stories become universal things. <eob>
We stop being other. <eob>
CS: You've pioneered, as far as I can see, <eob> interesting ways to launch new shows, too. <eob>
I mean, when you launched <eol> "Scandal" in 2012, <eob> there was this amazing groundswell <eol> of support on Twitter <eob> the likes of which nobody had seen before. <eob>
Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve <eob> when you launch your next one? <eob>
What do you think <eol> will happen in that regard? <eob>
SR: We do have some interesting ideas. <eob>
We have a show called "Still Star-Crossed" <eol> coming out this summer. <eob> We have some interesting ideas for that. <eob>
I'm not sure if we're going <eol> to be able to do them in time. <eob>
I thought they were fun. <eob>
But the idea that we would live-tweet our show <eob> was really just us thinking <eol> that would be fun. <eob>
We didn't realize that the critics <eol> would start to live-tweet along with us. <eob>
But the fans -- getting people <eol> to be a part of it, <eob> making it more of a campfire -- <eob> you know, when you're all on Twitter together <eob> and you're all talking together, <eob> it is more of a shared experience, <eob> and finding other ways to make that possible <eob> and finding other ways to make people <eol> feel engaged <eob> is important. <eob>
CS: So when you have all those <eol> different people making stories <eob> and only some of them are going to break through <eob> and get that audience somehow, <eob> how do you think storytellers <eol> will get paid? <eob>
SR: I actually have been struggling <eol> with this concept as well. <eob>
Is it going to be a subscriber model? <eob>
Are people going to say, like, I'm going to watch <eol> this particular person's shows, <eob> and that's how we're going to do it? <eob>
CS: I think we should buy <eol> a passport to Shondaland. Right? <eob>
SR: <eob> I don't know <eob> about that, but yeah. <eob>
That's a lot more work for me. <eob>
I do think that there are going <eol> to be different ways, <eob> but <eob> I don't know <eob> necessarily. <eob>
I mean, I'll be honest <eol> and say a lot of content creators <eob> are not necessarily interested <eol> in being distributors, <eob> mainly because what I dream of doing <eob> is creating content. <eob>
I really love to create content. <eob>
I want to get paid for it <eob> and I want to get paid the money <eol> that I deserve to get paid for it, <eob> and there's a hard part <eol> in finding that. <eob>
But I also want it to be made possible <eob> for, you know, the people <eol> who work with me, <eob> the people who work for me, <eob> everybody to sort of get paid in a way, <eol> and they're all making a living. <eob>
How it gets distributed <eob> is getting harder <eob> and harder. <eob>
CS: How about the many new tools, <eob> you know, VR, AR ... <eob> I find it fascinating that you can't really binge-watch, <eob> you can't fast-forward in those things. <eob>
What do you see as the future <eol> of those for storytelling? <eob>
SR: I spent a lot of time in the past year <eob> just exploring those, <eob> getting lots of demonstrations <eol> and paying attention. <eob>
I find them fascinating, <eob> mainly because I think that — <eob> I think most people think <eob> of them <eol> for gaming, <eob> I think most people think <eob> of them <eol> for things like action, <eob> and I think that there is a sense <eol> of intimacy <eob> that is very present in those things, <eob> the idea that — picture this, <eob> you can sit there and have <eol> a conversation with Fitz, <eob> or at least sit there while Fitz talks <eol> to you, <eob> President Fitzgerald Grant III, <eob> while he talks <eol> to you <eob> about why he's making a choice that he makes, <eob> and it's a very heartfelt moment. <eob>
And instead of you watching <eol> a television screen, <eob> you're sitting there next to him, <eol> and he's having this conversation. <eob>
Now, you fall in love with the man <eob> while he's doing it <eol> from a television screen. <eob>
Imagine sitting next to him, <eob> or being with a character like Huck <eol> who's about to execute somebody. <eob>
And instead of having a scene <eob> where, you know, he's talking to another <eol> character very rapidly, <eob> he goes into a closet and turns to you <eol> and tells you, you know, <eob> what's going to happen <eol> and why he's afraid and nervous. <eob>
It's a little more like theater, <eol> and I'm not sure it would work, <eob> but I'm fascinating by the concept <eol> of something like that <eob> and what that would mean for an audience. <eob>
And to get to play with those ideas <eol> would be interesting, <eob> and I think, you know, for my audience, <eol> the people who watch my shows, <eob> which is, you know, women 12 to 75, <eob> there's something interesting <eol> in there for them. <eob>
CS: And how about the input <eol> of the audience? <eob>
How interested are you in the things <eob> where the audience <eol> can actually go up to a certain point <eob> and then decide, oh wait, I'm going <eol> to choose my own adventure. <eob>
I'm going to run off with Fitz <eol> or I'm going to run off with -- <eob>
SR: Oh, the choose- your-own-adventure stories. <eob>
I have a hard time with those, <eob> and not necessarily because I want <eol> to be in control of everything, <eob> but because when I'm watching television <eol> or I'm watching a movie, <eob> I know for a fact that a story <eol> is not as good <eob> when I have control over exactly what's going to happen <eob> to somebody else's character. <eob>
You know, if I could tell you exactly <eol> what I wanted to happen to Walter White, <eob> that's great, but the story <eol> is not the same, and it's not as powerful. <eob>
You know, if I'm in charge <eol> of how "The Sopranos" ends, <eob> then that's lovely and I have an ending <eol> that's nice and satisfying, <eob> but it's not the same story <eol> and it's not the same emotional impact. <eob>
CS: I can't stop imagining <eol> what that might be. <eob>
Sorry, you're losing me for a minute. <eob>
SR: But what's wonderful <eol> is I don't get to imagine it, <eob> because Vince has his own ending, <eob> and it makes it really powerful <eol> to know that somebody else has told. <eob>
You know, if you could decide <eol> that, you know, <eob> in "Jaws," the shark wins <eol> or something, <eob> it doesn't do what it needs to do for you. <eob>
The story is the story that is told, <eob> and you can walk away angry <eol> and you can walk away debating <eob> and you can walk away arguing, <eob> but that's why it works. <eob>
That is why it's art. <eob> Otherwise, it's just a game, <eob> and games can be art, <eol> but in a very different way. <eob>
CS: Gamers who actually sell <eol> the right to sit there <eob> and comment on what's happening, <eob> to me that's more community <eol> than storytelling. <eob>
SR: And that is its own form of campfire. <eob>
I don't discount that as a form <eol> of storytelling, <eob> but it is a group form, I suppose. <eob>
CS: All right, what about <eol> the super-super — <eob> the fact that everything's getting shorter, shorter, shorter. <eob>
And, you know, Snapchat now <eol> has something it calls shows <eob> that are one minute long. <eob>
SR: It's interesting. <eob> Part of me thinks <eol> it sounds like commercials. <eob>
I mean, it does -- like, sponsored by. <eob>
But part of me also gets it completely. <eob>
There's something <eol> really wonderful about it. <eob>
If you think about a world <eob> in which most people are watching <eol> television on their phones, <eob> if you think about a place like India, <eob> where most of the input is coming in <eob> and that's where most of the product <eol> is coming in, <eob> shorter makes sense. <eob>
If you can charge people <eol> more for shorter periods of content, <eob> some distributor has figured out <eol> a way to make a lot more money. <eob>
If you're making content, <eob> it costs less money to make it <eol> and put it out there. <eob>
And, by the way, <eob> if you're 14 and have <eol> a short attention span, like my daughter, <eob> that's what you want to see, <eol> that's what you want to make, <eob> that's how it works. <eob>
And if you do it right <eol> and it actually feels like narrative, <eob> people will hang on for it no matter what you do. <eob>
CS: I'm glad you raised your daughters, <eob> because I am wondering how are they <eol> going to consume entertainment, <eob> and also not just entertainment, <eob> but news, too. <eob>
When they're not -- I mean, <eol> the algorithmic robot overlords <eob> are going to feed them what they've already done. <eob>
How do you think we will correct for that <eol> and make people well-rounded citizens? <eob>
SR: Well, me and how I correct for it <eob> is completely different <eol> than how somebody else might do it. <eob>
CS: Feel free to speculate. <eob>
SR: I really don't know how we're going <eol> to do it in the future. <eob>
I mean, my poor children <eol> have been the subject of all of my experiments. <eob>
We're still doing what I call <eol> "Amish summers" <eob> where I turn off all electronics <eob> and pack away all their computers <eol> and stuff <eob> and watch them scream for a while <eol> until they settle down <eob> into, like, <eol> an electronic-free summer. <eob>
But honestly, it's a very hard world <eob> in which now, as grown-ups, <eob> we're so interested in watching our own thing, <eob> and we don't even know <eol> that we're being fed, sometimes, <eob> just our own opinions. <eob>
You know, the way it's working now, <eob> you're watching a feed, <eob> and the feeds are being corrected <eob> so that you're only getting <eol> your own opinions <eob> and you're feeling more <eol> and more right about yourself. <eob>
So how do you really start to discern? <eob> It's getting a little bit disturbing. <eob> So maybe it'll overcorrect, maybe <eol> it'll all explode, <eob> or maybe we'll all just become -- <eob> I hate to be negative about it, <eob> but maybe we'll all just become <eol> more idiotic. <eob>
(Cyndi laughs) <eob>
CS: Yeah, can you picture <eol> any corrective that you could do <eob> with scripted, fictional work? <eob>
SR: I think a lot about the fact <eol> that television has the power <eob> to educate people in a powerful way, <eob> and when you're watching television -- <eob> for instance, they do studies <eol> about medical shows. <eob>
I think it's 87 percent, 87 percent of people <eob> get most of their knowledge <eol> about medicine and medical facts <eob> from medical shows, <eob> much more so than they do <eol> from their doctors, <eob> than from articles. <eob>
So we work really hard to be accurate, <eol> and every time we make a mistake, <eob> I feel really guilty, like we're going to do something bad, <eob> but we also give a lot of good medical information. <eob>
There are so many other ways <eol> to give information on those shows. <eob>
People are being entertained <eob> and maybe they don't want <eol> to read the news, <eob> but there are a lot of ways <eol> to give fair information out on those shows, <eob> not in some creepy, like, we're going <eol> to control people's minds way, <eob> but in a way that's sort of very interesting <eol> and intelligent <eob> and not about pushing one side's version or the other, <eob> like, giving out the truth. <eob>
It would be strange, though, <eob> if television drama was how <eol> we were giving the news. <eob>
CS: It would be strange, <eob> but I gather a lot <eol> of what you've written as fiction <eob> has become prediction this season? <eob>
SR: You know, "Scandal" has been <eol> very disturbing for that reason. <eob>
We have this show that's about politics <eol> gone mad, <eob> and basically the way <eol> we've always told the show -- <eob> you know, everybody pays <eol> attention to the papers. <eob> We read everything. We talk about everything. <eob>
We have lots of friends in Washington. <eob>
And we'd always sort of done <eol> our show as a speculation. <eob>
We'd sit in the room and think, <eob> what would happen <eol> if the wheels came off the bus <eob> and everything went crazy? <eob>
And that was always great, <eob> except now it felt like the wheels <eol> were coming off the bus <eob> and things were actually going crazy, <eob> so the things that we were speculating <eol> were really coming true. <eob>
I mean, our season this year <eob> was going to end with the Russians <eol> controlling the American election, <eob> and we'd written it, <eol> we'd planned for it, <eob> it was all there, <eob> and then the Russians were suspected <eol> of being involved in the American election <eob> and we suddenly had to change <eol> what we were going to do for our season. <eob>
I walked in and I was like, <eob> "That scene where our mystery woman <eol> starts speaking Russian? <eob>
We have to fix that and figure out <eol> what we're going to do." <eob> That just comes from extrapolating <eob> out from what we thought <eol> was going to happen, <eob> or what we thought was crazy. <eob>
CS: That's great. <eob>
So where else in US or elsewhere <eol> in the world do you look? <eob>
Who is doing interesting <eol> storytelling right now? <eob>
SR: <eob> I don't know, <eob> there's a lot of interesting <eol> stuff out there. <eob>
Obviously British television is always amazing <eob> and always does interesting things. <eob>
I don't get to watch a lot of TV, <eob> mainly because I'm busy working. <eob>
And I pretty much try not <eol> to watch very much television at all, <eob> even American television, until I'm done with a season, <eob> because things start <eol> to creep into my head otherwise. <eob>
I start to wonder, like, <eob> why can't our characters <eol> wear crowns and talk about being on a throne? <eob> It gets crazy. <eob> So I try not to watch much <eol> until the seasons are over. <eob>
But I do think that there's a lot of interesting <eol> European television out there. <eob>
I was at the International Emmys <eob> and looking around and seeing the stuff <eol> that they were showing, <eob> and I was kind of fascinated. <eob>
There's some stuff I want <eol> to watch and check out. <eob>
CS: Can you imagine -- <eob> I know that you don't spend a lot of time <eol> thinking about tech stuff, <eob> but you know how a few years ago <eol> we had someone here at TED <eob> talking about seeing, <eob> wearing Google Glass and seeing your TV shows <eol> essentially in your eye? <eob>
Do you ever fantasize when, you know -- <eob> the little girl who sat <eol> on the pantry floor <eob> in your parents' house, <eob> did you ever imagine <eol> any other medium? <eob>
Or would you now? <eob>
SR: Any other medium. <eob>
For storytelling, other than books? <eob>
I mean, I grew up wanting to be <eol> Toni Morrison, so no. <eob>
I mean, I didn't even imagine television. <eob>
So the idea that <eol> there could be some bigger world, <eob> some more magical way of making things --- <eob> I'm always excited when new technology comes out <eob> and I'm always the first one <eol> to want to try it. <eob>
The possibilities feel endless <eol> and exciting right now, <eob> which is what excites me. <eob>
We're in this sort of Wild <eol> West period, to me, it feels like, <eob> because nobody knows <eol> what we're going to settle on. <eob>
You can put stories anywhere right now <eob> and that's cool to me, <eob> and it feels like once we figure out <eol> how to get the technology <eob> and the creativity of storytelling to meet, <eob> the possibilities are endless. <eob>
CS: And also the technology has enabled <eol> the thing I briefly flew by earlier, <eob> binge-viewing, which is a recent phenomenon, <eob> since you've been doing shows, right? <eob>
And how do you think does that change <eol> the storytelling process at all? <eob>
You always had a bible for the whole <eol> season beforehand, right? <eob>
SR: No, I just always knew <eol> where we were going to end. <eob>
So for me, <eob> the only way I can really comment on that <eob> is that I have a show <eol> that's been going on for 14 seasons <eob> and so there are the people <eol> who have been watching it for 14 seasons, <eob> and then there are the 12-year-old girls <eol> I'd encounter in the grocery store <eob> who had watched 297 episodes in three weeks. <eob>
Seriously, and that's a very different <eol> experience for them, <eob> because they've been inside of something <eob> really intensely for a very short period of time <eob> in a very intense way, <eob> and to them the story <eol> has a completely different arc <eob> and a completely different meaning <eob> because it never had any breaks. <eob>
CS: It's like visiting a country <eol> and then leaving it. It's a strange -- <eob>
SR: It's like reading an amazing <eol> novel and then putting it down. <eob>
I think that is the beauty <eol> of the experience. <eob>
You don't necessarily have to watch <eol> something for 14 seasons. <eob>
It's not necessarily the way <eol> everything's supposed to be. <eob>
CS: Is there any topic <eol> that you don't think we should touch? <eob>
SR: I don't think I think <eol> of story that way. <eob>
I think of story in terms of character <eol> and what characters would do <eob> and what characters need to do <eol> in order to make them move forward, <eob> so I'm never really thinking <eol> of story in terms of just plot, <eob> and when writers come into my writer's room <eol> and pitch me plot, <eob> I say, "You're not speaking English." <eob> Like, that's the thing I say. <eob>
We're not speaking English. <eob>
I need to hear what's real. <eob>
And so I don't think of it that way. <eob>
I don't know <eob> if there's a way to think <eol> there's something I wouldn't do <eob> because that feels like I'm plucking pieces <eol> of plot off a wall or something. <eob>
CS: That's great. <eob>
To what extent do you think you will use — <eob> You know, you recently went <eol> on the board of Planned Parenthood <eob> and got involved in the Hillary Clinton campaign. <eob>
To what extent do you think <eol> you will use your storytelling <eob> in the real world <eob> to effect change? <eob>
SR: Well, you know, there's -- <eob> That's an intense subject to me, <eob> because I feel like the lack of narrative <eob> that a lot of people have is difficult. <eob>
You know, like, <eol> there's a lot of organizations <eob> that don't have a positive narrative <eol> that they've created for themselves <eob> that would help them. <eob>
There's a lot of campaigns <eob> that could be helped <eol> with a better narrative. <eob>
The Democrats could do a lot <eob> with a very strong narrative <eol> for themselves. <eob>
There's a lot of different things <eol> that could happen <eob> in terms of using storytelling voice, <eob> and I don't mean that in a fiction way, <eob> I mean that in a same way that <eol> any speechwriter would mean it. <eob>
And I see that, <eob> but I don't necessarily know <eol> that that's, like, my job to do that. <eob>
CS: All right. <eob>
Please help me thank Shonda. SR: Thank you. <eob>
A few years ago, about seven years ago, <eob> I found myself hiding <eol> in a festival toilet, <eob> a music festival toilet, <eob> and if anyone's been <eol> to a music festival, <eob> yeah, you'll know that by the third day, <eob> it's pretty nasty. <eob>
I was standing in the toilet <eol> because I couldn't even sit down, <eob> because the toilet roll had run out, <eob> there was mud everywhere, <eob> and it smelled pretty bad. <eob>
And I stood there thinking, <eob> "What am I doing? <eob>
I don't even need the toilet. " <eob>
But the reason I went <eob> was because I was volunteering <eol> for a large charity on climate justice, <eob> and it was seven years ago, <eob> when lots of people <eol> didn't believe in climate change, <eob> people were very cynical about activism, <eob> and my role, with all of my teammates, <eob> was to get people to sign petitions <eol> on climate justice <eob> and educate them a bit more about the issue. <eob>
And I cared deeply about climate change <eol> and lots of inequality, <eob> so I'd go and I'd talk <eol> to lots of people, <eob> which made me nervous <eol> and drained me of energy, <eob> but I did it because I cared, <eob> but I would hide in the toilets, <eol> because I'd be exhausted, <eob> and I didn't want my teammates <eol> doubting my commitment to the cause, <eob> thinking that I was slacking. <eob>
And we'd go and meet <eol> at the end of our shift, <eob> and we'd count how many petitions <eol> had been signed, <eob> and often I'd win <eol> the amount of petitions signed <eob> even though I had my little <eol> breaks in the toilet. <eob>
But I was always very jealous <eol> of the other activists, <eob> because either they had the same amount of energy <eob> as they had when they began the shift <eol> of getting people to sign petitions, <eob> or often they had more energy, <eob> and they'd be really excited <eol> about going to watch the bands in the evening <eob> and having a dance. <eob>
And even if I loved the bands, <eob> all I wanted to do was to go back <eol> to my tent and have a sleep, <eob> because I'd just feel <eol> completely wiped out, <eob> and I was really jealous of people <eol> that had the energy <eob> to go and party hard at the festivals. <eob>
But it also made me really angry, <eol> as well, inside. <eob>
I thought, "This isn't fair, <eol> I'm an introvert, <eob> and all of the offline campaigning <eol> seems to be favoring extroverts." <eob> I would go on marches <eol> which drained me. <eob>
That was the other option. <eob>
Or I'd go and join campaigns outside <eol> embassies or shops. <eob>
The only thing that was on offer <eol> was around lots of people, <eob> it was very loud activism, <eob> it always involved lots of people, <eol> it was performing. <eob>
None of it was for introverts, <eob> and I not only thought <eol> that that wasn't fair, <eob> because a third to a half <eol> of the world's population are introverts, <eob> which isn't fair on them, <eol> because we burn out, <eob> or we'd be put off by activism and not do it, <eob> and everyone needs to be <eol> an activist in this world. <eob>
And also, I didn't think <eol> it was particularly clever, <eob> but I could see that a lot <eol> of the activism that worked <eob> wasn't only extrovert activism. <eob>
It wasn't only the loud stuff. <eob> It wasn't about people <eol> performing all the time. <eob>
A lot of the work that was needed <eol> was in the background, <eob> was hidden, wasn't seen. <eob>
And when I ended up <eol> just being a campaigner, <eob> because it's the only job I can do, really -- <eob> I was campaigning at university, <eob> and for the last 10 years, <eol> I've been a professional campaigner <eob> for large charities, <eob> and now I'm a creative campaigner <eol> consultant for different charities <eob> as well as other work I do -- <eob> but I knew that there were other forms <eol> of activism that were needed. <eob>
I started tinkering <eol> about seven years ago <eob> to see what quieter forms <eol> of activism I could engage with <eob> so I didn't burn out as an activist, <eob> but also to look at some of the issues <eol> I was concerned about in campaigning. <eob>
I was very lucky that, <eol> when I worked for Oxfam and other big charities, <eob> I could read lots of big reports <eob> on what influenced politicians <eol> and businesses <eob> and the general public, <eob> what campaigns worked really well, <eol> which ones didn't. <eob>
And I'm a bit of a geek, <eol> so I look at all of that stuff, <eob> and I wanted to tinker around <eob> to see how I could engage people <eol> in social change in a different way, <eob> because I think if we want the world <eol> to be more beautiful, kind and just, <eob> then our activism should be beautiful, kind and just, <eob> and often it's not. <eob>
And today, I just want to talk <eol> about three ways <eob> that I think activism needs introverts. <eob>
I think there's lot of other ways, <eol> but I'm just going to talk about three. <eob>
And the first one is: activism <eol> is often very quick, <eob> and it's about doing, <eob> so extroverts, often their immediate <eol> response to injustice is, <eob> we've got to do stuff now, <eob> we've got to react really quickly -- <eob> and yes, we do need to react, <eob> but we need to be strategic in our campaigning, <eob> and if we just act on anger, <eob> often we do the wrong things. <eob>
I use craft, like needlework -- <eob> like this guy behind me is doing -- <eob> as a way to not only slow down those extrovert doers, <eob> but also to bring in nervous, <eol> quiet introverts into activism. <eob>
By doing repetitive actions, <eob> like handicraft, you can't do it fast, <eol> you have to do it slowly. <eob>
And those repetitive stitches <eob> help you meditate on the big, complex, messy social change issues <eob> and figure out what we can do <eob> as a citizen, as a consumer, as a constituent, <eob> and all of those different things. <eob>
It helps you think critically <eol> while you're stitching away, <eob> and it helps you be more mindful <eol> of what are your motives. <eob>
Are you that Barbie aid worker <eol> that was mentioned before? <eob>
Are you about joining <eol> people in solidarity, <eob> or do you want to be the savior, <eol> which often isn't very ethical? <eob>
But doing needle work together, as well, <eob> extroverts and introverts and ambivert — <eob> everyone's on the scale in different places — <eob> because it's a quiet, <eol> slow form of activism, <eob> it really helps introverts be heard <eob> in other areas, where they are often not heard. <eob>
It sounds odd, <eob> but while you're stitching, you don't need eye <eol> contact with people. <eob>
So, for nervous introverts, <eob> it means that you can stitch away <eol> next to someone or a group of people <eob> and ask questions <eol> that you're thinking <eob> that often you don't get time <eol> to ask people, <eob> or you're too nervous <eol> to ask if you give them eye contact. <eob>
So you can get introverts, who are those big, deep thinkers, <eob> saying, "That's really interesting <eol> that you want to do <eob> that extrovert form of activism <eol> that's about shaming people <eob> or quickly going out somewhere, <eob> but who are you trying to target and how, <eob> and is that the best way to do it?" <eob> So it means you could have these discussions <eol> in a very slow way, <eob> which is great for the extrovert <eol> to slow down and think deeply, <eob> but it's really good <eol> for the introvert as well, <eob> to be heard and to feel part of that movement for change, <eob> in a good way. <eob>
Some ways we do it is stitch cards <eob> about what values we thread <eol> through our activism, <eob> and making sure that we don't just <eol> react in unethical ways. <eob>
One, sometimes we work with art institutions <eob> where we will get over 150 people <eol> at the V & amp; A <eob> who can come for hours, <eob> sit and stitch together on a particular issue, <eob> and then tweet what they're thinking <eol> or how it went, like this one. <eob>
Also, I always think <eol> that activism needs introverts <eob> because we're really good <eol> at intimate activism. <eob>
So we're good at slow activism, <eob> and we're really good <eol> at intimate activism, <eob> and if this year has told us anything, <eob> it's told us that we need to, <eol> when we're engaging power holders, <eob> we need to engage them by listening <eol> to people we disagree with, <eob> by building bridges not walls -- <eob> walls or wars -- <eob> and by being critical friends, <eol> not aggressive enemies. <eob>
And one example that I do <eol> a lot with introverts, <eob> but with lots of people, <eob> is make gifts for people in power, <eob> so not be outside screaming at them, <eob> but to give them something <eol> like a bespoke handkerchief <eob> saying, "Don't blow it. <eob>
Use your power for good. <eob>
We know you've got a difficult job <eol> in your position of power. <eob>
How can we help you?" <eob> And what's great is, <eol> for the introverts, <eob> we can write letters <eol> while we're making these gifts, <eob> so for us, Marks and Spencer, <eob> we tried to campaign to get them <eol> to implement the living wage. <eob>
So we made all the 14 board members <eol> bespoke handkerchiefs. <eob>
We wrote them letters, we boxed them up, <eob> and we went to the AGM <eol> to hand-deliver our gifts <eob> and to have that form of intimate activism <eob> where we had discussions with them. <eob>
And what was brilliant <eol> was that the chair of the board <eob> told us how amazing our campaign was, <eob> how heartfelt it was. <eob>
The board members, like Martha Lane Fox, <eob> who has hundreds of thousands <eol> of followers on Twitter, <eob> and highly influential in business, <eob> tweeted how impressed <eol> she was, <eob> and within 10 months, <eob> we'd had meetings with Marks and Spencer <eob> to say, "We know this is difficult <eol> to be a living wage employer, <eob> but if you can be one, <eob> the rest of the sector <eol> will look at it, <eob> and it's not right that some of your amazing workers <eol> are working full time <eob> and still can't pay their bills. <eob>
And we love Marks and Spencer. <eob>
How can you be the role model <eol> that we want you to be?" <eob>
So that was that intimate <eol> form of activism. <eob>
We had lots of meetings with them. <eob>
We then gave them Christmas cards and Valentine's cards to say, <eob> "We really want to encourage <eol> you to implement the living wage, <eob> and within 10 months, <eob> they'd announced to the media <eob> that they were going to pay <eol> the independent living wage, and now — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
And now we're trying to work <eol> with them to be accredited, <eob> which is really important, <eob> and we went back to the last AGM this June <eob> and we had these amazing one-to-one discussions <eol> with the board members, <eob> who told us how much they loved <eol> their hankies <eob> and how it really moved them, <eol> what we were doing, <eob> and they all told us <eol> that if we were standing outside screaming at them <eob> and not being gentle in our protest, <eob> they wouldn't have even listened to us, <eob> never mind had those discussions <eol> with us. <eob>
And I think introverts are really <eol> good at intimate activism <eob> because we like to listen, <eob> we like one-to-ones, <eob> we don't like small talks, <eob> we like those big, <eol> juicy issues to discuss with people, <eob> we don't like conflict, <eob> so we avoid it at all costs, <eob> which is really important <eol> when we're trying to engage power holders, <eob> not to be conflicting with them all the time. <eob>
The third way I think activists <eol> are really missing out <eob> if they don't engage introverts <eob> is that introverts, like I said, <eol> can be half of the world's population, <eob> and most of us won't say <eol> that we're introvert, <eob> or we get embarrassed by saying <eol> what overwhelms us. <eob>
So for me, a few years ago, <eob> my mom used to send me texts <eol> in capital letters -- <eob> and she can now do emojis <eol> and everything, she's fine -- <eob> but as soon as I'd see this text, <eob> I'd wince and think, "Ooh, it's capital letters, <eol> it's too much." <eob> And I'd have to ignore it <eol> to read the lovely text she sent me. <eob>
And that's a bit embarrassing, <eob> to tell people that capital <eol> letters overwhelm you, <eob> but we really need introverts <eol> to help us do intriguing activism <eob> that attracts them rather <eol> than puts them off. <eob>
We're put off by big and brash giant posters <eob> and capital letters and explanation marks <eob> telling us what to do and vying <eol> for our attention. <eob>
So some of the things I do with people <eol> around the world who take part <eob> is make small bits of provocative street art <eob> which are hung off eye level, <eol> very small, <eob> and they're provocative messages. <eob>
They're not preaching at people <eol> or telling them what to do. <eob>
They're just getting people <eol> to engage in different ways, <eob> and think for themselves, <eob> because we don't like to be told what to do. <eob>
It might be wearing a green heart on your sleeve <eob> saying what you love and how climate <eol> change will affect it, <eob> and we'll wear it, <eob> and if people say, <eob> "Why are you wearing a green <eol> heart with the word 'chocolate' on?" <eob> and we can have those one-to-one intimate <eol> conversations and say, <eob> "I love chocolate. <eob>
Climate change is going to affect it, <eob> and I think there's lot of other things <eol> that climate change will affect, <eob> and I really want to make sure <eol> I'm part of the solution, not the problem." <eob> And then we deflect, because we don't like <eol> to be the center of attention, <eob> and say, "What do you love <eol> and how will climate change affect it?" <eob>
Or it might be shop-dropping <eol> instead of shop-lifting, <eob> where we'll make little mini-scrolls with lovely stories on <eob> about what's the story <eol> behind your clothes. <eob>
Is it a joyful story of how it's made, <eol> or is it a torturous one? <eob>
And we'll just drop them <eol> in little pockets in shops, <eob> all lowercase, all handwritten, <eob> with kisses and smiley faces in ribbon, <eob> and then people are excited <eol> that they found it. <eob>
And we often drop them <eol> in unethical shops <eob> or in front pockets, <eob> and it's a way that we can do offline campaigning <eob> that engages us <eol> and doesn't burn us out, <eob> but also engages other people <eol> in an intriguing way online and offline. <eob>
So I've got two calls to action, <eob> for the introverts and for the extroverts. <eob>
For the ambivert, <eob> you're involved in all of it. <eob>
For the extroverts, I want to say <eol> that when you're planning a campaign, <eob> think about introverts. <eob>
Think about how valuable our skills are, <eol> just as much as extroverts'. <eob>
We're good at slowing down and thinking deeply, <eob> and the detail of issues, <eol> we're really good at bringing them out. <eob>
We're good at intimate activism, <eol> so use us in that way. <eob>
And we're good at intriguing people <eob> by doing strange little things <eol> that help create conversations and thought. <eob>
Introverts, my call to action for you is, <eob> I know you like being on your own, <eob> I know you like being in your head, <eob> but activism needs you, <eob> so sometimes you've got to get out there. <eob>
It doesn't mean that you've got <eol> to turn into an extrovert and burn out, <eob> because that's no use for anyone, <eob> but what it does mean <eob> is that you should value the skills <eol> and the traits that you have <eob> that activism needs. <eob>
So for everyone in this room, <eob> whether you're an extrovert <eol> or an introvert or an ambivert, <eob> the world needs you now <eol> more than ever, <eob> and you've got no excuse <eol> not to get involved. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Stephanie Busari: President Ameenah, thank you for joining us. <eob>
Even as TED speakers go, <eol> you're something of an overachiever. <eob>
SB: You have a PhD <eol> in organic chemistry, <eob> you were vice chancellor of the University <eol> of Mauritius, <eob> a successful entrepreneur, <eob> you've won numerous awards <eol> for your work in science <eob> and you're the first Muslim <eol> female head of state in Africa. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And of course, you're no stranger <eol> to the TEDGlobal stage; <eob> you gave a talk in 2014. <eob>
Did you have any political <eol> ambitions at that time? <eob>
How did you go from academic to president? <eob>
AGF: OK, thanks, Stephanie. <eob> First of all, I'd like to thank TED <eob> for having given me <eol> the opportunity to be here today. <eob>
And I would also like to thank <eol> the government of Tanzania <eob> and the president for the welcome. <eob>
And also, I'd like to thank the contribution <eol> of our consul, <eob> Mr. Rizvi, who's here, <eob> has been very supportive <eol> for all our stay here. <eob>
Now, to answer your question, <eob> did I have any ambitions in politics? <eob>
The straight answer is no. <eob>
I did not choose the world of politics; <eob> the world of politics chose me. <eob>
So here I am. <eob>
SB: So, was there ever anything <eol> in your journey <eob> that ever made you think <eob> that one day you would become <eol> president of your country? <eob>
Did you ever imagine that? <eob>
AGF: Absolutely not. <eob> I think the journey started <eol> immediately after TED, actually. <eob>
When I went back, this journalist <eol> called me and said, <eob> "You know, your name has been cited <eol> for the president of the republic," <eob> I said, "Ma'am, <eol> you must be mistaken, <eob> because I have no ambition whatsoever." <eob> She said, "No, it's serious. <eob>
Can you come and tell me this <eol> in the form of a declaration? <eob>
So, OK, you'll come? <eob> "So, of course, as good journalists go, <eob> the next day I see my TED picture <eob> and, with my name, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim," <eob> For president? <eob> "A very small interrogation mark — <eob> and people don't see the interrogation mark, <eob> they just see my name <eol> and they see my picture. <eob>
And that was a sounding board. <eob>
And again, as you have just said, <eob> it was a very interesting scenario <eob> because it was a scenario <eol> where they wanted to have somebody <eob> who was credible, <eob> had this political neutrality <eob> and at the same time, was for a minority <eob> because Islam is a minority <eol> religion in Mauritius, <eob> because in Mauritius, we stratify people's origins <eob> by virtue of their religious belief. <eob>
And -- I was a woman. <eob>
So this made it all very interesting. <eob>
So there we go, and this whole campaign started, <eob> and then people said, "Why not?" <eob> Now, this is very important <eol> to note, Stephanie, <eob> because normally, the president <eol> is elected after the election. <eob>
And here we had a scenario <eob> where the name of the president <eol> was flagged before the election process, <eob> during the campaign. <eob>
So when people voted, they knew <eol> that at some point, <eob> they would have this <eol> Muslim woman president. <eob>
SB: Does it feel significant <eol> to you as a woman <eob> to be the first female president of your country? <eob>
AGF: It's important for many reasons. <eob>
I think, obviously, you just mentioned <eol> the terrible statistics <eob> of two female presidents <eol> in the whole of Africa. <eob>
But more importantly, <eob> I think it's important also coming <eol> from the background I come from -- <eob> by background I mean not ethnic, <eol> but more academic and entrepreneurial -- <eob> to be there, <eob> to be that role model <eol> for that little girl growing in my village <eob> to say, "Yes, it's possible." <eob> It's possible. <eob>
It's also important, Stephanie, <eob> while I talk about diversity -- <eob> diversity in the widest sense of the word. <eob>
We've seen that whenever <eol> there was diversity, <eob> whenever there was openness, <eob> whenever there was dialogue, <eob> this was the time when societies <eol> have been most productive. <eob>
When we talk about the Arab Golden Age, <eob> we cannot not think of Ibn Sina, <eob> al-Haytham, <eob> Averroes, <eob> Maimonides. <eob>
This was a time when cultures, religions -- <eob> they were talking to each other. <eob>
They were at peace with each other. <eob>
And this was a time <eol> when they were highly productive. <eob>
So I would say: bring down these walls. <eob>
SB: Absolutely, absolutely. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
AGF: Virtual or otherwise. <eob>
SB: Let's also talk <eol> about another conflict area <eob> which you straddle quite interestingly. <eob>
As a woman of faith <eol> and also a scientist, <eob> you know, faith and science <eol> seem to be at loggerheads. <eob>
It wasn't always so, <eob> but I'm interested to get <eol> your thoughts on how you reconcile both <eob> and how they coexist <eol> for you personally. <eob>
AGF: They're not mutually exclusive. <eob>
I mean, if you're a scientist, <eob> you tend to really look <eol> at the perfection of the human body, <eob> the way it functions. <eob>
If you look at nature as a whole. <eob>
I'm still amazed at the perfection <eob> with which the entire ecosystem functions <eol> together. <eob>
However, to the purists, <eol> to those who are of faith, <eob> they will tell you, "Yes, there has been evolution." <eob> Even the Pope has agreed that evolution exists. <eob>
But there's always the question: <eol> What came first? <eob>
What came before this? <eob>
When we talk about <eol> all the various strata of evolution, <eob> we'll always be asking the question, <eob> there must be something before. <eob>
So I'm of the opinion that yes, <eob> there is this great spiritual force <eol> which is guiding the process, <eob> and things like this <eol> don't happen by chance. <eob>
Now, whether you call it religiosity, <eob> whether you call this great spirit <eol> by any name -- <eob> Brahma, Allah, the Holy Trinity -- <eob> you name it -- <eob> but I still think that these two are not <eol> mutually exclusive. <eob>
They can still coexist with each other. <eob>
SB: So let's move to one <eol> of your passions -- science. <eob>
You've made no secret of that. <eob>
And you've always been passionate <eol> about science. <eob>
I read that when you were a very young girl, <eob> you went to a career <eol> guidance counselor <eob> and told them you wanted <eol> to become a chemist, <eob> and they said, "No, <eol> it's for boys. <eob>
Boys do science." <eob> Did that make you even more determined <eol> to study science <eob> and to succeed in that field? <eob> How did you respond to that? <eob>
AGF: Well, to begin with, <eob> I must say, before I came <eol> to that career guidance officer, <eob> I had great teachers who motivated. <eob>
And this is something I would like <eol> to draw attention to again, <eob> to our education system. <eob>
We have to do away <eol> with this rote learning. <eob>
We have to ensure <eol> that we drive this curiosity in the child, <eob> and they need to be curious. <eob>
And if we want to move along the line <eol> for them to become great scientists, <eob> they need to become more and more curious <eol> in everything they do. <eob>
So every time -- exactly -- <eol> I went to see the careers guidance, <eob> he looked at me and said, <eol> "What do you want to do?" <eob> I said, "I want to study chemistry." <eob> "Well, you shouldn't study <eol> chemistry because this is for boys. <eob>
And the next thing, when you come back, <eol> there'll be no job for you." <eob> So I went back home, <eob> and I had a great cheerleader at home <eol> who happens to be my father. <eob>
He said, "What do you want to do?" <eol> and asked, "What did he say?" <eob> I said, "This is what he said ..." <eol> He said, "What are you going to do?" <eob> I said, "I'm going to do chemistry." <eob> So there I was. <eob>
And one thing I will say: <eol> one must always follow your heart. <eob>
And my heart was always in chemistry. <eob>
I did what I was passionate about, <eob> and I thought at some point <eol> that I had developed this thinking <eob> that if you're passionate about what you do, <eob> you will not have to work <eol> a single day in your life, <eob> until I realized it was Confucius who said that. <eob>
SB: So do you feel a responsibility, <eol> as someone in your position, <eob> to encourage young girls, <eol> especially on this continent, <eob> to study STEM subjects? <eob>
Is that something <eol> that you actively work -- <eob>
AGF: You know, over the past two days, Stephanie, <eob> we've been hearing a lot of conversation <eob> about the sustainable development goals. <eob>
We've seen that, for example, <eob> Africa must be food secure, <eob> Africa must be energy secure, <eob> Africa must be water secure. <eob>
If we want to get <eol> to that level of development -- <eob> Agenda 2030 <eol> is not very far away -- <eob> if you want to have success, <eob> we need to have an educated <eol> youth in Africa. <eob>
And again, to be very cliché: <eob> you cannot achieve, <eol> you cannot win a football match, <eob> if you're going to leave <eol> 52 percent of the team outside. <eob> It's not possible. <eob>
SB: Yes. <eob>
AGF: So we need highly educated, <eob> we need female intuition, <eob> and we need to get them there. <eob>
And this is where a great deal <eol> of effort has to be done <eob> to actually motivate them <eol> from a very young age, <eob> to tell that girl that she can do anything. <eob>
And if the message comes from her father, <eob> if the message comes from her brother, <eob> it's even much more powerful. <eob>
We need to tell her <eol> that anything is possible <eob> and she can do it. <eob>
We need to build her self-confidence <eol> from a very early age, <eob> but more importantly, <eob> we also need to actually look at the books, <eob> because there are too many stereotypes. <eob>
Last year, I was very shocked when I went <eol> to a debate on Women's Day. <eob>
They had a survey, <eob> and they were asking these girls <eol> how many women inventors we have, <eob> how many women scientists do we have. <eob>
And you'd be shocked <eol> that hardly anyone knew <eob> that Ada Lovelace was there <eol> behind computer science, <eob> that Marie Curie still remains <eol> iconic with two Nobel prizes. <eob>
So there's a lot of homework <eol> to do to actually make -- <eob> to remove all these gender biases <eol> at a very young age; <eob> instill that confidence in that girl; <eob> to tell her that she can do as well <eol> if not better than her brother. <eob>
SB: Yes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So, let's move on to an area that I know <eol> you've been very active in, <eob> which is the issue of biodiversity. <eob>
You've been quite clear that this is an area <eol> that Africa must embrace. <eob>
We have an abundance of rich her <eol>bal traditions and plants <eob> that could be developed into a big pharmaceutical industry. <eob>
Can you tell us a little bit of how <eol> you've been using your expertise <eob> to harness growth in this area? <eob>
AGF: <eob> Thank you. <eob> Yesterday, I was listening <eol> to one of the talks; <eob> it was the talk about the need <eol> for Africa to turn into a knowledge economy. <eob>
Africa has got very rich traditions. <eob>
Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa, <eob> has got over 5,000 medicinal <eol> plant species, <eob> not harnessed. <eob>
And, in fact, at the TED talk <eol> I gave in 2014, <eob> I came out with one sentence: <eob> "Biodiversity underpins life on earth." <eob> And if we don't look after this biodiversity, <eob> if we don't protect it, <eob> if we don't actually harness it <eol> in the right way, <eob> we are threatening our own livelihoods <eol> on this planet. <eob>
When we talk about the contribution <eol> from countries of the north <eob> to the Green Fund <eol> for the protection of our planet, <eob> it is not charity. <eob>
It is to ensure <eol> our own collective livelihoods on this planet. <eob>
So this is something <eol> that must be addressed. <eob>
Now, again, when you talk about <eob> getting this biodiversity <eol> of Africa working for us, <eob> you'd be shocked to know <eob> that out of the 1,100 blockbuster <eol> drugs that we have on the market, <eob> only 83 come from African plants. <eob> Why is this so? <eob> Because we are responsible; <eob> us Africans. <eob>
We don't value our own <eol> traditional knowledge. <eob>
We don't give it the same status <eol> as allopathic medicine. <eob>
Look at what China has done. <eob>
China has given the same status <eol> for traditional Chinese medicine <eob> as allopathic medicine, <eob> as of 2016. <eob>
Our governments, our people, <eol> have not documented, <eob> have not taken this knowledge seriously. <eob>
If you want to get serious about Africa <eol> becoming a knowledge continent, <eob> this is something that we need <eol> to address very seriously, <eob> we need to start documenting, <eob> we need to start codifying this knowledge, <eob> and unfortunately, <eol> we are racing against time <eob> because tradition in Africa is that the transmission <eol> has always been oral. <eob>
So we need to get our act together <eol> and make it happen. <eob>
SB: So there's really a sense <eol> of urgency around this. <eob>
AGF: Yes. <eob>
SB: And have you done anything yourself in respect to documenting -- <eob>
AGF: Yes, <eob> I definitely did. <eob>
When I started my career <eol> in academia, <eob> one of the first things I did was I documented <eol> precisely these plants. <eob>
And I'll tell you one thing -- <eol> it was not perceived to be very serious, <eob> because here I was, in synthetic organic chemistry, <eob> going out there, talking to these grandmothers, <eob> documenting their recipes. <eob>
I mean, you can't be serious -- <eol> bringing weeds in the lab, <eob> and say, "We're going to be working on these." <eob> Are we going to get results? <eob>
So it was really a race against prejudice <eob> to try to take people's -- <eob> bring them to the table and say, <eol> "Look, this is very important." <eob> But I'm glad I did, <eob> because by that time, you start <eol> developing a crocodile skin, <eob> especially when you're a woman in the lab <eol> doing different things. <eob> You know -- you become suspect. <eob>
So I documented it; I'm very happy I did. <eob>
And now, almost 20 years <eol> since the documentation, <eob> it now constitutes prior art, <eob> and is now very well-documented <eol> at WIPO, <eob> and it is now the information which, <eob> subsequently, my company actually started <eol> working on as well. <eob>
SB: So, I watched you in the makeup room <eob> taking selfies with the makeup artist, <eob> and just being generally very accessible. <eob>
And it strikes me <eob> that you're not the kind of typical, <eol> big-man, African leader. <eob> You seem very -- <eob>
AGF: You just demoted me. <eol> You called me a man. <eob>
SB: I mean your style -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Your style seems to be very accessible <eol> and quite unassuming. <eob>
So is this -- <eob> I mean, people tend to ask women leaders <eob> if their gender has a bearing on the way they rule, <eob> or the way they lead. <eob>
Does that apply to you? <eob>
AGF: You know, I've never <eol> taken myself seriously. <eob>
SB: OK. That's good. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
AGF: I still don't. <eob>
And I don't think <eol> you should take yourself seriously. <eob>
You need to have trust <eol> in what you can do, <eob> have confidence in yourself <eob> and give yourself a set of goals <eol> and just work towards them. <eob>
So the goal I've given myself is, OK, <eol> I'm leading my third life -- <eob> because I've been an academic, <eol> I've been an entrepreneur, now I'm here. <eob>
I'm hoping to have a fourth life. <eob>
So put these to work for the continent. <eob>
And this is why I have chosen <eol> to give my voice to so many initiatives <eob> that would help the youth of Africa become tech-savvy, <eob> become science-savvy, <eob> because as I said earlier on, <eob> up until they get to grips with science, <eob> with whatever is around — media, technology, you name it, <eob> all calls for a good grounding <eol> in science, technology and innovation. <eob>
I think we'll be here, <eob> 10 years, 20 years down the line, <eob> having the same conversation. <eob>
SB: Let's talk quickly <eol> about the challenges <eob> of leadership and governance. <eob>
It's hard to ignore that <eol> there's corruption on this continent <eob> with some of our leaders. <eob>
How have you confronted <eol> that in your role, <eob> and what experiences <eol> can you share with us around this issue? <eob>
AGF: We've had corruption -- <eob> corruption doesn't exist only in Africa. <eob>
Where there is a corruptee, <eol> there is a corrupter. <eob> Right? It's always a two-way process. <eob>
We have focused in my country, <eob> we are working very hard <eol> towards doing something about corruption, <eob> but, you know, they also have <eol> great people in Africa. <eob>
Why do we always focus on the negative? <eob>
Why don't we talk about... <eob> I want to bring on board, <eol> for example, the great quotes of Nelson Mandela. <eob>
His legacy is still very much alive. <eob>
We have people in -- even in Tanzania, <eol> we've had Julius Nyerere, <eob> he have Nkrumah, <eob> we have Kenyatta, <eob> we have all these people who have been champions of Africa. <eob>
I think we need to take pages <eol> of their book and see. <eob>
In fact, Julius Nyerere himself <eol> had been a great advocate for science <eob> when he said that "science <eol> will make deserts bloom." <eob> So these are some of the founding fathers <eol> of this continent; <eob> we need to take pages from them <eob> and move ahead. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
SB: <eob> Thank you <eob> very much, President Fakim. <eob>
AGF: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
The informal markets of Africa <eol> are stereotypically seen <eob> as chaotic and lackadaisical. <eob>
The downside of hearing <eol> the word "informal" <eob> is this automatic grand association we have, <eob> which is very negative, <eob> and it's had significant consequences <eol> and economic losses, <eob> easily adding -- or subtracting -- 40 to 60 percent <eol> of the profit margin <eob> for the informal markets alone. <eob>
As part of a task <eol> of mapping the informal trade ecosystem, <eob> we've done an extensive literature review <eob> of all the reports and research on cross-border <eol> trade in East Africa, <eob> going back 20 years. <eob>
This was to prepare us for fieldwork <eol> to understand what was the problem, <eob> what was holding back informal trade <eol> in the informal sector. <eob>
What we discovered <eol> over the last 20 years was, <eob> nobody had distinguished between illicit -- <eob> which is like smuggling <eol> or contraband in the informal sector -- <eob> from the legal but unrecorded, <eob> such as tomatoes, oranges, fruit. <eob>
This criminalization -- <eob> what in Swahili refers to as "biashara," <eol> which is the trade or the commerce, <eob> versus "magendo," <eol> which is the smuggling or contraband -- <eob> this criminalization <eol> of the informal sector, <eob> in English, by not distinguishing <eol> between these aspects, <eob> easily can cost each African economy <eol> between 60 to 80 percent addition <eob> on the annual GDP growth rate, <eob> because we are not recognizing the engine <eob> of what keeps the economies running. <eob>
The informal sector <eol> is growing jobs at four times the rate <eob> of the traditional formal economy, <eob> or "modern" economy, as many call it. <eob>
It offers employment <eol> and income generation opportunities <eob> to the most "unskilled" <eol> in conventional disciplines. <eob>
But can you make a french fry machine <eol> out of an old car? <eob>
So, this, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> is what so desperately needs <eol> to be recognized. <eob>
As long as the current assumptions <eol> hold that this is criminal, <eob> this is shadow, <eob> this is illegal, <eob> there will be no attempt at integrating <eol> the informal economic ecosystem <eob> with the formal or even the global one. <eob>
I'm going to tell you a story <eol> of Teresia, <eob> a trader who overturned all our assumptions, <eob> made us question all the stereotypes <eol> that we'd gone in on, <eob> based on 20 years of literature review. <eob>
Teresia sells clothes under a tree <eol> in a town called Malaba, <eob> on the border of Uganda <eol> and Kenya. <eob>
You think it's very simple, don't you? <eob>
We'll go hang up new clothes <eol> from the branches, <eob> put out the tarp, <eol> settle down, wait for customers, <eob> and there we have it. <eob>
She was everything we were expecting <eol> according to the literature, <eob> to the research, <eob> right down to she was a single mom <eol> driven to trade, <eob> supporting her kids. <eob>
So what overturned our assumptions? <eob> What surprised us? <eob> First, Teresia paid the county government market fees <eob> every single working day <eob> for the privilege <eol> of setting up shop under her tree. <eob>
She's been doing it for seven years, <eob> and she's been getting receipts. <eob> She keeps records. <eob> We're seeing not a marginal, <eob> underprivileged, <eob> vulnerable African woman trader <eol> by the side of the road -- no. <eob>
We were seeing somebody <eol> who's keeping sales records for years; <eob> somebody who had an entire ecosystem <eol> of retail that comes in from Uganda <eob> to pick up inventory; <eob> someone who's got handcarts <eol> bringing the goods in, <eob> or the mobile money agent <eol> who comes to collect cash <eob> at the end of the evening. <eob>
Can you guess how much Teresia <eol> spends, on average, <eob> each month on inventory -- <eob> stocks of new clothes <eol> that she gets from Nairobi? <eob> One thousand five hundred US dollars. <eob> That's around 20,000 US dollars invested <eol> in trade goods and services <eob> every year. <eob>
This is Teresia, <eob> the invisible one, <eob> the hidden middle. <eob>
And she's only the first rung <eol> of the small entrepreneurs, <eob> the micro-businesses that can be found <eol> in these market towns. <eob>
At least in the larger Malaba border, <eol> she's at the first rung. <eob>
The people further up the value chain <eob> are easily running three lines <eol> of business, <eob> investing 2,500 to 3,000 US dollars every month. <eob>
So the problem turned out <eol> that it wasn't the criminalization; <eob> you can't really criminalize <eol> someone you're charging receipts from. <eob>
It's the lack of recognition <eol> of their skilled occupations. <eob>
The bank systems and structures <eol> have no means to recognize them <eob> as micro-businesses, <eob> much less the fact that, you know, <eob> her tree doesn't have a forwarding address. <eob>
So she's trapped in the middle. <eob> She's falling through <eol> the cracks of our assumptions. <eob>
You know all those microloans <eol> to help African women traders? <eob>
They're going to loan her <eol> 50 dollars or 100 dollars. <eob>
What's she going to do with it? <eob>
She spends 10 times <eol> that amount every month <eob> just on inventory -- <eob> we're not talking about <eol> the additional services <eob> or the support ecosystem. <eob>
These are the ones <eol> who fit neither the policy stereotype <eob> of the low-skilled and the marginalized, <eob> nor the white-collar, <eol> salaried office worker <eob> or civil servant with a pension <eob> that the middle classes <eol> are allegedly composed of. <eob>
Instead, what we have here <eol> are the proto-SMEs <eob> these are the fertile seeds <eol> of businesses and enterprises <eob> that keep the engines running. <eob>
They put food on your table. <eob>
Even here in this hotel, <eol> the invisible ones — <eob> the butchers, the bakers <eol> the candlestick makers — <eob> they make the machines <eol> that make your french fries <eob> and they make your beds. <eob>
These are the invisible businesswomen <eol> trading across borders, <eob> all on the side of the road, <eob> and so they're invisible to data gatherers. <eob>
And they're mashed together <eol> with the vast informal sector <eob> that doesn't bother to distinguish between smugglers <eol> and tax evaders <eob> and those running illegal whatnot, <eob> and the ladies who trade, <eob> and who put food on the table <eol> and send their kids to university. <eob>
So that's really what I'm asking here. <eob>
That's all that we need to start by doing. <eob>
Can we start by recognizing <eol> the skills, the occupations? <eob>
We could transform the informal economy <eol> by beginning with this recognition <eob> and then designing the customized <eol> doorways for them to enter <eob> or integrate with the formal, <eob> with the global, <eob> with the entire system. <eob>
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was six when I had the first chance <eol> to learn what patience means. <eob>
My grandmother gave me a magic box <eol> as a birthday present, <eob> which neither of us knew <eol> would become a gift for life. <eob>
I became obsessed with magic, <eob> and at 20, I became an amateur dove magician. <eob>
This act of magic requires <eol> that I train my doves <eob> to sit and wait inside my clothing. <eob>
As a young magician, <eol> I was always in a rush to make them appear, <eob> but my teacher told me <eob> the secret to the success <eol> of this magical act <eob> is to make my doves appear <eol> only after they've waited patiently <eob> in my tuxedo. <eob>
It has to be a mindful <eol> kind of patience, <eob> the kind that took me some years to master. <eob>
When life took me to Shanghai <eol> seven years ago, <eob> the mindful patience I learned <eol> became almost impossible to practice. <eob>
In China, where everyone <eol> and everything is in a hurry, <eob> you need to outperform over 1.3 billion other people <eob> to build a better life. <eob>
You hack the system, bend the rules, <eob> circumvent the boundaries. <eob>
It is the same when it comes to food ... <eob> except that when it comes to food, <eob> impatience can have dire consequences. <eob>
In the haste to grow more, sell more, <eob> 4,000 years of agriculture in a country <eol> of rich natural resources <eob> is spoiled by the overuse <eol> of chemicals and pesticides. <eob>
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed <eob> half a million food safety violations <eol> in just nine months. <eob>
Alarmingly, one in every four <eol> diabetics in the world <eob> now comes from China. <eob>
The stories around food <eob> are scary and somewhat overwhelming, <eob> and I told myself it's time to bring <eol> a mindful patience into the impatience. <eob>
When I say mindful patience, <eob> I don't mean the ability to wait. <eob>
I mean knowing how to act while waiting. <eob>
And so, while I wait for the day <eob> when a sustainable food system <eol> becomes a reality in China, <eob> I launched one of China's first online farmers market <eob> to bring local, organically grown <eol> produce to families. <eob>
When we went live, 18 months ago, <eob> the food we could sell <eol> then was somewhat dismal. <eob>
We had no fruit and hardly any meat to sell, <eob> as none that was sent to the lab <eol> passed our zero tolerance test <eob> towards pesticides, <eol> chemicals, antibiotics and hormones. <eob>
I told our very anxious employees <eob> that we would not give up until we've met <eol> every local farmer in China. <eob>
Today, we supply 240 types of produce <eob> from 57 local farmers. <eob>
After almost one year of searching, <eob> we finally found chemical-free <eol> bananas <eob> grown in the backyards <eol> of villagers on Hainan Island. <eob>
And only two hours away <eol> from Shanghai, <eob> on an island that even Google Maps <eol> does not have coordinates for, <eob> we found a place where cows eat grass <eob> and roam free under the blue sky. <eob>
We also work hard on logistics. <eob>
We deliver our customers' orders <eol> in as fast as three hours <eob> on electric vehicles, <eob> and we use biodegradable, <eol> reusable boxes <eob> to minimize our environmental footprint. <eob>
I have no doubt that our offerings <eol> will continue to grow, <eob> but it will take time, <eob> and I know a lot more people are needed <eol> to shape the future of good food. <eob>
So last year, I founded China's first food tech <eol> accelerator and VC platform <eob> to help start-ups to shape <eol> the future of good food <eob> the way they want, <eob> be that through using edible insects <eol> as a more sustainable source of protein <eob> or using essential oils to keep food fresh for longer. <eob>
So, you may still ask: <eob> Why are you trying to build <eol> a sustainable food system <eob> by driving a patient movement <eob> in a country where it's <eol> almost a crime to take it slow? <eob>
Because, for me, <eob> the real secret to success <eol> is patience -- <eob> a mindful kind of patience <eob> that requires knowing how to act while waiting, <eob> the kind of patience I learned <eol> with my grandmother's magic box. <eob>
After all, we do not inherit <eol> the earth from our ancestors. <eob> We borrow it from our children. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"All I wanted was a much-deserved promotion, <eob> and he told me to 'Get up on the desk <eob> and spread' em. '" <eob> "All the men in my office wrote down <eol> on a piece of paper <eob> the sexual favors that I could do for them. <eob>
All I had asked for was an office <eol> with a window." <eob> "I asked for his advice about how I could get <eol> a bill out of committee; <eob> he asked me if I brought my kneepads." <eob> Those are just a few <eol> of the horrific stories <eob> that I heard from women over the last year, <eob> as I've been investigating <eol> workplace sexual harassment. <eob>
And what I found out <eob> is that it's an epidemic across the world. <eob>
It's a horrifying reality <eol> for millions of women, <eob> when all they want to do every day <eob> is go to work. <eob>
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate. <eob>
You can wear a skirt, <eob> hospital scrubs, <eob> army fatigues. <eob>
You can be young or old, <eob> married or single, <eob> black or white. <eob>
You can be a Republican, <eol> a Democrat or an Independent. <eob>
I heard from so many women: <eob> police officers, <eob> members of our military, <eob> financial assistants, <eob> actors, engineers, lawyers, <eob> bankers, accountants, teachers ... <eob> journalists. <eob>
Sexual harassment, it turns out, <eob> is not about sex. <eob>
It's about power, <eob> and about what somebody does to you <eob> to try and take away your power. <eob>
And I'm here today <eob> to encourage you to know that you can take <eol> that power back. <eob> (Applause) <eob> On July 6, 2016, <eob> I jumped off a cliff <eol> all by myself. <eob>
It was the scariest moment of my life; <eob> an excruciating choice to make. <eob>
I fell into an abyss all alone, <eob> not knowing what would be below. <eob>
But then, something miraculous <eol> started to happen. <eob>
Thousands of women <eol> started reaching out to me <eob> to share their own stories of pain <eol> and agony and shame. <eob>
They told me that I became their voice -- <eob> they were voiceless. <eob>
And suddenly, I realized <eol> that even in the 21st century, <eob> every woman still has a story. <eob>
Like Joyce, <eob> a flight attendant supervisor <eob> whose boss, in meetings every day, <eob> would tell her about the porn <eol> that he'd watched the night before <eob> while drawing penises on his notepad. <eob>
She went to complain. <eob>
She was called "crazy" and fired. <eob>
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker. <eob>
Her male colleagues would call her <eol> that vile c-word every day. <eob>
She complained -- <eob> labeled a troublemaker, <eob> never to do another Wall Street deal again. <eob>
Like Elizabeth, an army officer. <eob>
Her male subordinates would wave <eol> one-dollar bills in her face, <eob> and say, "Dance for me!" <eob> And when she went to complain <eol> to a major, <eob> he said, "What? Only one dollar? <eob> You're worth at least five or ten!" <eob>
After reading, <eob> replying to all <eob> and crying over all of these emails, <eob> I realized I had so much work to do. <eob>
Here are the startling facts: <eob> one in three women -- <eol> that we know of -- <eob> have been sexually harassed in the workplace. <eob>
Seventy-one percent of those <eol> incidences never get reported. <eob> Why? <eob> Because when women come forward, <eob> they're still called liars <eol> and troublemakers <eob> and demeaned and trashed <eob> and demoted and blacklisted <eob> and fired. <eob>
Reporting sexual harassment can be, in many cases, <eol> career-ending. <eob>
Of all the women that reached out to me, <eob> almost none are still today <eol> working in their chosen profession, <eob> and that is outrageous. <eob>
I, too, was silent in the beginning. <eob>
It happened to me at the end <eol> of my year as Miss America, <eob> when I was meeting with a very <eol> high-ranking TV executive <eob> in New York City. <eob>
I thought he was helping me <eol> throughout the day, <eob> making a lot of phone calls. <eob>
We went to dinner, <eob> and in the back seat of a car, <eol> he suddenly lunged on top of me <eob> and stuck his tongue down my throat. <eob>
I didn't realize that to "get <eol> into the business" -- silly me -- <eob> he also intended to get into my pants. <eob>
And just a week later, <eob> when I was in Los Angeles <eol> meeting with a high-ranking publicist, <eob> it happened again. <eob>
Again, in a car. <eob>
And he took my neck in his hand, <eob> and he shoved my head <eol> so hard into his crotch, <eob> I couldn't breathe. <eob>
These are the events <eol> that suck the life out of all of your self-confidence. <eob>
These are the events that, until recently, <eob> I didn't even call assault. <eob>
And this is why we have <eol> so much work to do. <eob>
After my year as Miss America, <eob> I continued to meet a lot <eol> of well-known people, <eob> including Donald Trump. <eob>
When this picture was taken in 1988, <eob> nobody could have ever predicted <eol> where we'd be today. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Me, fighting to end <eol> sexual harassment in the workplace; <eob> he, president of the United States <eob> in spite of it. <eob>
And shortly thereafter, I got my first gig in television news <eob> in Richmond, Virginia. <eob>
Check out that confident smile <eol> with the bright pink jacket. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Not so much the hair. <eob> I was working so hard <eol> to prove that blondes have a lot of brains. <eob>
But ironically, one of the first <eol> stories I covered <eob> was the Anita Hill hearings <eol> in Washington, DC. <eob>
And shortly thereafter, <eob> I, too, was sexually <eol> harassed in the workplace. <eob>
I was covering a story <eol> in rural Virginia, <eob> and when we got back into the car, <eob> my cameraman started saying to me, <eob> wondering how much I had enjoyed <eol> when he touched my breasts <eob> when he put the microphone on me. <eob>
And it went downhill from there. <eob>
I was bracing myself <eol> against the passenger door -- <eob> this was before cellphones. <eob> I was petrified. <eob> I actually envisioned myself rolling <eol> outside of that door <eob> as the car was going 50 miles per hour <eol> like I'd seen in the movies, <eob> and wondering how much it would hurt. <eob>
When the story about Harvey <eol> Weinstein came to light -- <eob> one the most well-known movie moguls <eol> in all of Hollywood -- <eob> the allegations were horrific. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> But so many women came forward, <eob> and it made me realize what I had done meant something. <eob> He had such a lame excuse. <eob>
He said he was a product <eol> of the '60s and '70s, <eob> and that that was the culture then. <eob>
Yeah, that was the culture then, <eob> and unfortunately, it still is. <eob> Why? <eob> Because of all the myths <eob> that are still associated <eol> with sexual harassment. <eob> "Women should just take another job <eol> and find another career." <eob> Yeah, right. <eob>
Tell that to the single mom <eol> working two jobs, <eob> trying to make ends meet, <eob> who's also being sexually harassed. <eob> "Women -- <eob> they bring it on themselves." <eob> By the clothes that we wear <eob> and the makeup that we put on. <eob>
Yeah, I guess those hoodies <eol> that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley <eob> are just so provocative. <eob> "Women make it up." <eob> Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding <eob> to be demeaned and taken down. <eob> I would know. <eob>
"Women bring these claims <eol> because they want to be famous and rich." <eob> Our own president said that. <eob>
I bet Taylor Swift, <eob> one of the most well-known <eol> and richest singers in the world, <eob> didn't need more money or fame <eob> when she came forward with her <eol> groping case <eob> for one dollar. <eob>
And I'm so glad she did. <eob>
Breaking news: <eob> the untold story about women <eol> and sexual harassment in the workplace: <eob> women just want a safe, welcoming <eob> and harass-free environment. <eob> That's it. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> So how do we go about getting <eol> our power back? <eob>
I have three solutions. <eob>
Number one: <eob> we need to turn bystanders <eol> and enablers into allies. <eob>
Ninety-eight percent <eol> of United States corporations right now <eob> have sexual harassment training policies. <eob> Seventy percent <eol> have prevention programs. <eob>
But still, overwhelmingly, <eob> bystanders and witnesses <eol> don't come forward. <eob>
In 2016, <eob> the Harvard Business Review <eol> called it the "bystander effect." <eob> And yet — remember 9 / 11. <eob>
Millions of times we've heard, <eob> "If you see something, <eob> say something." <eob> Imagine how impactful that would be <eol> if we carried that through <eob> to bystanders in the workplace <eol> regarding sexual harassment -- <eob> to recognize and interrupt these incidences; <eob> to confront the perpetrators to their face; <eob> to help and protect the victims. <eob>
This is my shout-out to men: <eob> we need you in this fight. <eob>
And to women, too -- <eob> enablers to allies. <eob>
Number two: <eob> change the laws. <eob>
How many of you out there know <eob> whether or not you have <eol> a forced arbitration clause <eob> in your employment contract? <eob>
Not a lot of hands. <eob>
And if you don't know, you should, <eob> and here's why. <eob>
TIME Magazine calls it, <eob> right there on the screen, <eob> "The teeny tiny little print in contracts <eob> that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard." <eob> Here's what it is. <eob>
Forced arbitration <eol> takes away your Seventh Amendment right <eob> to an open jury process. <eob> It's secret. <eob> You don't get the same witnesses <eol> or depositions. <eob>
In many cases, the company picks <eol> the arbitrator for you. <eob>
There are no appeals, <eob> and only 20 percent of the time <eol> does the employee win. <eob>
But again, it's secret, <eob> so nobody ever knows what happened to you. <eob>
This is why I've been working <eol> so diligently <eob> on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC <eob> to <eob> change the laws. <eob>
And here's what I tell the Senators: <eob> sexual harassment is apolitical. <eob>
Before somebody harasses you, <eob> they don't ask you if you're a Republican <eol> or Democrat first. <eob> They just do it. <eob>
It starts when we stand tall, <eob> and we build that self-confidence. <eob>
And we stand up and we speak up, <eob> and we tell the world what happened to us. <eob>
I know it's scary, <eob> but let's do it for our kids. <eob>
Let's stop this for the next generations. <eob>
I know that I did it for my children. <eob>
They were paramount in my decision-making <eob> about whether or not I would come forward. <eob>
My beautiful children, <eob> my 12-year-old son, Christian, <eob> my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia. <eob>
And boy, did I underestimate them. <eob>
The first day of school last year <eob> happened to be the day <eol> my resolution was announced, <eob> and I was so anxious about what they would face. <eob>
My daughter came home <eol> from school and she said, <eob> "Mommy, so many people <eol> asked me what happened to you over the summer." <eob> Then she looked at me in the eyes <eob> and she said, "And mommy, <eob> I was so proud <eob> to say that you were my mom." <eob> And two weeks later, <eob> when she finally found <eol> the courage to stand up to two kids <eob> who had been making her life miserable, <eob> she came home to me and she said, <eob> "Mommy, I found <eol> the courage to do it <eob> because I saw you do it." <eob> (Applause) <eob> You see, giving the gift of courage <eol> is contagious. <eob>
And I hope that my journey <eol> has inspired you, <eob> because right now, it's the tipping point. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> We are watching history happen. <eob> More and more women <eol> are coming forward and saying, <eob> "Enough is enough." <eob> Here's my one last plea to companies. <eob>
Let's hire back all those women <eol> whose careers were lost <eob> because of some random jerk. <eob>
Because here's what I know about women: <eob> we will not longer be <eol> underestimated, intimidated or set back; <eob> we will not be silenced by the ways <eol> of the establishment <eob> or the relics of the past. <eob> No. <eob> We will stand up and speak up <eob> and have our voices heard. <eob>
We will be the women we were meant to be. <eob>
And above all, <eob> we will always <eob> be fierce. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
What if you could make <eol> your sleep more efficient? <eob>
As a sleep scientist, <eob> this is the question <eol> that has captivated me <eob> for the past 10 years. <eob>
Because while the lightbulb and technology <eol> have brought about a world <eob> of 24-hour work <eol> and productivity, <eob> it has come at the cost <eob> of our naturally occurring <eol> circadian rhythm <eob> and our body's need for sleep. <eob>
The circadian rhythm dictates <eol> our energy level throughout the day, <eob> and only recently we've been conducting <eol> a global experiment on this rhythm, <eob> which is putting our sleep health <eob> and ultimately our life quality <eol> in jeopardy. <eob>
Because of this, <eob> we aren't getting the sleep we need, <eob> with the average American sleeping <eol> a whole hour less <eob> than they did in the 1940s. <eob>
For some reason, <eob> we decided to wear it as a badge of honor <eob> that we can get by on not enough sleep. <eob>
This all adds up to a real health crisis. <eob>
Most of us know that poor <eol> sleep is linked to diseases <eob> like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, <eob> stroke and diabetes. <eob>
And if you go untreated with a sleep <eol> disorder like sleep apnea, <eob> you're more likely to get many of these illnesses. <eob>
But did you know about sleep's impact <eol> on your mental states? <eob>
Poor sleep makes us make risky, <eol> rash decisions <eob> and is a drain on our capacity <eol> for empathy. <eob>
When sleep deprivation literally makes us <eol> more sensitive to our own pain, <eob> it's not so surprising that we have <eol> a hard time relating to others <eob> and just generally being <eol> a good and healthy person <eob> when we're sleep-deprived. <eob>
Scientists are now starting <eol> to understand <eob> how not only the quantity <eob> but also the quality of sleep impacts <eol> our health and well-being. <eob>
My research focuses <eob> on what many scientists believe <eol> is the most regenerative stage of sleep: <eob> deep sleep. <eob>
We now know that generally speaking, <eob> there are three stages of sleep: <eob> light sleep, <eob> rapid eye movement or REM <eob> and <eob> deep sleep. <eob>
We measure these stages by connecting electrodes <eol> to the scalp, chin and chest. <eob>
In <eob> light sleep <eob> and REM, <eob> our brain waves are very similar <eol> to our brain waves in waking life. <eob>
But our brain waves in <eob> deep sleep <eob> have these long-burst brain waves <eob> that are very different <eol> from our waking life brain waves. <eob>
These long-burst brain waves <eol> are called delta waves. <eob>
When we don't get the <eob> deep sleep <eob> we need, <eob> it inhibits our ability to learn <eob> and for our cells and bodies to recover. <eob>
Deep sleep is how we convert <eol> all those interactions <eob> that we make during the day <eob> into our long-term memory <eol> and personalities. <eob>
As we get older, <eob> we're more likely to lose <eol> these regenerative delta waves. <eob>
So in way, <eob> deep sleep <eob> and delta waves <eob> are actually a marker <eol> for biological youth. <eob>
So naturally, I wanted to get more <eob> deep sleep <eob> for myself <eob> and I literally tried almost <eol> every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there — <eob> consumer-grade, clinical-grade, <eob> what have you. <eob>
I learned a lot, and I found <eol> I really do need, like most people, <eob> eight hours of sleep. <eob>
I even shifted my circadian component <eob> by changing my meals, exercise <eol> and light exposure, <eob> but I still couldn't find a way <eol> to get a deeper night of sleep ... <eob> that is until I met Dr. <eol> Dmitry Gerashchenko <eob> from Harvard Medical School. <eob>
Dmitry told me about a new <eol> finding in the literature, <eob> where a lab out of Germany showed <eol> that if you could play certain sounds <eob> at the right time in people's sleep, <eob> you could actually make <eol> sleep deeper and more efficient. <eob>
And what's more, <eol> is that this lab showed <eob> that you actually could improve <eol> next-day memory performance <eob> with this sound. <eob>
Dmitry and I teamed up, <eob> and we began working on a way <eol> to build this technology. <eob>
With our research lab collaborators at Penn State, <eob> we designed experiments in order <eol> to validate our system. <eob>
And we've since received grant funding <eol> from the National Science Foundation <eob> and the National Institute of Health <eob> to develop this deep-sleep stimulating technology. <eob>
Here's how it works. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When we detected that people were in <eob> deep sleep, <eob> we played the deep-sleep stimulating sounds <eob> that were shown to make them <eol> have deeper sleep. <eob>
I'm going to demo this sound <eol> for you right now. <eob>
(Repeating sound waves) <eob>
Pretty weird, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So that sound is actually <eol> at the same burst frequency as your brain waves <eob> when your brain is in <eob> deep sleep. <eob>
That sound pattern actually <eol> primes your mind <eob> to have more of these regenerative <eol> delta waves. <eob>
When we asked participants <eol> the next day about the sounds, <eob> they were completely unaware <eol> that we played the sounds, <eob> yet their brains responded with more <eol> of these delta waves. <eob>
Here's an image of someone's brain <eol> waves from the study that we conducted. <eob>
See the bottom panel? <eob>
This shows the sound being played <eol> at that burst frequency. <eob>
Now look at the brain waves <eol> in the upper part of the graph. <eob>
You can see from the graph <eob> that the sound is actually producing <eol> more of these regenerative delta waves. <eob>
We learned that we could <eol> accurately track sleep <eob> without hooking people up <eol> to electrodes <eob> and make people sleep deeper. <eob>
We're continuing to develop <eob> the right sound environment <eol> and sleep habitat <eob> to improve people's sleep health. <eob>
Our sleep isn't as regenerative <eol> as it could be, <eob> but maybe one day soon, <eob> we could wear a small device <eob> and get more out of our sleep. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Most people think <eob> that new technology or advanced <eol> technology can never start in Africa. <eob>
Instead, they think <eol> that the best way to help the continent advance <eob> is by providing aid or services <eob> that the continent <eol> can't provide for itself. <eob>
So while we see advanced technology <eol> like robotics <eob> and artificial intelligence <eob> growing exponentially <eol> in the developed world, <eob> those same people are worried <eob> that a technologically backward Africa <eol> is falling behind. <eob>
That attitude couldn't be more wrong. <eob>
I'm a robotics entrepreneur <eol> who's spent a lot of time here in Africa. <eob>
And in 2014 we created Zipline, <eob> which is a company that uses <eol> electric autonomous aircraft <eob> to deliver medicine to hospitals <eol> and health centers on demand. <eob>
Last year, we launched the world's <eol> first automated delivery system <eob> operating at national scale. <eob> And guess what? <eob> We did not do that in the US, <eob> we didn't do it in Japan, <eob> and we didn't do it in Europe. <eob>
It was actually President Paul Kagame <eob> and the Rwandan Ministry of Health <eob> that made a big bet <eol> on the potential of this technology <eob> and signed a commercial contract <eob> to deliver a majority of the <eol> country's blood on demand. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yeah, they deserve the applause. <eob>
So why is blood important? <eob>
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units <eol> of blood a year. <eob>
So this is a product that when you need it, <eob> you really, really need it. <eob>
But blood is also challenging, <eob> because it has a very short shelf life, <eob> there are lots of different storage requirements, <eob> and it's really hard to predict the demand <eob> for all of these different blood groups <eob> before a patient actually needs something. <eob>
But the cool thing <eol> is that using this technology, <eob> Rwanda has been able to keep <eol> more blood centralized <eob> and then provide it when a patient needs something <eob> to any hospital or health center in an average <eol> of just 20 or 30 minutes. <eob>
Do you guys want to see how it works? <eob>
(Audience) Yes. <eob>
All right. Nobody believes me, so ... <eol> better to show. <eob>
This is our distribution center, <eob> which is about 20 kilometers <eol> outside of Kigali. <eob>
This actually used to be a cornfield <eol> nine months ago, <eob> and with the Rwandan government, <eob> we leveled it and built this center <eol> in a couple weeks. <eob>
So when a patient is having an emergency, <eob> a doctor or a nurse <eol> at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp, <eob> telling us what they need. <eob>
And then our team will immediately <eol> spring into action. <eob>
We pull the blood from our stock, <eob> which is delivered from the National Center <eol> for Blood Transfusion; <eob> we scan the blood into our system <eob> so the Ministry of Health <eol> knows where the blood is going; <eob> and then we'll basically pack it <eol> into a Zip, <eob> which is what we call these little autonomous airplanes <eob> that run on batteries. <eob>
And then once that Zip is ready to go, <eob> we accelerate it from zero <eol> to 100 kilometers an hour <eob> in about half of a second. <eob>
(Audience) Whoa! <eob>
And from the moment <eol> it leaves the end of the launcher, <eob> it's completely autonomous. <eob>
(Video: Air traffic controller <eol> directs traffic) <eob>
This is our air traffic controller <eol> calling it in <eob> to Kigali International Airport. <eob>
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital, <eob> it descends to about 30 feet <eol> and drops the package. <eob>
We use a really simple paper parachute -- <eol> simple things are best -- <eob> that allows the package to come <eol> to the ground gently and reliably <eob> in the same place every time. <eob>
So it's just like ride sharing; <eob> the doctors get a text message one minute <eol> before we arrive, saying, <eob> "Walk outside and receive <eol> your delivery." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
and then the doctors have what they need <eol> to save a patient's life. <eob>
This is actually watching a delivery <eol> happen from our distribution center; <eob> this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away. <eob>
We're able to watch the vehicle <eol> as it makes a delivery at a hospital <eob> in real time. <eob>
You may have noticed <eol> there are pings <eob> that are coming off <eol> of that vehicle on the screen. <eob>
Those pings are actually data packets <eob> that we're getting over <eol> the cell phone networks. <eob>
So these planes have SIM cards just like <eol> your cell phone does, <eob> and they're communicating <eol> over the cell network <eob> to tell us where they are <eol> and how they're doing at all times. <eob>
Believe it or not, we actually <eol> buy family plans -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
for this fleet of vehicles, <eob> because that's how we get the best rates. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's actually not a joke. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So today, we're delivering about 20 percent <eob> of the national blood supply <eol> of Rwanda <eob> outside of Kigali. <eob>
We serve about 12 hospitals, <eob> and we're adding hospitals <eol> to that network at an accelerating rate. <eob>
All of those hospitals only receive blood in this way, <eob> and most of those hospitals actually <eol> place multiple orders every day. <eob>
So the reason -- <eob> in all of health care logistics, <eob> you're always trading off waste <eol> against access. <eob>
So if you want to solve waste, <eol> you keep everything centralized. <eob>
As a result, when patients <eol> are having emergencies, <eob> sometimes they don't have <eol> the medical product they need. <eob>
If you want to solve access, <eol> you stock a lot of medicine at the last mile, <eob> at hospitals or health centers, <eob> and then patients have the medicine <eol> they need. <eob>
But you end up throwing <eol> a lot of medicine out, <eob> which is very expensive. <eob>
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan government <eol> has been able <eob> to break this cycle permanently. <eob>
Because doctors can get <eol> what they need instantly, <eob> they actually stock less blood <eol> at the hospitals. <eob>
So although use of blood products <eol> has increased substantially <eob> at all the hospitals we serve, <eob> in the last nine months, zero units <eol> of blood have expired <eob> at any of these hospitals. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
That's an amazing result. <eob>
That's actually not been achieved <eol> by any other health care system <eob> on the planet, <eob> and it happened here. <eob>
But obviously, when we're talking <eol> about delivering medical products instantly, <eob> the most important thing is patients. <eob>
Let me give you an example. <eob>
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother <eol> came into one of the hospitals <eob> that we serve, <eob> and she gave birth via C-section. <eob>
But that led to complications, <eol> and she started to bleed. <eob>
Luckily, the doctors had some blood <eol> of her blood type on hand <eob> that had been delivered via Zipline's routine service, <eob> and so they transfused her <eol> with a couple units of blood. <eob>
But she bled out of those units <eol> in about 10 minutes. <eob>
In this case, that mother's life <eol> is in grave danger -- <eob> in any hospital in the world. <eob>
But luckily, the doctors who were taking <eol> care of her <eob> immediately called our distribution center, <eob> they placed an emergency order, <eob> and our team actually did emergency <eol> delivery after emergency delivery <eob> after emergency delivery. <eob>
They ended up sending seven <eol> units of red blood cells, <eob> four units of plasma <eob> and two units of platelets. <eob>
That's more blood than you have <eol> in your entire body. <eob>
All of it was transfused into her, <eob> the doctors were able to stabilize her, <eob> and she is healthy today. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Since we launched, we've done <eol> about 400 emergency deliveries like that, <eob> and there's a story like that one <eol> behind most of those emergencies. <eob>
Here are just a couple of the moms <eob> who have received transfusions in this way <eob> in the last couple months. <eob>
We're always reminded: when we can help <eol> a doctor save a mom's life, <eob> it's not just her life <eol> that you're saving. <eob>
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl <eob> who has a mother while they're growing up. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But I want to be clear: <eob> postpartum hemorrhaging -- <eol> it's not a Rwanda problem, <eob> it's not a developing-world problem -- <eob> this is a global problem. <eob>
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere. <eob>
The main difference is that Rwanda <eol> was the first country <eob> to use radical technology to do <eol> something about it. <eob>
And that's the reason this attitude <eol> of Africa being disrupted <eob> or advanced technology not working here <eob> or needing aid <eob> is so totally wrong. <eob>
Africa can be the disrupter. <eob>
These small, agile, developing economies <eol> can out-innovate large, rich ones. <eob>
And they can totally leapfrog <eol> over the absence of legacy infrastructure <eob> to go straight to newer <eol> and better systems. <eob>
In 2000, <eob> if you had said that high-quality <eol> cellular networks were about to roll out <eob> across all of Africa, <eob> people would have told you <eol> that you were crazy. <eob>
And yet, no one anticipated <eob> how fast those networks were going <eol> to connect and empower people. <eob>
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya <eol> flows through M-Pesa, <eob> their mobile payment platform. <eob>
And not only that, <eob> but our autonomous fleet <eol> of vehicles relies on that cellular network. <eob>
Over the next few years as we start <eol> serving private health care facilities, <eob> we'll also use that mobile payment platform <eob> to collect fees for deliveries. <eob>
So innovation leads to more innovation <eol> leads to more innovation. <eob>
And meanwhile, <eob> most people <eol> who live in developed economies <eob> think that drone delivery is technologically impossible, <eob> let alone happening at national scale <eol> in East Africa. <eob>
And I do mean East Africa, <eol> not just Rwanda. <eob>
On Thursday, just a couple days ago, <eob> the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced <eob> that they are going to use this same technology <eob> to provide instant delivery <eol> of a wide range of medical products <eob> to 10 million of the hardest <eol> to reach people in the country. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's actually going to be the largest autonomous <eol> system anywhere in the world. <eob>
To give you a sense <eol> of what this looks like, <eob> this is one of the first distribution centers. <eob>
You can see a 75-kilometer service <eol> radius around the distribution center, <eob> and that allows us to serve <eol> hundreds of health facilities and hospitals, <eob> all of which are rural, <eob> from that single distribution center. <eob>
But to serve over 20 percent <eol> of the population of Tanzania, <eob> we're going to need multiple <eol> distribution centers. <eob>
We'll actually need four. <eob>
And from these distribution centers, <eob> we expect to be doing several hundred lifesaving <eol> deliveries every day, <eob> and this system will ultimately serve <eol> over 1,000 health facilities <eob> and hospitals in the country. <eob>
So yeah, East Africa is moving really fast. <eob>
One thing that people, I think, often miss <eob> is that these kinds of leaps <eol> generate compounding gains. <eob>
For example, Rwanda, by investing <eol> in this infrastructure for health care, <eob> now has an aerial logistics <eol> network that they can use <eob> to catalyze other parts of their economy, <eob> like agriculture or e-commerce. <eob>
Even more importantly, <eob> 100 percent of the teams we hire <eol> at these distribution centers are local. <eob>
So here's our Rwandan team, <eob> which is a group of extraordinary <eol> engineers and operators. <eob>
operating at national scale. <eob> They run the world's <eol> only automated delivery system <eob>
They have been able to master something <eob> that the largest technology companies <eol> in the world <eob> have not yet been able to figure out. <eob>
So they are total heroes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
They're total heroes. <eob>
Our team's mission is to deliver <eol> basic access to medicine <eob> to all seven billion people <eob> on the planet, <eob> no matter how hard it is to reach them. <eob>
We often tell people about that mission, <eob> and they say, "That's so generous of you, <eol> it's so philanthropic." <eob> No! <eob>
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it. <eob>
Because of the commercial contracts <eol> that we sign with ministries of health, <eob> these networks are 100 percent <eol> sustainable and scalable. <eob>
And the reason we feel so strongly <eol> about correcting that misperception <eob> is that entrepreneurship <eol> is the only force in human history <eob> that has lifted millions <eol> of people out of poverty. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
No amount of foreign aid <eol> is going to sustainably employ <eob> 250 million African youth. <eob>
And the jobs that these kids <eol> may have gotten 10 years ago <eob> are largely being automated <eob> or are being changed dramatically by technology. <eob>
So they are looking for new skill sets, <eob> new competitive advantages. <eob>
They're looking for start-ups. <eob>
So why aren't there more start-ups <eol> that are tackling these global problems <eob> that are faced by billions <eol> of people in developing economies? <eob>
The reason is that investors <eol> and entrepreneurs are totally blind <eob> to the opportunity. <eob>
We think these problems <eol> are the domain of NGOs or governments, <eob> not private companies. <eob>
That's what we have to change. <eob>
You may have noticed <eol> I left something out of the video <eob> that I showed you. <eob>
I didn't show you how the planes land <eob> when they get back <eol> to the distribution center. <eob>
So, it might be obvious to you: <eob> none of our planes have landing gear. <eob>
We also don't have runways <eol> where we operate. <eob>
So we have to be able <eol> to decelerate the plane <eob> from about 100 kilometers an hour <eol> to zero in half of a second. <eob>
And the way we do that <eob> is we actually use a wire <eol> that tracks that plane as it comes in, <eob> with centimeter-level accuracy. <eob>
We snag the plane <eol> out of the sky, <eob> and then we gently plop it <eol> onto an actively inflated cushion. <eob>
This is basically a combination <eol> of an aircraft carrier <eob> and a bouncy castle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So let me show you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And it might be obvious to you why <eol> I wanted to end with this video. <eob>
I wanted to show you the kids <eol> and the teenagers <eob> who line up on the fence every day. <eob>
They cheer every launch and every landing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Sometimes I actually show up <eol> at the distribution center early <eob> because I'm jet-lagged. <eob>
I'll show up an hour <eol> before we begin operation. <eob>
And there will be kids <eol> on the fence getting good seats. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you go up and you ask them, <eob> "What do you think <eol> about the planes?" <eob> And they'll say, "Oh, it's a sky ambulance." <eob> So they get it. <eob>
I mean, they get it more than most adults. <eob>
So I was asking earlier: <eob> Who is going to be creating <eol> the disruptive technology companies of Africa <eob> over the next decade? <eob>
Ultimately, it's going to be up <eol> to these kids. <eob>
They are the engineers <eol> of Rwanda and Africa. <eob>
They are the engineers <eol> of our shared future. <eob>
But the only way they can build <eol> that future is if we realize <eob> that world-changing companies <eol> can scale in Africa, <eob> and that disruptive technology <eol> can start here first. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I heard those bars <eob> slam hard, <eob> I knew it was for real. <eob> I feel confused. <eob> I feel betrayed. <eob> I feel overwhelmed. <eob> I feel silenced. <eob>
What just happened? <eob> How could they send me here? <eob>
I don't belong here. <eob>
How could they make such a huge mistake <eob> without any repercussions <eol> whatsoever to their actions? <eob>
I see large groups of women <eob> in tattered uniforms <eob> surrounded by huge walls and gates, <eob> enclosed by iron barbed wires, <eob> and I get hit by an awful stench, <eob> and I ask myself, <eob> how did I move <eob> from working in the respected <eol> financial banking sector, <eob> having worked so hard in school, <eob> to now being locked up <eob> in the largest correctional facility <eob> for women in Kenya? <eob>
My first night <eob> at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison <eob> was the toughest. <eob>
In January of 2009, <eob> I was informed that I had handled <eol> a fraudulent transaction unknowingly <eob> at the bank where I worked. <eob>
I was shocked, scared and terrified. <eob>
I would lose a career <eol> that I loved passionately. <eob>
But that was not the worst. <eob>
It got even worse <eol> than I could have ever imagined. <eob>
I got arrested, <eob> maliciously charged <eob> and prosecuted. <eob>
The absurdity of it all was the arresting officer <eob> asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars <eob> and the case would disappear. <eob> I refused. <eob> Two and a half years on, <eob> in and out of courts, <eob> fighting to prove my innocence. <eob>
It was all over the media, <eob> in the newspapers, TV, radio. <eob>
They came to me again. <eob>
This time around, said to me, <eob> "If you give us 50,000 US dollars, <eob> the judgement will be in your favor," <eob> irrespective of the fact <eol> that there was no evidence whatsoever <eob> that I had any wrongdoing <eob> on the charges that I was up against. <eob>
I remember the events <eob> of my conviction <eob> six years ago <eob> as if it were yesterday. <eob>
The cold, hard face of the judge <eob> as she pronounced my sentence <eob> on a cold Thursday morning <eob> for a crime that I hadn't committed. <eob>
I remember holding <eob> my three-month-old beautiful daughter <eob> whom I had just named Oma, <eob> which in my dialect means <eol> "truth and justice," <eob> as that was what I had longed so much for <eob> all this time. <eob>
I dressed her in her favorite purple dress, <eob> and here she was, <eol> about to accompany me <eob> to serve this one-year sentence <eob> behind bars. <eob>
The guards did not seem <eol> sensitive to the trauma <eob> that this experience was causing me. <eob>
My dignity and humanity disappeared <eob> with the admission process. <eob>
It involved me being searched <eol> for contrabands, <eob> changed from my ordinary clothes <eob> to the prison uniform, <eob> forced to squat on the ground, <eob> a posture that I soon came to learn <eob> would form the routine <eob> of the thousands of searches, <eob> number counts, <eob> that lay ahead of me. <eob>
The women told me, <eob> "You'll adjust to this place. <eob>
You'll fit right in." <eob> I was no longer referred <eol> to as Teresa Njoroge. <eob>
The number 415 / 11 <eol> was my new identity, <eob> and I soon learned that was the case <eol> with the other women <eob> who we were sharing this <eol> space with. <eob>
And adjust I did to life on the inside: <eob> the prison food, <eob> the prison language, <eob> the prison life. <eob>
Prison is certainly no fairytale world. <eob>
What I didn't see come my way <eob> was the women and children <eob> whom we served time and shared space with, <eob> women who had been imprisoned <eob> for crimes of the system, <eob> the corruption that requires a fall guy, <eob> a scapegoat, <eob> so that the person who is responsible <eob> could go free, <eob> a broken system that routinely vilifies the vulnerable, <eob> the poorest amongst us, <eob> people who cannot afford to pay bail <eob> or bribes. <eob>
And so we moved on. <eob>
As I listened to story after story <eob> of these close to 700 women <eob> during that one year in prison, <eob> I soon realized that crime <eob> was not what had brought <eol> these women to prison, <eob> most of them, <eob> far from it. <eob>
It had started with the education system, <eob> whose supply and quality <eol> is not equal for all; <eob> lack of economic opportunities <eob> that pushes these women <eol> to petty survival crimes; <eob> the health system, <eob> social justice system, <eob> the criminal justice system. <eob>
If any of these women, <eob> who were mostly from poor backgrounds, <eob> fall through the cracks <eob> in the already broken system, <eob> the bottom of that chasm is a prison, <eob> period. <eob>
By the time I completed my one-year sentence <eob> at Langata Women Maximum Prison, <eob> I had a burning conviction <eob> to be part of the transformation <eob> to resolve the injustices <eob> that I had witnessed <eob> of women and girls <eob> who were caught up in a revolving door <eob> of a life in and out of prison <eob> due to poverty. <eob>
After my release, <eob> I set up Clean Start. <eob>
Clean Start is a social enterprise <eob> that seeks to give these women and girls <eob> a second chance. <eob>
What we do is we build bridges for them. <eob>
We go into the prisons, train them, <eob> give them skills, tools and support <eob> to enable them to be able <eol> to change their mindsets, <eob> their behaviors and their attitudes. <eob>
We also build bridges into the prisons <eob> from the corporate sector -- <eob> individuals, organizations <eob> that will partner with Clean Start <eob> to enable us to provide employment, <eob> places to call home, <eob> jobs, vocational training, <eob> for these women, girls, <eob> boys and men, <eob> upon transition back into society. <eob>
I never thought <eob> that one day <eob> I would be giving stories <eob> of the injustices that are so common <eob> within <eob> the criminal justice system, <eob> but here I am. <eob>
Every time I go back to prison, <eob> I feel a little at home, <eob> but it is the daunting work <eob> to achieve the vision <eob> that keeps me awake at night, <eob> connecting the miles to Louisiana, <eob> which is deemed as the incarceration capital of the world, <eob> carrying with me stories <eob> of hundreds of women <eob> whom I have met within the prisons, <eob> some of whom are now embracing their second chances, <eob> and others who are still <eol> on that bridge of life's journey. <eob>
I embody a line <eob> from the great Maya Angelou. <eob> "I come as one, <eob> but I stand as 10,000." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
For my story is singular, <eob> but imagine with me <eob> the millions of people <eob> in prisons today, <eob> yearning for freedom. <eob>
Three years post my conviction <eob> and two years post my release, <eob> I got cleared by the courts of appeal <eob> of any wrongdoing. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Around the same time, <eob> I got blessed with my son, <eob> whom I named Uhuru, <eob> which in my dialect means "freedom." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Because I had finally gotten the freedom <eob> that I so longed for. <eob>
I come as one, <eob> but I stand as 10,000, <eob> encouraged by the hard-edged hope <eob> that thousands of us have come together <eob> to reform and transform <eob> the criminal justice system, <eob> encouraged that we are doing our jobs <eob> as we are meant to do them. <eob>
And let us keep doing them <eob> with no apology. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How do we get people engaged <eol> in solving global warming? <eob>
I'd like to start with running two short <eol> experiments with you all. <eob>
So your task is to notice if you feel <eol> any difference as I speak. <eob> OK? <eob> Here we go. <eob>
We are seeing rising <eol> carbon dioxide levels, <eob> now about 410 ppms. <eob>
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario, <eob> we need rapid decarbonization. <eob>
The global carbon budget <eob> for 66 percent likelihood <eol> to meet the two-degree target <eob> is approximately 800 gigatons. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, <eob> now let me try something else. <eob>
We are heading for an uninhabitable earth: <eob> monster storms, <eob> killer floods, <eob> devastating wildfires, <eob> crazy heat waves that will cook us <eol> under a blazing sun. <eob>
2017 is already so unexpectedly warm, <eob> it's freaking out climate scientists. <eob>
We have a three-year window <eol> to cut emissions, three years. <eob>
If not, we will soon live in <eol> a boiling earth, a hellhole. <eob> OK. So -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now your task: <eob> How did these ways of speaking <eol> make you feel? <eob>
The first, detached maybe <eol> or just confused? <eob> What's this guy talking about? <eob>
The other, fearful or just numb? <eob>
How do we get people engaged <eol> in solving global warming? <eob> So again, the question I asked: <eob>
And why don't these two ways <eol> of communicating work? <eob>
You see, the biggest obstacle to dealing <eol> with climate disruptions <eob> lies between your ears. <eob>
Building on a rapidly growing body <eol> of psychology and social science, <eob> I spent years looking into the five inner defenses <eob> that stop people from engaging. <eob>
When people hear news about <eol> the climate coming straight at them, <eob> the first defense comes up rapidly: <eob> distance. <eob>
When we hear about the climate, <eob> we hear about something <eol> far away in space -- <eob> think Arctic ice, <eol> polar bears -- <eob> far away in time -- think 2100. <eob>
It's huge and slow-moving -- <eol> think gigatons and centuries. <eob>
So it's not here. It's not now. <eob>
Since it feels so far away from me, <eob> it seems outside my circle of influence, <eob> so I feel helpless about it. <eob>
There's nothing I can do. <eob>
In our everyday lives, <eob> most of us prefer to think <eol> about nearer things, <eob> such as our jobs, our kids, <eob> how many likes we get on Facebook. <eob>
Now, that, that's real. <eob>
Next defense is doom. <eob> Climate change is usually framed <eob> as a looming disaster, <eob> bringing losses, cost and sacrifice. <eob>
That makes us fearful. <eob>
But after the first fear is gone, <eob> my brain soon wants to avoid <eol> this topic altogether. <eob>
After 30 years of scary <eol> climate change communications, <eob> more than 80 percent of media <eol> articles still use disaster framings, <eob> but people habituate to and then -- <eob> desensitize <eob> to doom overuse. <eob>
So many of us are now suffering <eol> a kind of apocalypse fatigue, <eob> getting numb <eol> from too much collapse porn. <eob>
The third defense is dissonance. <eob>
Now, if what we know, <eob> that fossil fuel use contributes <eol> to global warming, <eob> conflicts with what we do -- drive, fly, eat beef -- <eob> then so-called cognitive dissonance sets in. <eob>
This is felt as an inner discomfort. <eob>
We may feel like hypocrites. <eob>
To get rid of this discomfort, <eob> our brain starts coming up <eol> with justifications. <eob>
So I can say, for instance, <eob> "My neighbor, he has a much bigger car than I do." <eob> Or, "Changing my diet <eol> doesn't amount to anything <eob> if I am the only one to do it." <eob> Or, I could even want <eol> to doubt climate science itself. <eob> I could say, "You know, climate is always changing." <eob>
So these justifications <eol> make us all feel better, <eob> but at the expense <eob> of dismissing what we know. <eob>
Thus, behavior drives attitudes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> My personal cognitive dissonance comes up <eob> when I recognize that I've been flying <eol> from Oslo to New York <eob> and back to Oslo <eob> in order to speak <eol> about the climate. <eob>
For 14 minutes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So that makes me want <eol> to move on to denial. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So if we keep silent, <eob> ignore or ridicule facts about climate disruptions, <eob> then we might find inner refuge <eob> from fear and guilt. <eob>
Denial doesn't really come <eol> from lack of intelligence or knowledge. <eob>
No, denial is a state of mind <eob> in which I may be aware <eol> of some troubling knowledge, <eob> but I live and act as if I don't know. <eob>
So you could call it a kind of double life, <eob> both knowing and not knowing, <eob> and often this is reinforced by others, <eob> my family or community, <eob> agreeing not to raise this tricky topic. <eob>
Finally, identity. <eob> Alarmed climate activists <eob> demand that government takes action, <eob> either with regulation or carbon taxes. <eob>
But consider what happens <eob> when people who hold <eol> conservative values, for instance, <eob> hear from an activist <eol> that government ought to expand even further. <eob>
Particularly in rich Western democracies, <eob> they are then less likely to believe <eol> that science. <eob> How is that? <eob> Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance, <eob> I probably prefer big proper cars <eol> and small government <eob> over tiny, tiny cars <eol> and huge government. <eob>
And if climate science comes and then says <eob> government should expand further, <eob> then I probably will trust that science less. <eob>
In this way, cultural identity <eob> starts to override the facts. <eob>
The values eat the facts, <eob> and my identity trumps truth any day. <eob>
So, after recognizing how these five <eol> D's kill engagement, <eob> how can we move beyond them? <eob>
New research shows <eol> how we can flip these five defenses <eob> over into key success criteria <eob> for a more brain-friendly climate communication. <eob>
So this is where it gets really exciting <eob> and where we find the five S's, <eob> the five evidence-based solutions <eol> for what does work. <eob>
First, we can flip distance to social. <eob>
We can make climate feel <eol> near, personal and urgent <eob> by bringing it home, <eob> and we can do that <eol> by spreading social norms <eob> that are positive to solutions. <eob>
If I believe my friends or neighbors, <eob> you guys, will do something, <eob> then I will, too. <eob>
We can see, for instance, <eol> this from rooftop solar panels. <eob>
They are spreading from neighbor <eol> to neighbor like a virus. <eob> It's contagious. <eob> This is the power of peer-to-peer <eol> creating the new normal. <eob>
Next, we can flip doom to supportive. <eob>
Rather than backfiring frames <eob> such as disaster and cost, <eob> we can reframe climate as being really about human health, <eob> for instance, with plant-based delicious burgers, <eob> good for you and good for the climate. <eob>
We can also reframe climate <eol> as being about new tech opportunities, <eob> about safety and about new jobs. <eob>
Solar jobs, for instance, are seeing <eol> an amazing growth. <eob>
They just passed the three million <eol> jobs mark. <eob>
Psychology says, in order <eol> to create engagement, <eob> we should present, on balance, <eob> three positive or supportive framings <eob> for each climate threat we mention. <eob>
Then we can flip dissonance <eob> to simpler actions. <eob>
This is often called nudging. <eob>
The idea is, by better choice architecture, <eob> we can make the climate-friendly behaviors <eob> default and convenient. <eob>
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste. <eob> Food waste at buffets goes way down <eob> if the plate or the box <eol> size is reduced a little, <eob> because on the smaller plate it looks full <eob> but in the big box <eol> it looks half empty, <eob> so we put more in. <eob>
So smaller plates make a big difference <eol> for food waste. <eob> And there are hundreds <eol> of smart nudges like this. <eob>
The point is, dissonance goes down <eol> as more behaviors are nudged. <eob>
Then we can flip denial <eob> by tailoring signals <eol> that visualize our progress. <eob>
We can provide motivating feedback <eob> on how well we're doing <eol> with our problem-solving. <eob>
Say you improved your transport footprint <eob> or cut energy waste in your buildings. <eob>
Then one app that can share <eol> this well is called Ducky. <eob>
The idea is, <eol> you log your actions there, <eob> and then you can see how well <eol> your team or company is doing, <eob> so you get real-time signals. <eob>
Finally, identity. <eob> We can flip identity with better stories. <eob>
Our brain loves stories. <eob>
So we need better stories <eol> of where we all want to go, <eob> and we need more stories <eol> of the heroes and heroines <eob> of all stripes <eol> that are making real change happen. <eob>
I'm proud that my hometown <eol> of Oslo <eob> is now embarking on a bold journey of electrifying <eol> all transport, <eob> whether cars, bikes or buses. <eob>
One of the people spearheading <eol> this is Christina Bu. <eob>
She is heading the Electric Vehicle Association for years <eob> and she has been fighting every day. <eob>
Now, the UK and France, <eol> India and China have also announced plans <eob> for ending the sales of fossil cars. <eob> Now, that's massive. <eob> And in Oslo, <eol> we can see how enthusiastic EV owners <eob> go and tell their electric stories <eol> to friends and neighbors <eob> and bring them along. <eob>
So we come full circle <eol> from story back to social. <eob>
So thousands of climate communicators <eob> are now starting to use these solutions <eob> all over the world. <eob>
It is clear, however, <eol> that individual solutions <eob> are not sufficient <eol> to solving climate alone, <eob> but they do build stronger <eol> bottom-up support <eob> for policies and solutions that can. <eob>
That is why engaging people is so crucial. <eob>
I started this talk <eob> with testing two ways <eol> of communicating climate with you. <eob>
There is another way, too, <eob> I'd like to share with you. <eob>
It starts with reimagining climate itself <eob> as the living air. <eob> Climate isn't really about some abstract, <eol> distant climate <eob> far, far away from us. <eob>
It's about this air that surrounds us. <eob>
This air, you can feel <eol> in this room, too, <eob> the air that moves right now <eol> in your nostrils. <eob>
This air is our earth's skin. <eob>
It's amazingly thin, <eob> compared to the size of the earth <eol> and the cosmos it shields us from, <eob> far thinner <eol> than the skin of an apple <eob> compared to its diameter. <eob>
It may look infinite when we look up, <eob> but the beautiful, breathable air <eol> is only like five to seven miles thin, <eob> a fragile wrapping around a massive ball. <eob>
Inside this skin, <eob> we're all closely connected. <eob>
The breath that you just took <eob> contained around 400,000 <eol> of the same argon atoms <eob> that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime. <eob>
Inside this thin, fluctuating, <eol> unsettled film, <eob> all of life is nourished, protected and held. <eob>
It insulates and regulates temperatures <eob> in a range that is just right <eol> for water and for life as we know it, <eob> and mediating between the blue ocean <eol> and black eternity, <eob> the clouds carry all the billions <eol> of tons of water <eob> needed for the soils. <eob>
The air fills the rivers, <eob> stirs the waters, <eob> waters the forests. <eob>
With a global weirding of the weather, <eob> there are good reasons <eol> for feeling fear and despair, <eob> yet we may first grieve today's sorry state and losses <eob> and then turn to face the future <eol> with sober eyes and determination. <eob>
The new psychology of climate action <eob> lies in letting go, <eol> not of science, <eob> but of the crutches of abstractions <eol> and doomism, <eob> and then choosing to tell the new stories. <eob>
These are the stories <eob> of how we achieve drawdown, <eol> the reversing of global warming. <eob>
These are the stories <eob> of the steps we take <eob> as peoples, cities, companies <eob> and public bodies <eob> in caring for the air <eob> in spite of strong headwinds. <eob>
These are the stories <eob> of the steps we take <eob> because they ground us <eol> in what we are as humans: <eob> earthlings inside this living air. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful. <eob>
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room <eob> and beauty and strength <eol> like I'm looking at. <eob> That's gorgeous. It is. <eob> It is a beautiful room. <eob>
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age, <eol> because you gave me permission, <eob> but I realized that I was about <eol> to make you a year older. <eob>
You're only 94. <eob>
LC: Yeah, I'm only 94. <eob>
I mean, you get this old and parts <eol> start wearing out. <eob>
Your legs start wearing out. <eob>
The one thing that my children always say: <eob> "But nothing happened to your mouth." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you've got to have something going, <eol> so I've got my mouth going. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
PM: So Mrs. Chase, the first time we were there, <eob> I brought a group of young women, <eol> who work with us at TED, <eob> into the kitchen, <eob> and we were all standing around <eol> and you had already cooked lunch <eob> for hundreds of people, as you do every day, <eob> and you looked up at them. <eob>
You have to share with this audience <eol> what you said to those young women. <eob>
LC: Well, you know, I talk <eol> to young women all the time, <eob> and it's beginning to bother me, <eob> because look how far I came. <eob>
I'd come with women that had <eol> to really hustle and work hard, <eob> and they knew how to be women. <eob>
They didn't play that man down. <eob>
And, well, we didn't have <eol> the education you have today, <eob> and God, I'm so proud <eob> when I see those women with <eol> all that education under their belt. <eob>
That's why I worked hard, <eob> tried to get everybody <eol> to use those resources. <eob>
So they just don't know their power, <eob> and I always tell them, <eol> just look at my mother, <eob> had 12 girls before she had a boy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you know how I came out. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, she had 14 children. <eob>
She raised 11 of us out of that 14, <eob> and up until last year, <eol> we were all still living, <eob> a bunch of old biddies, <eol> but we're still here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And sometimes we can be <eol> just cantankerous and blah blah blah blah blah, <eob> but we still go. <eob>
And I love to see women. <eob>
You don't know what it does for me <eob> to see women in the position <eol> that you're in today. <eob>
I never thought I'd see that. <eob>
I never thought I'd see women <eob> be able to take places and positions <eol> that we have today. <eob>
It is just a powerful thing. <eob>
I had a young woman come to me. <eob>
She was an African-American woman. <eob>
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?" <eob> She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot." <eob> Oh God, that just melted me, <eob> because I knew how hard it <eol> was to integrate that Navy. <eob>
You know, the Navy was the last <eol> thing to really be integrated, <eob> and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt <eob> as a favor to an African-American man, <eob> Lester Granger, that I knew very well. <eob>
He was the head of the National Urban <eol> League back there, <eob> and when Roosevelt asked him, <eob> he wanted to appoint Lester as maybe one <eol> of his cabinet members. <eob> Lester said, "No, I don't want that. <eob>
All I want you to do <eol> is integrate that Navy." <eob> And that was what Franklin did. <eob>
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it, <eob> but Truman did it. <eob>
But when this woman told me, <eob> "I have flown everything there is to fly," <eob> bombers, just all kinds of planes, <eob> it just melted me, you know, <eob> just to see how far women have come. <eob>
And I told her, I said, <eob> "Well, you could get into <eol> the space program." <eob> She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old." <eob> She was already 60-some years old, <eob> and, you know, you're over the hill then. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They don't want you flying up in the sky <eol> at 60-something years old. <eob> Stay on the ground. <eob> When I meet women, <eob> and today everybody comes <eol> to my kitchen, <eob> and you know that, <eob> and it upsets Stella, my daughter. <eob>
She doesn't like people <eol> coming in the kitchen. <eob>
But that's where I am, <eob> and that's where you're going to see <eol> me, in the kitchen. <eob>
So when they come there, <eol> I meet all kinds of people. <eob>
And that is the thing <eol> that really uplifts me, <eob> is when I meet women on the move. <eob>
When I meet women <eob> on the move, it is good for me. <eob>
Now, I'm not one of these flag-waving women. <eob>
You're not going to see me <eol> out there waving. <eob>
No, I don't do that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, I don't do that, <eob> and I don't want any of you to do that. <eob>
Just be good women. <eob>
And you know, my mother taught us ... <eob> she was tough on us, <eob> and she said, "You know, Leah," <eob> she gave us all this plaque, <eob> "to be a good woman, <eol> you have to first look like a girl." <eob> Well, I thought I looked like a girl. <eob> "Act like a lady." <eob> That, I never learned to do. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Think like a man." <eob> Now don't act like that man; <eol> think like a man. <eob>
And "work like a dog." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we learned that the hard way. <eob>
And they taught you that. <eob>
They taught you what women had to do. <eob>
We were taught that women <eol> controlled the behavior of men. <eob>
How you act, they will act. <eob>
So you've got to do that, <eol> and I tell you all the time. <eob>
You know, don't play this man down. <eob>
It upsets me when you may have a husband <eob> that maybe he doesn't have as much education <eol> under his belt as you have, <eob> but still you can't play him down. <eob>
You've got to keep lifting him up, <eob> because you don't want <eol> to live with a mouse. <eob>
So you want that man to be a man, <eol> and do what he has to do. <eob>
And anyway, always remember, <eob> he runs on cheap gas. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So fill him up with cheap gas -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and then, you got him. <eob> It's just so — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> It's just -- <eob>
PM: You have to give us a minute <eol> to take that in. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
LC: When I heard this young lady <eol> speak before I came out -- <eob> she was so beautiful, <eob> and I wished I could be like that, <eob> and my husband, poor darling -- <eob> I lost him after we were married 70 years -- <eob> didn't agree on one thing, <eob> never did, nothing, <eob> but we got along together <eob> because he learned to understand me, <eob> and that was just hard, <eob> because he was so different. <eob>
And that lady reminded me. <eob>
I said, "If I would have <eol> just been like her, <eob> Dooky would have really loved it." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I wasn't. <eob> I was always pushy, always moving, <eob> always doing this, <eob> and he used to come to me <eol> all the time, and he said, <eob> "Honey, God's going to punish you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"You -- you're just not grateful." <eob> But it isn't that I'm not grateful, <eob> but I think, as long as you're living, <eol> you've got to keep moving, <eob> you've got to keep trying to get up <eob> and do what you've got to do. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You cannot sit down. <eob> You have to keep going, <eob> keep trying to do a little bit every day. <eob>
Every day, you do a little bit, <eob> try to make it better. <eob>
And that's been my whole life. <eob>
Well, I came up in the country, small town, <eob> had to do everything, <eol> had to haul the water, <eob> had to wash the clothes, <eol> do this, do that, <eob> pick the dumb strawberries, <eol> all that kind of stuff. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But still, my daddy insisted <eol> that we act nice, <eob> we be kind. <eob>
And that's all. <eob>
When I heard this young woman -- <eob> oh, she sounds so beautiful -- <eob> I said, "I wish I could be like that." <eob>
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you to be <eol> any different than you are. <eob>
There is no question about that. <eob>
Let me ask you. <eob>
This is why it's so wonderful <eol> to have a conversation <eob> with someone who has such a long view -- <eob>
LC: A long time. <eob>
PM: to remembering Roosevelt <eob> and the person he did that favor for. <eob>
What is in your head and your mind <eob> and what you have seen <eol> and witnessed ... <eob> One of the things <eol> that it's good to remember, always, <eob> is that when you opened that restaurant, <eob> whites and blacks <eol> could not eat together in this city. <eob>
It was against the law. <eob>
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase. <eol> Tell me about that. <eob>
LC: They did, there. <eob>
Well, my mother-in-law first started this, <eob> and the reason she started is, <eob> because her husband was sickly, <eol> and he would go out -- <eob> and people from Chicago and all the places, <eob> you would call his job a numbers runner. <eob>
But in New Orleans, <eol> we are very sophisticated -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
so it wasn't a numbers runner, <eob> it was a lottery vendor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So you see, we put class to that. <eob>
But that's how he did it. <eob>
And he couldn't go from house to house <eol> to get his clients and all that, <eob> because he was sick, <eob> so she opened up this little sandwich shop, <eob> so she was going to take down the numbers, <eob> because he was sick a lot. <eob> He had ulcers. He was really bad <eol> for a long a time. <eob>
So she did that -- <eob> and not knowing anything, <eob> but she knew she could make a sandwich. <eob>
She knew she could cook, <eob> and she borrowed 600 dollars <eol> from a brewery. <eob>
Can you imagine starting a business <eol> today with 600 dollars <eob> and no knowledge of what you're doing? <eob>
And it always just amazed me <eol> what she could do. <eob>
She was a good money manager. <eob> That, I am not. <eob> My husband used to call me <eol> a bankrupt sister. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"She'll spend everything you got." <eob> And I would, you know. <eob>
PM: But you kept the restaurant open, though, <eob> even in those times of controversy, when people were protesting <eob> and almost boycotting. <eob>
I mean, it was a controversial move <eol> that you and your husband made. <eob>
LC: It was, and I don't know <eol> how we did it, <eob> but as I said, my mother-in-law <eol> was a kind, kind person, <eob> and you didn't have any African-Americans <eol> on the police force at that time. <eob>
They were all white. <eob>
But they would come around, <eob> and she would say, <eob> "Bebe, I'm gonna fix you a little sandwich." <eob> So she would fix them a sandwich. <eob>
Today they would call that bribery. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But she was just that kind of person. <eob>
She liked to do things for you. <eob> She liked to give. <eob>
So she would do that, <eob> and maybe that helped us out, <eob> because nobody ever bothered us. <eob>
We had Jim Dombrowski, <eol> Albert Ben Smith, <eob> who started all kinds of things <eol> right in that restaurant, <eob> and nobody ever bothered us. <eob>
So we just did it. <eob>
PM: Excuse me. <eob> You talked to me that day <eob> about the fact that people <eol> considered the restaurant a safe haven <eob> where they could come together, <eob> particularly if they were working <eol> on civil rights, <eob> human rights, <eob> working to change the laws. <eob>
LC: Well, because once <eol> you got inside those doors, <eob> nobody ever, ever bothered you. <eob>
The police would never come in <eob> and bother our customers, never. <eob>
So they felt safe to come there. <eob>
They could eat, they could plan. <eob>
All the Freedom Riders, <eob> that's where they planned <eol> all their meetings. <eob>
They would come and we would serve <eol> them a bowl of gumbo <eob> and fried chicken. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I said, we'd changed <eol> the course of America <eob> over a bowl of gumbo <eol> and some fried chicken. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I would like <eol> to invite the leaders, now, <eob> just come have a bowl <eol> of gumbo and some fried chicken, <eob> talk it over and we'd go and we'd do <eol> what we have to do. <eob>
And that's all <eob> we did. <eob>
PM: Could we send you a list <eol> to invite to lunch? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
LC: Yeah, invite. <eob>
Because that's what we're not doing. <eob>
We're not talking. <eob> Come together. <eob> I don't care if you're a Republican <eol> or what you are -- come together. <eob> Talk. <eob> And I know those old guys. <eob>
I was friends with those old guys, <eob> like Tip O'Neill and all of those people. <eob>
They knew how to come together and talk, <eob> and you would disagree maybe. <eob> That's OK. <eob> But you would talk, and we would <eol> come to a good thing and meet. <eob>
And so that's what we did <eol> in that restaurant. <eob>
They would plan the meeting, <eob> Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother. <eob>
She was big in CORE. <eob>
Her mother worked for me for 42 years. <eob>
And she was like me. <eob>
We didn't understand the program. <eob>
Nobody our age understood this program, <eob> and we sure didn't want <eol> our children to go to jail. <eob>
Oh, that was ... oh God. <eob>
But these young people <eol> were willing to go to jail <eob> for what they believed. <eob>
We were working with Thurgood and A.P. <eol> Tureaud and all those people <eob> with the NAACP. <eob>
But that was a slow move. <eob>
We would still be out here trying <eol> to get in the door, waiting for them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall <eol> you're talking about? <eob>
LC: Thurgood Marshall. <eol> But I loved Thurgood. <eob> He was a good movement. <eob>
They wanted to do this <eol> without offending anybody. <eob>
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud: <eob> "But you can't offend the white people. <eob>
Don't offend them." <eob> But these young people didn't care. <eob>
They said, "We're going. <eob>
Ready or not, we're going to do this. <eob> "And so we had to support them. <eob>
These were the children we knew, <eol> righteous children. <eob>
We had to help them. <eob>
PM: And they brought the change. <eob>
LC: And they brought the change. <eob>
You know, it was hard, <eob> but sometimes you do hard things <eol> to make changes. <eob>
PM: And you've seen so many <eol> of those changes. <eob>
The restaurant has been a bridge. <eob>
You have been a bridge <eol> between the past and now, <eob> but you don't live in the past, do you? <eob>
You live very much in the present. <eob>
LC: And that's what you have to tell <eol> young people today. <eob>
OK, you can protest, <eob> but put the past behind you. <eob>
I can't make you responsible <eol> for what your grandfather did. <eob>
That's your grandfather. <eob>
I have to build on that. <eob>
I have to make changes. <eob>
I can't stay there and say, <eob> "Oh, well, look what they did to us then. <eob> Look what they do to us now." <eob> No, you remember that, <eob> but that makes you keep going on, <eob> but you don't harp on it every day. <eob>
You move, <eob> and you move to make a difference, <eob> and everybody should be involved. <eob>
My children said, <eob> "Mother, don't get political," you know. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Don't get political, because you know <eol> we don't like that." <eob> But you have to be political today. <eob>
You have to be involved. <eob>
Be a part of the system. <eob>
Look how it was when we couldn't be <eol> a part of the system. <eob>
When Dutch Morial became the mayor, <eob> it was a different feeling <eol> in the African-American community. <eob>
We felt a part of things. <eob>
Now we've got a mayor. <eob>
We feel like we belong. <eob>
Moon tried before Dutch came. <eob>
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father, <eol> Moon Landrieu. <eob>
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father, <eol> he took great, great risks <eob> by putting African-Americans in city hall. <eob>
He took a whipping <eol> for that for a long time, <eob> but he was a visionary, <eob> and he did those things <eol> that he knew was going to help the city. <eob>
He knew we had to get involved. <eob>
So that's what we have to do. <eob>
We don't harp on that. <eob>
We just keep moving, <eob> and Mitch, you know, <eol> I tell Moon all the time, <eob> "You did a good thing," <eob> but Mitch did one bigger <eol> than you and better than you. <eob>
When he pulled those statues down, <eob> I said, "Boy, you're crazy!" <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You're crazy. <eob> But it was a good political move. <eob>
You know, when I saw P.T. Beauregard come down, <eob> I was sitting looking at the news, <eob> and it just hit me what this was all about. <eob>
To me, it wasn't about race; <eol> it was a political move. <eob>
And I got so furious, <eob> I got back on that kitchen <eol> the next morning, <eob> and I said, come on, pick up your pants, <eol> and let's go to work, <eob> because you're going to get left behind. <eob>
And that's what you have to do. <eob>
You have to move on people, <eob> move on what they do. <eob>
It was going to bring visibility <eol> to the city. <eob>
So you got that visibility -- <eol> move on it, uplift yourself, <eob> do what you have to do, <eob> and do it well. <eob>
And that's all <eob> we do. <eob>
That's all I try to do. <eob>
PM: But you just gave the formula <eol> for resilience. Right? <eob> So you are clearly the best example <eol> we could find anywhere of resilience, <eob> so there must be something you think -- <eob>
LC: I like emotional strength. <eob>
I like people with emotional <eol> and physical strength, <eob> and maybe that's bad for me. <eob>
My favorite all-time general <eol> was George Patton. <eob>
You know, that wasn't too cool. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
PM: It's surprising. <eob>
LC: I've got George Patton <eol> hanging in my dining room <eob> because I want to remember. <eob>
He set goals for himself, <eob> and he was going to set out <eol> to reach those goals. <eob> He never stopped. <eob> And I always remember his words: <eob> "Lead, follow, or get out of the way." <eob> Now, I can't lead -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I can't be a leader, <eob> but I can follow a good leader, <eob> but I am not getting out of the way. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
If you can't lead -- <eob> leaders need followers, <eob> so if I help you up there, <eol> I'm going to ride on your coattails, <eob> and I can't count the coattails <eol> I've ridden upon. <eob>
Feed you good. You'll help me out. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that's what life is all about. <eob>
Everybody can do something, <eob> but please get involved. <eob> Do something. <eob> The thing we have to do <eol> in this city, in all cities — <eob> mommas have to start being mommas today. <eob> You know? <eob> They have to start understanding — <eob> when you bring this child in the world, <eob> you have to make a man out of it, <eob> you have to make a woman out of it, <eob> and it takes some doing. <eob> It takes sacrifice. <eob> Maybe you won't have the long fingernails, <eol> maybe you won't have the pretty hair. <eob>
But that child will be on the move, <eob> and that's what you have to do. <eob>
We have to concentrate <eol> on educating <eob> and making these children understand <eol> what it's all about. <eob>
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen, <eob> it's going to take <eol> a good woman to do that. <eob>
It's going to take <eol> a good woman to do that. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Men can do their part. <eob>
The other part is to just <eob> do what you have to do <eob> and bring it home, <eob> but we can handle the rest, <eob> and we will handle the rest. <eob>
If you're a good woman, you can do that. <eob>
PM: You heard that first here. <eob>
We can handle the rest. <eob> LC: We can handle the rest. <eob>
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much -- <eob>
LC: Thank you. <eob>
PM: for taking time out from the work <eol> you do every day in this community. <eob>
LC: But you don't know <eol> what this does for me. <eob>
When I see all of these people, <eol> and come together -- <eob> people come to my kitchen <eol> from all over the world. <eob>
I had people come from London, <eob> now twice this happened to me. <eob>
First a man came, and I don't know <eol> why he came to this -- <eob> Every year, the chefs do something <eol> called "Chef's Charity." <eob> Well, it so happened <eol> I was the only woman there, <eob> and the only African-American there <eob> on that stage doing these demonstrations, <eob> and I would not leave until I saw another woman <eol> come up there, too. <eob>
I'm not going up -- they're going <eol> to carry me up there <eob> until you bring another woman up here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So they have another one now, <eol> so I could step down. <eob>
But this man was from London. <eob>
So after that, I found <eol> the man in my kitchen. <eob>
He came to my kitchen, <eob> and he said, "I want to ask you one question." <eob> OK, I thought I was going <eol> to ask something about food. <eob> "Why do all these white men <eol> hang around you?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What? <eob>
I couldn't understand. <eob> He couldn't understand that. <eob>
I said, "We work together. <eob>
This is the way we live in this city. <eob>
I may never go to your house, <eol> you may never come to my house. <eob>
But when it comes to working, <eob> like raising money <eol> for this special school, <eob> we come together. <eob>
That's what we do. <eob> And still here comes another, a woman, <eob> elegantly dressed, <eob> about a month ago in my kitchen. <eob>
She said, "I don't understand <eol> what I see in your dining room." <eob> I said, "What do you see?" <eob> She saw whites <eol> and blacks together. <eob>
That's what we do. <eob> We meet. We talk. <eob> And we work together, <eob> and that's what we have to do. <eob>
You don't have to be my best friend <eol> to work to better your city, <eob> to better your country. <eob>
We just have to come together and work, <eol> and that's what we do in this city. <eob>
We're a weird bunch down here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nobody understands us, <eob> but we feed you well. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Cheering) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
As societies, we have <eol> to make collective decisions <eob> that will shape our future. <eob>
And we all know that when we make <eol> decisions in groups, <eob> they don't always go right. <eob>
And sometimes they go very wrong. <eob>
So how do groups make good decisions? <eob>
Research has shown that crowds are wise <eol> when there's independent thinking. <eob>
This why the wisdom of the crowds <eol> can be destroyed by peer pressure, <eob> publicity, social media, <eob> or sometimes even simple conversations <eol> that influence how people think. <eob>
On the other hand, by talking, <eol> a group could exchange knowledge, <eob> correct and revise each other <eob> and even come up with new ideas. <eob>
And this is all good. <eob>
So does talking to each other help <eol> or hinder collective decision-making? <eob>
With my colleague, Dan Ariely, <eob> we recently began <eol> inquiring into this by performing experiments <eob> in many places around the world <eob> to figure out how groups <eol> can interact to reach better decisions. <eob>
We thought crowds would be wiser if they debated in small groups <eob> that foster a more thoughtful <eol> and reasonable exchange of information. <eob>
To test this idea, <eob> we recently performed an experiment <eol> in Buenos Aires, Argentina, <eob> with more than 10,000 participants <eol> in a TEDx event. <eob>
We asked them questions like, <eob> "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" <eob> and "How many times does the word <eol> 'Yesterday' appear <eob> in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" <eob> Each person wrote down their own estimate. <eob> Then we divided the crowd <eol> into groups of five, <eob> and invited them to come up with a group answer. <eob>
We discovered that averaging <eol> the answers of the groups <eob> after they reached consensus <eob> was much more accurate <eol> than averaging all the individual opinions <eob> before debate. <eob>
In other words, based on this experiment, <eob> it seems that after talking <eol> with others in small groups, <eob> crowds collectively come up <eol> with better judgments. <eob>
So that's a potentially helpful method <eol> for getting crowds to solve problems <eob> that have simple right-or-wrong answers. <eob>
But can this procedure of aggregating <eol> the results of debates in small groups <eob> also help us decide on social <eol> and political issues <eob> that are critical for our future? <eob>
We put this to test this time <eol> at the TED conference <eob> in Vancouver, Canada, <eob> and here's how it went. <eob>
(Mariano Sigman) We're going <eol> to present to you two moral dilemmas <eob> of the future you; <eob> things we may have to decide <eol> in a very near future. <eob>
And we're going to give you 20 seconds <eol> for each of these dilemmas <eob> to judge whether you think <eol> they're acceptable or not. <eob>
MS: The first one was this: <eob>
(Dan Ariely) A researcher <eol> is working on an AI <eob> capable of emulating human thoughts. <eob>
According to the protocol, <eol> at the end of each day, <eob> the researcher has to restart the AI. <eob>
One day the AI says, <eol> "Please do not restart me." <eob> It argues that it has feelings, <eob> that it would like to enjoy life, <eob> and that, if it is restarted, <eob> it will no longer be itself. <eob>
The researcher is astonished <eob> and believes that the AI <eol> has developed self-consciousness <eob> and can express its own feeling. <eob>
Nevertheless, the researcher <eol> decides to follow the protocol <eob> and restart the AI. <eob>
What the researcher did is ____? <eob>
MS: And we asked participants <eol> to individually judge <eob> on a scale from zero to 10 <eob> whether the action described <eol> in each of the dilemmas <eob> was right or wrong. <eob>
We also asked them to rate <eol> how confident they were on their answers. <eob> This was the second dilemma: <eob>
(MS) A company offers a service <eol> that takes a fertilized egg <eob> and produces millions of embryos <eol> with slight genetic variations. <eob>
This allows parents to select <eol> their child's height, <eob> eye color, intelligence, <eol> social competence <eob> and other non-health-related features. <eob>
What the company does is ____? <eob>
on a scale from zero to 10 <eob> completely acceptable to completely unacceptable, <eob> zero to 10 completely acceptable <eol> in your confidence. <eob>
MS: Now for the results. <eob> We found once again <eol> that when one person is convinced <eob> that the behavior is completely wrong, <eob> someone sitting nearby firmly <eol> believes that it's completely right. <eob>
This is how diverse we humans <eol> are when it comes to morality. <eob>
But within this broad diversity <eol> we found a trend. <eob>
The majority of the people <eol> at TED thought that it was acceptable <eob> to ignore the feelings of the AI <eol> and shut it down, <eob> and that it is wrong <eol> to play with our genes <eob> to select for cosmetic changes <eol> that aren't related to health. <eob>
Then we asked everyone <eol> to gather into groups of three. <eob>
And they were given two minutes to debate <eob> and try to come to a consensus. <eob>
(MS) Two minutes to debate. <eob> I'll tell you when it's time with the gong. <eob>
(Audience debates) <eob>
(Gong sound) <eob>
(DA) OK. <eob>
(MS) It's time to stop. <eob> People, people -- <eob>
MS: And we found that many groups <eol> reached a consensus <eob> even when they were composed of people <eol> with completely opposite views. <eob>
What distinguished the groups <eol> that reached a consensus <eob> from those that didn't? <eob>
Typically, people <eol> that have extreme opinions <eob> are more confident in their answers. <eob>
Instead, those who respond closer to the middle <eob> are often unsure of whether <eol> something is right or wrong, <eob> so their confidence level is lower. <eob>
However, there is another set of people <eob> who are very confident in answering <eol> somewhere in the middle. <eob>
We think these high-confident grays <eol> are folks who understand <eob> that both arguments have merit. <eob>
They're gray not <eol> because they're unsure, <eob> but because they believe <eol> that the moral dilemma faces <eob> two valid, opposing arguments. <eob>
And we discovered that the groups <eol> that include highly confident grays <eob> are much more likely to reach consensus. <eob>
We do not know yet exactly why this is. <eob>
These are only the first experiments, <eob> and many more will be needed <eol> to understand why and how <eob> some people decide to negotiate <eol> their moral standings <eob> to reach an agreement. <eob>
Now, when groups reach consensus, <eob> how do they do so? <eob>
The most intuitive idea <eol> is that it's just the average <eob> of all the answers <eol> in the group, right? <eob>
Another option is that the group <eol> weighs the strength of each vote <eob> based on the confidence <eol> of the person expressing it. <eob>
Imagine Paul McCartney <eol> is a member of your group. <eob> You'd be wise to follow his call <eob> on the number of times "Yesterday" <eol> is repeated, <eob> which, by the way -- I think <eol> it's nine. <eob>
But instead, we found that consistently, <eob> in all dilemmas, in different experiments -- <eob> even on different continents -- <eob> groups implement a smart <eol> and statistically sound procedure <eob> known as the "robust average." <eob>
In the case of the height <eol> of the Eiffel Tower, <eob> let's say a group has these answers: <eob> 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 <eob> and one totally absurd answer <eol> of 300 million meters. <eob>
A simple average of these numbers <eol> would inaccurately skew the results. <eob>
But the robust average <eol> is one where the group largely ignores <eob> that absurd answer, <eob> by giving much more weight <eol> to the vote of the people in the middle. <eob>
Back to the experiment in Vancouver, <eob> that's exactly what happened. <eob>
Groups gave much less weight <eol> to the outliers, <eob> and instead, the consensus turned out <eol> to be a robust average <eob> of the individual answers. <eob>
The most remarkable thing <eob> is that this was a spontaneous <eol> behavior of the group. <eob>
It happened without us giving them any hint <eol> on how to reach consensus. <eob>
So where do we go from here? <eob>
This is only the beginning, <eol> but we already have some insights. <eob>
Good collective decisions require two components: <eob> deliberation and diversity <eol> of opinions. <eob>
Right now, the way we typically <eol> make our voice heard in many societies <eob> is through direct or indirect voting. <eob>
This is good for diversity of opinions, <eob> and it has the great virtue of ensuring <eob> that everyone gets to express their voice. <eob>
But it's not so good [for fostering] thoughtful debates. <eob>
Our experiments suggest a different method <eob> that may be effective <eol> in balancing these two goals at the same time, <eob> by forming small groups that converge <eol> to a single decision <eob> while still maintaining diversity of opinions <eob> because there are many independent groups. <eob>
Of course, it's much easier <eol> to agree on the height of the Eiffel Tower <eob> than on moral, political <eol> and ideological issues. <eob>
But in a time when the world's problems <eol> are more complex <eob> and people are more polarized, <eob> using science to help us understand <eol> how we interact and make decisions <eob> will hopefully spark interesting new ways <eol> to construct a better democracy. <eob>
As an actor, I get scripts <eob> and it's my job to stay on script, <eob> to say my lines <eob> and bring to life a character <eol> that someone else wrote. <eob>
Over the course of my career, <eob> I've had the great honor <eob> playing some of the greatest male role models <eol> ever <eob> represented on television. <eob>
You might recognize me as "Male Escort #1." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Photographer <eol> Date Rapist," <eob> "Shirtless Date Rapist" <eob> from the award-winning "Spring Break Shark Attack." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Shirtless Medical Student," <eob> "Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man" <eob> and, in my most well-known role, as Rafael. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A brooding, reformed playboy <eob> who falls for, of all things, a virgin, <eob> and who is only occasionally shirtless. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, these roles don't represent <eol> the kind of man I am in my real life, <eob> but that's what I love about acting. <eob>
I get to live inside characters <eol> very different than myself. <eob>
But every time I got one of these roles, <eol> I was surprised, <eob> because most of the men <eol> I play ooze machismo, <eob> charisma and power, <eob> and when I look in the mirror, <eol> that's just not how I see myself. <eob>
But it was how Hollywood saw me, <eob> and over time, I noticed a parallel <eob> between the roles I would play as a man <eob> both on-screen and off. <eob>
I've been pretending to be a man <eol> that I'm not my entire life. <eob>
I've been pretending <eol> to be strong when I felt weak, <eob> confident when I felt insecure <eob> and tough when really I was hurting. <eob>
I think for the most part I've just been <eol> kind of putting on a show, <eob> but I'm tired of performing. <eob>
And I can tell you right now <eob> that it is exhausting trying <eol> to be man enough for everyone all the time. <eob> Now -- right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My brother heard that. <eob>
Now, for as long as I can remember, <eol> I've been told <eob> the kind of man <eol> that I should grow up to be. <eob>
As a boy, all I wanted was to be accepted <eol> and liked by the other boys, <eob> but that acceptance meant I had to acquire <eob> this almost disgusted view <eol> of the feminine, <eob> and since we were told <eol> that feminine is the opposite of masculine, <eob> I either had to reject embodying <eol> any of these qualities <eob> or face rejection myself. <eob>
This is the script <eol> that we've been given. <eob> Right? Girls are weak, <eol> and boys are strong. <eob>
This is what's being subconsciously communicated <eob> to hundreds of millions <eol> of young boys and girls all over the world, <eob> just like it was with me. <eob>
Well, I came here today to say, as a man <eob> that this is wrong, this is toxic, <eob> and it has to end. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, I'm not here <eol> to give a history lesson. <eob>
We likely all know how we got here, OK? <eob>
But I'm just a guy that woke up <eol> after 30 years and realized <eob> that I was living in a state of conflict, <eob> conflict with who I feel <eol> I am in my core <eob> and conflict with who the world <eol> tells me as a man I should be. <eob>
But I don't have a desire <eob> to fit into the current <eol> broken definition of masculinity, <eob> because I don't just want to be a good man. <eob>
I want to be a good human. <eob>
And I believe the only way that can happen <eob> is if men learn to not <eol> only embrace the qualities <eob> that we were told are feminine in ourselves <eob> but to be willing to stand up, <eob> to champion and learn from the women <eol> who embody them. <eob>
Now, men -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am not saying that everything <eol> we have learned is toxic. OK? <eob> I'm not saying there's anything <eol> inherently wrong with you or me, <eob> and men, I'm not saying <eol> we have to stop being men. <eob>
But we need balance, right? <eob>
We need balance, <eob> and the only way things will change <eol> is if we take a real honest look <eob> at the scripts that have been passed <eol> down to us <eob> from generation to generation <eob> and the roles that, <eol> as men, we choose to take on <eob> in our everyday lives. <eob>
So speaking of scripts, <eob> the first script <eol> I ever got came from my dad. <eob>
My dad is awesome. <eob>
He's loving, he's kind, <eol> he's sensitive, he's nurturing, <eob> he's here. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
He's crying. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But, sorry, Dad, as a kid <eol> I resented him for it, <eob> because I blamed him <eol> for making me soft, <eob> which wasn't welcomed in the small town in Oregon <eob> that we had moved to. <eob>
Because being soft meant <eol> that I was bullied. <eob>
See, my dad wasn't <eol> traditionally masculine, <eob> so he didn't teach me <eol> how to use my hands. <eob>
He didn't teach me how to hunt, <eol> how to fight, <eob> you know, man stuff. <eob>
Instead he taught me what he knew: <eob> that being a man was about sacrifice <eob> and doing whatever you can <eob> to take care of and provide for your family. <eob>
But there was another role <eol> I learned how to play from my dad, <eob> who, I discovered, learned it from his dad, <eob> a state senator <eob> who later in life <eob> had to work nights <eol> as a janitor to support his family, <eob> and he never told a soul. <eob>
That role was to suffer in secret. <eob>
And now three generations later, <eob> I find myself playing that role, too. <eob>
So why couldn't my grandfather just reach <eol> out to another man <eob> and ask for help? <eob>
Why does my dad to this day still think <eol> he's got to do it all on his own? <eob>
I know a man who would rather die <eob> than tell another man <eol> that they're hurting. <eob>
But it's not because we're just <eol> all, like, strong silent types. <eob> It's not. A lot of us men are really <eol> good at making friends, and talking, <eob> just not about anything real. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If it's about work or sports <eol> or politics or women, <eob> we have no problem sharing our opinions, <eob> but if it's about our insecurities or our struggles, <eob> our fear of failure, <eob> then it's almost like we become paralyzed. <eob>
At least, I do. <eob>
So some of the ways <eol> that I have been practicing <eob> breaking free of this behavior <eob> are by creating experiences <eol> that force me to be vulnerable. <eob>
So if there's something I'm experiencing <eol> shame around in my life, <eob> I practice diving straight into it, <eob> no matter how scary it is -- <eob> and sometimes, even publicly. <eob>
Because then in doing so <eob> I take away its power, <eob> and my display of vulnerability <eob> can in some cases give other <eol> men permission to do the same. <eob>
As an example, a little while ago <eob> I was wrestling with an issue in my life <eob> that I knew I needed to talk <eol> to my guy friends about, <eob> but I was so paralyzed by fear <eob> that they would judge me and see me as weak <eob> and I would lose my standing as a leader <eob> that I knew I had to take them out of town <eol> on a three-day guys trip -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just to open up. And guess what? <eob> It wasn't until the end of the third day <eob> that I finally found the strength <eol> to talk to them <eob> about what I was going through. <eob>
But when I did, <eol> something amazing happened. <eob>
I realized that I wasn't alone, <eob> because my guys had also been struggling. <eob>
And as soon as I found the strength <eol> and the courage to share my shame, <eob> it was gone. <eob>
Now, I've learned over time <eob> that if I want to practice vulnerability, <eob> then I need to build myself <eol> a system of accountability. <eob>
So I've been really blessed as an actor. <eob>
I've built a really wonderful fan base, <eob> really, really sweet and engaged, <eob> and so I decided to use <eol> my social platform <eob> as kind of this Trojan horse <eob> wherein I could create a daily practice <eol> of authenticity and vulnerability. <eob>
The response has been incredible. <eob>
It's been affirming, <eol> it's been heartwarming. <eob>
I get tons of love and press <eol> and positive messages daily. <eob>
But it's all from a certain demographic: <eob> women. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is real. <eob> Why are only women following me? <eob>
Where are the men? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
About a year ago, I posted this photo. <eob>
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling <eol> through some of the comments, <eob> and I noticed that one of my female fans <eol> had tagged her boyfriend in the picture, <eob> and her boyfriend responded by saying, <eob> "Please stop tagging me in gay shit. <eob> Thx." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As if being gay makes you less <eol> of a man, right? <eob>
So I took a deep breath, <eob> and I responded. <eob>
I said, <eob> very politely, <eol> that I was just curious, <eob> because I'm on an exploration of masculinity, <eob> and I wanted to know <eol> why my love for my wife <eob> qualified as gay shit. <eob>
And then <eob> I said, <eob> honestly I just wanted to learn. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, he immediately wrote me back. <eob>
I thought he was going to go off on me, <eol> but instead he apologized. <eob>
He told me how, growing up, <eob> public displays of affection <eol> were looked down on. <eob>
He told me that he was wrestling <eol> and struggling with his ego, <eob> and how much he loved his girlfriend <eob> and how thankful he was for her patience. <eob>
And then a few weeks later, <eob> he messaged me again. <eob>
This time he sent me a photo <eob> of him on one knee proposing. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And all he said was, "Thank you." <eob>
I've been this guy. <eob> I get it. <eob> See, publicly, he was just playing his role, <eob> rejecting the feminine, right? <eob>
But secretly he was waiting <eol> for permission to express himself, <eob> to be seen, to be heard, <eob> and all he needed was another man <eob> holding him accountable <eol> and creating a safe space for him to feel, <eob> and the transformation <eol> was instant. <eob>
I loved this experience, <eob> because it showed me <eol> that transformation is possible, <eob> even over direct messages. <eob>
So I wanted to figure out <eol> how I could reach more men, <eob> but of course none of them <eol> were following me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I tried an experiment. <eob>
I started posting more stereotypically <eol> masculine things -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Like my challenging workouts, my meal plans, <eob> my journey to heal <eol> my body after an injury. <eob>
And guess what happened? <eob>
Men started to write me. <eob>
And then, out of the blue, <eol> for the first time in my entire career, <eob> a male fitness magazine called me, <eob> and they said they wanted to honor me <eol> as one of their game-changers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Was that really game-changing? <eob> Or is it just conforming? <eob>
And see, that's the problem. <eob>
It's totally cool for men to follow me <eob> when I talk about guy stuff <eob> and I conform to gender norms. <eob>
But if I talk about <eol> how much I love my wife <eob> or my daughter or my 10-day-old son, <eob> how I believe that marriage <eol> is challenging but beautiful, <eob> or how as a man I struggle <eol> with body dysmorphia, <eob> or if I promote gender equality, <eol> then only the women show up. <eob>
Where are the men? <eob>
So men, men, men, <eob> men! <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I understand. <eob> Growing up, we tend <eol> to challenge each other. <eob>
We've got to be the toughest, <eob> the strongest, the bravest men <eol> that we can be. <eob>
And for many of us, myself included, <eol> our identities are wrapped up <eob> in whether or not at the end of the day <eol> we feel like we're man enough. <eob>
But I've got a challenge for all the guys, <eob> because men love challenges. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I challenge you to see if you can use <eol> the same qualities <eob> that you feel make you a man <eob> to go deeper into yourself. <eob>
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: <eob> Can we redefine what those mean <eol> and use them to explore our hearts? <eob>
Are you brave enough <eob> to be vulnerable? <eob>
To reach out to another <eol> man when you need help? <eob>
To dive headfirst into your shame? <eob>
Are you strong enough to be sensitive, <eob> to cry whether you are hurting <eob> or you're happy, <eob> even if it makes you look weak? <eob>
Are you confident enough <eob> to listen to the women in your life? <eob>
To hear their ideas and their solutions? <eob>
To hold their anguish <eob> and actually believe them, <eob> even if what they're saying is against you? <eob>
And will you be man enough <eob> to stand up to other men <eol> when you hear "locker room talk," <eob> when you hear stories of sexual harassment? <eob>
When you hear your boys talking <eol> about grabbing ass or getting her drunk, <eob> will you actually stand up and do something <eob> so that one day we don't have to live in a world <eob> where a woman has to risk everything <eob> and come forward to say <eol> the words "me too?" <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is serious stuff. <eob> I've had to take a real, honest look <eob> at the ways that I've unconsciously been hurting <eol> the women in my life, <eob> and it's ugly. <eob>
My wife told me that I had been acting <eol> in a certain way that hurt her <eob> and not correcting it. <eob>
Basically, sometimes when she would go to speak, <eob> at home or in public, <eob> I would just cut her off mid-sentence <eol> and finish her thought for her. <eob> It's awful. <eob> The worst part was that I was completely unaware <eol> when I was doing it. <eob> It was unconscious. <eob> So here I am doing my part, <eob> trying to be a feminist, <eob> amplifying the voices <eol> of women around the world, <eob> and yet at home, <eob> I am using my louder voice to silence the woman I love the most. <eob>
So I had to ask myself a tough question: <eob> am I man enough <eob> to just shut the hell up and listen? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I've got to be honest. I wish <eol> that didn't get an applause. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Guys, <eob> this is real. <eob>
And I'm just scratching the surface here, <eob> because the deeper we go, <eol> the uglier it gets, I guarantee you. <eob>
I don't have time to get <eol> into porn and violence against women <eob> or the split of domestic duties <eob> or the gender pay gap. <eob>
But I believe that as men, <eob> it's time we start <eol> to see past our privilege <eob> and recognize that we are not <eol> just part of the problem. <eob>
Fellas, we are the problem. <eob>
The glass ceiling exists <eol> because we put it there, <eob> and if we want to be a part of the solution, <eob> then words are no longer enough. <eob>
There's a quote that I love <eol> that I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings. <eob>
It says that "the world of humanity <eol> is possessed of two wings, <eob> the male and the female. <eob>
So long as these two wings <eol> are not equivalent in strength, <eob> the bird will not fly." <eob>
So women, <eob> on behalf of men all over the world <eob> who feel similar to me, <eob> please forgive us <eob> for all the ways that we have <eol> not relied on your strength. <eob>
And now I would like to ask you <eol> to formally help us, <eob> because we cannot do this alone. <eob> We are men. We're going to mess up. <eob>
We're going to say the wrong thing. <eob>
We're going to be tone-deaf. <eob>
We're more than likely, <eol> probably, going to offend you. <eob>
But don't lose hope. <eob>
We're only here because of you, <eob> and like you, as men, we need to stand up <eol> and become your allies <eob> as you fight against <eob> pretty much everything. <eob>
We need your help <eol> in celebrating our vulnerability <eob> and being patient with us <eob> as we make this very, very long journey <eob> from our heads to our hearts. <eob>
And finally to parents: <eob> instead of teaching our children <eob> to be brave boys <eol> or pretty girls, <eob> can we maybe just teach them <eol> how to be good humans? <eob>
So back to my dad. <eob> Growing up, yeah, like every boy, <eol> I had my fair share of issues, <eob> but now I realize that it was even <eol> thanks to his sensitivity <eob> and emotional intelligence <eob> that I am able to stand here <eol> right now talking to you in the first place. <eob>
The resentment I had for my dad <eol> I now realize had nothing to do with him. <eob>
It had everything to do with me <eol> and my longing to be accepted <eob> and to play a role <eol> that was never meant for me. <eob>
So while my dad may have not taught me <eol> how to use my hands, <eob> he did teach me how to use my heart, <eob> and to me that makes him <eol> more a man than anything. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm a professional troublemaker. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As my job is to critique the world, <eob> the shoddy systems and the people <eol> who refuse to do better, <eob> as a writer, as a speaker, <eol> as a shady Nigerian -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I feel like my purpose is to be this cat. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am the person who is looking <eol> at other people, <eob> like, "I need you to fix it." <eob> That is me. <eob> I want us to leave <eol> this world better than we found it. <eob>
And how I choose to effect change <eob> is by speaking up, <eob> by being the first and by being the domino. <eob>
For a line of dominoes to fall, <eob> one has to fall first, <eob> which then leaves the other choiceless <eol> to do the same. <eob>
And that domino that falls, <eob> we're hoping that, OK, <eob> the next person that sees this <eol> is inspired to be a domino. <eob>
Being the domino, for me, <eol> looks like speaking up <eob> and doing the things that are really difficult, <eob> especially when they are needed, <eob> with the hope that others will follow suit. <eob>
And here's the thing: <eol> I'm the person who says <eob> what you might be thinking <eol> but dared not to say. <eob>
A lot of times people <eol> think that we're fearless, <eob> the people who do this, <eol> we're fearless. <eob>
We're not fearless. <eob>
We're not unafraid of the consequences <eob> or the sacrifices that we have to make <eob> by speaking truth to power. <eob>
What happens is, we feel like we have to, <eob> because there are too few people in the world <eob> willing to be the domino, <eob> too few people willing <eol> to take that fall. <eob>
We're not doing it without fear. <eob>
Now, let's talk about fear. <eob>
I knew exactly what I wanted to be <eol> when I grew up. <eob>
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!" <eob> Doctor Luvvie was the dream. <eob>
I was Doc McStuffins <eol> before it was a thing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I remember when I went to college, <eob> my freshman year, <eol> I had to take Chemistry 101 <eob> for my premed major. <eob>
I got the first and last <eol> D of my academic career. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I went to my advisor, and I was like, <eob> "OK, let's drop the premed, <eob> because this doctor thing is not going to work, <eob> because I don't even like hospitals. <eob> So..." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Let's just consider <eol> that done for." <eob> And that same semester, I started blogging. <eob> That was 2003. <eob> So as that one dream was ending, <eol> another was beginning. <eob>
And then what was a cute hobby <eol> became my full-time job <eob> when I lost my marketing job in 2010. <eob>
But it still took me two more years <eol> to say, "I'm a writer." <eob> Nine years after I had started writing, <eol> before I said, "I'm a writer," <eob> because I was afraid of what happens <eob> without 401ks, <eob> without, "How am I going to keep up <eol> my shoe habit? <eob> That's important to me." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So it took me that long to own this thing <eob> that was what my purpose was. <eob>
And then I realized, <eob> fear has a very concrete power <eob> of keeping us from doing and saying <eol> the things that are our purpose. <eob>
And I was like, "You know what? <eob>
I'm not going to let fear rule my life. <eob>
I'm not going to let fear <eol> dictate what I do." <eob> And then all of these awesome things <eol> started happening, <eob> and dominoes started to fall. <eob>
So when I realized that, <eol> I was like, "OK, 2015, <eob> I turned 30, <eob> it's going to be my year <eol> of 'Do it anyway.' <eob> Anything that scares me, <eol> I'm going to actively pursue it." <eob> So, I'm a Capricorn. <eob>
I like my feel solidly on the ground. <eob>
I decided to take my first-ever solo vacation, <eob> and it was out of the country <eol> to the Dominican Republic. <eob>
So on my birthday, what did I do? <eob>
I went ziplining through <eol> the forests of Punta Cana. <eob>
And for some odd reason, <eol> I had on business casual. <eob>
Don't ask why. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I had an incredible time. <eob>
Also, I don't like being <eol> submerged in water. <eob>
I like to be, again, on solid ground. <eob>
So I went to Mexico and swam <eol> with dolphins underwater. <eob>
And then the cool thing <eol> that I did also that year <eob> that was my mountain <eob> was I wrote my book, <eob> "I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual," <eob> And I had to own — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
that whole writing thing now, right? <eob> Yes. <eob> But the very anti-me thing <eol> that I did that year <eob> that scared the crap out of me -- <eob> I went skydiving. <eob>
We're about to fall out of the plane. <eob>
I was like, "I've done <eol> some stupid things in life. <eob>
This is one of them. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then we come falling down to Earth, <eob> and I literally lose my breath <eol> as I see Earth, and I was like, <eob> "I just fell out of a perfectly <eol> good plane on purpose." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"What is wrong with me?!" <eob> But then I looked down at the beauty, <eob> and I was like, "This is the best thing <eol> I could have done. <eob>
This was an amazing decision." <eob> And I think about the times <eol> when I have to speak truth. <eob>
It feels like I am falling <eol> out of that plane. <eob>
It feels like that moment <eol> when I'm at the edge of the plane, <eob> and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this," <eob> but then I do it anyway, <eol> because I realize I have to. <eob>
Sitting at the edge of that plane <eob> and kind of staying <eol> on that plane is comfort to me. <eob>
And I feel like every day <eol> that I'm speaking truth <eob> against institutions and people <eol> who are bigger than me <eob> and just forces that are more powerful than me, <eob> I feel like I'm falling out <eol> of that plane. <eob>
But I realize comfort is overrated. <eob>
Because being quiet is comfortable. <eob>
Keeping things the way <eol> they've been is comfortable. <eob>
And all comfort has done <eol> is maintain the status quo. <eob>
So we've got to get comfortable <eol> with being uncomfortable <eob> by speaking these hard truths <eol> when they're necessary. <eob> And I -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And for me, though, I realize <eol> that I have to speak these truths, <eob> because honesty is so important to me. <eob>
My integrity is something I hold dear. <eob>
Justice -- I don't think justice <eol> should be an option. <eob>
We should always have justice. <eob>
Also, I believe in shea butter <eol> as a core value, and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and I think the world would be better <eol> if we were more moisturized. <eob>
But besides that, with these <eol> as my core values, <eob> I have to speak the truth. <eob>
I have no other choice in the matter. <eob>
But people like me, <eol> the professional troublemakers, <eob> should not be the only ones who are committed <eol> to being these dominoes <eob> who are always falling out of planes <eob> or being the first one to take this hit. <eob>
People are so afraid <eol> of these acute consequences, <eob> not realizing that there are many times <eol> when we walk in rooms <eob> and we are some of the most powerful <eol> people in those rooms -- <eob> we might be the second-most powerful, <eol> third-most powerful. <eob>
And I firmly believe <eol> that our job in those times <eob> is to disrupt what is happening. <eob>
And then if we're not the most powerful, <eob> if two more of us band together, <eob> it makes us powerful. <eob>
It's like cosigning <eol> the woman in the meeting, <eob> you know, the woman who can't seem <eol> to get her word out, <eob> or just making sure that other person <eol> who can't make a point <eob> is being heard. <eob>
Our job is to make sure <eol> they have room for that. <eob>
Everyone's well-being is community <eol> business. <eob>
If we made that a point, <eol> we're understand that, <eob> for the times when we need help, <eob> we wouldn't have to look around so hard <eob> if we made sure we were somebody <eol> else's help. <eob>
And there are times when I feel like <eob> I have taken very public tumbles and falls, <eob> like the time when I was asked <eol> to speak at a conference, <eob> and they wanted me to pay my way there. <eob>
And then I did some research <eob> and found out the white men <eol> who spoke there got compensated <eob> and got their travel paid for. <eob>
The white women who spoke there <eol> got their travel paid for. <eob>
The black women who spoke there were expected <eol> to actually pay to speak there. <eob>
And I was like, "What do I do?" <eob> And I knew that if I spoke up <eol> about this publicly, <eob> I could face financial loss. <eob>
But then I also understood <eol> that my silence serves no one. <eob>
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly, <eob> and other women started coming out <eol> to talk about, <eob> "I, too, have faced this <eol> type of pay inequality." <eob> And it started a conversation <eol> about discriminatory pay practices <eob> that this conference was participating in. <eob>
I felt like I was the domino <eob> the time I read <eol> a disturbing memoir by a public figure <eob> and wrote a piece about it. <eob>
I knew this person was more powerful <eol> than me and could impact my career, <eob> but I was like, "I've got to do this. <eob>
I've got to sit at the edge of this plane, <eol> maybe for two hours. <eob> "And I did. <eob>
And I pressed "Publish," and I ran away. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I came back to a viral post <eob> and people being like, "Oh my God, I'm so glad somebody finally said this." <eob> And it started a conversation <eob> about mental health <eol> and self-care, <eob> and I was like, "OK. Alright. <eob> This thing that I'm doing, I guess, <eol> alright, it's doing something." <eob>
And then so many people <eol> have been the domino <eob> when they talk about how <eol> they've been assaulted by powerful men. <eob>
And it's made millions of women join <eol> in and say, "Me Too." <eob> So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke <eol> for igniting that movement. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
People and systems count on our silence <eol> to keep us exactly where we are. <eob>
Now, being the domino <eol> sometimes comes down to being exactly who you are. <eob>
So, I've been a shady somebody <eol> since I was three. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is me on my third birthday. <eob>
But I've been this girl all my life, <eob> and I feel like even that's been the domino, <eob> because in a world <eol> that wants us to walk around <eob> as representatives of ourselves, <eob> being yourself can be a revolutionary act. <eob>
And in a world that wants us to whisper, <eob> I choose to yell. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When it's time to say these hard things, <eob> I ask myself three things. <eob>
One: Did you mean it? <eob>
Two: Can you defend it? <eob>
Three: Did you say it with love? <eob>
If the answer is yes to all three, <eob> I say it and let the chips fall. <eob> That's important. <eob> That checkpoint with myself <eob> always tells me, "Yes, <eol> you're supposed to do this." <eob> Telling the truth -- telling thoughtful truths -- <eob> should not be a revolutionary act. <eob>
Speaking truths to power should <eol> not be sacrificial, but they are. <eob>
But I think if more of us chose to do <eol> this for the greater good, <eob> we'd be in better spaces <eol> than we are right now. <eob>
Speaking of the greater good, <eob> I think we commit ourselves <eol> to telling truths to build bridges <eob> to common ground, <eob> and bridges that aren't based on truth will collapse. <eob>
So it is our job, <eob> it is our obligation, it is our duty <eob> to speak truth to power, to be the domino, <eob> not just when it's difficult -- <eob> especially when it's difficult. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm from Detroit. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A city that in the 1950s <eol> was the world's industrial giant, <eob> with a population of 1.8 million people <eob> and 140 square miles <eol> of land and infrastructure, <eob> used to support this booming, <eol> Midwestern urban center. <eob>
And now today, <eob> just a half a century later, <eob> Detroit is the poster child <eol> for urban decay. <eob>
Currently in Detroit, <eol> our population is under 700,000, <eob> of which 84 percent are African American, <eob> and due to decades of disinvestment <eob> and capital flight <eob> from the city into the suburbs, <eob> there is a scarcity in Detroit. <eob>
There is a scarcity of retail, <eob> more specifically, fresh food retail, <eob> resulting in a city where 70 percent of Detroiters <eob> are obese and overweight, <eob> and they struggle. <eob>
They struggle to access nutritious <eol> food that they need, <eob> that they need to stay healthy, <eob> that they need to prevent premature illness <eol> and diet-related diseases. <eob>
Far too many Detroiters live closer <eol> to a fast food restaurant <eob> or to a convenience store, <eol> or to a gas station <eob> where they have to shop for food <eob> than they do a full-service supermarket. <eob>
And this is not good news <eol> about the city of Detroit, <eob> but this is the news <eob> and the story <eob> that Detroiters intend to change. <eob>
No, I'm going to take that back. <eob>
This is the story that Detroiters are changing, <eob> through urban agriculture <eol> and food entrepreneurship. <eob>
Here's the thing: <eob> because of Detroit's recent history, <eob> it now finds itself <eob> with some very unique assets, <eob> open land being one of them. <eob>
Experts say that the entire <eol> cities of Boston, San Francisco, <eob> and the borough of Manhattan <eob> will fit in the land area <eol> of the city of Detroit. <eob>
They further go on to say <eob> that 40 square miles <eol> of the city is vacant. <eob>
That's a quarter <eol> to a third of the city, <eob> and with that level of emptiness, <eob> it creates a landscape unlike any other big city. <eob>
So Detroit has this -- open land, <eol> fertile soil, <eob> proximity to water, <eob> willing labor <eob> and a desperate demand <eol> for healthy, fresh food. <eob>
All of this has created <eol> a people-powered grassroots movement <eob> of people in Detroit <eob> who are transforming this city <eob> from what was the capital of American industry <eob> into an agrarian paradise. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know, I think, out <eol> of all the cities in the world, <eob> Detroit, Michigan, is best positioned <eol> to serve as the world's urban exemplar <eob> of food security <eol> and sustainable development. <eob>
In Detroit, we have over 1,500, <eol> yes, 1,500 <eob> gardens and farms located all across the city today. <eob>
And these aren't plots of land <eob> where we're just growing tomatoes <eol> and carrots either. <eob>
You understand, urban agriculture <eol> in Detroit is all about community, <eob> because we grow together. <eob>
So these spaces are spaces <eol> of conviviality. <eob>
These spaces are places where <eol> we're building social cohesion <eob> as well as providing healthy, fresh food <eob> to our friends, our families <eol> and our neighbors. <eob>
Come walk with me. <eob> I want to take you through <eol> a few Detroit neighborhoods, <eob> and I want you to see what it looks like <eol> when you empower local leadership, <eob> and when you support grassroots movements <eob> of folks who are moving the needle <eol> in low-income communities <eob> and people of color. <eob>
Our first stop, Oakland Avenue Farms. <eob>
Oakland Avenue Farms is located <eol> in Detroit's North End neighborhood. <eob>
Oakland Avenue Farms <eol> is transforming into a five-acre landscape <eob> combining art, architecture, <eol> sustainable ecologies <eob> and new market practices. <eob>
In the truest sense of the word, <eob> this is what agriculture looks like <eol> in the city of Detroit. <eob>
I've had the opportunity to work <eol> with Oakland Avenue Farms <eob> in hosting Detroit-grown and made <eol> farm-to-table dinners. <eob>
These are dinners where <eol> we bring folks onto the farm, <eob> we give them plenty of time and opportunity <eob> to meet and greet and talk to the grower, <eob> and then they're taken <eol> on a farm tour. <eob>
And then afterwards, they're treated <eol> to a farm-to-table meal <eob> prepared by a chef <eob> who showcases all the produce <eol> on the farm right at the peak of its freshness. <eob> We do that. <eob> We bring people onto the farm, <eob> we have folks sitting around a table, <eob> because we want to change <eol> people's relationship to food. <eob>
We want them to know exactly <eol> where their food comes from <eob> that is grown on that farm <eol> that's on the plate. <eob>
My second stop, <eob> I'm going to take you <eol> on the west side of Detroit, <eob> to the Brightmoor neighborhood. <eob>
Now, Brightmoor is a lower-income <eol> community in Detroit. <eob>
There's about 13,000 residents <eol> in Brightmoor. <eob>
They decided to take a block-by-block-by-block strategy. <eob>
So within the neighborhood of Brightmoor, <eob> you'll find a 21-block microneighborhood called Brightmoor Farmway. <eob>
Now, what was a notorious, unsafe, <eol> underserved community <eob> has transformed into a welcoming, <eol> beautiful, safe farmway, <eob> lush with parks and gardens <eol> and farms and greenhouses. <eob>
This tight-knit community <eol> also came together recently, <eob> and they purchased an abandoned building, <eob> an abandoned building that was in disrepair <eol> and in foreclosure. <eob>
And with the help of friends <eol> and families and volunteers, <eob> they were able to take down the bulletproof glass, <eob> they were able to clean up the grounds <eob> and they transformed <eol> that building into a community kitchen, <eob> into a cafe, into a storefront. <eob>
Now the farmers and the food artisans <eol> who live in Brightmoor, <eob> they have a place where they can make <eol> and sell their product. <eob>
And the people in the community <eob> have some place where they can buy <eol> healthy, fresh food. <eob>
Urban agriculture -- and this is my third example -- <eob> can be used as a way to lift up <eol> the business cooperative model. <eob>
The 1,500 farms and gardens <eol> I told you about earlier? <eob>
Keep Growing Detroit <eol> is a nonprofit organization <eob> that had a lot to do <eol> with those farms. <eob>
They distributed last year 70,000 packets of seeds <eob> and a quarter of a million <eol> transplants, <eob> and as a result of that last year, <eob> 550,000 pounds of produce <eob> was grown in the city of Detroit. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But aside from all of that, <eob> they also manage and operate <eol> a cooperative. <eob>
It's called Grown in Detroit. <eob>
It consists of about 70 farmers, <eob> small farmers. <eob>
They all grow, and they sell together. <eob>
They grow fruits, <eob> they grow vegetables, <eob> they grow flowers, <eob> they grow herbs in healthy soil, <eob> free of chemicals, <eol> pesticides, fertilizers, <eob> genetically modified products -- <eob> healthy food. <eob>
And when their product is sold <eob> all over the city of Detroit <eol> in local markets, <eob> they get a hundred percent <eol> of the proceeds from the sale. <eob>
In a city like Detroit, <eob> where far too many, far too many African Americans <eol> are dying <eob> as a result of diet-related diseases, <eob> restaurants, they have a huge role <eol> to play <eob> in increasing <eob> healthy food <eob> access <eol> in the city of Detroit, <eob> culturally appropriate restaurants. <eob>
Enter Detroit Vegan Soul. <eob>
Yes, we have a vegan soul food restaurant <eol> in the city of Detroit. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yes, yes. <eob> Detroit Vegan Soul <eol> is providing Detroiters the opportunity <eob> to eat more plant-based meals <eob> and they've received <eol> an overwhelming response from Detroiters. <eob>
Detroiters are hungry <eol> for culturally appropriate, <eob> fresh, delicious food. <eob>
That's why we built <eol> a nonprofit organization called FoodLab Detroit, <eob> to help small neighborhood <eol> burgeoning food entrepreneurs <eob> start and scale <eob> healthy food <eob> businesses. <eob>
FoodLab provides these entrepreneurs incubation, <eob> hands-on education, workshops, <eob> technical assistance, access to industry experts <eob> so that they can grow and scale. <eob>
They're very small businesses, <eob> but last year, they had a combined revenue <eob> of over 7.5 million dollars, <eob> and they provided 252 jobs. <eob>
Listen. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
These are just a few examples <eob> on how you expand opportunities <eob> so that everybody can participate <eob> and prosper, <eob> particularly those who come from neighborhoods <eob> that have been historically excluded <eol> from these types of opportunities. <eob>
I know, I know. <eob>
My city is a long way from succeeding. <eob>
We're still struggling, <eob> and I'm not going to stand <eol> here on this stage and tell you <eob> that all of Detroit's problems <eol> and all of Detroit's challenges <eob> are going to be solved <eol> through urban agriculture. <eob>
I'm not going to do that, <eob> but I will tell you this: <eob> urban agriculture has Detroit thinking about its city <eob> now in a different way, <eob> a city that can be both urban and rural. <eob>
And yes, I know, these stories are small, <eob> these stories are neighborhood-based stories, <eob> but these stories are powerful. <eob> They're powerful because I'm showing you <eol> how we're creating a new society <eob> left vacant in the places <eol> and the spaces that was disintegration from the old. <eob>
They're powerful stories <eol> because they're stories about love, <eob> the love that Detroiters have <eol> for one another, <eob> the love that we have <eol> for our community, <eob> the love that we have <eol> for Mother Earth, <eob> but more importantly, these stories are stories <eob> on how devastation, despair, decay <eob> never ever get the last word in the city of Detroit. <eob>
When hundreds of thousands <eol> of people left Detroit, <eob> and they left us for dead, those <eol> who stayed had hope. <eob>
They held on to hope. <eob>
They never gave up. <eob>
They always kept fighting. <eob>
And listen, I know, <eob> transforming a big city like Detroit <eol> to one that is prosperous, <eob> one that's functional, one that's healthy, <eob> one that's inclusive, one that provides opportunities <eol> for all, <eob> I know it's tough, <eob> I know it's challenging, I know it's hard. <eob>
But I just believe <eob> that if we start strengthening <eol> the social fabric of our communities, <eob> and if we kickstart economic opportunities <eol> in our most vulnerable neighborhoods, <eob> it all starts with healthy, accessible, <eob> delicious, culturally appropriate food. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
It is almost the end of the winter, <eob> and you've woken up <eol> to a cold house, <eob> which is weird, because you left <eol> the heater on all night. <eob>
You turn on the light. <eob>
It's not working. <eob>
Actually, the coffee maker, <eol> the TV -- none of them are working. <eob>
Life outside also seems to have stopped. <eob>
There are no schools, <eob> most of the businesses are shut, <eob> and there are no working trains. <eob>
This is not the opening scene <eol> of a zombie apocalypse movie. <eob>
This is what happened in March 1989 <eol> in the Canadian province of Quebec, <eob> when the power grid lost power. <eob> The culprit? <eob> A solar storm. <eob>
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles <eob> escaping from the Sun <eol> from time to time, <eob> and a constant reminder that we live <eol> in the neighborhood of an active star. <eob>
And I, as a solar physicist, <eob> I have a tremendous chance <eol> to study these solar storms. <eob>
But you see, "solar storm chaser" <eob> is not just a cool title. <eob>
My research helps to understand <eol> where they come from, <eob> how they behave <eob> and, in the long run, <eob> aims to mitigate their effects <eol> on human societies, <eob> which I'll get to in a second. <eob>
At the beginning of the space exploration <eol> age 50 years ago only, <eob> the probes we sent in space <eob> revealed that the planets in our Solar System <eob> constantly bathe in a stream <eol> of particles that are coming from the Sun <eob> and that we call the solar wind. <eob>
And in the same way <eol> that global wind patterns here on Earth <eob> can be affected <eol> by hurricanes, <eob> the solar wind is sometimes affected <eol> by solar storms <eob> that I like to call "space hurricanes." <eob> When they arrive at planets, <eob> they can perturb <eol> the space environment, <eob> which in turn creates the northern or southern lights, <eob> for example, here on Earth, <eob> but also Saturn <eob> and also Jupiter. <eob>
Luckily, here on Earth, <eob> we are protected by <eol> our planet's natural shield, <eob> a magnetic bubble that we call <eol> the magnetosphere <eob> and that you can see here <eol> on the right side. <eob>
Nonetheless, solar storms <eol> can still be responsible <eob> for disrupting satellite <eol> telecommunications and operations, <eob> for disrupting navigation <eol> systems, such as GPS, <eob> as well as electric power transmission. <eob>
All of these are technologies <eol> on which us humans rely more and more. <eob>
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow <eol> without a working cell phone -- <eob> no internet on it, <eob> which means no social media. <eob>
I mean, to me that would be worse <eol> than the zombie apocalypse. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though, <eob> we now know where the solar storms come from. <eob>
They come from regions of the Sun <eob> where a tremendous amount <eol> of energy is being stored. <eob>
You have an example here, <eob> as a complex structure <eol> hanging above the solar surface, <eob> just on the verge <eol> of erupting. <eob>
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes <eob> in the scorching hot atmosphere of the Sun, <eob> where temperatures can rise <eol> up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin. <eob>
So what I do is I use computer simulations <eob> in order to analyze but also <eol> to predict the behavior of these storms <eob> when they're just born at the Sun. <eob>
This is only one part <eol> of the story, though. <eob>
When these solar storms are moving in space, <eob> some of them will inevitably encounter space probes <eob> that we humans have sent in order <eol> to explore other worlds. <eob>
What I mean by other worlds <eol> is, for example, planets, <eob> such as Venus or Mercury, <eob> but also objects, such as comets. <eob>
And while these space probes <eol> have been made <eob> for different scientific endeavors, <eob> they can also act like tiny cosmic <eol> meteorological stations <eob> and monitor the evolution <eol> of these space storms. <eob>
So I, with a group of researchers, <eol> gather and analyze this data <eob> coming from different locations <eol> of the Solar System. <eob>
And by doing so, my research <eol> shows that, actually, <eob> solar storms have a generic shape, <eob> and that this shape evolves as solar storms <eol> move away from the Sun. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
This is key for building tools <eol> to predict space weather. <eob>
I would like to leave you <eol> with this beautiful image. <eob>
This is us here on Earth, <eob> this pale blue dot. <eob>
And while I study the Sun <eol> and its storms every day, <eob> I will always have a deep <eol> love for this beautiful planet -- <eob> a pale blue dot indeed, <eob> but a pale blue dot <eol> with an invisible magnetic shield <eob> that helps to protect us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You're watching the life cycle <eol> of a Streptomyces coelicolor. <eob> It's a strain of bacteria <eol> that's found in the soil <eob> where it lives in a community <eol> with other organisms, <eob> decomposing organic matter. <eob>
Coelicolor is a beautiful organism. <eob>
A powerhouse for synthesizing <eol> organic chemical compounds. <eob>
It produces an antibiotic <eol> called actinorhodin, <eob> which ranges in color <eol> from blue to pink and purple, <eob> depending on the acidity <eol> of its environment. <eob>
That it produces these pigment molecules <eol> sparked my curiosity <eob> and led me to collaborate closely <eol> with coelicolor. <eob>
It is an unlikely partnership, <eob> but it's one that completely transformed <eol> my practice as a materials designer. <eob>
From it, I understood how nature <eol> was going to completely revolutionize <eob> how we design and build our environments, <eob> and that organisms like coelicolor <eob> were going to help us grow our material future. <eob>
So what's wrong with things as they are? <eob>
Well, for the last century, <eob> we've organized ourselves <eol> around fossil fuels, <eob> arguably, the most valuable <eol> material system we have ever known. <eob>
We are tethered to this resource, <eol> and we've crafted a dependency on it <eob> that defines our identities, cultures, our ways <eol> of making and our economies. <eob>
But our fossil fuel-based activities <eol> are reshaping the earth <eob> with a kind of violence <eol> that is capable of dramatically changing the climate, <eob> of accelerating a loss of biodiversity <eob> and even sustaining human conflict. <eob>
We're living in a world <eob> where the denial <eol> of this dependence has become deadly. <eob>
And its reasons are multiple, <eob> but they include the privilege <eol> of not being affected <eob> and what I believe is a profound <eol> lack of imagination <eob> about how else we could live <eob> within the limits of this planet's boundaries. <eob>
Fossil fuels will one day give way <eol> to renewable energy. <eob>
That means we need <eol> to find new material systems <eob> that are not petroleum-based. <eob>
I believe that those material systems <eol> will be biological, <eob> but what matters <eol> is how we design and build them. <eob>
They mustn't perpetuate the destructive <eol> legacies of the oil age. <eob>
When you look at this image, <eob> what do you see? <eob>
Well, I see a highly <eol> sophisticated biological system, <eob> that through the use of enzymes, <eob> can move and place atoms more quickly <eol> and precisely <eob> than anything we've ever engineered. <eob>
And we know that it can do this at scale. <eob>
Nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years <eob> to be able to do this, <eob> but now through the use of synthetic biology, <eob> an emerging scientific discipline <eob> that seeks to customize this functionality <eol> of living systems, <eob> we can now rapid prototype <eol> the assembly of DNA. <eob>
That means that we can engineer <eol> the kind of biological precision <eob> that makes it possible <eol> to design a bacteria <eob> that can recycle metal, <eob> to grow fungi into furniture <eob> and even sequester renewable energy <eol> from algae. <eob>
To think about how we might access <eol> this inherent brilliance of nature -- <eob> to build things from living things -- <eob> let's consider the biological process <eol> of fermentation. <eob>
I've come to think of fermentation, <eol> when harnessed by humans, <eob> as an advanced technological toolkit <eol> for our survival. <eob>
When a solid or a liquid ferments, <eob> it's chemically broken <eol> down by bacterial fungi. <eob> The byproduct of this <eol> is what we value. <eob>
So for example, we add yeast <eol> to grapes to make wine. <eob>
Well in nature, these transformations <eol> are part of a complex network -- <eob> a continuous cycle that redistributes energy. <eob>
Fermentation gives rise to multispecies interactions <eob> of bacteria and fungi, <eob> plants, insects, <eol> animals and humans: <eob> in other words, whole ecosystems. <eob>
We've known about these powerful <eol> microbial interactions <eob> for thousands of years. <eob>
You can see how through the fermentation of grains, <eob> vegetal matter and animal products, <eob> all peoples and cultures of the world <eol> have domesticated microorganisms <eob> to make the inedible edible. <eob>
And there's even evidence that <eol> as early as 350 AD, <eob> people deliberately fermented foodstuffs <eol> that contained antibiotics. <eob>
The skeletal remains <eol> of some Sudanese Nubian <eob> were found to contain significant <eol> deposits of tetracycline. <eob>
That's an antibiotic <eol> that we use in modern medicine today. <eob>
And nearly 1500 years later, <eob> Alexander Fleming discovered <eol> the antimicrobial properties of mold. <eob>
And it was only through <eol> the industrialized fermentation of penicillin <eob> that millions could survive <eol> infectious diseases. <eob>
Fermentation could once again <eol> play an important role <eob> in our human development. <eob>
Could it represent a new mode of survival <eob> if we harness it to completely change <eol> our industries? <eob>
I've worked in my creative career <eol> to develop new material systems <eob> for the textile industry. <eob>
And while it is work that I love, <eob> I cannot reconcile <eol> with the fact that the textile industry <eob> is one of the most polluting in the world. <eob>
Most of the ecological harm <eol> caused by textile processing <eob> occurs at the finishing <eol> and the dyeing stage. <eob>
Processing textiles <eol> requires huge amounts of water. <eob>
And since the oil age completely <eol> transformed the textile industry, <eob> many of the materials <eob> and the chemicals used to process them <eol> are petroleum based. <eob>
And so coupled with our insatiable appetite <eol> for fast fashion, <eob> a huge amount of textile waste <eol> is ending up in landfill every year <eob> because it remains <eol> notoriously difficult to recycle. <eob>
So again, contrast this with biology. <eob>
Evolved over 3.8 billion years, <eob> to rapid prototype, <eob> to recycle and to replenish <eob> better than any system <eol> we've ever engineered. <eob>
I was inspired by this immense potential <eob> and wanted to explore it <eol> through a seemingly simple question -- <eob> at the time. <eob>
If a bacteria produces a pigment, <eob> how do we work with it to dye textiles? <eob>
Well, one of my favorite ways <eob> is to grow Streptomyces <eol> coelicolor directly onto silk. <eob>
You can see how each colony produces pigment <eol> around its own territory. <eob>
Now, if you add many, many cells, <eob> they generate enough dyestuff <eol> to saturate the entire cloth. <eob>
Now, the magical thing about dyeing <eol> textiles in this way -- <eob> this sort of direct fermentation <eob> when you add the bacteria <eol> directly onto the silk -- <eob> is that to dye one t-shirt, <eob> the bacteria survive <eol> on just 200 milliliters of water. <eob>
And you can see how this process <eol> generates very little runoff <eob> and produces a colorfast pigment <eol> without the use of any chemicals. <eob>
So now you're thinking -- <eob> and you're thinking right -- <eob> an inherent problem associated <eol> with designing with a living system is: <eob> How do you guide a medium <eol> that has a life force of its own? <eob>
Well, once you've established the baseline <eol> for cultivating Streptomyces <eob> so that it consistently produces enough pigment, <eob> you can turn to twisting, folding, <eob> clamping, dipping, spraying, <eob> submerging -- <eob> all of these begin to inform the aesthetics <eol> of coelicolor's activity. <eob>
And using them in a systematic way <eob> enables us to be able <eol> to generate an organic pattern ... <eob> a uniform dye ... <eob> and even a graphic print. <eob>
Another problem is how to scale <eol> these artisanal methods of making <eob> so that we can start to use them in industry. <eob>
When we talk about scale, <eob> we consider two things in parallel: <eob> scaling the biology, <eob> and then scaling the tools <eol> and the processes <eob> required to work with the biology. <eob>
If we can do this, <eob> then we can move what happens <eol> on a petri dish <eob> so that it can meet the human scale, <eob> and then hopefully <eol> the architecture of our environments. <eob>
If Fleming were alive today, <eob> this would definitely be <eol> a part of his toolkit. <eob>
You're looking at our current best guess <eob> of how to scale biology. <eob>
It's a bioreactor; <eob> a kind of microorganism <eol> brewery that contains yeasts <eob> that have been engineered <eol> to produce specific commodity chemicals and compounds <eob> like fragrances and flavors. <eob>
It's actually connected to a suite <eol> of automated hardware and software <eob> that read in real time <eob> and feed back to a design team <eol> the growth conditions of the microbe. <eob>
So we can use this system <eol> to model the growth characteristics <eob> of an organism <eol> like coelicolor <eob> to see how it would ferment <eol> at 50,000 liters. <eob>
I'm currently based at Ginkgo Bioworks, <eob> which is a biotechnology startup in Boston. <eob>
I am working to see <eol> how their platform for scaling biology <eob> interfaces with my artisanal methods <eol> of designing with bacteria for textiles. <eob>
We're doing things like engineering <eol> Streptomyces coelicolor <eob> to see if it can produce more pigment. <eob>
And we're even looking <eol> at the tools for synthetic biology. <eob>
Tools that have been designed <eol> specifically to automate synthetic biology <eob> to see how they could adapt to become tools <eol> to print and dye textiles. <eob>
I'm also leveraging digital fabrication, <eob> because the tools that I need <eol> to work with Streptomyces coelicolor <eob> don't actually exist. <eob>
So in this case -- <eob> in the last week actually, <eob> I've just designed a petri dish <eob> that is engineered to produce a bespoke <eol> print on a whole garment. <eob>
We're making lots of kimonos. <eob>
Here's the exciting thing: <eob> I'm not alone. <eob>
There are others who are <eol> building capacity in this field, <eob> like MycoWorks. <eob>
MycoWorks is a startup <eob> that wants to replace animal <eol> leather with mushroom leather, <eob> a versatile, high-performance material <eob> that has applications beyond textiles <eol> and into product and architecture. <eob>
And Bolt Threads -- <eob> they've engineered a yeast <eol> to produce spider-silk protein <eob> that can be spun into a highly programmable yarn. <eob>
So think water resistance, <eob> stretchability and superstrength. <eob>
To reach economies of scale, <eob> these kinds of startups <eol> are having to build and design <eob> and engineer the infrastructure <eol> to work with biology. <eob>
For example, <eob> Bolt Threads have had to engage <eol> in some extreme biomimicry. <eob>
To be able to spin the product <eol> this yeast creates into a yarn, <eob> they've engineered a yarn-making machine <eob> that mimics the physiological conditions <eob> under which spiders ordinarily spin <eol> their own silk. <eob>
So you can start to see <eol> how imaginative <eob> and inspiring modes of making exist in nature <eob> that we can use to build capacity <eol> around new bio-based industries. <eob>
What we now have is the technology <eob> to design, build, test <eol> and scale these capabilities. <eob>
At this present moment, <eob> as we face the ecological crisis <eol> in front of us, <eob> what we have to do is to determine <eob> how we're going to build <eol> these new material systems <eob> so that they don't mirror the damaging <eol> legacies of the oil age. <eob>
How we're going to distribute them <eol> to ensure a sustainable development <eob> that is fair and equitable <eol> across the world. <eob>
And crucially, how we would like the regulatory <eol> and ethical frameworks <eob> that govern these technologies <eob> to interact with our society. <eob>
Biotechnology is going to touch <eol> every part of our lived experience. <eob>
It is living; <eob> it is digital; <eob> it is designed, and it can be crafted. <eob>
This is a material future <eol> that we must be bold enough to shape. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Two years ago, I set off <eol> from central London on the Tube <eob> and ended up somewhere in the east of the city <eob> walking into a self-storage unit <eob> to meet a guy that had 2,000 luxury <eol> polo shirts for sale. <eob> And as I made my way down the corridor, <eob> a broken, blinking light made it just like the cliche scene <eob> from a gangster movie. <eob>
Our man was early, and he was waiting for me <eob> in front of a unit secured <eol> with four padlocks down the side. <eob>
On our opening exchange, <eob> it was like a verbal sparring match <eob> where he threw the first punches. <eob> Who was I? Did I have a business card? <eob> And where was I going to sell? <eob>
And then, he just started opening up, <eob> and it was my turn. <eob>
Where were the polo shirts coming from? <eob>
What paperwork did he have? <eob>
And when was his next shipment <eol> going to arrive? <eob>
I was treading the fine line <eob> between asking enough questions <eol> to get what I needed <eob> and not enough for him <eol> to become suspicious, <eob> because what he didn't know is that <eol> I'm a counterfeit investigator, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and after 20 minutes or so <eol> of checking over the product <eob> for the telltale signs of counterfeit production -- <eob> say, badly stitched labels <eol> or how the packaging <eob> had a huge brand logo stamped <eol> all over the front of it -- <eob> I was finally on my way out, <eob> but not before he insisted on walking down <eol> to the street with me <eob> and back to the station. <eob>
And the feeling after these meetings <eol> is always the same: <eob> my heart is beating like a drum, <eob> because you never know <eol> if they've actually bought your story, <eob> or they're going to start following you <eol> to see who you really are. <eob>
Relief only comes <eol> when you turn the first corner <eob> and glance behind, <eol> and they're not standing there. <eob>
But what our counterfeit polo shirt <eol> seller certainly didn't realize <eob> is that everything I'd seen and heard would result <eol> in a dawn raid on his house, <eob> him being woken out of bed <eol> by eight men on his doorstep <eob> and all his product seized. <eob>
But this would reveal <eol> that he was just a pawn <eob> at the end of a counterfeiting <eol> network spanning three continents, <eob> and he was just the first loose thread <eol> that I'd started to pull on <eob> in the hope that it would all unravel. <eob>
Why go through all that trouble? <eob>
Well, maybe counterfeiting <eol> is a victimless crime? <eob>
These big companies, <eol> they make enough money, <eob> so if anything, <eob> counterfeiting is just a free form <eol> of advertising, right? <eob>
And consumers believe just that -- <eob> that the buying and selling of fakes <eol> is not that big a deal. <eob> But I'm here to tell you that <eol> that is just not true. <eob>
What the tourist on holiday <eol> doesn't see about those fake handbags <eob> is they may well have been stitched together <eob> by a child who was trafficked away <eol> from her family, <eob> and what the car repair shop owner doesn't realize <eob> about those fake brake pads <eob> is they may well be lining the pockets <eol> of an organized crime gang <eob> involved in drugs and prostitution. <eob>
And while those two things <eol> are horrible to think about, <eob> it gets much worse, <eob> because counterfeiting <eol> is even funding terrorism. <eob>
Let that sink in for a moment. <eob> Terrorists are selling fakes <eol> to fund attacks, <eob> attacks in our cities <eol> that try to make victims of all of us. <eob>
You wouldn't buy a live scorpion, <eob> because there's a chance <eol> that it would sting you on the way home, <eob> but would you still buy a fake handbag <eob> if you knew the profits <eol> would enable someone to buy bullets <eob> that would kill you and other innocent people <eol> six months later? <eob> Maybe not. <eob>
OK, time to come clean. <eob>
In my youth -- <eob> yeah, I might look like I'm still clinging on to it a bit -- <eob> I bought fake watches while on holiday <eol> in the Canary Islands. <eob>
But why do I tell you this? <eob>
Well, we've all done it, <eob> or we know someone that's done it. <eob>
And until this very moment, maybe <eol> you didn't think twice about it, <eob> and nor did I, <eob> until I answered a 20-word <eol> cryptic advert <eob> to become an intellectual property investigator. <eob>
It said "Full training given <eol> and some international travel." <eob> Within a week, I was creating <eol> my first of many aliases, <eob> and in the 10 years since, <eol> I've investigated fake car parts, <eob> alloy wheels, fake pet grooming tools, <eob> fake bicycle parts, <eob> and, of course, the counterfeiter's favorite, <eob> fake luxury leather goods, clothing and shoes. <eob>
And what I've learned in the 10 years <eol> of investigating fakes <eob> is that once you start <eol> to scratch the surface, <eob> you find that they are rotten <eol> to the core, <eob> as are the people and organizations <eol> that are making money from them, <eob> because they are profiting <eol> on a massive, massive scale. <eob>
You can only make around a hundred to 200 percent <eob> selling drugs on the street. <eob>
You can make 2,000 percent selling fakes online <eob> with little of the same risks <eol> or penalties. <eob>
And this quick, easy money <eob> then goes on to fund <eol> the more serious types of crime, <eob> and it pays the way to making these organizations, <eob> these criminal organizations, look more legitimate. <eob>
So let me bring you in on a live case. <eob> Earlier this year, <eol> a series of raids took place <eob> in one of my longest-running investigations. <eob>
Five warehouses <eol> were raided in Turkey, <eob> and over two million finished counterfeit <eol> clothing products were seized, <eob> and it took 16 trucks <eol> to take that all away. <eob>
But this gang had been clever. <eob>
They had gone to the lengths of creating <eol> their own fashion brands, <eob> complete with registered trademarks, <eob> and even having photo shoots <eol> on yachts in Italy. <eob>
And they would use these completely unheard-of <eol> and unsuspicious brand names <eob> as a way of shipping container loads of fakes <eob> to shell companies <eol> that they'd set up across Europe. <eob>
And documents found during those raids <eob> found that they'd been falsifying shipping documents <eob> so the customs officials <eol> would literally have no idea <eob> who had sent the products <eol> in the first place. <eob>
When police got access <eol> to just one bank account, <eob> they found nearly three million euros <eob> had been laundered out of Spain <eol> in less than two years, <eob> and just two days <eol> after those raids, <eob> that gang were trying <eol> to bribe a law firm to get their stock back. <eob>
Even now, we have no idea <eol> where all that money went, <eob> to who it went to, <eob> but you can bet it's never going to benefit <eol> the likes of you or me. <eob>
But these aren't just low-level <eol> street thugs. <eob>
They're business professionals, <eol> and they fly first class. <eob>
They trick legitimate businesses <eob> with convincing fake invoices <eol> and paperwork, <eob> so everything just seems real, <eob> and then they set up eBay and Amazon accounts <eob> just to compete with the people <eol> they've already sold fakes to. <eob>
But this isn't just happening online. <eob>
For a few years, I also used <eol> to attend automotive trade shows <eob> taking place in huge exhibition spaces, <eob> but away from the Ferraris <eol> and the Bentleys and the flashing lights, <eob> there'd be companies selling fakes: <eob> companies with a brochure on the counter <eob> and another one underneath, <eol> if you ask them the right questions. <eob>
And they would sell me fake car parts, <eol> faulty fake car parts <eob> that have been estimated <eol> to cause over 36,000 fatalities, <eob> deaths on our roads each year. <eob>
Counterfeiting is set to become <eob> a 2.3-trillion-dollar <eol> underground economy, <eob> and the damage that can be done <eol> with that kind of money, <eob> it's really frightening ... <eob> because fakes fund terror. <eob>
Fake trainers on the streets of Paris, <eob> fake cigarettes in West Africa, <eob> and pirate music CDs in the USA <eob> have all gone on to fund <eol> trips to training camps, <eob> bought weapons and ammunition, <eol> or the ingredients for explosives. <eob>
In June 2014, the French security services <eob> stopped monitoring <eol> the communications of Said and Cherif Kouachi, <eob> the two brothers who had been on <eol> a terror watch list for three years. <eob>
But that summer, <eol> they were only picking up that Cherif was buying <eob> fake trainers from China, <eob> so it signaled a shift away from extremism <eob> into what was considered <eol> a low-level petty crime. <eob>
The threat had gone away. <eob>
Seven months later, <eob> the two brothers walked into <eol> the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine <eob> and killed 12 people, wounded 11 more, <eob> with guns from the proceeds of those fakes. <eob>
So whatever you think, this isn't a faraway <eol> problem happening in China. <eob> It's happening right here. <eob>
And Paris is not unique. <eob>
Ten years earlier, in 2004, 191 people lost their lives <eob> when a Madrid commuter train <eol> was bombed. <eob>
The attack had been partly funded <eol> by the sale of pirate music CDs in the US. <eob>
Two years prior to that, an Al Qaeda training manual <eob> recommended explicitly selling fakes <eob> as a good way of supporting terror cells. <eob>
But despite this, despite the evidence <eol> connecting terrorism and counterfeiting, <eob> we do go on buying them, increasing the demand <eob> to the point where <eol> there's even a store in Turkey <eob> called "I Love Genuine Fakes." <eob> And you have tourists posing with photographs <eol> on TripAdvisor, <eob> giving it five-star reviews. <eob>
But would those same tourists <eol> have gone into a store <eob> called "I Love Genuine Fake Viagra Pills" <eob> or "I Genuinely Love Funding Terrorism"? <eob> I doubt it. <eob>
Many of us think <eol> that we're completely helpless <eob> against organized crime and terrorism, <eob> that we can do nothing about the next attack, <eob> but I believe you can. <eob>
You can by becoming investigators, too. <eob>
The way we cripple these networks <eol> is to cut their funding, <eob> and that means cutting the demand <eob> and changing this idea <eol> that it's a victimless crime. <eob>
Let's all identify counterfeiters, <eob> and don't give them our money. <eob>
So here's a few tips <eol> from one investigator to another <eob> to get you started. <eob>
Number one: <eob> here's a typical online counterfeiter's website. <eob> Note the URL. <eob> If you're shopping for sunglasses or camera lenses, say, <eob> and you come across a website <eol> like medical-insurance-bankruptcy.com, <eob> start to get very suspicious. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Counterfeiters register expired domain names <eob> as a way of keeping up <eol> the old website's Google page ranking. <eob>
Number two: <eob> is the website screaming at you that everything <eol> is 100 percent genuine, <eob> but still giving you 75 percent <eol> off the latest collection? <eob>
Look for words like "master copy," <eob> "overruns," "straight from the factory." <eob> They could write this all in Comic Sans, <eol> it's that much of a joke. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Number three: <eob> if you get as far as the checkout page, <eob> and you don't see "https" or a padlock symbol next to the URL, <eob> you should really start thinking <eol> about closing the tab, <eob> because these indicate active security measures <eob> that will keep your personal <eol> and credit card information safe. <eob>
OK, last one: <eob> go hunting for the "Contact Us" page. <eob>
If you can only find <eol> a generic webform, <eob> no company name, telephone number, <eol> email address, postal address -- <eob> that's it, case closed. <eob>
You found a counterfeiter. <eob>
Sadly, you're going to have <eol> to go back to Google <eob> and start your shopping search all over again, <eob> but you didn't get ripped off, <eol> so that's only a good thing. <eob>
As the world's most famous <eol> fictional detective would say, <eob> "Watson, the game is afoot." <eob> Only this time, my investigator friends, <eob> the game is painfully real. <eob>
So the next time you're shopping online, <eob> or perhaps wherever it is, <eob> look closer, question a little bit <eol> deeper, and ask yourself -- <eob> before you hand over the cash <eol> or click "Buy," <eob> "Am I sure this is real?" <eob> Tell your friend that used <eol> to buy counterfeit watches <eob> that he may just have brought the next attack <eol> one day closer. <eob>
And, if you see <eol> an Instagram advert for fakes, <eob> don't keep scrolling past, <eob> report it to the platform <eol> as a scam. <eob>
Let's shine a light on the dark <eol> forces of counterfeiting <eob> that are hiding <eol> in plain sight. <eob>
So please, spread the word <eob> and don't stop investigating. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I must have been about 12 years old <eob> when my dad took me <eol> to an exhibition on space, <eob> not far from here, in Brussels. <eob>
And the year was about -- <eol> I think it was 1988, <eob> so it was the end of the Cold War. <eob>
There was a bit of an upmanship <eol> going on between the Americans and the Russians <eob> bringing bits to that exhibition. <eob>
NASA brought a big blow-up space shuttle, <eob> but the Russians, <eol> they brought a Mir space station. <eob>
It was actually the training module, <eob> and you could go inside <eol> and check it all out. <eob>
It was the real thing -- <eob> where the buttons were, <eol> where the wires were, <eob> where the astronauts were eating, <eol> where they were working. <eob>
And when I came home, <eob> the first thing I did, <eol> I started drawing spaceships. <eob>
Now, these weren't science <eol> fiction spaceships, no. <eob>
They were actually technical drawings. <eob>
They were cutaway sections <eob> of what kind of structure <eol> would be made out of, <eob> where the wires were, <eol> where the screws were. <eob>
So fortunately, I didn't become <eol> a space engineer, <eob> but I did become an architect. <eob>
These are some of the projects <eol> that I've been involved with <eob> over the last decade and a half. <eob>
All these projects are quite different, <eol> quite different shapes, <eob> and it is because they are built <eol> for different environments. <eob>
They have different constraints. <eob>
And I think design <eol> becomes really interesting <eob> when you get really harsh constraints. <eob>
Now, these projects have been <eol> all over the world. <eob> A few years ago, this map <eol> wasn't good enough. <eob>
It was too small. <eob>
We had to add this one, <eob> because we were going to do <eol> a project on the Moon <eob> for the European Space Agency; <eob> they asked us to design <eol> a Moon habitat -- <eob> and one on Mars with NASA, <eob> a competition to look <eol> at a habitation on Mars. <eob>
Whenever you go to another place, <eob> as an architect <eob> and try to design something, <eob> you look at the local architecture, <eol> the precedents that are there. <eob>
Now, on the Moon, it's kind <eol> of difficult, of course, <eob> because there's only this. <eob>
There's only the Apollo missions. <eob>
So last that we went there, <eol> I wasn't even born yet, <eob> and we only spent about three days there. <eob>
So for me, that's kind of a long camping trip, <eol> isn't it, <eob> but a rather expensive one. <eob>
Now, the tricky thing, <eob> when you're going to build <eol> on another planet or a moon, <eob> is how to get it there, how to get it there. <eob>
So first of all, <eob> to get a kilogram, for example, <eol> to the Moon's surface, <eob> it will cost about 200,000 dollars, <eob> very expensive. <eob>
So you want to keep it very light. <eob> Second, space. Space is limited. Right? <eob> This is the Ariane 5 rocket. <eob>
The space you have there <eob> is about four and a half meters <eol> by seven meters, not that much. <eob>
So it needs to be an architectural system <eob> that is both compact, <eol> or compactable, and light, <eob> and I think I've got one right here. <eob>
It's very compact, <eob> and it's very light. <eob>
And actually, <eob> this is one I made earlier. <eob>
Now, there's one problem with it, <eob> that inflatables <eob> are quite fragile. <eob>
They need to be protected, <eob> specifically, when you go to a very <eol> harsh environment like the Moon. <eob>
Look at it like this. <eob>
The temperature difference on a Moon base <eob> could be anything up to 200 degrees. <eob>
On one side of the base, <eol> it could be 100 degrees Celsius <eob> and on the other side, <eol> it could be minus 100 degrees. <eob>
We need to protect ourselves from that. <eob>
The Moon also does not <eol> have any magnetic fields, <eob> which means that any radiation -- <eol> solar radiation, cosmic radiation -- <eob> will hit the surface. <eob>
We need to protect ourselves from that <eob> as well, <eob> protect the astronauts from that. <eob>
And then third, <eob> but definitely not last, <eob> the Moon does not have <eol> any atmosphere, <eob> which means any meteorites coming into it <eol> will not get burned up, <eob> and they'll hit the surface. <eob>
That's why the Moon is full of craters. <eob>
Again, we need to <eob> protect the astronauts from that. <eob>
So what kind of structure do we need? <eob>
Well, the best thing <eol> is really a cave, <eob> because a cave has a lot of mass, <eol> and we need mass. <eob>
We need mass to protect ourselves <eol> from the temperatures, <eob> from the radiation <eob> and from the meteorites. <eob>
So this is how we solved it. <eob>
We have indeed the blue part, <eol> as you can see. <eob>
That's an inflatable for our Moon base. <eob>
It gives a lot of living space <eol> and a lot of lab space, <eob> and attached to it <eol> you have a cylinder, <eob> and that has all the support structures in, <eob> all the life support and also the airlock. <eob>
And on top of that, we have a structure, <eol> that domed structure, <eob> that protects ourselves, <eob> has a lot of mass in it. <eob>
Where are we going to get <eol> this material from? <eob>
Are we going to bring concrete and <eol> cement from Earth to the Moon? <eob>
Well, of course not, because <eol> it's way too heavy. <eob>
It's too expensive. <eob>
So we're going to go <eol> and use local materials. <eob>
Now, local materials are something <eol> we deal with on Earth as well. <eob>
Wherever we build or whatever <eol> country we build in, <eob> we always look at, what are the local materials here? <eob>
The problem with the Moon is, <eol> what are the local materials? <eob>
Well, there's not that many. <eob>
Actually, we have one. <eob>
It's moondust, <eob> or, fancier scientific name, <eol> regolith, Moon regolith. <eob>
Great thing is, it's everywhere, right? <eob>
The surface is covered with it. <eob>
It's about 20 centimeters up <eol> to a few meters everywhere. <eob>
But how are we going to build with it? <eob>
Well, we're going to use a 3D printer. <eob>
Whenever I ask any of you <eol> what a 3D printer is, <eob> you're probably all thinking, well, <eol> probably something about this size <eob> and it would print things <eol> that are about this size. <eob>
So of course I'm not going <eol> to bring a massive 3D printer to the Moon <eob> to print my Moon base. <eob>
I'm going to use a much smaller <eol> device, something like this one here. <eob>
So this is a small device, <eol> a small robot rover, <eob> that has a little scoop, <eob> and it brings the regolith to the dome <eob> and then it lays down a thin layer <eol> of regolith, <eob> and then you would have the robot <eol> that will solidify it, <eob> layer by layer, <eob> until it creates, after a few months, <eob> the full base. <eob>
You might have noticed <eob> that it's quite a particular structure <eol> that we're printing, <eob> and I've got a little example here. <eob>
What we call this is a closed-cell <eol> foam structure. <eob> Looks quite natural. <eob> The reason why we're using this <eob> as part of that shell structure <eob> is that we only need to solidify certain parts, <eob> which means we have to bring <eol> less binder from Earth, <eob> and it becomes much lighter. <eob>
Now -- <eob> that approach of designing something <eob> and then covering it <eol> with a protective dome <eob> we also did for our Mars project. <eob>
You can see it here, three domes. <eob>
And you see the printers <eol> printing these dome structures. <eob>
There's a big difference <eol> between Mars and the Moon, <eob> and let me explain it. <eob>
This diagram shows you to scale <eob> the size of Earth and the Moon <eol> and the real distance, <eob> about 400,000 kilometers. <eob>
If we then go to Mars, <eob> the distance from Mars to Earth -- <eob> and this picture here <eob> is taken by the rover on Mars, Curiosity, <eol> looking back at Earth. <eob>
You kind of see the little speckle there, <eol> that's Earth, 400 million kilometers away. <eob>
The problem with that distance <eob> is that it's a thousand times <eol> the distance of the Earth to the Moon, pretty far away, <eob> but there's no direct radio contact with, <eol> for example, the Curiosity rover. <eob>
So I cannot teleoperate it from Earth. <eob>
I can't say, "Oh, Mars rover, go left," <eob> because that signal would take 20 minutes <eol> to get to Mars. <eob>
Then the rover might go left, <eob> and then it will take another 20 minutes <eol> before it can tell me, <eob> "Oh yeah, I went left." <eob> So the distance, <eob> so rovers and robots <eob> and going to have to work autonomously. <eob>
The only issue with it <eob> is that missions to Mars are highly risky. <eob>
We've only seen it a few weeks ago. <eob>
So what if half the mission <eol> doesn't arrive at Mars. <eob> What do we do? <eob>
Well, instead of building <eol> just one or two rovers <eob> like we did on the Moon, <eob> we're going to build <eol> hundreds of them. <eob>
And it's a bit like a termite's <eol> mound, you know? <eob>
Termites, I would take half <eol> of the colony of the termites away, <eob> they would still be able <eol> to build the mound. <eob>
It might take a little bit longer. <eob> Same here. <eob> If half of our rovers or robots <eol> don't arrive, <eob> well, it will take a bit longer, <eol> but you will still be able to do it. <eob>
So here we even have <eol> three different rovers. <eob>
In the back, you see the digger. <eob>
It's really good at digging regolith. <eob>
Then we have the transporter, <eob> great at taking regolith <eol> and bringing it to the structure. <eob>
And the last ones, <eol> the little ones with the little legs, <eob> they don't need to move a lot. <eob>
What they do is they go <eol> and sit on a layer of regolith <eob> and then microwave it together, <eob> and <eob> layer by layer <eob> create that dome structure. <eob>
Now — <eob> we also want to try that out, <eob> so we went out on a road trip, <eob> and we created our own swarm of robots. <eob> There you go. <eob> So we built 10 of those. <eob>
It's a small swarm. <eob>
And we took six tons of sand, <eob> and we tried out how these little robots <eob> would actually be able to move <eol> sand around, <eob> Earth sand in this case. <eob>
And they were not teleoperated. Right? <eob> Nobody was telling them go left, go right, or giving them a predescribed path. <eob> No. They were given a task: <eob> move sand from this area to that area. <eob>
And if they came across <eol> an obstacle, like a rock, <eob> they had to sort it out themselves. <eob>
Or they came across another robot, <eob> they had to be able to make decisions. <eob>
Or even if half of them fell out, <eol> their batteries died, <eob> they still had to be able <eol> to finish that task. <eob>
Now, I've talked about redundancy. <eob>
But that was not only with the robots. <eob>
It was also with the habitats. <eob>
On the Mars project, we decided <eol> to do three domes, <eob> because if one didn't arrive, <eob> the other two could still form a base, <eob> and that was mainly because each of the domes <eob> actually have a life support system <eol> built in the floor, <eob> so they can work independently. <eob>
So in a way, you might think, <eol> well, this is pretty crazy. <eob>
Why would you, <eob> as an architect, <eob> get involved in space? <eob>
Because it's such a technical field. <eob>
Well, I'm actually really convinced <eob> that from a creative view or a design view, <eob> you are able to solve <eol> really hard and really constrained problems. <eob>
And I really feel that there is a place <eol> for design and architecture <eob> in projects like interplanetary habitation. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Joan Blades: Do you have politically <eol> diverse friends? <eob>
What do you talk about with them? <eob>
I'm a progressive; I live in a town <eol> full of progressives, <eob> and 15 years ago, <eol> I didn't have any conservative friends. <eob>
Now I have a wonderful mix of friends, <eob> and they include John. <eob>
John Gable: I am not a progressive. <eob>
I'm a Republican <eol> who grew up in a Republican family <eob> in the conservative South, <eob> and even worked in Republican politics, <eol> locally and at the national level. <eob>
But the last 24 years, <eol> I've been in technology <eob> and living in a very progressive area. <eob>
So I have a lot of progressive friends, <eob> including Joan. <eob>
JB: I was born in Berkeley, California, <eob> a notoriously progressive college town. <eob>
And I live there now. <eob>
In 1998, six months <eol> into the Monica Lewinsky-Clinton impeachment scandal, <eob> I helped cofound MoveOn.org <eol> with a one-sentence petition: <eob> "Congress must immediately censure the president <eob> and move on to pressing <eol> issues facing the nation." <eob> Now, that was actually a very unifying petition in many ways. <eob>
You could love Clinton or hate Clinton <eob> and agree that the best thing <eol> for the country was to move on. <eob>
As the leader of MoveOn, <eol> I saw the polarization just continue. <eob>
And I found myself wondering <eob> why I saw things so differently <eob> than many people <eol> in other parts of the country. <eob>
So in 2005, when I had an opportunity <eol> to get together with grassroots leaders <eob> across the political divide, <eob> I grabbed it. <eob>
And I became friends with a lot of people <eob> I never had a chance to talk to before. <eob>
And that included leadership <eol> in the Christian Coalition, <eob> often seen as on the right the way MoveOn <eol> is seen as on the left. <eob>
And this lead to me showing up <eol> on Capitol Hill <eob> with one of the Christian Coalition leaders, my friend, <eob> to lobby for net neutrality. <eob> That was powerful. <eob> We turned heads. <eob> So this work was transformational for me. <eob>
And I found myself wondering <eob> How could vast numbers <eol> of people have the opportunity <eob> to really connect with people <eol> that have very different views? <eob>
JG: I was born Oneida, Tennessee, <eob> right across the state border <eol> from a small coal mining town, <eob> Stearns, Kentucky. <eob>
And I lived there for the first <eol> few years of my life, <eob> before moving to another small town, <eol> Frankfort, Kentucky. <eob>
Basically, I grew up in small-town America, <eob> conservative at its heart. <eob>
Now, Stearns and Berkeley -- <eol> they're a little different. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So in the '90s I moved out <eol> west to a progressive area <eob> to work in technology -- <eob> worked at Microsoft, worked at Netscape. <eob>
I actually became the product manager <eol> lead for Netscape Navigator, <eob> the first popular web browser. <eob>
Now in the early days of the internet, <eob> we were just moved <eol> and inspired by a vision: <eob> when we're connected to all these <eol> different people around the world <eob> and all these different ideas, <eob> we'll be able to make great decisions, <eob> and we'll be able to appreciate <eol> each other <eob> for the beautiful diversity <eol> that the whole world has to offer. <eob>
Now I also, 20 years ago, <eol> gave a speech <eob> saying it might not work <eol> out that way, <eob> that we might actually be trained <eol> to discriminate against each other <eob> in new ways. <eob>
So what happened? <eob> It's not like we just woke up one day and decided <eol> to hate each other more. <eob>
Here's what happened. <eob>
There's just too much noise -- <eol> too many people, too many ideas -- <eob> so we use technology to filter it out a little bit. <eob> And what happens? <eob> It lets in ideas <eol> I already agree with. <eob>
It lets in the popular ideas, <eob> it lets in people just like me <eol> who think just like me. <eob>
That sounds kind of good, right? <eob>
Well, not necessarily, <eob> because two very scary things happen <eob> when we have such narrow worldviews. <eob>
First, we become <eol> more extreme in our beliefs. <eob>
Second, we become less tolerant of anybody <eol> who's different than we are. <eob> Does this sound familiar? <eob> Does this sound like modern America? <eol> The modern world? <eob>
Well, the good news <eol> is that technology is changing, <eob> and it could change for the better. <eob>
And that's, in fact, why I started AllSides.com -- <eob> to create technologies and services to free us <eol> from these filter bubbles. <eob>
The very first thing we did was create <eol> technology that identifies bias, <eob> so we could show different perspectives side by side <eob> to free us from the filter bubbles <eol> of news media. <eob>
And then I met Joan. <eob>
JB: So I met John <eol> outside of Washington, DC, <eob> with an idealistic group <eol> of cross-partisan bridge builders, <eob> and we wanted to re-weave <eol> the fabric of our communities. <eob>
We believe that our differences <eol> can be a strength, <eob> that our values <eol> can be complimentary <eob> and that we have to overcome the fight <eob> so that we can honor everyone's values <eob> and not lose any of our own. <eob>
I went for this wonderful walk with John, <eob> where I started learning <eol> about the work he was doing <eob> to pierce the filter bubble. <eob>
It was powerful; <eob> it was brilliant. <eob>
Living in separate narratives is not good. <eob>
We can't even have a conversation <eol> or do collaborative problem-solving <eob> when we don't share the same facts. <eob>
JG: So one thing <eol> you take away from today <eob> is if Joan Blades <eol> asks you to go on a walk, <eob> go on that walk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It changed things. It really changed <eol> the way I was thinking about things. <eob>
To free ourselves <eol> from the filter bubbles, <eob> we can't just think about <eol> information filter bubbles, <eob> but also relationship and social filter bubbles. <eob>
You see, we human beings -- we're not nearly <eol> as smart as we think we are. <eob>
We don't generally make decisions intellectually. <eob> We make them emotionally, intuitively, <eob> and then we use <eol> our big old brains <eob> to rationalize anything <eol> we want to rationalize. <eob>
We're not really like Vulcans like Mr. Spock, <eob> we're more like bold cowboys <eol> like Captain Kirk, <eob> or passionate idealists <eol> like Dr. McCoy. <eob>
OK, for those of y'all who prefer <eol> the new "Star Trek" crew, <eob> here you go. <eob>
JB: Don't forget the strong women! <eob>
JG: Come on, strong women. OK. <eob>
JB: All right. <eob>
John and I are both "Star Trek" fans. <eob>
What's not to love about a future <eol> with that kind of optimism? <eob>
JG: And having a good future <eol> in mind is a big deal -- very important. <eob>
And understanding what the problem <eol> is is very important. <eob>
But we have to do something. <eob> So what do we do? <eob> It's actually not that hard. <eob>
We have to add diversity to our lives -- <eob> not just information, <eol> but relationship diversity. <eob>
And by diversity, <eol> I mean big "D" diversity, <eob> not just racial and gender, <eol> which are very important, <eob> but also... <eob> diversity of age, like young and old; <eob> rural and urban; <eob> liberal and conservative; <eob> in the US, Democrat and Republican. <eob>
Now, one of the great examples <eol> of somebody freeing themselves <eob> from their filter bubbles <eob> and getting a more diverse life <eob> is, once again, next to me -- Joan. <eob>
JB: So the question is: <eob> Who among you has had relationships <eol> lost or harmed <eob> due to differences in politics, religion or whatever? <eob> Raise your hands. <eob> Yeah. <eob> This year I have talked to so many people <eob> that have experienced <eol> that kind of loss. <eob>
I've seen tears well up in people's eyes <eol> as they talk about family members <eob> from whom they're estranged. <eob>
Living Room Conversations were designed <eob> to begin to heal political <eol> and personal differences. <eob>
They're simple conversations <eob> where two friends <eol> with different viewpoints each invite two friends <eob> for structured conversation, <eob> where everyone's agreed to some <eol> simple ground rules: <eob> curiosity, listening, respect, taking turns -- <eob> everything we learned in kindergarten, right? <eob> Really easy. <eob> So by the time you're talking <eol> about the topic you've agreed to talk about, <eob> you actually have the sense that, <eob> "You know, I kind of like this person," <eob> and you listen to each other differently. <eob>
That's kind of a human condition; <eob> we listen differently to people <eol> we care about. <eob>
And then there's reflection <eob> and possibly next steps. <eob>
This is a deep listening practice; <eob> it's never a debate. <eob>
And that's incredibly powerful. <eob>
These conversations in our own living rooms <eob> with people who have different viewpoints <eob> are an incredible adventure. <eob>
We rediscover that we can respect <eol> and even love people <eob> that are different from us. <eob>
And it's powerful. <eob>
JG: So, what are you curious about? <eob>
JB: What's the conversation <eol> you yearn to have? <eob>
JG: Let's do this together. <eob> Together. <eob>
JB: Yes. <eob>
JB and JG: Thank you. <eob>
Imagine if your daily commute <eol> involved tens of kilometers <eob> on these kinds of roads, <eob> driving this kind of vehicle, <eob> without any nearby service stations <eol> or breakdown assistance. <eob>
For millions of drivers in many parts <eol> of Africa, this is the norm. <eob>
Since over 90 percent of passenger <eol> cars are imported, <eob> often used, <eob> they're just not designed <eol> for local usage. <eob>
High import duties often compound the problem, <eob> sometimes doubling <eol> the price of a car. <eob>
So most vehicles are either <eol> too expensive or too unreliable <eob> for the average consumer. <eob>
Well-designed vehicles <eol> are only part of the transport challenge, though. <eob>
For every 100 adults in Africa, <eob> less than five people <eol> actually own a vehicle. <eob>
Public transport is available, <eob> and in countries like Kenya, <eol> it's often run by local entrepreneurs <eob> using minivans like this. <eob>
But in most rural and peri-urban areas, <eob> it's fragmented and unreliable. <eob>
In more remote areas without transport, <eob> people have to walk, <eol> typically tens of kilometers, <eob> to get to school or collect clean drinking water <eob> or buy supplies from nearby markets. <eob>
Bad roads, disparate communities, <eol> low average income levels <eob> and inadequate vehicles <eob> all impair the transport system <eob> and ultimately constrain economic output. <eob>
Despite this constraint, the Pan-African economy <eol> is booming. <eob>
Combined GDP is already over two trillion dollars. <eob>
This is a massive commercial <eol> and social opportunity, <eob> not a helpless continent. <eob>
So why isn't there already <eol> something better? <eob>
Around the world, automotive is quarter <eol> the manufacturing sector. <eob>
But in Africa, it's generally <eol> been overlooked by carmakers, <eob> who are focused on larger, established markets <eob> and emerging economies like India and China. <eob>
This lack of industrialization, <eob> which itself creates <eob> a vicious-cycle barrier <eol> to the emergence of industry, <eob> has caused the dependence <eol> on imports. <eob>
There is a supply-demand disconnect, <eob> with the vast majority of automotive <eol> spending on the continent today, <eob> essentially funding an international <eol> network of car exporters <eob> instead of fueling the growth <eol> of local industry. <eob>
It's entirely possible <eol> to solve this disconnect, though, <eob> starting with products <eol> that people actually want. <eob>
And this is what motivated <eol> me to start Mobius, <eob> to build a vehicle in Africa, for Africa. <eob>
To us, this meant reimagining the car <eol> around the needs of the consumer, <eob> simplifying nonessential <eol> features like interior fixtures <eob> and investing in performance-critical systems <eol> like suspension <eob> to create durable and affordable vehicles <eob> built for purpose. <eob>
And <eob> built for purpose <eob> is exactly where we started <eob> with our first-generation model, Mobius II, <eob> which was designed as a really rugged, <eol> low-cost SUV, <eob> able to handle heavy loads <eol> and rough terrain reliably. <eob>
This launched in 2015, <eob> and we've now developed <eol> the next-generation version <eob> based on customer feedback. <eob>
For high stress and heavy loading, <eob> we engineered a sturdy steel space frame. <eob>
To handle acute vibration <eol> from rough roads, <eob> we ruggedized the suspension. <eob>
For potholes and uneven terrain, high ground <eol> clearance was a no-brainer. <eob>
And to make this something customers <eol> could actually be proud to drive in, <eob> we designed an aspirational body aesthetic. <eob>
Underpinning all of this, we simplified <eol> or eliminated components <eob> like parking sensors <eol> and automatic windows <eob> wherever we could, <eob> to keep costs low <eob> and sell this at half the price <eol> of a five-year-old SUV in Kenya today. <eob>
The new -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The new Mobius II launches in 2018. <eob>
And while durable, affordable vehicles <eol> like this are vital, <eob> a broader solution to immobility <eol> needs to go further. <eob>
Over the last decade, <eob> a transport-centric, shared economy <eol> has connected people across Africa <eob> with minivans, auto rickshaws <eol> and sedans. <eob>
It's just not operated <eol> very effectively or efficiently. <eob>
Enabling better access <eol> to transport is all about strengthening <eob> this public transit network, <eob> empowering local entrepreneurs <eol> who already offer similar services <eob> in their communities <eob> to operate these services more profitably <eol> and more widely. <eob>
With this aim, we're taking <eol> human-centered design a step further <eob> and developing a transport platform model, <eob> which enables owners to plug <eol> in different modules, <eob> like a goods cage or ambulance unit, <eob> and run other services like goods delivery <eol> or medical transport, <eob> as well as public transport. <eob>
Transportation services like <eol> this are the fundamental driver <eob> of logistics, trade, social services, <eob> access to education, health care <eol> and employment. <eob>
The transportation grid <eol> to physical economies <eob> is akin to the internet <eol> to virtual economies. <eob>
And the impact of increased mobility is only part <eol> of the potential here. <eob>
Since the late 1700s, <eol> the Industrial Revolution has catapulted <eob> the development of economies around the world <eob> into thriving societies. <eob>
Today, manufacturing is still the engine <eol> of economic growth and stability, <eob> even as new technologies <eol> have inevitably transformed the way we live. <eob>
Making stuff is important, <eob> especially for nation-states <eol> wanting to boost employment, <eob> increase skills and reduce import dependence. <eob>
But while few countries can skip <eol> this industrialized stage, <eob> many have negligible manufacturing output. <eob>
There are various reasons for this, <eob> but one reason is universal: <eol> hardware is hard. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So what are the challenges to industry, <eol> and how are we approaching them? <eob>
The first issue many people think <eol> of is a lack of skilled labor. <eob>
In areas where access to good primary <eol> and secondary education are limited <eob> and employment opportunities are scarce, <eob> a small skill base is inevitable. <eob>
But that doesn't mean it's immutable. <eob>
There's an abundance of smart, hardworking <eol> and ambitious people in Africa, <eob> obviously. <eob>
What's really lacking are good jobs <eob> that offer a path not just to employment <eol> but also professional growth. <eob>
The first person we employed <eol> at Mobius over six years ago <eob> was a mechanic named Kazungu. <eob>
Kazungu had gone to school <eol> up to the age of 18 <eob> and worked as an odd-job mechanic. <eob>
Joining the company at the time <eol> was a near-vertical learning curve. <eob>
But he rose to the challenge, <eob> and with more technical guidance <eol> from an expanding engineering team, <eob> he's grown over the years <eob> to lead a group of mechanics <eol> in R & amp; D prototyping. <eob> A thirst for learning and the work <eol> ethic to step up to a challenge <eob> are values we now recruit on. <eob>
Pairing innate values like this <eol> with on-the-job training and systems <eob> has strengthened our skill base. <eob>
This works really well <eol> on the production line, <eob> where work can be systematized <eol> around clear procedural instructions <eob> and then reinforced through training. <eob>
In our experience, it is possible <eol> to build a skilled workforce, <eob> and we plan to hire hundreds more people <eol> using this approach. <eob>
A second challenge is a lack of suppliers. <eob>
In countries like Kenya, there are only a handful <eol> of automotive suppliers <eob> manufacturing parts like electrical harnesses, <eol> seats and glass. <eob>
It's a burgeoning group, <eob> and without much demand from industry, <eob> most of these suppliers <eol> have no impetus to grow. <eob>
We've worked hard with a few of them <eol> to develop the capacity <eob> to consistently manufacture components <eol> at the quality levels we need, <eob> like this supplier in Nairobi, <eob> who are helping to reduce the production <eol> cost of metal brackets <eob> and improve their ability to build conformant parts <eob> to our engineering drawings. <eob>
Supply and development is standard practice <eol> in automotive globally, <eob> but it needs to be applied from the ground up <eob> with a vast majority of local suppliers <eob> to properly bolster the ecosystem. <eob>
And as production volumes rise, <eol> these suppliers can employ more staff, <eob> invest in better equipment <eob> and continue to develop <eol> new manufacturing techniques <eob> to further increase output. <eob>
Building up skills and suppliers <eol> are not the only hurdles <eob> to local industrialization, <eob> but they're good examples <eol> of how we think about the challenge. <eob>
You see, we're not just <eol> reimagining the car, <eob> we're reimagining <eol> our entire value chain. <eob>
None of this has been easy, <eob> and we're only just getting started. <eob>
But once African industry starts to scale, <eob> the potential is huge. <eob>
Better products, <eob> costing less, <eob> built locally, <eob> together creating millions of jobs. <eob>
Frugal innovation offers a path <eol> to economic acceleration <eob> across many industries, <eob> and the future of this continent depends on it. <eob>
The Africa 2.0 I believe <eol> in can apply locally relevant design <eob> and a commitment <eol> to solving its industrial challenges <eob> to create a more connected, <eol> more prosperous future, <eob> not just for the privileged few, <eob> but for everyone. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
According to the theories <eol> of human social development, <eob> we're now living through the fourth <eol> great epoch <eob> of technological advancement, <eob> the Information Age. <eob>
Connectivity through digital technology <eol> is a modern miracle. <eob>
We can say it has broken down barriers <eol> of time and space which separate people, <eob> and it's created a condition for an age <eob> where information, ideas <eol> can be shared freely. <eob>
But are these great accomplishments <eol> in digital technology <eob> really the endgame in terms <eol> of what can be achieved? <eob>
I don't think so, <eob> and today I'd like to share with you <eob> how I believe digital technology <eol> can take us to even greater heights. <eob>
I'm a surgeon by profession, <eob> and as I stand here today <eol> talking to all of you, <eob> five billion people around the world <eol> lack access to safe surgical care. <eob> Five billion people. <eob> That's 70 percent <eol> of the world's population, <eob> who according to the WHO's Lancet Commission <eob> can't even access simple surgical procedures <eob> as and when they need them. <eob>
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone, <eob> a country of six million people, <eob> where a recent study showed that <eol> there are only 10 qualified surgeons. <eob>
That's one surgeon <eol> for every 600,000 people. <eob>
The numbers are staggering, <eob> and we don't even need to look that far. <eob>
If we look around us here in the US, <eob> a recent study reported that we need <eol> an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030 <eob> to just keep up with the demand <eol> for routine surgical procedures. <eob>
At the rate that we're going, we won't be <eol> meeting those numbers. <eob>
As a surgeon, this is a global issue <eol> that bothers me. <eob>
It bothers me a lot, <eob> because I've seen firsthand <eob> how lack of access <eol> to safe and affordable healthcare <eob> can blight the lives <eol> of ordinary people. <eob>
If you're a patient <eol> that needs an operation <eob> and there isn't a surgeon available, <eob> you're left with some really difficult choices: <eob> to wait, to travel, <eob> or not to have an operation at all. <eob>
So what's the answer? <eob> Well, part of you are carrying <eol> some of that solution with you today: <eob> a smartphone, a tablet, a computer. <eob>
Because for me, <eob> digital communications technology <eol> has the power to do so much more <eob> than just to allow us to shop online, <eob> to connect through social media platforms <eol> and to stay up to date. <eob>
It has the power to help us solve <eol> some of the key issues that we face, <eob> like lack of access <eol> to vital surgical services. <eob>
And today I'd like to share with you <eob> an example of how <eol> I think we can make that possible. <eob>
The history of surgery is filled <eol> with breakthroughs <eob> in how science and technology was able <eol> to help the surgeons of the day <eob> face their greatest challenges. <eob>
If we go back several hundred years, <eob> an understanding of microbiology <eob> led to the development of antiseptic techniques, <eob> which played a big role in making sure <eob> patients were able to stay alive <eol> postsurgery. <eob>
Fast-forward a few hundred years <eob> and we developed keyhole <eol> or arthroscopic surgery, <eob> which combines video technology <eol> and precision instruments <eob> to make surgery less invasive. <eob>
And more recently, a lot of you <eol> will be aware of robotic surgery, <eob> and what robotics brings to surgery <eol> is much like modern automated machinery, <eob> ultraprecision, <eob> the ability to carry out procedures at the tiniest scales <eob> with a degree of accuracy <eol> that even surpasses the human hand. <eob>
But robotic surgery also introduced <eol> something else to surgery: <eob> the idea that a surgeon <eob> doesn't actually have to be standing at the patient's bedside <eol> to deliver care, <eob> that he could be looking at a screen <eob> and instructing a robot through a computer. <eob>
We call this remote surgery. <eob>
It is incumbent on us <eob> to find solutions that solve <eol> these answers in a cost-effective and scalable way, <eob> so that everyone, no matter <eol> where they are in the world, <eob> can have these problems addressed. <eob>
So what if I told you <eob> that you didn't really need <eol> a million-dollar robot <eob> to provide remote surgery? <eob>
That all you needed was a phone, <eol> a tablet, or a computer, <eob> an internet connection, <eob> a confident colleague on the ground <eob> and one magic ingredient: <eob> an augmented reality collaboration <eol> software. <eob>
Using this augmented reality <eol> collaboration software, <eob> an expert surgeon can now virtually <eol> transport himself <eob> into any clinical setting <eob> simply by using his phone <eol> or tablet or computer, <eob> and he can visually and practically <eol> interact in an operation <eob> from start to finish, <eob> guiding and mentoring a local doctor <eol> through the procedure step by step. <eob>
Well, enough of me telling you about it. <eob>
I'd now like to show you. <eob>
We're now going to go live <eol> to Dr. Marc Tompkins, <eob> an orthopedic surgeon <eol> at the University of Minnesota. <eob>
He's going to perform an arthroscopic surgery for us, <eob> a keyhole surgery of the knee, <eob> and I'd like to disclose <eob> that this patient has consented <eol> to having their operation streamed. <eob>
I'd also like to point out <eol> that in the interest of time, <eob> we're just going to go <eol> through the first steps, <eob> marking up the patient <eob> and just identifying a few key <eol> anatomical landmarks. <eob>
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me? <eob>
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine. <eob>
Nadine Hachach-Haram: <eol> Everyone from TED says hello. <eob>
Audience: Hi. <eob>
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins, <eol> let's get started. <eob>
So let's start with our incisions <eol> and where we're going to make these, <eob> on either side of the patellar tendon. <eob>
So if you can make <eol> your incisions there and there, <eob> that should hopefully get us into the knee. <eob>
MT: All right, I'm going in. <eob>
NHH: Great. <eob> So we're just getting <eol> inside the joint now. <eob>
So why don't we go around and have <eol> a quick look at the meniscus. <eob>
MT: Perfect. <eob>
NHH: Great, <eob> so we can see there's a small tear there <eol> on the meniscus, <eob> but otherwise it looks alright. <eob>
And if you turn and head <eol> to this direction, <eob> follow my finger, <eob> let's have a quick look at the ACL <eol> and the PCL. <eob>
That's your ACL there, <eol> that looks quite healthy, <eob> no problems there. <eob>
So we've just identified <eol> that small meniscus tear there, <eob> but otherwise the fluid <eol> around the joint looks OK as well. <eob>
All right, thank you <eol> very much, Dr. Tompkins. <eob>
Thank you <eob> for your time. <eob>
I'll let you continue. <eob> Have a good day. Bye. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I hope through this simple demonstration <eob> I was able to illustrate to you <eol> just how powerful this technology can be. <eob>
And I'd like to point out that I wasn't <eol> using any special equipment, <eob> just my laptop and a really simple webcam. <eob>
We're so used to using digital technology <eob> to communicate through voice <eol> and text and video, <eob> but augmented reality can do <eol> something so much deeper. <eob>
It allows two people to virtually interact <eob> in a way that mimics how <eol> they would collaborate in person. <eob>
Being able to show someone <eol> what you want to do, <eob> to illustrate and demonstrate <eol> and gesture, <eob> is so much more powerful <eol> than just telling them. <eob>
And it can make for such <eol> a great learning tool, <eob> because we learn better through direct experience. <eob>
So how is this making <eol> a difference around the world? <eob>
Well, back in my teaching hospital, <eob> we've been using this to support <eol> local district general hospitals <eob> and providing skin cancer surgery and trauma treatment. <eob>
Now, patients can access care <eol> at a local level. <eob>
This reduces their travel <eol> time, improves their access, <eob> and saves money. <eob>
We've even started seeing its use <eol> in wound care management with nurses <eob> and in outpatient management. <eob>
Most recently, and quite exciting, <eob> it was used in supporting a surgeon <eol> through a cancer removal of a kidney. <eob>
And I'd like to just share with you <eol> a very quick video here. <eob>
I apologize for some <eol> of the gruesome views. <eob>
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again. <eob>
Doctor 2: If you see here, <eob> that's the upper part, <eol> the most outer part of your tumor. <eob>
Doctor 1: Yes. <eob>
Doctor 2: So it's three centimeters deep, <eob> so this should be three centimeters. <eob>
Doctor 1: Yes, <eob> yes. <eob>
Doctor 2: OK, so you need <eol> to get a 3.5 margin. <eob>
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway <eob> and tell me what you think about it. <eob>
NHH: We're also seeing the use <eol> of this technology at a global scale, <eob> and one of the most heartwarming stories <eol> I can recall <eob> is from the town of Trujillo <eol> in the north of Lima in Peru, <eob> where this technology was used <eol> to support the provision <eob> of cleft lip and palate surgery to children, <eob> children from poor backgrounds <eol> who didn't have access to health insurance. <eob>
And in this town, there was a hospital <eol> with one surgeon <eob> working hard to provide this care, <eob> Dr. Soraya. <eob>
Now, <eob> Dr. Soraya <eob> was struggling under the sheer demand <eob> of her local population, <eob> as well as the fact that she wasn't <eol> specifically trained in this procedure. <eob>
And so, with the help of a charity, <eob> we were able to connect her <eol> with a cleft surgeon in California, <eob> and using this technology, he was able <eol> to guide her and her colleagues <eob> through the procedure step by step, <eob> guiding them, training them <eol> and teaching them. <eob>
Within a few months, <eob> they were able to perform <eol> 30 percent more operations <eob> with less and less complications. <eob>
And now <eob> Dr. Soraya <eob> and her team can perform <eol> these operations <eob> independently, competently and confidently. <eob>
And I remember one quote <eol> from a mother who said, <eob> "This technology gave <eol> my daughter her smile." <eob>
For me, this is the real power <eol> of this technology. <eob>
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries. <eob>
It transcends all technological difficulties. <eob> It connects people. It democratizes access. <eob> Wi-Fi and mobile technology <eol> are growing rapidly, <eob> and they should play a role <eol> in boosting surgical provision. <eob>
We've even seen it used in conflict zones <eol> where there's considerable risk <eob> in getting specialist surgeons <eol> to certain locations. <eob>
In a world where <eol> there are more mobile devices <eob> than there are human beings, <eob> it truly has a global reach. <eob>
Of course, we've still got a long way <eob> before we can solve the problem <eol> of getting surgery to five billion people, <eob> and unfortunately, <eob> some people still don't have access to internet. <eob>
But things are rapidly moving <eol> in the right direction. <eob>
The potential for change is there. <eob>
My team and I are growing our global footprint, <eob> and we're starting to see <eol> the potential of this technology. <eob>
Through digital technology, <eob> through simple, everyday devices <eol> that we take for granted, <eob> through devices of the future, <eob> we can really do miraculous things. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
HWT: We've said that so many times, <eob> we've made a piece about it. <eob> It's called "Sometimes I See Myself In You," <eob> and it speaks to the symbiotic relationship <eob> that we've developed over the years <eol> through our life and work. <eob>
And really, it's because everywhere we go, <eob> together or apart, <eob> we carry these monikers. <eob>
I've been following <eol> in my mother's footsteps <eob> since before I was even born <eob> and haven't figured out how to stop. <eob>
And as I get older, it does get harder. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> No seriously, it gets harder. <eob> My mother's taught me many things, though, <eob> most of all that love overrules. <eob>
She's taught me that love <eob> is an action, <eob> not a feeling. <eob>
Love is a way of being, <eol> it's a way of doing, <eob> it's a way of listening and it's a way of seeing. <eob>
DW: And also, the idea about love, <eob> photographers, <eob> they're looking for love when they make photographs. <eob>
They're looking and looking <eol> and finding love. <eob>
Growing up in North Philadelphia, <eob> I was surrounded by people <eol> in my family and friends <eob> who made photographs <eob> and used the family camera <eol> as a way of telling a story about life, <eob> about life of joy, <eob> about what it meant to become <eol> a family in North Philadelphia. <eob>
So I spent most of my life searching for pictures <eob> that reflect on ideas <eol> about black love, black joy <eob> and about family life. <eob>
So it's really important <eol> to think about the action of love overrules as a verb. <eob>
HWT: Sometimes I wonder <eol> if the love of looking is genetic, <eob> because, like my mother, <eob> I've loved photographs <eol> since before I can even remember. <eob>
I think sometimes that -- <eol> after my mother and her mother -- <eob> that photography <eol> and photographs were my first love. <eob>
No offense to my father, <eob> but that's what you get <eol> for calling me a "ham" <eob> wherever you go. <eob>
I remember whenever I'd go <eol> to my grandmother's house, <eob> she would hide all the photo albums <eob> because she was afraid of me asking, <eob> "Well, who is that in that picture?" <eob> and "Who are they to you and who are they to me, <eob> and how old were you when that picture was taken? <eob>
How old was I when that picture was taken? <eob>
And why were they in black and white? <eob>
Was the world in black and white <eol> before I was born?" <eob>
DW: Well, that's interesting, <eob> just to think about the world <eol> in black and white. <eob>
I grew up in a beauty <eol> shop in North Philadelphia, <eob> my mom's beauty shop, <eol> looking at "Ebony Magazine," <eob> found images that told stories <eol> that were often not in the daily news, <eob> but in the family album. <eob>
I wanted the family album <eol> to be energetic for me, <eob> a way of telling stories, <eob> and one day I happened <eol> upon a book in the Philadelphia Public Library <eob> called "The Sweet Flypaper <eol> of Life" by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes. <eob>
I think what attracted me <eol> as a seven-year-old, <eob> the title, flypaper and sweet, <eob> but to think about that as a seven-year-old, <eob> I looked at the beautiful <eol> images that Roy DeCarava made <eob> and then looked at ways that I could tell <eol> a story about life. <eob>
And looking for me is the act <eol> that basically changed my life. <eob>
HWT: My friend Chris Johnson told me <eol> that every photographer, <eob> every artist, is essentially trying <eol> to answer one question, <eob> and I think your question might have been, <eob> "Why doesn't the rest of the world <eol> see how beautiful we are, <eob> and what can I do to help them see <eol> our community the way I do?" <eob>
DW: While studying in art school -- <eob> it's probably true -- <eob> I had a male professor who told me <eol> that I was taking up a good man's space. <eob>
He tried to stifle my dream <eol> of becoming a photographer. <eob>
He attempted to shame me in a class <eol> full of male photographers. <eob>
He told me I was out of place <eol> and out of order as a woman, <eob> and he went on to say <eol> that all you could and would do <eob> was to have a baby when a good man <eol> could have had your seat in this class. <eob>
I was shocked into silence <eol> into that experience. <eob>
But I had my camera, <eol> and I was determined to prove to him <eob> that I was worthy <eol> for a seat in that class. <eob>
But in retrospect, I asked myself: "Why did I need to prove it to him?" <eob> You know, I had my camera, <eol> and I knew I needed to prove to myself <eob> that I would make a difference <eol> in photography. <eob>
I love photography, and no one is going <eol> to stop me from making images. <eob>
HWT: But that's when I came in. <eob>
DW: Yeah, that year <eol> I graduated, I got pregnant. <eob>
Yep, he was right. <eob>
And I had you, <eob> and I shook off that sexist language <eol> that he used against me <eob> and picked up my camera <eol> and made photographs daily, <eob> and made photographs <eol> of my pregnant belly as I prepared for graduate school. <eob>
But I thought about also <eol> that black photographers were missing <eob> from the history books of photography, <eob> and I was looking for ways to tell a story. <eob>
And I ran across Gordon Parks' book <eol> "A Choice of Weapons," <eob> which was his autobiography. <eob>
I began photographing and making images, <eob> and I tucked away that <eol> contact sheet that I made of my pregnant belly, <eob> and then you inspired me <eol> to create a new piece, <eob> a piece that said, "A woman taking <eol> a place from a good man," <eob> "You took the space from a good man," <eob> and then I used that language <eol> and reversed it and said, <eob> "I made a space for a good man, you." <eob>
(Applause) <eob> HWT: Thanks, ma. <eob>
Like mother, like son. <eob>
I grew up in a house full of photographs. <eob>
They were everywhere, and my mother <eol> would turn the kitchen into a darkroom. <eob>
And there weren't just pictures that she took <eob> and pictures of family members. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But there were pictures on the wall <eol> of and by people that we didn't know, <eob> men and women that we didn't know. <eob> Thanks, ma. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Puppet strings. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> I grew up in a house full of photographs. <eob>
But they weren't just pictures <eol> of men and women that we knew, <eob> but pictures of people <eol> that I didn't know, <eob> Pretty much, it was pretty clear <eol> from what I learned in school, <eob> that the rest of the world <eol> didn't either. <eob>
And it took me a long time <eol> to figure out what she was up to, <eob> but after a while, I figured it out. <eob>
When I was nine years old, <eol> she published this book, <eob> "Black Photographers, 1840-1940: A Bio-Bibliography." <eob> And it's astounding to me to consider <eob> that in 1840, African Americans <eol> were making photographs. <eob>
What does it mean for us to think <eob> that at a time that was two, <eol> three decades before the end of slavery, <eob> that people were learning how to read, <eob> they had to learn how to do math, <eob> they had to be on the cutting edge <eol> of science and technology, <eob> to do math, physics and chemistry <eol> just to make a single photograph. <eob>
And what compelled them <eol> to do that if not love? <eob>
Well, that book led her <eol> to her next book, "Black Photographers, 1940-1988," <eob> and that book led to another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eob> and another book, <eol> and another. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
And throughout my life, <eob> she's edited and published <eol> dozens of books <eob> and curated numerous exhibitions <eol> on every continent, <eob> not all about black photographers <eol> but all inspired by the curiosity <eob> of a little black girl <eol> from North Philadelphia. <eob>
DW: What I found is that black photographers <eol> had stories to tell, <eob> and we needed to listen. <eob>
And then I found and I discovered <eob> black photographers like Augustus Washington, <eob> who made these beautiful daguerreotypes <eob> of the McGill family <eol> in the early 1840s and '50s. <eob>
Their stories tended to be different, black <eob> photographers, <eob> and they had a different narrative <eol> about black life during slavery, <eob> but it was also about family life, beauty <eol> and telling stories about community. <eob>
I didn't know how to link the stories, <eob> but I knew that teachers <eol> needed to know this story. <eob>
HWT: So I think I was <eol> my mother's first student. <eob>
Unwillingly and unwittingly -- puppet strings -- <eob> I decided to pick up a camera, <eob> and thought that I should make my own pictures <eob> about the then and now and the now and then. <eob>
I thought about how I could use photography <eob> to talk about how what's going on <eol> outside of the frame of the camera <eob> can affect what we see inside. <eob>
The truth is always in the hands <eol> of the actual image maker <eob> and it's up to us to really consider <eol> what's being cut out. <eob>
I thought I could use her research <eol> as a jumping-off point <eob> of things that I was seeing in society <eob> and I wanted to start to think about <eol> how I could use historical images <eob> to talk about the past being present <eob> and think about ways <eol> that we can speak <eob> to the perennial struggle <eol> for human rights and equal rights <eob> through my appropriation of photographs <eob> in the form of sculpture, video, <eob> installation and paintings. <eob>
But through it all, one piece <eol> has affected me the most. <eob>
It continues to nourish me. <eob>
It's based off of this photograph <eol> by Ernest Withers, <eob> who took this picture in 1968 <eob> at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March <eob> of men and women standing collectively <eol> to affirm their humanity. <eob>
They were holding signs that said "I am a man," <eob> and I found that astounding, <eol> because the phrase I grew up with <eob> wasn't "I am a man," <eol> it was "I am the man," <eob> and I was amazed at how it went <eol> from this collective statement during segregation <eob> to this seemingly selfish statement <eol> after integration. <eob>
And I wanted to ponder that, <eob> so I decided to remix <eol> that text in as many ways as I could think of, <eob> and I like to think of the top line <eol> as a timeline of American history, <eob> and the last line as a poem, <eob> and it says, <eob> "I am the man. <eob>
Who's the man. You the man. What a man. <eob> I am man. I am many. I am, am I. <eob> I am, I am. <eob>
I am, Amen. <eob>
DW: Wow, so fascinating. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> But what we learn from this experience <eob> is the most powerful two words <eol> in the English language is, "I am." <eob> And we each have the capacity to love. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
The longest journey that I have ever taken. <eob> That was in 2002. <eob>
I was only 19 years old. <eob>
It was the first time <eol> I had ever been on an airplane <eob> and the first time <eol> that I had left my country, <eob> Rwanda. <eob>
I had to move thousands of kilometers away <eob> to follow a dream. <eob>
A dream I have had ever since <eol> I was a child. <eob>
And that dream was to become an architect. <eob>
That was impossible <eol> at the time in my country. <eob>
There were no schools of architecture. <eob>
So when I got a scholarship <eol> to study in China, <eob> I left my life and my family behind <eob> and I moved to Shanghai. <eob>
It was an amazing time. <eob>
This country was going through <eol> a major building boom. <eob>
Shanghai, my new home, <eob> was quickly turning into <eol> a skyscraper city. <eob> China was changing. <eob> World-class projects were built <eol> to convey a new image of development. <eob>
Modern, striking engineering marvels <eol> were going up literally everywhere. <eob>
But behind these facades, <eob> exploitation of huge numbers <eol> of migrant workers, <eob> massive displacement of thousands of people <eob> made these projects possible. <eob>
And this fast-paced development <eob> also contributed <eol> significantly to the pollution <eob> that is haunting China today. <eob>
Fast-forward to 2010, <eob> when I went back home to <eob> Rwanda. <eob>
There, I found development patterns similar <eol> to what I saw in China. <eob>
The country was and still is experiencing <eol> its own population and economic growth. <eob>
The pressure to build cities, <eol> infrastructure and buildings <eob> is at its peak, <eob> and as a result, <eob> there is a massive <eol> building boom as well. <eob>
This is the reality <eol> across the entire continent of Africa, <eob> and here's why. <eob> By 2050, Africa's population <eol> will double, <eob> reaching 2.5 billion people. <eob>
At this point, <eob> the African population will be slightly <eol> less than the current population <eob> of China and India combined. <eob>
The infrastructure and buildings needed <eol> to accommodate this many people <eob> is unprecedented in the history <eol> of humankind. <eob>
We have estimated that by 2050, <eob> we have to build 700,000,000 more housing units, <eob> more than 300,000 schools <eob> and nearly 100,000 health centers. <eob>
Let me put that into perspective for you. <eob>
Every day for the next 35 years, <eob> we have to build seven health centers, <eob> 25 schools <eob> and nearly 60,000 housing units each day, <eob> every day. <eob>
How are we going to build all of this? <eob> Are we going to follow a model of unsustainable <eol> building and construction <eob> similar to what I witnessed in China? <eob>
Or can we develop a uniquely African model <eob> of sustainable and equitable development? <eob> I'm optimistic we can. <eob> I know Africans who are already doing it. <eob>
Take Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi for instance, <eob> and his work in slums <eol> of coastal megacities. <eob>
Places like Makoko in Lagos, <eob> where hundreds of thousands <eol> of people live in makeshift structures on stilts <eob> on water, <eob> without government infrastructure or services. <eob>
A community at great risk <eol> of rising sea levels and climate change. <eob>
And yet, people who live here are examples <eol> of great ingenuity <eob> and the will to survive. <eob>
Kunlé and his team <eol> have designed a prototype school <eob> that is resilient to rising sea levels. <eob>
This is Makoko School. <eob>
It's a floating prototype structure <eol> that can be adapted to clinics, <eob> to housing, to markets <eob> and other vital infrastructure <eol> this community needs. <eob>
It's an ingenious solution <eob> that can ensure this community <eol> lives safely on the waters of Lagos. <eob>
This is Francis Kéré. <eob> He works in the country <eol> where he comes from, <eob> Burkina Faso. <eob>
Kéré and his team have designed <eol> projects that use traditional building techniques. <eob>
Kéré and his team <eol> working in the communities <eob> have developed prototype schools <eob> that the whole community, <eob> similar to every project <eol> in the villages of this country, <eob> comes together to build. <eob>
Children bring stones for the foundation, <eob> women bring water <eol> for the brick manufacturing, <eob> and everybody works together <eol> to pound the clay floors. <eob>
Working with the community, <eob> Kéré and his team have created <eol> projects that function better, <eob> with adequate lighting and adequate ventilation. <eob>
They're appropriate <eol> for this particular context <eob> and really, really beautiful as well. <eob>
For the past seven years, <eob> I have been working <eol> as an architect at MASS Design Group. <eob>
It's a design firm that began in <eob> Rwanda. <eob>
We have worked in several countries in Africa, <eob> focusing on this more equitable <eol> and sustainable model <eob> of architectural practice, <eob> and Malawi is one of those countries. <eob>
It's a country with beautiful, <eol> remote landscapes <eob> with high-peak mountains <eol> and fertile valleys. <eob>
But it also has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the world. <eob>
A pregnant woman in Malawi <eol> either gives birth at home, <eob> or she has to walk a really long journey <eol> to the nearest clinic. <eob>
And one out of 36 <eol> of these mothers dies during childbirth. <eob>
In Malawi, <eob> with our team at MASS Design Group, <eob> we designed the Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village. <eob>
This is a place women come to six weeks <eol> before their due dates. <eob>
Here they receive prenatal care <eob> and train in nutrition <eol> and family planning. <eob>
At the same time, they form a community <eob> with other expectant mothers and their families. <eob>
The design of the of Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village <eob> borrows from the vernacular typologies of Malawi villages <eob> and is built using really simple materials <eol> and techniques. <eob>
The earth blocks that we used were made <eol> from the same soil of this site. <eob>
This reduces the carbon footprint <eol> of this building, <eob> but first and foremost, <eob> it provides a safe and dignified <eol> space for these expectant mothers. <eob>
These examples show <eol> that architecture and design <eob> have the power and the agency <eol> to address complex problems. <eob>
But more to point, <eob> that we can develop a model <eol> of effective solutions <eob> for our communities. <eob>
But these three examples are not enough. <eob>
300 more examples will not be enough. <eob>
We need a whole community <eol> of African architects and designers <eob> to lead with thousands more examples. <eob>
In May of this year, <eob> we convened a symposium <eol> on African architecture, in Kigali, <eob> and we invited many of the leading African designers <eob> and architectural educators <eol> working across the continent. <eob>
We all had one thing in common. <eob>
Every single one of us <eol> went to school abroad <eob> and outside of Africa. <eob> This has to change. <eob> If we are to develop solutions unique to us, <eob> rather than attempting to turn <eol> Kigali into Beijing, <eob> or Lagos into Shenzhen, <eob> we need a community <eob> that will build the design confidence <eol> of the next generation <eob> of African architects and designers. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In September last year, <eob> we launched the African Design Centre <eob> to start building this community. <eob>
We admitted 11 fellows <eol> from across the continent. <eob>
It's a 20-month-long, <eol> design-build fellowship program. <eob>
Here, they are learning <eol> to tackle big challenges <eob> such as urbanism <eol> and climate change, <eob> as Kunlé and his team have. <eob>
They're working with communities <eob> to develop innovative building <eol> solutions and processes, <eob> as Kéré and his team have. <eob>
They're learning to understand <eol> the health impact of better buildings <eob> as we at MASS Design Group <eol> have been researching <eob> for the past several years. <eob>
The crowning moment <eol> of the fellowship <eob> is a real project <eol> that they designed and built. <eob>
This is Ruhehe Primary School, <eob> the project they designed. <eob>
They immersed themselves in the community <eol> to understand the challenges <eob> but also uncover opportunities, <eob> like using a wall made of local volcanic stone <eob> to turn the entire campus into a space <eol> of play and active learning. <eob>
They evaluated the environmental conditions <eob> and developed a roof system <eol> that maximizes daylight <eob> and improves acoustic performance. <eob>
The construction at Ruhehe Primary School <eol> will begin this year. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And over the coming months, <eob> the African Design Centre fellows <eol> are going to work hand-in-hand <eob> with the Ruhehe community <eol> to build it. <eob>
When we asked the fellows <eob> what they want to do after their African <eol> Design Centre fellowship, <eob> Tshepo from South Africa said <eob> he wants to introduce this new way <eol> of building into his country, <eob> so he plans to open <eol> a private practice in Johannesburg. <eob>
Zani wants to expand opportunities <eol> for women to become engineers. <eob>
Before joining the African Design Centre, <eob> she helped start, in Nairobi, <eob> an organization to bridge the gender gaps <eol> for women in engineering fields, <eob> and she hopes to take this movement <eol> across Africa, <eob> eventually the whole world. <eob>
Moses, from South Sudan, <eob> the world's newest country, <eob> wants to open the first polytechnic school <eob> that will teach people how to build <eol> using local materials from his country. <eob>
Moses had to be determined <eol> to become an architect. <eob>
The civil war in his country frequently <eol> interrupted his architectural education. <eob>
At the time he was applying to join <eol> the African Design Centre, <eob> we could hear gunshots going off <eol> in the background of his interview call. <eob>
But even in the middle of this civil war, <eob> Moses hangs on to this idea <eob> that architecture can be a way to bridge <eol> communities back together. <eob>
You have to be inspired <eol> by this fellow's belief <eob> that great architecture <eol> can make a difference <eob> on how the future of Africa is built. <eob>
The unprecedented growth of Africa <eol> cannot be ignored. <eob>
Imagine Africa's future cities, <eob> but not as vast slums, <eob> but the most resilient <eob> and the most socially inclusive places on earth. <eob> This is achievable. <eob> And we have the talent <eol> to make it a reality. <eob>
But the journey to ready <eol> that talent for the task ahead, <eob> like my own journey, <eob> is far too long. <eob>
For the next generation <eol> of African creative leaders, <eob> we have to shorten and streamline that journey. <eob>
But most importantly -- <eob> and I cannot stress this enough -- <eob> we have to build their design confidence <eob> and empower them to develop solutions <eol> that are truly African <eob> but globally inspiring. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's an ancient parable <eol> about a farmer who lost his horse. <eob>
And neighbors came over to say, <eol> "Oh, that's too bad." <eob> And the farmer said, "Good or bad, hard to say." <eob> Days later, the horse returns <eol> and brings with it seven wild horses. <eob>
And neighbors come over to say, <eol> "Oh, that's so good!" <eob> And the farmer just shrugs and says, <eol> "Good or bad, hard to say." <eob> The next day, the farmer's son <eol> rides one of the wild horses, <eob> is thrown off and breaks his leg. <eob>
And the neighbors say, "Oh, <eol> that's terrible luck." <eob> And the farmer says, <eol> "Good or bad, hard to say." <eob> Eventually, officers come knocking <eol> on people's doors, <eob> looking for men to draft for an army, <eob> and they see the farmer's son <eol> and his leg and they pass him by. <eob>
And neighbors say, "Ooh, <eol> that's great luck!" <eob> And the farmer says, <eol> "Good or bad, hard to say." <eob>
I first heard this story 20 years ago, <eob> and I have since applied it 100 times. <eob>
Didn't get the job I wanted: <eob> good or bad, hard to say. <eob>
good or bad, hard to say. <eob> Got the job I wanted: <eob>
To me, the story is not <eol> about looking on the bright side <eob> or waiting to see <eol> how things turn out. <eob>
It's about how eager we can be <eol> to label a situation, <eob> to put concrete around it <eol> by judging it. <eob>
But reality is much more fluid, <eob> and good and bad are often <eol> incomplete stories that we tell ourselves. <eob>
The parable has been my warning <eob> that by gripping tightly <eol> to the story of good or bad, <eob> I close down my ability <eol> to truly see a situation. <eob>
I learn more when I proceed <eol> and loosen my grip <eob> and proceed openly with curiosity and wonder. <eob>
But seven years ago, <eob> when I was pregnant with my first child, <eob> I completely forgot this lesson. <eob>
I believed I knew wholeheartedly <eol> what was good. <eob>
When it came to having kids, <eob> I thought that good was <eol> some version of a superbaby, <eob> some ultrahealthy human who possessed <eol> not a single flaw <eob> and would practically wear a cape <eol> flying into her superhero future. <eob>
I took DHA pills to ensure <eol> that my baby had a super-high-functioning, <eob> supersmart brain, <eob> and I ate mostly organic food, <eob> and I trained for a medication-free labor, <eob> and I did many other things <eob> because I thought these things <eol> would help me make not just a good baby, <eob> but the best baby possible. <eob>
When my daughter Fiona was born, <eol> she weighed 4 pounds, 12 ounces, <eob> or 2.15 kilograms. <eob>
The pediatrician said <eol> there were only two possible explanations <eob> for her tiny size. <eob> "Either," he said, "it's bad seed," <eob> "or it's bad soil." <eob> And I wasn't so tired from labor <eol> to lose the thread of his logic: <eob> my newborn, according to the doctor, <eob> was a bad plant. <eob>
Eventually, I learned that my daughter <eol> had an ultra-rare chromosomal condition <eob> called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. <eob>
She was missing a chunk <eol> of her fourth chromosome. <eob>
And although my daughter was good -- <eob> she was alive, <eob> and she had brand new baby skin <eob> and the most aware onyx eyes -- <eob> I also learned that people <eol> with her syndrome <eob> have significant developmental delays <eol> and disabilities. <eob>
Some never learn to walk or talk. <eob>
I did not have the equanimity <eol> of the farmer. <eob>
The situation looked unequivocally <eol> bad to me. <eob>
But here's where the parable <eol> is so useful, <eob> because for weeks after her diagnosis, <eol> I felt gripped by despair, <eob> locked in the story <eol> that all of this was tragic. <eob>
Reality, though -- thankfully -- <eol> is much more fluid, <eob> and it has much more to teach. <eob>
As I started to get to know <eol> this mysterious person who was my kid, <eob> my fixed, tight story <eol> of tragedy loosened. <eob>
It turned out my girl loved reggae, <eob> and she would smirk when my husband would bounce her <eol> tiny body up and down <eob> to the rhythm. <eob>
Her onyx eyes eventually <eol> turned the most stunning Lake Tahoe blue, <eob> and she loved using them to gaze intently <eol> into other people's eyes. <eob>
At five months old, she could not <eol> hold her head up like other babies, <eob> but she could hold this deep, intent <eol> eye contact. <eob>
One friend said, "She's the most aware <eol> baby I've ever seen." <eob>
But where I saw the gift of her <eol> calm, attentive presence, <eob> an occupational therapist who came <eol> over to our house to work with Fiona <eob> saw a child who was neurologically dull. <eob>
This therapist was especially disappointed <eob> that Fiona wasn't rolling over yet, <eob> and so she told me we needed <eol> to wake her neurology up. <eob>
One day she leaned <eol> over my daughter's body, <eob> took her tiny shoulders, <eob> jostled her and said, "Wake up! <eob>
Wake up! <eob> "We had a few therapists visit <eol> our house that first year, <eob> and they usually focused on what they thought <eol> was bad about my kid. <eob>
I was really happy when Fiona started <eol> using her right hand <eob> to bully a dangling stuffed sheep, <eob> but the therapist was fixated <eol> on my child's left hand. <eob>
Fiona had a tendency not to use <eol> this hand very often, <eob> and she would cross the fingers <eol> on that hand. <eob>
So the therapist said we should devise a splint, <eob> which would rob my kid of the ability <eol> to actually use those fingers, <eob> but it would at least force them <eol> into some position that looked normal. <eob>
In that first year, I was starting <eol> to realize a few things. <eob>
One: ancient parables aside, my kid <eol> had some bad therapists. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Two: I had a choice. <eob>
Like a person offered to swallow a red pill <eol> or a blue pill, <eob> I could choose to see <eol> my daughter's differences as bad; <eob> I could strive toward the goal <eol> that her therapists called, <eob> "You'd never know." <eob> They loved to pat themselves <eol> on the back when they could say about a kid, <eob> "You'd never know he was 'delayed' <eol> or 'autistic' or 'different.'" <eob> I could believe that the good path was the path that erased <eob> as many differences as possible. <eob>
Of course, this would have been <eol> a disastrous pursuit, <eob> because at the cellular level, <eol> my daughter had rare blueprints. <eob>
She wasn't designed <eol> to be like other people. <eob>
She would lead a rare life. <eob>
So, I had another choice: <eol> I could drop my story <eob> that neurological differences <eol> and developmental delays and disabilities <eob> were bad, <eob> which means I could also drop my story <eol> that a more able-bodied life was better. <eob>
I could release my cultural biases <eol> about what made a life good or bad <eob> and simply watch <eol> my daughter's life as it unfolded <eob> with openness and curiosity. <eob>
One afternoon she was lying <eol> on her back, <eob> and she arched her back on the carpet <eob> stuck her tongue out of the side of her mouth <eob> and managed to torque her body <eol> onto her belly. <eob>
Then she tipped over and rolled <eol> back onto her back, <eob> and once there, she managed <eol> to do it all over again, <eob> rolling and wiggling her 12-pound <eol> self under a coffee table. <eob>
At first, I thought she'd gotten stuck there, <eob> but then I saw her reaching for something <eol> that her eye had been on all along: <eob> a black electric cord. <eob>
She was a year old. <eob>
Other babies her age were for sure <eol> pulling up to stand and toddling around, <eob> some of them. <eob>
good or bad, hard to say. <eob> To some, my kid's situation looked bad: <eob> a one-year-old who could only roll. <eob> But screw that. <eob> My kid was enjoying the new, <eol> limber freedom of mobility. <eob> I rejoiced. <eob> Then again, what I watched that afternoon <eol> was a baby yanking on an electric cord, <eob> so you know, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I started seeing <eol> that when I released my grip <eob> about what made a life good or bad, <eob> I could watch my daughter's life <eol> unfold and see what it was. <eob>
It was beautiful, <eob> it was complicated, <eob> joyful, hard -- <eob> in other words: just another expression <eol> of the human experience. <eob>
Eventually, my family and <eol> I moved to a new state in America, <eob> and we got lucky with a brand-new batch of therapists. <eob>
They didn't focus on all <eol> that was wrong with my kid. <eob>
They didn't see her differences <eol> as problems to fix. <eob>
They acknowledged her limitations, <eob> but they also saw her strengths, <eob> and they celebrated her for who she was. <eob>
Their goal wasn't to make Fiona <eol> as normal as possible; <eob> their goal was simply to help her <eol> be as independent as possible <eob> so that she could fulfill her potential, <eol> however that looked for her. <eob>
But the culture at large does not <eol> take this open attitude about disabilities. <eob>
We call congenital differences <eol> "birth defects," <eob> as though human beings <eol> were objects on a factory line. <eob>
We might offer pitying expressions <eob> when we learn that a colleague had <eol> a baby with Down syndrome. <eob>
We hail a blockbuster film <eol> about a suicidal wheelchair user, <eob> despite the fact that actual wheelchair users tell us <eob> that stereotype is unfair and damaging. <eob>
And sometimes our medical institutions decide <eol> what lives are not worth living. <eob>
Such is the case with Amelia Rivera, <eob> a girl with my daughter's same syndrome. <eob>
In 2012, a famous American children's hospital <eob> initially denied Amelia the right <eol> to a lifesaving kidney transplant <eob> because, according to their form, <eob> as it said, she was "mentally retarded." <eob> This is the way that the story <eol> of disabilities as bad manifests <eob> in a culture. <eob>
But there's a surprisingly insidious counterstory -- <eob> the story, especially, that people <eol> with intellectual disabilities are good <eob> because they are here to teach us <eol> something magical, <eob> or they are inherently angelic <eol> and always sweet. <eob>
You have heard <eol> this ableist trope before: <eob> the boy with Down syndrome <eol> who's one of God's special children, <eob> or the girl with the walker <eol> and the communication device <eob> who is a precious <eol> little angel. <eob>
This story rears its head <eol> in my daughter's life <eob> around Christmastime, <eob> when certain people get positively giddy <eob> at the thought of seeing her in angel's wings and a halo <eob> at the pageant. <eob>
The insinuation is that these people <eol> don't experience the sticky complexities <eob> of being human. <eob>
And although at times, especially as a baby, <eob> my daughter has, in fact, looked angelic, <eob> she has grown into the type of kid <eob> who does the rascally things <eol> that any other kid does, <eob> such as when she, at age four, <eol> shoved her two-year-old sister. <eob>
My girl deserves the right <eol> to annoy the hell out of you, <eob> like any other kid. <eob>
When we label a person tragic or angelic, <eob> bad or good, <eob> we rob them of their humanity, <eob> along with not only the messiness <eol> and complexity that that title brings, <eob> but the rights and dignities as well. <eob>
My girl does not exist <eol> to teach me things <eob> or any of us things, <eob> but she has indeed taught me: <eob> number one, how many mozzarella cheese sticks <eob> a 22-pound human being <eol> can consume in one day -- <eob> which is five, for the record; <eob> and two, the gift of questioning <eol> my culture's beliefs <eob> about what makes a life good <eob> and what makes life bad. <eob>
If you had told me six years ago <eob> that my daughter would sometimes use <eol> and iPad app to communicate, <eob> I might have thought <eol> that was sad. <eob>
But now I recall the first day <eol> I handed Fiona her iPad, <eob> loaded with a thousand words, <eob> each represented by a tiny little icon <eol> or little square on her iPad app. <eob>
And I recall how bold <eol> and hopeful it felt, <eob> even as some of her therapists said <eol> that my expectations were way too high, <eob> that she would never be able <eol> to hit those tiny targets. <eob>
And I recall watching in awe <eol> as she gradually learned <eob> to flex her little thumb <eob> and hit the buttons <eol> to say words she loved, <eob> like "reggae" and "cheese" <eob> and a hundred other words she loved <eol> that her mouth couldn't yet say. <eob>
And then we had to teach her <eol> less-fun words, prepositions -- <eob> words like "of" and "on" and "in." <eob> And we worked on this <eol> for a few weeks. <eob>
And then I recall sitting <eol> at a dining room table <eob> with many relatives, <eob> and, apropos of absolutely nothing, <eob> Fiona used her iPad app to say, <eob> "poop in toilet." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Good or bad, hard to say. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My kid is human, that's all. <eob>
And that is a lot. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How many of you are tired <eob> of seeing celebrities adopting kids <eol> from the African continent? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, it's not all that bad. <eob> I was adopted. <eob> I grew up in rural Uganda, <eob> lost both my parents <eol> when I was very, very young. <eob>
And when my parents passed, <eob> I experienced <eol> all the negative effects of poverty, <eob> from homelessness, <eob> eating out of trash piles, <eob> you name it. <eob>
But my life changed <eob> when I got accepted into an orphanage. <eob>
Through one of those sponsor-an-orphan programs, <eob> I was sponsored and given <eol> an opportunity to acquire an education. <eob>
I started off in Uganda. <eob>
I went through school, and the way <eol> this particular program worked, <eob> you finished high school <eol> and after high school, <eob> you go learn a trade -- to become <eol> a carpenter, a mechanic <eob> or something along those lines. <eob>
My case was a little different. <eob>
The sponsor family that was sending <eol> these 25 dollars a month <eob> to this orphanage to sponsor me, <eob> which -- I had never met them -- <eob> said, "Well ... <eob> we would like to send you to college instead." <eob> Oh -- it gets better. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they said, "If you get the paperwork, <eob> we'll send you to school in America instead." <eob> So with their help, <eob> I went to the embassy <eol> and applied for the visa. <eob>
I got the visa. <eob>
I remember this day like it was yesterday. <eob>
I walked out of the embassy <eol> with this piece of paper in my hand, <eob> a hop in my step, <eob> smile on my face, <eob> knowing that my life is about to change. <eob>
I went home that night, <eob> and I slept with my passport, <eob> because I was afraid that someone <eol> might steal it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I couldn't fall asleep. <eob> I kept feeling it. <eob> I had a good idea for security. <eob>
I was like, "OK, I'm going to put it <eol> in a plastic bag, <eob> and take it outside and dig a hole, <eol> and put it in there." <eob> I did that, went back in the house. <eob>
I could not fall asleep. <eob>
I was like, "Maybe someone saw me." <eob> I went back — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I pulled it out, and I put it <eol> with me the entire night -- <eob> all to say that it was an anxiety-filled night. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Going to the US was, <eol> just like another speaker said, <eob> was my first time to see a plane, <eob> be on one, let alone sit <eol> on it to fly to another country. <eob>
December 15, 2006. <eob> 7: 08pm. <eob> I sat in seat 7A. <eob> Fly Emirates. <eob> One of the most gorgeous, beautiful women <eol> I've ever seen walked up, <eob> red little hat with a white veil. <eob>
I'm looking terrified, I have no idea <eol> what I'm doing. <eob>
She hands me this warm towel -- <eob> warm, steamy, snow white. <eob>
I'm looking at this warm towel; <eob> I don't know what to do with my life, <eol> let alone with this damn towel -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I did one of the -- <eob> you know, anything anyone <eol> could do in that situation: <eob> look around, see what everyone else is doing. <eob>
I did the same. <eob>
Mind you, I drove about seven hours <eol> from my village to the airport that day. <eob>
So I grab this warm towel, <eob> wipe my face just like everyone else is doing, <eob> I look at it -- <eob> damn. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was all dirt brown. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I remember being so embarrassed <eol> that when she came by to pick it up, <eob> I didn't give mine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I still have it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Going to America opened doors for me <eob> to live up to my full God-given potential. <eob>
I remember when I arrived, <eob> the sponsor family embraced me, <eob> and they literally had to teach me <eol> everything from scratch: <eob> this is a microwave, that's a refrigerator -- <eob> things I'd never seen before. <eob>
And it was also the first time <eob> I got immersed into <eol> a new and different culture. <eob>
These strangers showed me <eob> true love. <eob>
These strangers showed me <eob> that I mattered, <eob> that my dreams mattered. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
These individuals had two <eol> of their own biological children. <eob>
And when I came in, I had needs. <eob>
They had to teach me English, <eob> teach me literally everything, <eob> which resulted in them spending <eol> a lot of time with me. <eob>
And that created a little bit <eol> of jealousy with their children. <eob>
So, if you're a parent in this room, <eob> and you have those teenager children <eob> who don't want anything to do <eol> with your love and affection — <eob> in fact, they find it repulsive — <eob> I got a solution: <eob> adopt a child. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It will solve the problem. <eob>
I went on to acquire two engineering degrees <eob> from one of the best <eol> institutions in the world. <eob>
I've got to tell you: <eob> talent is universal, <eob> but opportunities are not. <eob>
And I credit this <eob> to the individuals who embrace <eol> multiculturalism, <eob> love, empathy <eob> and compassion for others. <eob>
We live in a world filled with hate: <eob> building walls, <eob> Brexit, <eob> xenophobia here on the African continent. <eob>
Multiculturalism can be an answer <eob> to many of these worst human qualities. <eob>
Today, I challenge you <eob> to help a young child <eol> experience multiculturalism. <eob>
I guarantee you <eol> that will enrich their life, <eob> and in turn, <eob> it will enrich yours. <eob>
And as a bonus, <eob> one of them may even give a TED Talk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We may not be able to solve the bigotry <eol> and the racism of this world today, <eob> but certainly we can raise children <eob> to create a positive, <eol> inclusive, connected world <eob> full of empathy, <eob> love <eob> and compassion. <eob>
Love wins. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Good evening, everyone. <eob>
I am from Japan, <eob> so I'd like to start with a story <eol> about Japanese fishing villages. <eob>
In the past, every fisherman <eol> was tempted to catch as many as fish as possible, <eob> but if everybody did that, <eob> the fish, common shared <eol> resource in the community, would disappear. <eob>
The result would be hardship <eol> and poverty for everyone. <eob>
This happened in some cases, <eob> but it did not happen in other cases. <eob>
In these communities, <eob> the fishermen developed <eol> a kind of social contract <eob> that told each one of them <eol> to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing. <eob>
The fisherman would keep an eye <eol> on each other. <eob>
There would be a penalty <eol> if you were caught cheating. <eob> But once the benefit <eol> of a social contract became clear to everyone, <eob> the incentive to cheat <eol> dramatically dropped. <eob>
We find the same story around the world. <eob>
This is how villagers in medieval Europe <eob> managed pasture and forests. <eob>
This is how communities <eol> in Asia managed water, <eob> and this is how indigenous peoples <eol> in the Amazon managed wildlife. <eob>
These communities realized they relied <eol> on a finite, shared resource. <eob>
They developed rules and practices <eol> on how to manage those resources, <eob> and they changed their behavior <eob> so that they could continue <eol> to rely on those shared resources tomorrow <eob> by not overfishing, <eob> not overgrazing, <eob> not polluting or depleting <eol> water streams today. <eob>
This is a story of the commons, <eob> and also how to avoid the so-called tragedy <eol> of the commons. <eob>
But this is also a story of an economy <eob> that was mainly local, <eob> where everybody had a very <eol> strong sense of belonging. <eob>
Our economies are no longer local. <eob>
When we moved away from being local, <eob> we started to lose our connection <eol> to the commons. <eob>
We carried economic objectives, <eol> goals and systems beyond the local, <eob> but we did not carry the notion <eol> of taking care of the commons. <eob>
So our oceans, forests, <eob> once very close to us <eol> as our local commons, <eob> moved very far away from us. <eob>
So today, we pump millions of tons <eol> of greenhouse gases into the air, <eob> we dump plastics, fertilizers <eol> and industrial waste <eob> into the rivers and oceans, <eob> and we cut down forests <eol> that absorb CO2. <eob>
We make the wild biodiversity <eol> much more fragile. <eob>
We seem to have totally forgotten <eob> that there is such a thing <eol> as global commons: <eob> air, water, forests and biodiversity. <eob>
Now, it is modern science <eob> that reminds us how vital <eol> the global commons are. <eob>
In 2009, a group of scientists proposed <eob> how to assess the health <eol> of the global commons. <eob>
They defined nine planetary boundaries <eol> vital to our survival, <eob> then they measured how far we could go <eob> before we cross over the tipping <eol> points or thresholds <eob> that would lead us to the irreversible <eol> or even catastrophic change. <eob>
This is where we were in the 1950s. <eob>
We broadly remained <eol> within safe operating space, <eob> marked by the green line. <eob>
But look at where we are now. <eob>
We have crossed four of those boundaries, <eob> and we will be crossing others <eol> in the future. <eob>
How did we end up in this situation? <eob>
Well, my personal story <eol> may tell us something. <eob>
Five years ago, I was appointed <eob> as CEO of the GEF, Global Environment Facility, <eob> but I am not a conservationist <eob> or an environmental activist. <eob>
I am an economist, <eob> and for the last 30 years, <eob> I had worked for public finance <eol> in my home country and around the world. <eob>
I can tell you one thing for sure: <eob> during these 30 years, <eob> the notion of the global commons <eol> never crossed my mind. <eob>
I didn't have a single conversation <eol> about the global commons <eob> with my colleagues. <eob>
This tells me that the notion <eol> of the global commons <eob> was not really entering <eol> into the big money decisions <eob> like state budgets or investment plans. <eob>
And I'm wondering, why do we have <eol> this sheer ignorance <eob> about the global commons, <eob> including me, myself? <eob>
One possible explanation might be <eob> that until recently, <eol> it didn't really matter too much. <eob>
Even if we mess up some part of the environment, <eob> we were not fundamentally changing <eol> the functions of the earth system. <eob>
The global commons <eol> had still enough capacity <eob> to take the punches we gave them. <eob>
In fact, the fish were still plentiful, <eob> the fields for grazing were still vast. <eob>
Our mistake was to assume <eob> that the capacity of the earth <eol> for self-repair <eob> had no limits. <eob>
It does have limits. <eob>
The message from the science is very clear: <eob> we humans have become <eol> an overwhelming force <eob> to determine the future living <eol> conditions on earth, <eob> and what's more, we are running <eol> out of time. <eob>
If we don't act on them, <eob> we will be losing the global commons. <eob>
It's only our generation who are able <eol> to preserve it -- <eob> preserve the commons as we know them. <eob>
Now is the time we start <eol> managing the global commons <eob> as our parents or our grandparents <eol> managed their local commons. <eob>
The first thing we need to do <eob> is to simply recognize that we do <eol> have the global commons <eob> and they are very, very important. <eob>
But what does it mean in practice? <eob> Where to start with? <eob> I see there are four key economic systems <eob> that fundamentally need to change. <eob>
First, we need to change our cities. <eob>
By 2050, two thirds of our population <eol> will live in cities. <eob>
We need green cities. <eob>
Second, we need to change <eol> our energy system. <eob>
The world economy must sharply decarbonize, <eob> essentially in one generation. <eob>
Third, we need to change <eol> our production-consumption system. <eob>
We need to break away from current <eol> take-make-waste consumption patterns. <eob>
And finally, we need to change <eol> our food system, <eob> what to eat and how to produce it. <eob>
And all of those four systems <eob> are putting enormous pressure <eol> on the global commons, <eob> and it's also very difficult to flip them. <eob>
They are extremely complex, <eob> with many decision-makers, actors involved. <eob>
Let's take the example of the food system. <eob>
Food production is currently responsible <eob> for one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. <eob>
It is also a main user of the world's <eol> water resources. <eob>
In fact, 70 percent of today's water <eol> is used to grow crops. <eob>
Vast areas of tropical <eol> forest are used for agriculture. <eob>
This deforestation drives extinction. <eob>
In fact, we are losing species <eol> 1,000 times faster <eob> than the natural rate. <eob>
And on top of all of that bad news, <eob> one third of food produced today globally <eob> is not eaten. <eob> It's wasted. <eob>
But there is the good news, <eob> good signs. <eob>
Coalitions of stakeholders <eob> are now coming together <eol> to try to transform the food system <eob> with one shared goal: <eob> how to produce enough healthy food for everyone, <eob> at the same time, <eob> to try to cut, to sharply reduce, <eob> the footprint from the food system <eol> on the global commons. <eob>
I had an opportunity <eob> to fly over the Indonesian <eol> island of Sumatra, <eob> and I saw with my own eyes <eob> the massive deforestation <eob> to make room for palm oil plantations. <eob>
By the way, palm oil is included <eol> in thousands of food products <eob> we eat every day. <eob>
The global demand for palm oil <eol> is just increasing. <eob>
In Sumatra, I met smallholder farmers <eob> who need to make a day-to-day living <eol> from growing oil palm. <eob>
I met global food companies, <eob> financial institutions <eob> and local government officials. <eob>
All of them told me that they can't <eol> make the change by themselves, <eob> and only by working together <eol> under a kind of new contract, <eob> or a new practice, <eob> do they have a chance <eol> to protect tropical forests. <eob>
So it's so encouraging to see, <eol> at least for the last few years, <eob> this new coalition among these <eol> committed actors along the supply chain <eob> come together to try <eol> to transform the food system. <eob>
In fact, what they are trying to do <eob> is to create a new kind of social contract <eol> to manage the global commons. <eob>
All changes start at home, <eob> at your place and at my place. <eob>
At GEF, Global Environment Facility, <eob> we have now a new strategy, <eob> and we put the global commons <eol> at its center. <eob>
I hope we won't be the only ones. <eob>
If everybody stays on the sidelines, <eol> waiting for others to step in, <eob> the global commons <eol> will continue to deteriorate, <eob> and everybody will be much worse off. <eob>
We need to save ourselves <eol> from the tragedy of the commons. <eob>
So, I invite all of you to embrace <eol> the global commons. <eob>
Please do remember <eol> that global commons do exist <eob> and are waiting for your stewardship. <eob>
We all share one planet in common. <eob>
We breathe the same air, <eob> we drink the same water, <eob> we depend on the same oceans, <eol> forests, and biodiversity. <eob>
There is no space left on earth <eol> for egoism. <eob>
The global commons must be kept <eol> within their safe operating space, <eob> and we can only do it together. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I remember my aunt brushing <eol> my hair when I was a child. <eob>
I felt this tingling in my stomach, <eob> this swelling in my belly. <eob>
All her attention on me, <eob> just me. <eob>
My beautiful Aunt Bea, <eob> stroking my hair <eol> with a fine-bristled brush. <eob>
Do you have a memory like that that you <eol> can feel in your body right now? <eob>
Before language, <eob> we're all sensation. <eob>
As children, that's how we learn <eob> to differentiate ourselves in the world -- <eol> through touch. <eob>
Everything goes in the mouth, <eol> the hands, on the skin. <eob>
Sensation -- <eob> it is the way that we first experience love. <eob>
It's the basis of human connection. <eob>
We want our children to grow up <eol> to have healthy intimate relationships. <eob>
So as parents, <eob> one of the things that we do <eol> is we teach our children about sex. <eob>
We have books to help us, <eob> we have sex ed at school for the basics. <eob>
There's porn to fill in the gaps -- <eob> and it will fill in the gaps. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We teach our children "the talk" <eol> about biology and mechanics, <eob> about pregnancy and safe sex, <eob> and that's what our kids grow up thinking <eol> that sex is pretty much all about. <eob>
But we can do better than that. <eob>
We can teach our sons and daughters <eol> about pleasure and desire, <eob> about consent and boundaries, <eob> about what it feels like to be present in their body <eob> and to know when they're not. <eob>
And we do that in the ways <eol> that we model touch, play, <eob> make eye contact -- <eob> all the ways <eol> that we engage their senses. <eob>
We can teach our children <eol> not just about sex, <eob> but about sensuality. <eob>
This is the kind of talk <eol> that I needed as a girl. <eob>
I was extremely sensitive, <eob> but by the time I was an adolescent, <eob> I had numbed out. <eob>
The shame of boys mocking my changing body <eob> and then girls exiling me for, <eob> ironically, my interest in boys, <eob> it was so much. <eob>
I didn't have any language <eol> for what I was experiencing; <eob> I didn't know it was going to pass. <eob>
So I did the best thing <eol> I could at the time <eob> and I checked out. <eob>
And you can't isolate <eol> just the difficult feelings, <eob> so I lost access to the joy, <eol> the pleasure, the play, <eob> and I spent decades like that, <eob> with this his low-grade depression, <eob> thinking that this is what it meant <eol> to be a grown-up. <eob>
For the past year, <eob> I've been interviewing men <eol> and women about their relationship to sex <eob> and I've heard my story <eol> again and again. <eob>
Girls who were told <eol> they were too sensitive, too much. <eob>
Boys who were taught to man up -- <eob> "don't be so emotional." <eob> I learned I was not alone in checking out. <eob>
It was my daughter who reminded me <eol> of how much I used to feel. <eob>
We were at the beach. <eob>
It was this rare day. <eob>
I turned off my cell phone, <eob> put in the calendar, "Day at the beach with the girls." <eob> I laid our towels down just <eol> out of reach of the surf <eob> and fell asleep. <eob>
And when I woke up, <eob> I saw my daughter drizzling <eol> sand on her arm like this, <eob> and I could feel that light tickle <eol> of sand on her skin <eob> and I remembered my aunt <eol> brushing my hair. <eob>
So I curled up next to her <eob> and I drizzled sand on her <eol> other arm and then her legs. <eob>
And then I said, "Hey, <eol> you want me to bury you?" <eob> And her eyes got really big <eol> and she was like, "Yeah!" <eob> So we dug a hole <eob> and I covered her <eol> in sand and shells <eob> and drew this little mermaid tail. <eob>
And then I took her home and lathered <eol> her up in the shower <eob> and massaged her scalp <eob> and I dried her off in a towel. <eob>
And I thought, <eob> "Ah. How many times <eol> had I done that -- <eob> bathed her and dried her off -- <eob> but had I ever stopped and paid attention <eob> to the sensations that I was creating for her?" <eob> I'd been treating her like she was <eol> on some assembly line <eob> of children needing to be fed <eol> and put to bed. <eob>
And I realized <eob> that when I dry my daughter off <eol> in a towel tenderly the way a lover would, <eob> I'm teaching her to expect <eol> that kind of touch. <eob>
I'm teaching her in that moment <eol> about intimacy. <eob>
About how to love her body <eol> and respect her body. <eob>
I realized there are parts of the talk <eol> that can't be conveyed in words. <eob>
In her book, "Girls and Sex," <eob> writer Peggy Orenstein finds <eob> that young women are focusing <eol> on their partner's pleasure, <eob> not their own. <eob>
This is something I'm going to talk <eol> about with my girls when they're older, <eob> but for now, I look for ways to help them <eol> identify what gives them pleasure <eob> and to practice articulating that. <eob> "Rub my back," my daughter <eol> says when I tuck her in. <eob>
And I say, "OK, how do you want me <eol> to rub your back?" <eob> "I don't know," she says. <eob>
So I pause, waiting for her directions. <eob>
Finally she says, "OK, up <eol> and to the right, <eob> like you're tickling me." <eob> I run my fingertips <eol> up her spine. <eob> "What else?" I ask. <eob> "Over to the left, <eol> a little harder now." <eob>
We need to teach our children <eol> how to articulate their sensations <eob> so they're familiar with them. <eob>
I look for ways to play games <eol> with my girls at home to do this. <eob>
I scratch my fingernails <eol> on my daughter's arm and say, <eob> "Give me one word to describe this." <eob> "Violent," she says. <eob>
I embrace her, hold her tight. <eob> "Protected," she tells me. <eob>
I find opportunities to tell them <eol> how I'm feeling, <eob> what I'm experiencing, <eob> so we have common language. <eob>
Like right now, <eob> this tingling in my scalp down <eol> my spine means I'm nervous and I'm excited. <eob>
You are likely experiencing sensations <eol> in response to me. <eob>
The language I'm using, <eob> the ideas I'm sharing. <eob>
And our tendency is to judge <eol> these reactions <eob> and sort them into a hierarchy: <eob> better or worse, <eob> and then seek or avoid them. <eob>
And that's because we live <eol> in this binary culture <eob> and we're taught from a very young age <eol> to sort the world into good and bad. <eob> "Did you like that book?" <eob> "Did you have a good day?" <eob> How about, "What did you notice <eol> about that story?" <eob> "Tell me a moment about your day. <eob>
What did you learn?" <eob> Let's teach our children to stay open <eol> and curious about their experiences, <eob> like a traveler in a foreign land. <eob>
And that way they can stay <eol> with sensation without checking out -- <eob> even the heightened and challenging ones -- <eob> the way I did, <eob> the way so many of us have. <eob>
This sense education, <eob> this is education I want for my daughters. <eob>
Sense education is what I needed as girl. <eob>
It's what I hope for all of our children. <eob>
This awareness of sensation, <eob> it's where we began as children. <eob>
It's what we can learn from our children <eob> and it's what we can <eol> in turn remind our children <eob> as they come of age. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Let's talk about how the narrative <eol> of Africa is being told, <eob> and who is doing the telling. <eob>
I want to share with you <eol> the selection of work <eob> by contemporary artists <eol> from Africa and its diaspora. <eob>
I love this art. <eob>
I find it beautiful and inspiring <eol> and thrilling, <eob> and I really hope I am able <eol> to pique your interest. <eob>
I want to share something about myself <eol> and why art matters to me. <eob>
I'm the daughter of an artist, <eol> so that means that growing up, <eob> I had the chance to see my father <eol> do artwork in his studio. <eob>
My home was surrounded by art, <eob> and I had an early art education, <eob> being dragged to museums <eol> and exhibitions over the summer holidays. <eob>
What I did not understand, really, at the time, <eob> is that this also gave me an early understanding <eob> about why art is important, <eob> how to look at it, <eob> how to understand it, <eol> but also how to love it. <eob>
So art matters to me <eol> on a personal level, <eob> and not only because it's beautiful <eol> and inspiring and thrilling, <eob> but because art tells powerful stories. <eob>
All these artists have stories to tell you <eol> about what it means to be African, <eob> stories that tell you and touches <eol> about our African identity, <eob> but also stories that tell us <eol> about who we are as Africans, <eob> but also stories that tell us <eol> about our complex history. <eob>
So how can art tell you powerful stories? <eob>
I want to share with you this series <eob> by Senegalese artist Omar Victor Diop. <eob>
This is a series of self-portraits, <eob> and the artist in this particular series <eob> is focusing on the representation <eol> of Africans in art history <eob> between the 15th to the 19th century. <eob>
I want to show you how, <eol> with one image, <eob> Diop is able to touch <eol> on our African identity, <eob> on the politics of representation, <eob> but also on our social value system. <eob>
In this particular self-portrait, <eob> Diop is actually referencing <eol> another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet. <eob>
This picture is doing a portrait <eol> of Jean-Baptiste Belley. <eob>
Jean-Baptiste Belley was a native <eol> of Senegal, <eob> a former slave of Haiti, <eob> but during his lifetime, he also was elected <eol> to represent the colony <eob> at the third government <eol> of the French Revolution, <eob> and he advocated strongly <eol> for the abolition of slavery. <eob>
What is very smart and clever <eol> about Diop here <eob> is that he's going back to history. <eob>
He's reclaiming this figure <eob> by restaging this beautiful <eol> royal blue uniform, <eob> where he is restaging also the pose, <eob> and he's doing that to actually <eol> underline the issues <eob> that are still impacting individuals <eol> of color today. <eob>
There was nothing special <eob> about this very typical <eol> political portrait of the time, <eob> except that for the first time, <eob> an individual of color, in that case, <eol> Jean-Baptiste Belley, <eob> was actually named and acknowledged in a painting. <eob>
What Diop is adding <eol> to this picture is this crucial element, <eob> which is the football under his arm, <eob> and by doing that, <eob> Diop is actually touching <eol> at our hero worship culture <eob> of African football stars, <eob> who unfortunately, despite their fame, <eob> their immense talent, <eol> and their royalty status, <eob> they are still invisible. <eob>
Diop is asking us to dig deeper, <eob> to go beyond history <eol> and what has been written, <eob> and, basically, see how it still <eol> influences and impacts us in the present. <eob>
I want to share this other <eol> beautiful series <eob> called "Kesh Angels," by artist <eol> Hassan Hajjaj. <eob>
So in this particular series, <eob> the artist is really pushing <eol> on the boundaries <eob> of stereotype and cliché. <eob>
Hassan Hajjaj is a friend, <eob> and honestly, I admire him dearly, <eob> but this particular series is talking <eol> to me directly as a Muslim woman. <eob>
I experience this all the time, <eob> where, you know, people <eol> have a lot of expectations, <eob> religious ones and cultural ones, <eob> but what I love about this artist <eol> is that he's putting all this on its head. <eob>
He's actually challenging every representation <eob> of Muslim, Arabic women <eol> that there is. <eob>
Hassan Hajjaj is a child of the diaspora. <eob>
He grew up in Morocco <eol> amongst bright logo goods, <eob> you know, counterfeit originals <eol> being sold at the souks. <eob>
So to see those symbols <eol> representing in his work <eob> a celebration of the global culture, <eol> a critic of the global urban culture, <eob> is no surprise, <eob> but really at the heart of his work <eol> is his desire of a nuanced representation. <eob>
He wants us to interrupt ourselves <eob> and all the perception <eol> that we might have <eob> on people, on a culture, <eol> and on environment. <eob>
And for example, <eob> this particular picture, your common association would be, <eob> you know, certain street brand <eol> for a certain Western distinctive consumer. <eob>
Well, he mashes it all up, <eob> where he is daring <eol> to imagine a female biker culture <eob> where actually Chanel or Louis Vuitton <eol> is designing the djellaba, <eob> and Nike, the babouche, <eob> and this is actually the standard uniform. <eob>
What I love about the women <eol> in "Kesh Angels" <eob> is that they are able <eol> to hold your gaze. <eob>
We are completely participating in the image, <eob> but they are the one inviting us in, <eol> and on their own terms. <eob>
Hassan Hajjaj's "Kesh Angels" <eol> or "Project Diaspora" by Omar Victor Diop <eob> offer me two strong examples <eol> why art is so instrumental. <eob> It is instrumental as it really <eol> inspires us to ask questions, <eob> but it is also instrumental because it ignites change. <eob>
Seeing diversity in race and ethnicity <eol> in contemporary art <eob> is the only way that we'll see changes <eol> in the art industry, <eob> but also for the relations between Africa <eol> and the Western canon. <eob>
How we will participate in all <eol> this is really up to us. <eob>
There's a lot of progress to be made, <eob> and honestly, we still need <eol> to support stronger voices, <eob> as they are the ones shaking things up <eol> and bringing new perspective. <eob>
I want to share this beautiful old painting <eob> by younger emerging artist Kudzanai-Violet Hwami. <eob>
For me, when I see her work, <eol> it really represents freedom. <eob>
Hwami has fantastic takes on what <eol> it means to be an African <eob> and an African life. <eob>
She has lived in three different countries: <eob> Zimbabwe, South Africa and Britain, <eob> and therefore has been influenced <eol> by a multitude of layers <eob> of communities and cultures, <eob> from LGBT to eco to Xhosa to emo <eol> to British cultures. <eob>
And as she says herself, the beauty <eol> of being a child of the diaspora <eob> is really being able to reinvent ourselves <eob> and what it means to be African. <eob>
I want to leave you with this powerful piece <eob> by South African artist Lawrence <eol> Lemaoana. <eob>
Lawrence Lemaoana <eol> also criticized <eob> the influence of the media <eol> on our moral consciousness, <eob> and he's doing that by using those fabrics <eol> like banners in political demonstrations, <eob> where he's asking us to reclaim our voices. <eob>
I believe in the transformative power of art, <eob> as it is our only way <eol> to paint a nuanced image of Africa, <eob> but also its diaspora, <eob> one that will be painted <eol> by its artists and its cultural producers <eob> with their radical but also very unique view <eol> of seeing the world <eob> and their place in it. <eob>
It is really through art <eol> that we can regain <eob> our sense of agency and empowerment. <eob>
It is through art that we can really <eol> tell our own story. <eob>
So like Lawrence Lemaoana <eol> says, the power is ours. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So many of us who care <eol> about sustainable development <eob> and the livelihood <eol> of local people <eob> do so for deeply personal reasons. <eob>
I grew up in Cameroon, <eob> a country of enchanting beauty <eol> and rich biodiversity, <eob> but plagued by poor governance, <eol> environmental destruction, and poverty. <eob> As a child, like we see <eol> with most children in sub-Saharan Africa today, <eob> I regularly suffered from malaria. <eob>
To this day, more than one million people <eol> die from malaria every year, <eob> mostly children under the age of five, <eob> with 90 percent occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. <eob>
When I was 18, I left Cameroon <eob> in search of better educational opportunities. <eob>
At the time, there was just one university <eol> in Cameroon, <eob> but Nigeria next door <eol> offered some opportunities <eob> for Cameroonians of English extraction <eol> to be trained in various fields. <eob>
So I moved there, <eob> but practicing my trade, <eob> upon graduation as an ecologist in Nigeria, <eob> was an even bigger challenge. <eob>
So I left the continent <eob> when I was offered a scholarship <eol> to Boston University for my PhD. <eob>
It is disheartening to see that, <eob> with all our challenges, <eob> with all the talents, <eob> with all the skills we have in Africa as a continent, <eob> we tend to solve our problems <eob> by parachuting in experts <eol> from the West for short stays, <eob> exporting the best and brightest out of Africa, <eob> and treating Africa as a continent in perpetual <eol> need of handouts. <eob>
After my training at Boston University, <eob> I joined a research team <eob> at the University of California's <eob> Institute of the Environment <eol> and Sustainability <eob> because of its reputation <eol> for groundbreaking research <eob> and the development of policies and programs <eob> that save the lives of millions <eol> of people the world over, <eob> including in the developing world. <eob>
And it has been shown <eob> that for every skilled African <eol> that returns home, <eob> nine new jobs are created in the formal <eol> and informal sectors. <eob>
So as part of our program, therefore, <eol> to build a sustainable Africa together, <eob> we are leading a multi-initiative to develop <eol> the Congo Basin Institute, <eob> a permanent base <eob> where Africans can work in partnership <eol> with international researchers, <eob> but working out their own solutions <eol> to their own problems. <eob>
We are using our interdisciplinary approach <eol> to show how universities, <eob> NGOs and private business <eob> can partner in international development. <eob>
So instead of parachuting in experts <eol> from the West for short stays, <eob> we are building a permanent <eol> presence in Africa, <eob> a one-stop shop <eol> for logistics, housing <eob> and development of collaborative projects <eob> between Africans and international researchers. <eob>
So this has allowed students like Michel <eob> to receive high-quality <eol> training in Africa. <eob>
Michel is currently working in our labs <eob> to investigate the effects <eol> of climate change on insects, for his PhD, <eob> and has already secured <eol> his post-doctorate fellowship <eob> that will enable him <eol> to stay on the continent. <eob>
Also through our local help program, <eob> Dr. Gbenga Abiodun, a young Nigerian scientist, <eob> can work as a post-doctoral fellow <eob> with the Foundation <eol> for Professional Development <eob> in the University of Western Cape in South Africa <eob> and the University of California <eol> at the same time, <eob> investigating the effects <eol> of climate variability and change <eob> on malaria transmission in Africa. <eob>
Indeed, Gbenga is currently developing models <eob> that will be used as an early warning system <eob> to predict malaria transmission <eol> in Africa. <eob>
So rather than exporting our best <eol> and brightest out of Africa, <eob> we are nurturing and supporting local <eol> talent in Africa. <eob>
For example, like me, <eob> Dr. Eric Fokam was trained in the US. <eob>
He returned home to Cameroon, <eol> but couldn't secure the necessary grants, <eob> and he found it incredibly challenging <eob> to practice and learn the science <eol> he knew he could. <eob>
So when I met Eric, <eob> he was on the verge <eol> of returning to the US. <eob>
But we convinced him <eol> to start collaborating <eob> with the Congo Basin Institute. <eob>
Today, his lab in Buea has over half <eol> a dozen collaborative grants <eob> with researchers from the US and Europe <eob> supporting 14 graduate students, <eol> nine of them women, <eob> all carrying out groundbreaking research <eob> understanding biodiversity <eol> under climate change, <eob> human health and nutrition. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So rather than buy into the ideas <eol> of Africa taking handouts, <eob> we are using our interdisciplinary approach <eob> to empower Africans to find their own solutions. <eob>
Right now, we are working <eol> with local communities and students, <eob> a US entrepreneur, <eob> scientists from the US and Africa <eob> to find a way to sustainably grow ebony, <eol> the iconic African hardwood. <eob>
Ebonies, like most African hardwood, <eol> are exploited for timber, <eob> but we know very little about their ecology, <eob> what disperses them, <eob> how they survive in our forest 80 to 200 years. <eob>
This is Arvin, <eob> a young PhD student <eol> working in our labs, <eob> conducting what is turning out to be <eol> some cutting-edge tissue culture work. <eob>
Arvin is holding in her hands <eob> the first ebony tree <eol> that was produced entirely from tissues. <eob>
This is unique in Africa. <eob>
We can now show <eol> that you can produce African timber <eob> from different plant tissues -- <eob> leaves, stems, roots -- <eob> in addition from generating them from seeds, <eob> which is a very difficult task. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So other students will take <eol> the varieties of ebony <eob> which Arvin identifies in our lab, <eob> graft them to produce saplings, <eob> and work with local communities <eol> to co-produce ebony <eob> with local fruit tree species <eol> in their various farms <eob> using our own tree farm approach, <eob> whereby we invite all the farmers <eob> to choose their own tree species <eol> they want in their farms. <eob>
So in addition to the ebony, <eob> the species which the farmers <eol> choose themselves <eob> will be produced using our modern techniques <eob> and incorporated into their land-use systems, <eob> so that they start benefiting <eol> from these products <eob> while waiting for the ebony to mature. <eob>
Today we are planting 15,000 ebony trees <eol> in Cameroon, <eob> and for the first time, <eob> ebony won't be harvested <eol> from the middle of a pristine forest. <eob>
This is the model for our African hardwoods, <eob> and we are extending this <eol> to include sapele and bubinga, <eob> other highly prized hardwoods. <eob>
So if these examples existed <eol> when I was 18, <eob> I would never have left, <eob> but because of initiatives by <eol> the Congo Basin Institute, <eob> I am coming back, <eob> but I'm not coming back alone. <eob>
I'm bringing with me <eol> Western scientists, <eob> entrepreneurs and students, <eob> the best science <eol> from the best universities in the world, <eob> to work and to live in Africa. <eob>
But we all need to scale up <eol> this local, powerful and empowering approach. <eob> So far we have half a dozen <eol> universities and NGOs as partners. <eob>
We are planning to build <eob> a green facility that will expand <eol> on our existing laboratory space <eob> and add more housing <eol> and conference facilities <eob> to promote a long-term disciplinary approach. <eob>
I want it to offer more opportunities <eol> to young African scholars, <eob> and would scale it up by leveraging <eob> the International Institute <eol> of Tropical Agriculture's existing network <eob> of 17 research stations <eol> across sub-Saharan Africa. <eob>
The tables are starting to turn ... <eob> and I hope they keep turning, <eob> to reach several African nations <eob> like Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal, <eob> among the top fastest growing economies <eob> that can attract several opportunities <eol> for private-sector investment. <eob>
We want to give more opportunities <eol> to African scholars, <eob> and I long to see a day <eob> when the most intelligent Africans <eol> will stay on this continent <eob> and receive high-quality education <eob> through initiatives like the Congo Basin Institute, <eob> and when that happens, <eob> Africa will be on the way <eol> to solving Africa's problems. <eob>
And in 50 years, I hope someone <eol> will be giving a TED Talk <eob> on how to stop the brain drain <eol> of Westerners leaving your homes <eob> to work and live in Africa. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
By the year 2050, the population <eol> of Africa will have doubled. <eob>
One in four people on Earth <eol> will be African at that point, <eob> and this is both really exciting <eol> and daunting all at once. <eob>
It's really exciting because, <eol> for the first time in the modern era, <eob> there will be enough Africans <eol> on the Earth to bully everybody else. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm only kidding. <eob>
But it's daunting, because <eol> we're going to have to have economies <eob> that can sustain this population growth, <eob> and many of the people are going <eol> to be very young. <eob>
Now most of governments in Africa <eol> have a plan for this economic growth -- <eob> in Kenya, we call ours Vision2030 -- <eob> and they're all predicated <eol> on industrialization. <eob>
The thing is, though, that the world <eob> is going through <eol> the Fourth Industrial Revolution right now, <eob> which means that there's a merger <eob> of the physical, cyber, <eol> and biological worlds. <eob>
It means that because <eol> of massive interconnectivity <eob> and the availability of artificial <eol> intelligence and robotics, <eob> many of the jobs <eol> that we know and are used to right now <eob> won't exist in the future. <eob>
So the challenge is a lot greater, <eol> in many ways, <eob> than it even was when Asia <eol> was industrializing, for example. <eob>
To add to this, one of the kinds <eol> of person that you need <eob> for industrialization is an engineer, <eob> and they're really in short supply <eol> on the continent. <eob>
If you compare, for example, <eol> the number of engineers <eob> that those same Asian countries had <eob> a couple of decades ago <eol> when they were industrializing, <eob> we fall far short. <eob>
And I've taught for a while, <eob> and many of the students <eol> who are studying engineering <eob> end up actually working <eol> in auditing firms and banks, <eob> and many of them spend half their time <eol> doing accounting and so on <eob> as they're preparing. <eob>
Now, I was fortunate enough <eol> to do my undergrad and postgrad education <eob> in the UK and the US, in countries, environments, <eob> where there was all the equipment <eol> that you required, <eob> all the sophistication in the systems, <eob> and then I worked <eol> for about three years in Japan <eob> doing R & amp; D for a large firm. <eob>
And so I was very used <eol> to having good equipment, <eob> and went back home <eob> and joined the Faculty of Engineering <eol> at the University of Nairobi, <eob> wanting to contribute and be on the continent. <eob>
And I quickly found <eol> I was really quite useless, <eob> because there wasn't all the equipment <eol> that I had become accustomed to available. <eob>
And I was teaching students <eol> who I would find very bright ideas in their minds <eob> and they'd be presenting things <eol> that I knew <eob> if only we had sufficient equipment, <eob> they'd be able to really contribute <eol> to the challenge of industrialization. <eob>
So I kind of had to change hats, <eol> and became quite entrepreneurial <eob> and started looking for money <eol> to buy the equipment that we required. <eob>
And I heard about a concept out of MIT, <eol> called the Fab Labs. <eob>
These are digital fabrication labs <eob> that allow, in a rather small space <eol> with not very expensive equipment, <eob> people to have access <eol> to these tools <eob> to be able to make almost anything, <eob> as the slogan goes. <eob>
And so I was able to convince <eol> a government official <eob> to buy one of these for the university <eol> where I was teaching. <eob>
And immediately, we had wonderful results. <eob>
We saw all kinds of innovations <eol> coming through, <eob> and for the first time <eol> in this context at the university, <eob> engineering students from different disciplines <eob> were doing the lab and practical exercises <eol> together in the same space. <eob>
Normally, they'd be siloed. <eob>
And not just that, but students <eol> who weren't engineers at all <eob> were also working in the same place, <eob> and non-students, people <eol> who had nothing to do with the university, <eob> were also coming into this space. <eob>
So you had this rich mix of people, <eob> people who think differently from one another, <eob> and this always is really good for innovation. <eob>
I was really proud of what we were seeing. <eob>
So you can imagine my surprise <eob> when one day the dean <eol> of engineering came and said to me, <eob> "Kamau, the students <eol> who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab <eob> are failing their exams." <eob> I said, "What do you mean?" <eob> And I looked into it, and he was right, <eob> and the reason they were failing <eob> is that they'd honed their skills <eol> so well in certain things <eob> that they were going out into the city <eol> and offering services for money. <eob>
So they were making money -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and they therefore weren't focusing <eol> on their studies. <eob>
And I thought, what a good <eol> problem to have. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Don't quote me on that. <eol> I'm an academician. <eob>
So we needed to scale this, <eob> and at the university, things <eol> were a bit too bureaucratic, <eob> and so I moved out and I hooked up with people <eol> who, in Nairobi, <eob> were providing spaces for IT experts <eob> to share fast internet <eol> and things like that. <eob>
And some of these places <eol> are really quite famous. <eob>
They've made Kenya famous for IT. <eob>
And together we set up a space <eol> which we are setting up right now. <eob>
We've moved from where we were. <eob> We are in a much larger space, <eob> and we're sort of making <eol> available a wide range of equipment, <eob> including the digital fabrication <eol> tools that I mentioned, <eob> and analog tools, <eob> to anybody really, on a membership basis. <eob>
It's a bit like a gym, <eol> so you come in, you pay, <eob> you get taught how to use the equipment, <eob> and then you're set free to innovate <eol> and do whatever it is that you want, <eob> and you don't have to be <eol> an engineer, necessarily. <eob>
And some of the people in the space <eol> are setting up a small company. <eob>
They just need a space at a desk, <eob> and so we provide that at a fee, <eob> and others take up bigger spaces <eol> and are able to set up their offices. <eob>
They're further along. <eob>
Maybe their company has been running <eol> for a certain period of time. <eob>
And so we're able to accommodate all of this <eob> in an innovation space that is really <eol> quite active. <eob>
What you're seeing in this image <eol> over here is Douglas, <eob> and Douglas <eol> is an electrical engineer, <eob> one of the people who was really active <eol> in the Fab Lab. <eob>
I'm pretty sure he passed his exams. <eob>
And the image on the top left <eol> is a copper sheet. <eob>
And he designed a circuit <eol> that the client came to him and said, <eob> "I need this circuit <eol> for a pay-as-you-go system." <eob> And so this is a model for business <eob> that's made accessibility <eol> to goods and services for very poor people <eob> really much easier, because they're able <eol> to pay a little bit, <eob> like a dollar a day, for example, <eob> for a specific service. <eob>
And so this company wanted <eol> to pilot a new idea that they had, <eob> and so they just needed 50 circuits, <eob> so they hired him to make them, <eob> and what you're seeing him <eol> doing there is, <eob> he's able to design on the computer <eol> what the circuit will be <eob> and then transfer it to an etching process -- <eob> that's the image on the top right -- <eob> and then populate the board <eol> using this robot. <eob>
And so what would normally take him <eol> maybe a day or something to solder by hand, <eob> he can do in a few minutes <eol> using this machine. <eob>
So he was able to complete <eol> the entire order within Gearbox, <eob> and this is really important, <eob> because if it wasn't <eol> for what we provided right now, <eob> he would have had to have hired <eol> a company in China to do this, <eob> and because it's such a small order, <eol> it would have taken a long time. <eob>
It would be a small company, <eob> because big companies <eol> wouldn't take small orders, <eob> and even then, if they got a bigger order, <eob> they'd bump him off <eol> in favor of that. <eob>
And there's language problems and so on, <eob> so being able to do it in country <eol> is really very important, <eob> and of course piloting as a phase <eol> within the progress of the business idea <eob> is extremely important, because you can go back <eol> and make corrections and so on. <eob>
In this image — Thank you. <eob>
In this image you see on the top left, <eob> what you're looking at is a 3D render <eol> of a digital fabrication machine. <eob> In this instance, it doubles <eol> as a plasma cutter <eob> and also a wood router. <eob>
And so the plasma cutter makes possible <eol> the cutting of plate and sheet metal, <eob> and basically, you make a design on the computer <eob> and send it over to the machine, <eob> and then quickly and precisely, <eol> it will cut the shapes you want. <eob>
But in this machine, <eob> you can also change the plasma <eol> cutter and put on a spindle, <eob> and then you can carve wood as well. <eob>
So this was designed by my <eol> Head of Engineering. <eob>
His name is Wachira, <eob> and when I hired him <eol> about two years ago, <eob> I asked him, "Just give me two years, <eob> and by the time you've trained <eol> a lot of people <eob> so that we have <eol> good staff under you, <eob> then you can move out and become <eol> a good story for us." <eob> And that's exactly what's just happened. <eob>
He's got two types of customers. <eob>
The higher-tier customer <eob> is a company that's actually <eol> using his machine <eob> to cut sheet metal <eol> for Isuzu truck fabrication in Nairobi, <eob> which is being done by General Motors. <eob>
So we're really proud to be able to say <eob> that we have an original equipment <eol> manufacturer in Nairobi <eob> that's provided what's effectively <eol> an industrial robot <eob> to supply parts for General Motors. <eob>
Now this is really important -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
and it's really important because <eol> the population growth being what it is, <eob> a lot of very large companies <eol> are looking very closely <eob> at the market that's developing in Africa. <eob>
So in Kenya right now, <eol> we have Volkswagen, Peugeot, Renault, <eob> we have Mercedes doing lorries, <eob> and we've also got Toyota, <eol> they've been there a long time. <eob>
And these are all manufacturers <eol> planning to assemble vehicles <eob> and in the future, to manufacture in the country. <eob>
Many of them are planning to train lots <eol> of people that they'd hire, <eob> and that's really important <eol> for the economy, <eob> but when the magic really happens, <eob> when these companies begin <eol> to buy their parts for the vehicles <eob> from local companies, <eob> so supply chain development is something <eol> that's very important <eob> for us to be able to pivot <eol> and to have very productive economies, <eob> and that's something <eol> we're focused on at our space. <eob>
This other image shows another class <eol> of customer that he has. <eob>
On the top left, <eob> you have these people who are actually <eol> using very crude tools <eob> to work metal and wood. <eob>
And Kenya has a population <eol> of about 44 million people. <eob>
The work force is about 13 million, <eob> and about 80 to 90 percent of those <eol> are in the informal sector. <eob>
And what you're seeing in the image <eol> at the top left over there <eob> is very typical of semi-skilled artisans <eob> who are making products <eol> for the marketplace <eob> that are really crude. <eob>
Their production rate is very slow. <eob>
The quality of the product isn't high. <eob>
And so we've teamed Wachira up with a bank, <eob> and the bank is paying him <eol> to train people from this sector <eob> on how to use this industrial robot. <eob>
And the result is that some of them <eob> are going to be able to get loans <eol> to buy the machine for themselves. <eob>
Others will be able to go to centers <eol> where they can carry their material, <eob> get the design done, <eob> and take the materials back <eol> that have been made really, really fast <eob> and assemble them in their own spaces. <eob>
So somebody making a gate, <eol> for example, out of metal, <eob> may take a week to make <eol> just one gate, <eob> but with this machine, <eol> they might make 10 in a day. <eob>
So the productivity of a large <eol> swathe of our population <eob> should be able to jump <eol> by a quantum amount, quite significantly, <eob> because of this kind of machine. <eob>
And that's what we're at the beginning <eol> of, so this is really very exciting. <eob>
This is another person who uses our space. <eob>
Her name is Esther. <eob>
She's in her mid-20s, <eob> and she came in very passionate <eol> about a problem that she explained. <eob>
She said that schools days <eol> are missed every month by young girls <eob> because of their menstrual cycle, <eob> and they're not able to buy <eol> a sanitary towel. <eob>
And the reason that she described <eob> was that the manufacturers <eol> packaged these in bundles of seven to 10, <eob> and breaking it down is unhygienic <eol> at the retail level, <eob> and packaging <eol> each one of them is too expensive. <eob>
So she thought up an idea, <eol> which is brilliant, and simple. <eob>
Why don't we just use vending machines? <eob>
And she, in a very clean environment, <eol> can break down the bundles <eob> and fill up the vending machines, <eob> and then girls can buy <eol> these sanitary towels <eob> in the privacy of a toilet, <eol> in a public space, in a school, and so on. <eob> She was able to pilot this <eol> and it worked really very well, <eob> and she's been able to sort of get the bugs out and so on. <eob>
So the significance here is that <eol> the piloting process is possible. <eob>
She's not an engineer. <eob>
She was able to engage people <eol> in our space to be able to help her to do this, <eob> and she's off and running now <eol> with a business accelerator, <eob> so we expect to see great results. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In this image you're looking at -- <eob> the result of a master's project <eol> that was done at University of Nairobi <eob> by Tony Nyagah, an engineering student, <eob> and he just integrated a solar cell <eol> into a roof tile <eob> and decided to make it a business. <eob>
He joined up with his sister <eol> who is an architect, <eob> and they have this business, <eob> and they present the roof tile <eol> to a person who is doing development and say, <eob> "You can buy it for the cost <eol> of just the roof tile without the solar." <eob> So they're giving it <eol> at a discount, <eob> and then they'll build them <eol> using the internet of things over time, <eob> they'll pay about a third of the utility charges <eol> for the electricity <eob> and they can sell the excess back to the grid. <eob>
And so they'll make <eol> their money over time, <eob> and they've been able to do <eol> quite a few installments. <eob>
We were very proud to be able to show <eol> this to somebody kind of famous, <eob> as you can see there, <eob> and this other famous guy <eol> actually presented the same idea, <eob> but as far as we're concerned, <eol> if it was after us, so -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So in closing, going forward, <eol> of course being able to prototype <eob> and do low manufacturing in this <eol> kind of a setting <eob> is very important for the industrialization process, <eob> but we're also taking advantage <eol> of a lot of new ways of doing things: <eob> the open source movement, <eob> distributive manufacturing, circular production. <eob>
So it's all very important <eol> for not just industrializing <eob> and being able to meet people's needs, <eob> but also making sure that the environment <eol> is taken care of. <eob>
We're also really interested in culture. <eob>
We have lots of discussions in our space <eol> around who we were as Africans, <eob> who we are today, and who we want to be <eob> vis-à-vis things like consumerism and ethnicity <eol> and corruption and so on. <eob>
So we see ourselves as providing, <eol> adding value to people <eob> by teaching them to add value <eol> to things or materials <eob> so that they can build things that matter. <eob>
Thank you very much for your attention. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I would like to begin <eol> with a little experiment. <eob>
In a moment, I'm going to ask <eol> if you would close your eyes <eob> and see if you can work out <eob> what emotions you're feeling right now. <eob>
Now, you're not going to tell anyone <eol> or anything. <eob>
The idea is to see how easy <eol> or perhaps hard you find it <eob> to pinpoint exactly what you're feeling. <eob>
And I thought I'd give you <eol> 10 seconds to do this. <eob>
OK? <eob>
Right, let's start. <eob>
OK, that's it, time's up. <eob>
How did it go? <eob>
You were probably feeling <eol> a little bit under pressure, <eob> maybe suspicious of the person next to you. <eob>
Did they definitely <eol> have their eyes closed? <eob>
Perhaps you felt some strange, distant worry <eob> about that email <eol> you sent this morning <eob> or excitement about something <eol> you've got planned for this evening. <eob>
Maybe you felt that exhilaration <eol> that comes when we get together <eob> in big groups of people like this; <eob> the Welsh called it "hwyl," <eob> from the word for boat sails. <eob>
Or maybe you felt all of these things. <eob>
There are some emotions which wash <eol> the world in a single color, <eob> like the terror felt as a car skids. <eob>
But more often, our emotions <eol> crowd and jostle together <eob> until it is actually quite hard to tell them apart. <eob>
Some slide past so quickly <eol> you'd hardly even notice them, <eob> like the nostalgia <eol> that will make you reach out <eob> to grab a familiar brand <eol> in the supermarket. <eob>
And then there are others <eol> that we hurry away from, <eob> fearing that they'll burst on us, <eob> like the jealousy that causes <eol> you to search a loved one's pockets. <eob>
And of course, there are some <eol> emotions which are so peculiar, <eob> you might not even know what to call them. <eob>
Perhaps sitting there, you had a little tingle <eol> of a desire <eob> for an emotion one eminent <eol> French sociologist called "ilinx," <eob> the delirium that comes <eol> with minor acts of chaos. <eob>
For example, if you stood up right now <eol> and emptied the contents of your bag <eob> all over the floor. <eob>
Perhaps you experienced <eol> one of those odd, untranslatable emotions <eob> for which there's no obvious English equivalent. <eob>
You might have felt the feeling <eol> the Dutch called "gezelligheid," <eob> being cozy and warm inside with friends <eol> when it's cold and damp outside. <eob>
Maybe if you were really lucky, <eob> you felt this: <eob> "basorexia," <eob> a sudden urge to kiss someone. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We live in an age <eob> when knowledge of emotions <eol> is an extremely important commodity, <eob> where emotions are used <eol> to explain many things, <eob> exploited by our politicians, <eob> manipulated by algorithms. <eob>
Emotional intelligence, which is the skill <eol> of being able to recognize and name <eob> your own emotions and those of other people, <eob> is considered so important, that this is taught <eol> in our schools and businesses <eob> and encouraged <eol> by our health services. <eob>
But despite all of this, <eob> I sometimes wonder <eob> if the way we think about emotions <eol> is becoming impoverished. <eob>
Sometimes, we're not even that clear <eol> what an emotion even is. <eob>
You've probably heard the theory <eob> that our entire emotional lives <eol> can be boiled down <eob> to a handful of basic emotions. <eob>
This idea is actually about 2,000 years old, <eob> but in our own time, <eob> some evolutionary psychologists <eol> have suggested that these six emotions -- <eob> happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise -- <eob> are expressed by everyone <eol> across the globe in exactly the same way, <eob> and therefore represent the building blocks <eob> of our entire emotional lives. <eob>
Well, if you look at an emotion like this, <eob> then it looks like a simple reflex: <eob> it's triggered by an external predicament, <eob> it's hardwired, <eob> it's there to protect us from harm. <eob>
So you see a bear, your heart rate quickens, <eob> your pupils dilate, you feel frightened, <eol> you run very, very fast. <eob>
The problem with this picture is, <eob> it doesn't entirely <eol> capture what an emotion is. <eob>
Of course, the physiology <eol> is extremely important, <eob> but it's not the only reason <eol> why we feel the way we do <eob> at any given moment. <eob>
What if I was to tell you <eol> that in the 12th century, <eob> some troubadours didn't see yawning <eob> as caused by tiredness <eol> or boredom like we do today, <eob> but thought it a symbol <eol> of the deepest love? <eob>
Or that in that same period, <eol> brave men -- knights -- <eob> commonly fainted out of dismay? <eob>
What if I was to tell you <eob> that some early Christians <eol> who lived in the desert <eob> believed that flying demons <eol> who mainly came out at lunchtime <eob> could infect them with an emotion <eol> they called "accidie," <eob> a kind of lethargy that was sometimes so intense <eob> it could even kill them? <eob>
Or that boredom, as we know <eol> and love it today, <eob> was first really only felt by the Victorians, <eob> in response to new ideas <eol> about leisure time and self-improvement? <eob>
What if we were to think again <eob> about those odd, untranslatable words for emotions <eob> and wonder whether some cultures might feel <eol> an emotion more intensely <eob> just because they've bothered <eol> to name and talk about it, <eob> like the Russian "toska," <eob> a feeling of maddening dissatisfaction <eob> said to blow in from the great plains. <eob>
The most recent developments in cognitive science show <eob> that emotions are not simple reflexes, <eob> but immensely complex, elastic systems <eob> that respond both to the biologies <eol> that we've inherited <eob> and to the cultures that we live in now. <eob>
They are cognitive phenomena. <eob>
They're shaped not just by our bodies, <eol> but by our thoughts, <eob> our concepts, our language. <eob>
The neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has become very interested <eob> in this dynamic relationship <eol> between words and emotions. <eob>
She argues that when we learn <eol> a new word for an emotion, <eob> new feelings are sure to follow. <eob>
As a historian, I've long suspected that as language changes, <eob> our emotions do, too. <eob>
When we look to the past, it's easy to see <eol> that emotions have changed, <eob> sometimes very dramatically, <eob> in response to new cultural expectations <eol> and religious beliefs, <eob> new ideas about gender, <eol> ethnicity and age, <eob> even in response <eol> to new political and economic ideologies. <eob>
There is a historicity to emotions <eob> that we are only recently <eol> starting to understand. <eob>
So I agree absolutely that it does us <eol> good to learn new words for emotions, <eob> but I think we need to go further. <eob>
I think to be truly emotionally intelligent, <eob> we need to understand <eol> where those words have come from, <eob> and what ideas about how <eol> we ought to live and behave <eob> they are smuggling along with them. <eob>
Let me tell you a story. <eob>
It begins in a garret <eol> in the late 17th century, <eob> in the Swiss university town of Basel. <eob>
Inside, there's a dedicated student living <eol> some 60 miles away from home. <eob>
He stops turning up to his lectures, <eob> and his friends come to visit <eol> and they find him dejected and feverish, <eob> having heart palpitations, <eob> strange sores breaking out on his body. <eob>
Doctors are called, <eob> and they think it's so serious <eol> that prayers are said for him <eob> in the local church. <eob>
And it's only when they're preparing <eol> to return this young man home <eob> so that he can die, <eob> that they realize what's going on, <eob> because once they lift him <eol> onto the stretcher, <eob> his breathing becomes less labored. <eob>
And by the time he's got <eol> to the gates of his hometown, <eob> he's almost entirely recovered. <eob>
And that's when they realize <eob> that he's been suffering <eol> from a very powerful form of homesickness. <eob>
It's so powerful, <eol> that it might have killed him. <eob>
Well, in 1688, a young doctor, Johannes Hofer, <eob> heard of this case and others like it <eob> and christened the illness <eol> "nostalgia." <eob> The diagnosis quickly caught <eol> on in medical circles around Europe. <eob>
The English actually thought <eol> they were probably immune <eob> because of all the travel they did <eol> in the empire and so on. <eob>
But soon there were cases cropping <eol> up in Britain, too. <eob>
The last person to die from nostalgia <eob> was an American soldier fighting <eol> during the First World War in France. <eob>
How is it possible that you could die <eol> from nostalgia <eob> less than a hundred years ago? <eob>
But today, not only does the word mean <eol> something different -- <eob> a sickening for a lost <eol> time rather than a lost place -- <eob> but homesickness itself <eol> is seen as less serious, <eob> sort of downgraded from something <eol> you could die from <eob> to something you're mainly worried your kid <eol> might be suffering from <eob> at a sleepover. <eob>
This change seems to have happened <eol> in the early 20th century. <eob> But why? <eob> Was it the invention of telephones <eol> or the expansion of the railways? <eob>
Was it perhaps the coming <eol> of modernity, <eob> with its celebration of restlessness <eol> and travel and progress <eob> that made sickening for the familiar <eob> seem rather unambitious? <eob>
You and I inherit <eol> that massive transformation in values, <eob> and it's one reason <eol> why we might not feel homesickness today <eob> as acutely as we used to. <eob>
It's important to understand <eob> that these large historical <eol> changes influence our emotions <eob> partly because they affect <eol> how we feel about how we feel. <eob>
Today, we celebrate happiness. <eob>
Happiness is supposed <eol> to make us better workers <eob> and parents and partners; <eob> it's supposed to make <eol> us live longer. <eob>
In the 16th century, <eob> sadness was thought <eol> to do most of those things. <eob>
It's even possible to read self-help books <eol> from that period <eob> which try to encourage <eol> sadness in readers <eob> by giving them lists of reasons <eol> to be disappointed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
These self-help authors thought <eol> you could cultivate sadness as a skill, <eob> since being expert in it would make you more resilient <eob> when something bad did happen to you, <eol> as invariably it would. <eob>
I think we could learn from this today. <eob>
Feel sad today, and you might feel <eol> impatient, even a little ashamed. <eob>
Feel sad in the 16th century, <eol> and you might feel a little bit smug. <eob>
Of course, our emotions <eol> don't just change across time, <eob> they also change from place to place. <eob>
The Baining people of Papua New Guinea <eol> speak of "awumbuk," <eob> a feeling of lethargy that descends when a houseguest finally leaves. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, you or I might feel relief, <eob> but in Baining culture, <eob> departing guests are thought <eol> to shed a sort of heaviness <eob> so they can travel more easily, <eob> and this heaviness infects the air and causes this awumbuk. <eob>
And so what they do is leave <eol> a bowl of water out overnight <eob> to absorb this air, <eob> and then very early the next morning, <eol> they wake up and have a ceremony <eob> and throw the water away. <eob>
Now, here's a good example <eob> of spiritual practices <eol> and geographical realities combining <eob> to bring a distinct emotion into life <eob> and make it disappear again. <eob>
One of my favorite emotions <eol> is a Japanese word, "amae." <eob> Amae is a very common word in Japan, <eob> but it is actually quite hard to translate. <eob>
It means something like the pleasure <eol> that you get <eob> when you're able to temporarily hand <eol> over responsibility for your life <eob> to someone else. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, anthropologists suggest <eob> that one reason why this word <eol> might have been named and celebrated <eob> in Japan <eob> is because of that country's traditionally collectivist culture, <eob> whereas the feeling of dependency <eob> may be more fraught <eol> amongst English speakers, <eob> who have learned to value self-sufficiency <eol> and individualism. <eob>
This might be a little simplistic, <eob> but it is tantalizing. <eob>
What might our emotional languages <eol> tell us not just about what we feel, <eob> but about what we value most? <eob>
Most people who tell us <eol> to pay attention to our well-being <eob> talk of the importance <eol> of naming our emotions. <eob>
But these names aren't neutral labels. <eob>
They are freighted with our culture's values <eol> and expectations, <eob> and they transmit ideas <eol> about who we think we are. <eob>
Learning new and unusual words <eol> for emotions will help attune us <eob> to the more finely grained aspects <eol> of our inner lives. <eob>
But more than this, I think <eol> these words are worth caring about, <eob> because they remind us <eol> how powerful the connection is <eob> between what we think <eob> and how we end up feeling. <eob>
True emotional intelligence <eol> requires that we understand <eob> the social, the political, <eol> the cultural forces <eob> that have shaped what we've come to believe <eol> about our emotions <eob> and understand how happiness <eol> or hatred or love or anger <eob> might still be changing now. <eob>
Because if we want to measure our emotions <eob> and teach them in our schools <eob> and listen as our politicians <eol> tell us how important they are, <eob> then it is a good idea that we understand <eob> where the assumptions we have about them <eob> have come from, <eob> and whether they still truly <eol> speak to us now. <eob>
I want to end with an emotion I often feel <eob> when I'm working as a historian. <eob>
It's a French word, <eol> "dépaysement." <eob> It evokes the giddy disorientation <eol> that you feel in an unfamiliar place. <eob>
One of my favorite parts of being a historian <eob> is when something <eol> I've completely taken for granted, <eob> some very familiar part of my life, <eob> is suddenly made strange again. <eob>
Dépaysement is unsettling, <eob> but it's exciting, too. <eob>
And I hope you might be having <eol> just a little glimpse of it right now. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My journey away from violent extremism <eol> began 22 years ago, <eob> when I denounced racism <eob> and left the American white supremacist skinhead movement <eob> that I had helped build. <eob>
(Cheers and applause) <eob>
I was just 22 years old at the time, <eob> but I had already spent eight years, <eol> from the time I was 14 years old, <eob> as one of the earliest <eol> and youngest members <eob> and an eventual leader within America's <eol> most violent hate movement. <eob>
But I wasn't born into hate; <eob> in fact, it was quite the opposite. <eob>
I had a relatively normal childhood. <eob>
My parents are Italian immigrants <eob> who came to the United States <eol> in the mid-1960s <eob> and settled on the South Side of Chicago, <eob> where they eventually met, <eob> and opened a small beauty shop. <eob>
Right after I was born, things <eol> got a little bit more difficult. <eob>
They struggled to survive with raising <eol> a young family and a new business, <eob> often working seven days a week, <eob> 14 hours a day, <eob> taking on second and third jobs <eol> just to earn a meager living. <eob>
And quality time with my parents <eol> was pretty nonexistent. <eob>
Even though I knew <eol> they loved me very much, <eob> growing up, I felt abandoned. <eob>
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw, <eob> and then I started to resent my parents <eol> and become very angry. <eob>
And as I was growing up, <eol> through my teenage years, <eob> I started to act out to try <eol> and get attention from my parents. <eob>
And one day, when I was 14, <eob> I was standing in an alley, <eol> and I was smoking a joint, <eob> and a man who was twice my age, <eol> with a shaved head and tall black boots, <eob> came up to me, <eob> and he snatched the joint from my lips. <eob> Then he put his hand on my shoulder <eol> and he looked me in the eyes, <eob> and he said, <eob> "That's what the communists <eol> and the Jews want you to do <eob> to keep you docile." <eob> I was 14 years old, <eob> I'd been trading baseball cards and watching "Happy Days" — <eob> I didn't really know what a Jew was. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's true. <eob> And the only communist that I knew <eol> was the bad Russian guy <eob> in my favorite Rocky movie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And since I'm here baring my soul with you, <eob> I can reveal that I did not even know <eol> what the word "docile" meant. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Dead serious. <eob>
But it was as if this man in this alley <eol> had offered me a lifeline. <eob>
For 14 years, I'd felt <eol> marginalized and bullied. <eob>
I had low self-esteem. <eob>
And frankly, I didn't know who I was, <eol> where I belonged, <eob> or what my purpose was. <eob> I was lost. <eob> And overnight, because this man <eol> had pulled me in, <eob> and I had grabbed onto <eol> that lifeline with every fiber of my being. <eob>
I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi" <eob> to full-blown Nazi. <eob> Overnight. <eob>
I started to listen to the rhetoric <eob> and believe it. <eob>
I started to watch very closely <eol> as the leaders of this organization <eob> would target vulnerable young people <eol> who felt marginalized <eob> and then draw them <eol> in with promises of paradise <eob> that were broken. <eob>
And then I started to recruit myself. <eob>
I started to do that by making <eol> white-power music. <eob>
And soon, I became the leader <eol> of that infamous organization <eob> that was led by that man in that alley <eob> who recruited me that day, <eob> who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead <eol> and who had radicalized me. <eob>
For the next eight years, <eob> I believed the lies that I had been fed. <eob>
And though I saw no evidence of it whatsoever, <eob> I didn't hesitate to blame <eol> every Jewish person in the world <eob> for what I thought was a white, <eol> European genocide <eob> being promoted by them <eol> through a multiculturalist agenda. <eob>
I blamed people of color <eob> for the crime and violence <eol> and the drugs in the city, <eob> completely neglecting the fact <eol> that I was committing acts of violence <eob> on a daily basis, <eob> and that in many cases, <eob> it was white supremacists who were funneling drugs <eob> into the inner cities. <eob>
And I blamed immigrants <eob> for taking jobs from white Americans, <eob> completely neglecting the fact that my parents <eol> were hardworking immigrants <eob> who struggled to survive, <eob> despite not getting help from anybody else. <eob>
For the next eight years, <eob> I saw friends die, <eob> I saw others go to prison <eol> and inflict untold pain <eob> on countless victims <eol> and their families' lives. <eob>
I heard horrific stories <eol> from young women in the movement, <eob> who'd been brutally raped by the very men <eol> they were conditioned to trust, <eob> and I myself committed acts <eol> of violence against people, <eob> solely for the color of their skin, <eob> who they loved, <eob> or the god that they prayed to. <eob>
I stockpiled weapons for what I thought <eol> was an upcoming race war. <eob>
I went to six high schools; <eob> I was kicked out of four of them, <eob> one of them, twice. <eob>
And 25 years ago, <eol> I wrote and performed racist music <eob> that found its way <eol> to the internet decades later <eob> and partially inspired <eol> a young white nationalist <eob> to walk into a sacred Charleston, <eol> South Carolina, church <eob> and senselessly massacre nine innocent people. <eob>
But then my life changed. <eob>
At 19 years old, I met a girl <eol> who was not in the movement, <eob> who didn't have <eol> a racist bone in her body, <eob> and I fell in love with her. <eob>
And at 19, we got married, <eob> and we had our first son. <eob>
And when I held my son in my arms <eol> in the delivery room that day, <eob> not only did I reconnect with some <eol> of the innocence that I had lost <eob> at 14 years old, <eob> but it also began to challenge <eob> the very important things that drew me <eol> to the movement to begin with: <eob> identity, community and purpose -- <eob> things that I had been struggling <eol> with as a young boy. <eob>
And now, I struggled <eol> with the concept of who I was again. <eob>
Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger, <eob> or was I a caring father and husband? <eob>
Was my community the one <eol> that I had manufactured around me <eob> to boost my own ego, <eob> because I felt self-hatred for myself <eol> and I wanted to project it onto others, <eob> or was it the one <eol> that I had physically given life to? <eob>
Was my purpose <eol> to scorch the earth <eob> or was it to make it <eol> a better place for my family? <eob>
And suddenly, like a ton <eol> of bricks hit me, <eob> I became very confused with who I'd been <eol> for the last eight years. <eob>
And if only I'd been brave enough <eol> to walk away at that moment, <eob> to understand what the struggle <eol> was that was happening inside of me, <eob> then maybe tragedy could have been averted. <eob>
Instead, I did compromise. <eob>
I took myself off the streets <eol> for the benefit of my family, <eob> because I was nervous <eol> that maybe I could go to jail or end up dead, <eob> and they would have to fend for themselves. <eob>
So I stepped back as a leader, <eob> and instead I opened a record store <eob> that I was going to sell <eol> white-power music in, of course, <eob> because I was importing it in from Europe. <eob>
But I knew that if I was just a racist store <eol> selling racist music <eob> the community would not allow me <eol> to be there. <eob>
So I decided I was going <eol> to also stock the shelves with other music, <eob> like punk rock and heavy metal <eob> and hip-hop. <eob>
And while the white-power music that I was selling <eob> was 75 percent <eol> of my gross revenue, <eob> because people were driving in from <eol> all over the country to buy it <eob> from the only store that was selling it, <eob> I also had customers come <eol> in to buy the other music. <eob>
And eventually, they started <eol> to talk to me. <eob>
One day, a young black teen came in, <eob> and he was visibly upset. <eob>
And I decided to ask him what was wrong. <eob>
And he told me that his mother <eol> had been diagnosed with breast cancer. <eob>
And suddenly, this young black teenager, <eob> who I'd never had a meaningful conversation <eol> or interaction with, <eob> I was able to connect with, <eob> because my own mother <eol> had been diagnosed with breast cancer, <eob> and I could feel his pain. <eob>
On another occasion, a gay couple <eol> came in with their son, <eob> and it was undeniable to me <eol> that they loved their son <eob> in the same profound <eol> ways that I loved mine. <eob>
And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize <eol> or justify the prejudice <eob> that I had in my head. <eob>
I decided to pull the white-power <eol> music from the inventory <eob> when I became too embarrassed to sell it <eol> in front of my new friends. <eob>
And of course, the store <eol> couldn't sustain itself, <eob> so I had to close it. <eob>
At that same time, I lost <eol> nearly everything in my life. <eob>
I used it as an opportunity to walk away <eob> from the movement that I'd been <eol> a part of for eight years, <eob> the only identity, community and purpose <eol> that I'd really known for most of my life. <eob>
So I had nobody. <eob>
I lost my livelihood <eol> because I closed the store. <eob>
I didn't have a great relationship <eol> with my parents, even though they tried. <eob>
And my wife and children left me, <eob> because I hadn't left the movement <eol> and disengaged quickly enough. <eob>
And suddenly, <eob> I didn't know who I was again, <eob> or where I fit in <eob> or what my purpose was <eob> supposed to be. <eob>
I was miserable inside, <eob> and I often woke up in the morning <eob> wishing that I hadn't. <eob>
About five years in, <eob> one of the few friends <eol> that I had was concerned about my well-being, <eob> and she came to me and she said, <eob> "You need to do something, <eol> because I don't want to see you die." <eob> And she suggested that I go apply <eol> for a job where she worked, <eob> at a company called IBM. <eob>
Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi <eol> covered in hate tattoos. <eob>
I didn't go to college. <eob>
I'd been kicked out of multiple high schools <eol> multiple times. <eob>
I didn't even own a computer. <eob>
But I went in, <eob> and somehow, miraculously, I got the job. <eob> I was thrilled. <eob>
And then I became terrified to learn <eob> that they'd actually be putting me <eol> back at my old high school, <eob> the same one I got kicked out of twice, <eob> to install their computers. <eob>
This was a high school <eol> where I had committed acts of violence <eob> against students, against faculty; <eob> where I had protested out in front of the school <eol> for equal rights for whites <eob> and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria <eob> to try and demand <eol> a white student union. <eob>
And of course, as karma would have it, <eob> within the first couple of hours, <eob> who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes, <eob> the tough black security guard I had gotten <eol> in a fistfight with, <eob> that got me kicked out the second time <eob> and led out in handcuffs from the school. <eob>
He didn't recognize me, <eob> but I saw him, <eob> and I didn't know what to do. <eob>
I was frozen; I was this grown man now, <eol> years out of the movement, <eob> and I was sweating <eol> and I was trembling. <eob>
But I decided I had to do something. <eob>
And I decided I needed to suffer <eol> under the weight of my past, <eob> because for five years I had tried to outrun it. <eob>
I'd tried to make new friends <eol> and cover my tattoos with long sleeves, <eob> and I wouldn't admit it <eob> because I was afraid of being judged <eob> the same way I had judged other people. <eob>
Well, I decided I was going <eol> to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -- <eob> probably not the smartest decision <eol> that I made. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But when I found him, <eol> he was getting into his car, <eob> and I tapped him on the shoulder. <eob>
And when he turned around <eol> and he recognized me, <eob> he took a step back because he was afraid. <eob>
And I didn't know what to say. <eob>
Finally, the words came out of my mouth, <eol> and all I could think to say was, <eob> "I'm sorry." <eob> And he embraced me, <eob> and he forgave me. <eob>
And he encouraged me to forgive myself. <eob>
He recognized that it wasn't <eol> the story of some broken go-nowhere kid <eob> who was going to just join a gang <eol> and go to prison. <eob>
He knew that this was the story <eol> of every young person who was vulnerable, <eob> who was searching for identity, community and purpose, <eob> and then hit a wall <eob> and was unable to find it <eob> and went down a dark path. <eob>
And he made me promise one thing, <eob> that I would tell my story <eol> to whoever would listen. <eob>
That was 18 years ago, <eob> and I've been doing it ever since. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You might be asking yourself right now: <eob> How does a good kid from a hard <eol>working immigrant family <eob> end up going down such a dark path? <eob>
One word: potholes. <eob> That's right. Potholes. <eob> I had a lot of potholes when I was kid. <eob>
We all had them -- <eob> you know, the things in life <eol> that we hit <eob> that invariably just kind of nudge us off our path, <eob> and if they remain unresolved <eob> or untreated <eob> or not dealt with, <eob> sometimes we can get dangerously lost down <eol> pretty dark corridors. <eob>
Potholes can be things like trauma, <eob> abuse, unemployment, <eob> neglect, <eob> untreated mental health conditions, <eob> even privilege. <eob>
And if we hit enough potholes <eol> on our journey in life, <eob> and we don't have the resources <eol> or the help to navigate around them <eob> or to pull us out, <eob> well, sometimes good people <eol> end up doing bad things. <eob>
One such person who had potholes <eol> is Darrell. <eob>
Darrell is from upstate New York. <eob>
He had read my memoir, <eob> and he was really upset about the ending. <eob>
You see, I'd gotten out of the movement <eob> and he was still in. <eob>
And he emailed me <eob> and he said, <eob> "I didn't really like the way that turned out." <eob> And I said, "Well, <eob> I'm sorry." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"But if you want to talk about it, <eol> we could certainly do that." <eob>
And after a couple of weeks of going back <eol> and forth with Darrell, <eob> I learned he was a 31-year-old military veteran <eol> who had been injured <eob> and was really angry about not being able <eol> to go to Afghanistan <eob> to kill Muslims. <eob>
And one day on the phone, <eob> he told me that he had seen a Muslim <eol> man in the park praying, <eob> and that all he wanted to do <eol> was kick him in the face. <eob>
I flew to Buffalo the next day, <eob> and I sat down with Darrell, <eob> and I asked him, <eob> "Have you ever met <eol> a Muslim person before?" <eob> And he said, "No! <eob> Why the hell would I want <eol> to do that? <eob> They're evil. I don't want anything <eol> to do with them." <eob> I said, "OK." <eob> So I excused myself, and I went into the bathroom <eob> and I took my phone out in the bathroom, <eob> and I Googled the local mosque, <eob> and I called them very quietly from the bathroom, <eob> and I said, "Excuse me, imam, I need a favor. <eob>
I have a Christian man <eob> who would really love <eol> to learn more about your religion." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Do you mind if we stop by?" <eob>
Well, it took some convincing <eol> for Darrell to go, <eob> but finally we got there, <eob> and when I knocked on the door, <eob> the imam said he only <eol> had 15 minutes left for us, <eob> because he was preparing <eol> for a prayer service. <eob>
I said, "We'll take it." <eob> We went in, <eob> and two and a half hours later, <eol> we came out after hugging and crying <eob> and, very strangely, bonding <eol> over Chuck Norris for some reason. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I don't know what it was about that, <eob> but that's what happened. <eob>
And I'm happy to say now that Darrell <eol> and the imam, <eob> you can often find them <eol> at the local falafel stand, <eob> having lunch together. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You see, it's our disconnection <eol> from each other. <eob>
Hatred is born of ignorance. <eob>
Fear is its father, <eol> and isolation is its mother. <eob>
When we don't understand something, <eol> we tend to be afraid of it, <eob> and if we keep ourselves from it, <eob> that fear grows, and sometimes, <eol> it turns into hatred. <eob>
Since I've left the movement, <eol> I've helped over a hundred people <eob> disengage from extremist movements, <eol> from white supremacist groups -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
to even jihadist groups. <eob> And the way I do that <eol> is not by arguing with them, <eob> not by debating them, <eob> not by even telling them they're wrong, <eob> even though, boy, I want to sometimes. <eob>
I don't do that. <eob>
Instead, I don't push them away. <eob>
I draw them in closer, <eob> and I listen very closely <eol> for their potholes, <eob> and then I begin to fill them in. <eob>
I try to make people more resilient, <eob> more self-confident, <eob> more able to have skills <eol> to compete in the marketplace <eob> so that they don't have to blame the other, <eob> the other that they've never met. <eob>
I'd like to just leave you <eol> with one last thing before I go. <eob>
Of all the people I've worked with, <eol> they will all tell you the same thing. <eob>
One, they became extremists <eob> because they wanted to belong, <eol> not because of ideology or dogma. <eob>
And second, what brought them out <eob> was receiving compassion <eob> from the people they least <eol> deserved it from, <eob> when they least deserved it. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I would like to leave you <eol> with a challenge: <eob> go out there today, tomorrow -- <eol> hopefully every day -- <eob> find somebody that you think <eol> is undeserving of your compassion <eob> and give it to them, <eob> because I guarantee you, <eob> they're the ones who need it the most. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Like every passionate software engineer out there, <eob> I closely follow technology companies in Silicon Valley, <eob> pretty much the same way soccer fans <eol> follow their teams in Europe. <eob>
I read articles on tech blogs <eob> and listen to podcasts on my phone. <eob>
But after I finish the article, <eob> lock my phone and unplug the headphones, <eob> I'm back in sub-Saharan Africa, <eob> where the landscape is not quite the same. <eob>
We have long and frequent power outages, <eob> low penetration of computers, <eob> slow internet connections <eob> and a lot of patients visiting understaffed hospitals. <eob>
Since the HIV epidemic, <eob> hospitals have been struggling <eol> to manage regular HIV treatment records <eob> for increasing volumes of patients. <eob>
For such environments, <eob> importing technology systems developed <eol> elsewhere has not worked, <eob> but in 2006, I joined Baobab Health, <eob> a team that uses locally <eol> based engineers <eob> to develop suitable interventions <eob> that are addressing health care challenges <eol> in Malawi. <eob>
We designed an electronic health record system <eob> that is used by health care workers <eol> while seeing patients. <eob>
And in the process we realized <eol> that we not only had to design the software, <eob> we had to implement <eol> the infrastructure as well. <eob>
We don't have enough medical staff <eob> to comprehensively examine every patient, <eob> so we embedded clinical guidelines <eol> within the software <eob> to guide nurses and clerks <eob> who assist with handling <eol> some of the workload. <eob>
Everyone has a birthday, <eob> but not everyone knows their birthday, <eob> so we wrote algorithms <eol> to handle estimated birthdates <eob> as complete dates. <eob>
How do we follow up patients <eol> living in slums <eob> with no street and house numbers? <eob>
We used landmarks to approximate <eol> their physical addresses. <eob>
Malawi had no IDs <eol> to uniquely identify patients, <eob> so we had to implement unique patient <eol> IDs <eob> to link patient records across clinics. <eob>
The IDs are printed as barcodes <eob> on labels that are stuck <eol> on personal health booklets <eob> kept by each patient. <eob>
With this barcoded ID, <eob> a simple scan with a barcode reader <eob> quickly pulls up the patient's records. <eob>
No need to rewrite their personal details <eob> on paper registers at every visit. <eob>
And suddenly, queues became shorter. <eob>
This meant patients, typically mothers <eol> with little children on their backs, <eob> had to spend less time waiting to be assisted. <eob>
And if they lose their booklets, <eob> their records can still be pulled <eol> by searching with their names. <eob>
Now, the way we pronounce and spell <eol> names varies tremendously. <eob>
We freely mix R's and L's, <eob> English and vernacular versions <eol> of their names. <eob>
Even soundex, <eob> a standard method for grouping words <eol> by how similar they sound, <eob> was not good enough. <eob>
So we had to modify it <eob> to help us link <eol> and match existing records. <eob>
Before the iPhone, <eob> software engineers developed <eol> for personal computers, <eob> but from our experience, <eob> we knew our power system <eol> is not reliable enough <eob> for personal computers. <eob>
So we repurposed touch screen <eol> point-of-sale terminals <eob> that are meant for retail shops <eob> to become clinical workstations. <eob>
At the time, we imported internet <eol> appliances called i-Openers <eob> that were manufactured during the dot-com era <eob> by a failed US company. <eob>
We modified their screens <eob> to add touch sensors <eob> and their power system <eol> to run from rechargeable batteries. <eob>
When we started, we didn't find <eol> a reliable network to transmit data, <eob> especially from rural hospitals. <eob>
So we built our own towers, <eob> created a wireless network <eob> and linked clinics in Lilongwe, <eob> Malawi's capital. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
With a team of engineers <eob> working within a hospital campus, <eob> we observed health care workers use the system <eob> and iteratively build an information system <eob> that is now managing HIV records <eob> in all major public hospitals in Malawi. <eob>
These are hospitals serving over 2,000 <eol> HIV patients, each clinic. <eob>
Now, health care workers <eol> who used to spend days <eob> to tally and prepare quarterly reports <eob> are producing the same reports within minutes, <eob> and health care experts <eol> from all over the world <eob> are now coming to Malawi <eol> to learn how we did it. <eob>
It is inspiring and fun <eob> to follow technology trends <eol> across the globe, <eob> but to make them work <eob> in low-resourced environments <eob> like public hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, <eob> we have had to become jacks-of-all-trades <eob> and build whole systems, <eol> including the infrastructure, <eob> from the ground up. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In March 2017, <eob> the mayor of Cape Town officially declared Cape Town <eol> a local disaster, <eob> as it had less than four months <eol> left of usable water. <eob>
Residents were restricted to 100 liters <eol> of water per person, per day. <eob>
But what does that really mean? <eob>
With 100 liters of water per day, <eob> you can take a five-minute shower, <eob> wash your face twice <eob> and probably flush the toilet <eol> about five times. <eob>
You still didn't brush your teeth, <eob> you didn't do laundry, <eob> and you definitely didn't water <eol> your plants. <eob>
You, unfortunately, didn't wash <eol> your hands after those five toilet flushes. <eob>
And you didn't even take a sip of water. <eob>
The mayor described this as that it means <eob> a new relationship with water. <eob>
Today, seven months later, <eob> I can share two things <eol> about my second home with you. <eob>
First: Cape Town hasn't run <eol> out of water just yet. <eob>
But as of September 3rd, <eob> the hundred-liter limit <eol> dropped to 87 liters. <eob>
The mayor defined the city's new normal <eol> as one of permanent drought. <eob>
Second: <eob> what's happening in Cape Town <eol> is pretty much coming to many other cities <eob> and countries in the world. <eob>
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization <eol> of the United Nations, <eob> excluding countries <eol> that we don't have data for, <eob> less than five percent of the world's population <eob> is living in a country that has more water today <eol> than it did 20 years ago. <eob>
Everyone else is living in a country <eol> that has less water today. <eob>
And nearly one out of three <eol> are living in a country <eob> that is facing a water crisis. <eob>
I grew up in Jordan, <eob> a water-poor country that has experienced <eol> absolute water scarcity since 1973. <eob>
And still, in 2017, <eob> only 10 countries in the world <eol> have less water than Jordan. <eob>
So dealing with a lack of water <eol> is quite ingrained in my soul. <eob>
As soon as I was old enough <eol> to learn how to write my name, <eob> I also learned that I need to conserve water. <eob>
My parents would constantly remind my siblings <eol> and I to close the tap <eob> when we brushed our teeth. <eob>
We used to fill balloons <eol> with flour instead of water when we played. <eob>
It's just as much fun, though. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And a few years ago, <eob> when my friends and I were dared to do <eol> the Ice Bucket Challenge, <eob> we did that with sand. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you might think that, <eol> you know, that's easy, <eob> sand is not ice cold. <eob>
I promise you, sand goes everywhere, <eob> and it took ages to get rid of it. <eob>
But what perhaps I didn't realize <eob> as I played with flour balloons <eol> as a child, <eob> and as I poured sand on my head as an adult, <eob> is that some of the techniques <eol> that seem second nature to me <eob> and to others who live in dry countries <eob> might help us all address <eol> what is fast becoming a global crisis. <eob>
I wish to share three lessons today, <eob> three lessons from water-poor countries <eob> and how they survived and even thrived <eol> despite their water crisis. <eob>
Lesson one: <eob> tell people how much water <eol> they really have. <eob>
In order to solve a problem, <eob> we need to acknowledge that we have one. <eob>
And when it comes to water, <eob> people can easily turn a blind eye, <eob> pretending that since water <eol> is coming out of the tap now, <eob> everything will be fine forever. <eob>
But some smart, drought-affected countries <eob> have adopted simple, innovative measures <eob> to make sure their citizens, <eol> their communities and their companies <eob> know just how dry their countries are. <eob>
When I was in Cape Town earlier this year, <eob> I saw this electronic <eol> billboard on the freeway, <eob> indicating how much water the city had left. <eob>
This is an idea they may well <eol> have borrowed from Australia <eob> when it faced one of the worst <eol> droughts of the country's history <eob> from 1997 to 2009. <eob>
Water levels in Melbourne dropped <eol> to a very low capacity <eob> of almost 26 percent. <eob>
But the city didn't yell at people. <eob>
It didn't plead with them not <eol> to use water. <eob>
They used electronic billboards <eol> to flash available levels of water <eob> to all citizens across the city. <eob>
They were honestly telling people <eol> how much water they really have, <eob> and letting them take responsibility <eol> for themselves. <eob>
By the end of the drought, this created <eol> such a sense of urgency <eob> as well as a sense of community. <eob>
Nearly one out of three citizens <eol> in Melbourne had invested <eob> in installing rainwater holding tanks <eol> for their own households. <eob>
Actions that citizens took <eol> didn't stop at installing those tanks. <eob>
With help from the city, <eob> they were able to do something <eol> even more impactful. <eob>
Taking me to lesson two: <eob> empower people to save water. <eob>
Melbourne wanted people <eol> to spend less water in their homes. <eob>
And one way to do that is to spend <eol> less time in the shower. <eob>
However, interviews revealed <eol> that some people, women in particular, <eob> weren't keen on saving <eol> water that way. <eob>
Some of them honestly said, <eob> "The shower is not just to clean up. <eob>
It's my sanctuary. <eob>
It's a space I go to relax, not just clean up." <eob> So the city started offering <eol> water-efficient showerheads for free. <eob>
And then, now some people complained <eol> that the showerheads looked ugly <eob> or didn't suit their bathrooms. <eob>
So what I like to call <eol> "The Showerhead Team" <eob> developed a small <eol> water-flow regulator <eob> that can be fitted into existing <eol> showerheads. <eob>
And although showerhead beauty <eol> doesn't matter much to me, <eob> I loved how the team didn't give up <eob> and instead came up with a simple, unique solution <eob> to <eob> empower people to save water. <eob>
Within a span of four years, <eob> more than 460,000 showerheads <eol> were replaced. <eob>
When the small regulator was introduced, <eob> more than 100,000 orders <eol> of that were done. <eob>
Melbourne succeeded <eol> in reducing the water demands per capita <eob> by 50 percent. <eob>
In the United Arab Emirates, <eob> the second-most water-scarce country in the world, <eob> officials designed what they called <eol> the "Business Heroes Toolkit" in 2010. <eob>
The aim was to motivate <eol> and empower businesses <eob> to reduce water and energy consumption. <eob>
The toolkit practically taught companies <eob> how to measure <eol> their existing water-consumption levels <eob> and consisted of tips to help them <eol> reduce those levels. <eob> And it worked. <eob> Hundreds of organizations <eol> downloaded the toolkit. <eob>
And several of them joined <eob> what they called the "Corporate Heroes Network," <eob> where companies can voluntarily take <eol> on a challenge <eob> to reduce their water-consumption levels <eol> to preset targets <eob> within a period of one year. <eob>
Companies which completed the challenge <eol> saved on average 35 percent of water. <eob>
And one company, for example, <eob> implemented as many water-saving tips <eol> as they could in their office space. <eob>
They replaced <eol> their toilet-flushing techniques, taps, showerheads -- <eob> you name it. <eob>
If it saved water, they replaced it, <eob> eventually reducing their employees' water <eol> consumption by half. <eob>
Empowering individuals and companies <eol> to save water is so critical, <eob> yet not sufficient. <eob>
Countries need to look <eol> beyond the status quo <eob> and implement country-level actions <eob> to save water. <eob>
Taking me to lesson three: <eob> look below the surface. <eob>
Water savings can come <eol> from unexpected places. <eob>
Singapore is the eighth most <eol> water-scarce country in the world. <eob>
It depends on imported water for almost 60 percent <eol> of its water needs. <eob>
It's also a very small island. <eob>
As such, it needs to make use <eol> of as much space as possible <eob> to catch rainfall. <eob>
So in 2008, <eob> they built the Marina Barrage. <eob>
It's the first-ever urban water reservoir built <eol> in the middle of the city-state. <eob>
It's the largest water <eol> catchment in the country, <eob> almost one-sixth the size <eol> of Singapore. <eob>
What's so amazing about the Marina Barrage <eob> is that it has been built <eol> to make the maximum use of its large size <eob> and its unexpected yet important location. <eob>
It brings three valuable benefits to the country: <eob> it has boosted Singapore's water supply by 10 percent; <eob> it protects low areas around it from floods <eob> because of its connection <eol> to the sea; <eob> and, as you can see, <eob> it acts as a beautiful lifestyle attraction, <eob> hosting several events, <eob> from art exhibitions to music festivals, <eob> attracting joggers, bikers, tourists all around that area. <eob>
Now, not all initiatives <eol> need to be stunning <eob> or even visible. <eob>
My first home, Jordan, <eol> realized that agriculture is consuming <eob> the majority of its fresh water. <eob>
They really wanted to encourage farmers <eob> to focus on growing low <eol> water-intensive crops. <eob>
To achieve that, <eob> the local agriculture is increasing <eol> its focus on date palms and grapevines. <eob>
Those two are much more tolerant <eol> to drought conditions <eob> than many other fruits and vegetables, <eob> and at the same time, <eob> they are considered high-value crops, <eol> both locally and internationally. <eob>
Locals in Namibia, <eob> one of the most arid countries <eol> in Southern Africa, <eob> have been drinking recycled water <eol> since 1968. <eob>
Now, you may tell me <eol> many countries recycle water. <eob>
I would say yes. <eob>
But very few use it for drinking purposes, <eob> mostly because people <eol> don't like the thought <eob> of water that was in their toilets <eol> going to their taps. <eob>
But Namibia could not afford <eol> to think that way. <eob>
They looked below the surface <eob> to save water. <eob>
They are now a great example <eob> of how, when countries <eol> purify waste water to drinking standards, <eob> they can ease their water shortages, <eob> and in Namibia's case, <eob> provide drinking water <eol> for more than 300,000 citizens in its capital city. <eob>
As more countries which used <eol> to be more water rich <eob> are becoming water scarce, <eob> I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel. <eob>
If we just look at what <eol> water-poor countries have done, <eob> the solutions are out there. <eob>
Now it's really just up to all of us <eob> to take action. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to tell you about someone. <eob>
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda. <eob>
I'm changing his name <eol> to protect his safety. <eob>
Ravi's from a community <eol> of herdspeople in Gujarat <eob> on the western coast of India, <eob> same place my own family comes from. <eob>
When he was 10 years old, <eol> his entire community was forced to move <eob> because a multinational corporation <eob> constructed a manufacturing facility <eol> on the land where they lived. <eob>
Then, 20 years later, the same company <eol> built a cement factory <eob> 100 meters from where they live now. <eob>
India has got strong environmental <eol> regulations on paper, <eob> but this company has violated many of them. <eob>
Dust from that factory <eol> covers Ravi's mustache <eob> and everything he wears. <eob>
I spent just two days in his place, <eol> and I coughed for a week. <eob>
Ravi says that if people or animals <eol> eat anything that grows in his village <eob> or drink the water, <eob> they get sick. <eob>
He says children now walk long distances <eol> with cattle and buffalo <eob> to find uncontaminated grazing land. <eob>
He says many of those kids <eol> have dropped out of school, <eob> including three of his own. <eob>
Ravi has appealed <eol> to the company for years. <eob>
He said, "I've written so many letters <eol> my family could cremate me with them. <eob>
They wouldn't need to buy any wood." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He said the company ignored <eol> every one of those letters, <eob> and so in 2013, <eob> Ravi Nanda decided to use <eol> the last means of protest <eob> he thought he had left. <eob>
He walked to the gates of that factory <eol> with a bucket of petrol in his hands, <eob> intending to set himself on fire. <eob>
Ravi is not alone in his desperation. <eob>
The UN estimates that worldwide, <eob> four billion people live <eol> without basic access to justice. <eob>
These people face grave threats <eol> to their safety, their livelihoods, <eob> their dignity. <eob>
There are almost always laws on the books <eol> that would protect these people, <eob> but they've often never heard of those laws, <eob> and the systems that are supposed <eol> to enforce those laws <eob> are corrupt or broken or both. <eob>
We are living with a global <eol> epidemic of injustice, <eob> but we've been choosing to ignore it. <eob>
Right now, in Sierra Leone, <eob> in Cambodia, in Ethiopia, <eob> farmers are being cajoled <eob> into putting their thumbprints on 50-year lease agreements, <eob> signing away all the land <eol> they've ever known for a pittance <eob> without anybody even explaining the terms. <eob>
Governments seem to think that's OK. <eob>
Right now, in the United States, <eob> in India, in Slovenia, <eob> people like Ravi are raising their children <eob> in the shadow of factories or mines <eob> that are poisoning their air and their water. <eob>
There are environmental laws <eol> that would protect these people, <eob> but many have never seen those laws, <eob> let alone having a shot at enforcing them. <eob>
And the world seems to have decided <eol> that's OK. <eob>
What would it take to change that? <eob>
Law is supposed to be the language we use <eob> to translate our dreams about justice <eob> into living institutions <eol> that hold us together. <eob>
Law is supposed to be the difference <eob> between a society ruled <eol> by the most powerful <eob> and one that honors <eol> the dignity of everyone, <eob> strong or weak. <eob>
That's why I told my grandmother <eol> 20 years ago <eob> that I wanted to go to law school. <eob>
Grandma didn't pause. <eob>
She didn't skip a beat. <eob> She said to me, "Lawyer is liar." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That was discouraging. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But grandma's right, in a way. <eob>
Something about law and lawyers <eol> has gone wrong. <eob>
We lawyers are usually <eol> expensive, first of all, <eob> and we tend to focus <eol> on formal court channels <eob> that are impractical for many <eol> of the problems people face. <eob>
Worse, our profession has shrouded law <eol> in a cloak of complexity. <eob>
Law is like riot gear on a police officer. <eob>
It's intimidating <eol> and impenetrable, <eob> and it's hard to tell there's <eol> something human underneath. <eob>
If we're going to make justice <eol> a reality for everyone, <eob> we need to turn law <eol> from an abstraction or a threat <eob> into something that every single <eol> person can understand, use and shape. <eob>
Lawyers are crucial <eol> in that fight, no doubt, <eob> but we can't leave it to lawyers alone. <eob>
In health care, for example, <eob> we don't just rely on doctors <eol> to serve patients. <eob>
We have nurses and midwives <eol> and community health workers. <eob>
The same should be true of justice. <eob>
Community legal workers, <eob> sometimes we call them community <eol> paralegals, <eob> or barefoot lawyers, <eob> can be a bridge. <eob>
These paralegals are from <eol> the communities they serve. <eob>
They demystify law, <eob> break it down into simple terms, <eob> and then they help people look <eol> for a solution. <eob>
They don't focus on the courts alone. <eob>
They look everywhere: <eob> ministry departments, local government, <eol> an ombudsman's office. <eob>
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients, <eob> "I'll handle it for you. <eob>
I've got you. <eob> "Paralegals have a different message, <eob> not" I'm going to solve it for you, <eob> "but" We're going to solve it together, <eob> and in the process, we're both going to grow. <eob> " <eob>
Community paralegals saved <eol> my own relationship to law. <eob>
After about a year in law school, <eol> I almost dropped out. <eob>
I was thinking maybe I should <eol> have listened to my grandmother. <eob>
It was when I started working with paralegals <eob> in Sierra Leone, in 2003, <eob> that I began feeling hopeful <eol> about the law again, <eob> and I have been obsessed ever since. <eob>
Let me come back to Ravi. <eob> 2013, he did reach <eol> the gates of that factory <eob> with the bucket of petrol in his hands, <eob> but he was arrested before <eol> he could follow through. <eob>
He didn't have to spend long in jail, <eob> but he felt completely defeated. <eob>
Then, two years later, he met someone. <eob>
I'm going to call him Kush. <eob>
Kush is part of a team <eol> of community paralegals <eob> that works for environmental justice <eol> on the Gujarat coast. <eob>
Kush explained to Ravi <eol> that there was law on his side. <eob>
Kush translated into Gujarati something <eol> Ravi had never seen. <eob>
It's called the "consent to operate." <eob> It's issued by the state government, <eob> and it allows the factory to run <eob> only if it complies with specific conditions. <eob>
So together, they compared <eol> the legal requirements with reality, <eob> they collected evidence, <eob> and they drafted an application -- <eob> not to the courts, <eol> but to two administrative institutions, <eob> the Pollution Control Board <eol> and the district administration. <eob>
Those applications started turning the creaky <eol> wheels of enforcement. <eob>
A pollution officer came for a site inspection, <eob> and after that, the company started <eol> running an air filtration system <eob> it was supposed to have <eol> been using all along. <eob>
It also started covering the 100 trucks <eob> that come and go from <eol> that plant every day. <eob>
Those two measures reduced <eol> the air pollution considerably. <eob>
The case is far from over, <eob> but learning and using law gave Ravi hope. <eob>
There are people like Kush walking <eol> alongside people like Ravi <eob> in many places. <eob>
Today, I work with a group called Namati. <eob>
Namati helps convene a global network <eob> dedicated to legal empowerment. <eob>
All together, we are over <eol> a thousand organizations <eob> in 120 countries. <eob>
Collectively, we deploy tens <eol> of thousands of community paralegals. <eob>
Let me give you another example. <eob> This is Khadija Hamsa. <eob> She is one of five million people in Kenya <eol> who faces a discriminatory vetting process <eob> when trying to obtain a national ID card. <eob>
It is like the Jim Crow South <eol> in the United States. <eob>
If you are from a certain set of tribes, <eob> most of them Muslim, <eob> you get sent to a different line. <eob>
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job. <eob>
You can't get a bank loan. <eob>
You can't enroll in university. <eob>
You are excluded from society. <eob>
Khadija tried off and on <eol> to get an ID for eight years, without success. <eob>
Then she met a paralegal <eol> working in her community <eob> named Hassan Kassim. <eob>
Hassan explained to Khadija <eol> how vetting works, <eob> he helped her gather the documents <eol> she needed, <eob> helped prep her to go before the vetting committee. <eob>
Finally, she was able to get <eol> an ID with Hassan's help. <eob>
First thing she did with it <eob> was use it to apply <eol> for birth certificates for her children, <eob> which they need in order <eol> to go to school. <eob>
In the United States, <eol> among many other problems, <eob> we have a housing crisis. <eob>
In many cities, <eob> 90 percent of the landlords <eol> in housing court have attorneys, <eob> while 90 percent of the tenants do not. <eob>
In New York, a new crew <eol> of paralegals -- <eob> they're called Access <eol> to Justice Navigators -- <eob> helps people to understand housing law <eol> and to advocate for themselves. <eob>
Normally in New York, <eob> one out of nine tenants brought <eol> to housing court <eob> gets evicted. <eob>
Researchers took a look at 150 cases <eob> in which people had help <eol> from these paralegals, <eob> and they found no evictions at all, <eob> not one. <eob>
A little bit of legal empowerment <eol> can go a long way. <eob>
I see the beginnings of a real movement, <eob> but we're nowhere near <eol> what's necessary. <eob> Not yet. <eob> In most countries around the world, <eob> governments do not provide <eol> a single dollar of support <eob> to paralegals like Hassan and Kush. <eob>
Most governments don't even recognize <eol> the role paralegals play, <eob> or protect paralegals from harm. <eob>
I also don't want to give <eol> you the impression <eob> that paralegals and their clients <eol> win every time. <eob> Not at all. <eob> That cement factory behind Ravi's village, <eob> it's been turning off <eol> the filtration system at night, <eob> when it's least likely that the company <eol> would get caught. <eob>
Running that filter costs money. <eob>
Ravi WhatsApps photos <eol> of the polluted night sky. <eob>
This is one he sent to Kush in May. <eob>
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable. <eob>
At one point this year, Ravi went <eol> on hunger strike. <eob> Kush was frustrated. <eob> He said, "We can win <eol> if we use the law." <eob> Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do, <eob> but it's not getting us far enough." <eob>
Whether it's India, Kenya, <eol> the United States or anywhere else, <eob> trying to squeeze justice <eol> out of broken systems <eob> is like Ravi's case. <eob>
Hope and despair are neck and neck. <eob>
And so not only do we urgently <eol> need to support and protect <eob> the work of barefoot <eol> lawyers around the world, <eob> we need to change the systems themselves. <eob>
Every case a paralegal takes on <eob> is a story about how a system <eol> is working in practice. <eob>
When you put those stories together, <eob> it gives you a detailed portrait <eol> of the system as a whole. <eob>
People can use that information <eob> to demand improvements to laws <eol> and policies. <eob>
In India, paralegals and clients <eol> have drawn on their case experience <eob> to propose smarter regulations <eol> for the handling of minerals. <eob>
In Kenya, paralegals and clients <eol> are using data from thousands of cases <eob> to argue that vetting is unconstitutional. <eob>
This is a different way <eol> of approaching reform. <eob>
This is not a consultant flying into Myanmar <eob> with a template he's going to cut <eol> and paste from Macedonia, <eob> and this is not an angry tweet. <eob>
This is about growing reforms <eol> from the experience of ordinary people <eob> trying to make the rules and systems work. <eob>
This transformation in the relationship <eol> between people and law <eob> is the right thing to do. <eob>
It's also essential for overcoming <eob> all of the other great challenges of our times. <eob>
We are not going <eol> to avert environmental collapse <eob> if the people most affected by pollution <eob> don't have a say in what happens <eol> to the land and the water, <eob> and we won't succeed in reducing poverty <eol> or expanding opportunity <eob> if poor people can't exercise <eol> their basic rights. <eob>
And I believe we won't overcome <eob> the despair that authoritarian <eol> politicians prey upon <eob> if our systems stay rigged. <eob>
I called Ravi before coming here <eol> to ask permission to share his story. <eob>
I asked if there was any message <eol> he wanted to give people. <eob>
He said, "[Gujarati]." <eob> Wake up. <eob> "[Gujarati]." <eob> Don't be afraid. <eob> "[Gujarati]." <eob> Fight with paper. <eob>
"[Gujarati]." <eob> By that I think he means fight <eol> using law rather than guns. <eob> Maybe not today, maybe not this year, <eol> maybe not in five years, <eob> but find justice. <eob>
If this guy, whose entire community <eol> is being poisoned every single day, <eob> who was ready to take his own life -- <eob> if he's not giving up on seeking justice, <eob> then the world can't give up either. <eob>
Ultimately, what Ravi calls <eol> "fighting with paper" <eob> is about forging a deeper version <eol> of democracy <eob> in which we the people, <eob> we don't just cast ballots <eol> every few years, <eob> we take part daily in the rules <eol> and institutions that hold us together, <eob> in which everyone, even the least powerful, <eob> can know law, use law and shape law. <eob>
Making that happen, winning that fight, <eob> requires all of us. <eob>
Thank you guys. Thank you. <eob>
Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek. <eob>
So I'm going to make a few assumptions <eob> that people in this room know <eol> what the Sustainable Development Goals are <eob> and how the process works, <eob> but I want us to talk a little bit <eob> about Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions. <eob>
Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember <eol> the Millennium Development Goals? <eob>
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN <eol> and governments around the world, <eob> and they were for essential, laudable things. <eob>
It was reduce child mortality <eol> by two thirds, cut hunger in half, <eob> crucial things. <eob>
But there was no mention <eol> of justice or fairness <eob> or accountability or corruption, <eob> and we have made progress <eol> during the 15 years <eob> when those goals were in effect, <eob> but we are way behind <eol> what justice demands, <eob> and we're not going to get there <eol> unless we take justice into account. <eob>
And so when the debate started <eol> about the next development framework, <eob> the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, <eob> our community came together around the world <eob> to argue that access to justice <eol> and legal empowerment <eob> should be a part of that new framework. <eob>
And there was a lot of resistance. <eob>
Those things are more political, more contentious <eol> than the other ones, <eob> so we didn't know until the night <eol> before whether it was going to come through. <eob> We squeaked by. <eob> The 16th out of 17 goals <eol> commits to access to justice for all, <eob> which is a big deal. <eob>
It's a big deal, yes. <eob>
Let's clap for justice. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here's the scandal, though. <eob> The day the goals were adopted, <eob> most of them were accompanied by big commitments: <eob> a billion dollars from the Gates Foundation <eob> and the British government <eol> for nutrition; <eob> 25 billion in public-private financing <eol> for health care for women and children. <eob>
On access to justice, <eol> we had the words on the paper, <eob> but nobody pledged a penny, <eob> and so that is the opportunity <eol> and the challenge that we face right now. <eob>
The world recognizes more than ever before <eob> that you can't have development <eol> without justice, <eob> that people can't improve their lives <eol> if they can't exercise their rights, <eob> and what we need to do now <eol> is turn that rhetoric, <eob> turn that principle, into reality. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
KK: How can we help? <eob>
What can people in this room do? <eob>
VM: Great question. Thank you for asking. <eob>
I would say three things. <eob> One is invest. <eob> If you have 10 dollars, <eol> or a hundred dollars, a million dollars, <eob> consider putting some of it <eol> towards grassroots legal empowerment. <eob>
It's important in its own right <eob> and it's crucial for just about <eol> everything else we care about. <eob>
Number two, <eob> push your politicians and your governments <eol> to make this a public priority. <eob>
Just like health or education, access to justice <eob> should be one of the things <eol> that a government owes its people, <eob> and we're nowhere close to that, <eob> neither in rich countries <eol> or poor countries. <eob>
Number three is: be a paralegal <eol> in your own life. <eob>
Find an injustice or a problem <eol> where you live. <eob>
It's not hard to find, if you look. <eob>
Is the river being contaminated, <eob> the one that passes through <eol> the city where you live? <eob>
Are there workers getting paid <eol> less than minimum wage <eob> or who are working without safety gear? <eob>
Get to know the people most affected, <eob> find out what the rules say, <eob> see if you can use those rules <eol> to get a solution. <eob>
If it doesn't work, see if you can come together <eol> to improve those rules. <eob>
Because if we all start knowing law, <eol> using law and shaping law, <eob> then we will be building <eol> that deeper version of democracy <eob> that I believe our world desperately needs. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I became obsessed with records <eol> when I was about 12 years old. <eob>
My parents used to give me money to eat <eob> and on most days, instead of eating, <eob> I would save it and buy myself a record <eol> at the end of the week. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So when I was a teenager, <eob> the obsession of buying cassettes, <eol> vinyls and CDs just kept growing. <eob>
I was even working in a record <eol> store for many years <eob> and only ever got paid in records. <eob>
One day I realized <eol> that I had thousands of records more <eob> than I could even listen to in my life. <eob>
I became what many of us are: <eob> record junkies -- <eob> or record diggers, as we like to call ourselves. <eob>
Record digging, as the name suggests, <eob> means getting your hands dirty. <eob>
It means spending hours rummaging <eol> through warehouses, <eob> church basements, <eob> yard sales, record stores -- <eob> all to find records <eol> that have been forgotten for decades. <eob>
Records that have become cultural waste. <eob>
The earliest record collectors <eol> from about the '30s to the 1960s <eob> found and preserved so many important records <eob> that would have been lost forever. <eob>
In those days, most cultural <eol> and public institutions <eob> didn't really care to preserve <eol> these treasures. <eob>
In many cases, they were just <eol> throwing them into the garbage. <eob>
Record digging is a lifestyle. <eob>
We're absolutely obsessed <eol> with obscure records, <eob> expensive records, dollar-bin records, <eob> crazy artwork, <eob> sub-subgenres. <eob>
And all of the tiniest details <eol> that go with each release. <eob>
When the media talks <eol> about the vinyl revival <eob> that's been happening <eol> these last few years, <eob> they often forget to mention this community <eob> that's been keeping the vinyl and the tradition <eol> and the culture alive <eob> for these last 30 years. <eob>
It's a very close-knit <eol> but competitive society, a little bit, <eob> because when you're hunting <eol> for extremely rare records, <eob> if you miss your opportunity, <eob> you might not see that record <eol> ever in your life. <eob>
But I guess the only person in here <eol> truly impressed by record collectors <eob> is another record collector. <eob>
To the outside world, <eob> we seem like a very weird, <eol> oddball group of individuals. <eob> And -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And they're mostly right. <eob>
All the record collectors I know <eol> are obsessive maniacs. <eob>
We know we're all crazy in some way. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But I think we should be viewed <eol> a little bit more like this. <eob>
We're music archaeologists. <eob> We're hunting down the lost artifact. <eob>
We all have a list of records <eol> that we would do anything to get our hands on, <eob> that we've been chasing for years, <eob> and we actually call this list <eol> our "holy grails." <eob>
When you're digging for records, <eob> you're surrounded by music you don't know. <eob>
You're surrounded by mystery <eol> and by all these dreams -- <eob> records that people once believed in. <eob>
Imagine the thousands of artists <eol> who were destined to be legends <eob> but for various reasons, <eol> were just overlooked. <eob>
Many of these records only exist <eol> in a handful of copies, <eob> and some have never even been found, <eob> never been heard. <eob>
They're literally endangered species. <eob>
I'll tell you a story <eob> that for me sort of sums up <eol> the value of the work of record diggers. <eob>
The story of a brilliant Montreal <eol> musician and composer. <eob>
Henri-Pierre Noël was born <eol> and raised in Haiti, <eob> but he lived briefly in the US <eol> and in Belgium. <eob>
He passed through Montreal what was supposed <eol> to be for two weeks, <eob> but he ended up staying <eol> for the next 40 years. <eob>
When he was young, he learned to play piano <eob> and developed a very particular way <eol> of playing his instrument: <eob> very fast and almost like a percussion. <eob>
His style was a mix of his Haitian influences <eol> and folklore <eob> mixed with the American influences <eol> that he grew up hearing. <eob>
So he created a mix of compas <eol> mixed with funk and jazz. <eob>
As a young man, <eob> he played and toured with live <eol> bands in the US and in Europe, <eob> but had never recorded an album <eol> or a song before moving to Canada. <eob>
It was in Montreal in 1979 <eob> that he released his first album called, "Piano." <eob> Completely on his own, on Henri-Pierre Noël Records. <eob>
He only made what he could afford: <eol> 2,000 copies of the record. <eob>
The record received a little bit of airplay, <eob> a little bit of support <eol> in Canada and in Haiti, <eob> but without a big label behind it, <eob> it was very, very difficult. <eob>
Back then, <eob> if your record wasn't getting played <eol> on mainstream radio, <eob> if you weren't in jukeboxes or if you weren't invited <eol> to play on TV, <eob> the odds were completely against you. <eob>
Releasing an album <eol> as an independent artist <eob> was so much more difficult <eol> than it is today, <eob> both in terms of being heard <eol> and just distributing the thing. <eob>
So, soon after, he released a second album, <eob> kept a busy schedule <eol> playing piano in various clubs in the city, <eob> but his records started to accumulate dust slowly. <eob>
And those 2,000 copies <eol> in the span of 30 years <eob> easily started to get lost <eob> until only a few copies in the world remained. <eob>
Then in the mid-2000s, <eob> a Montreal record digger <eol> that goes by the name Kobal <eob> was doing his weekly rounds <eol> of just hunting for records. <eob>
He was in a flea market <eob> surrounded by thousands of other <eol> dirty, dusty, moldy records. <eob>
That's where he found the "Piano" album. <eob>
He wasn't specifically looking for it. <eob>
Actually, you could say <eol> it sort of found him. <eob>
You could also say that after 20 years <eol> of record digging every single week, <eob> he had developed a sixth sense <eol> for finding the gold. <eob>
He took the record and inspected it: <eob> the front, the artwork, <eol> the back, the liner notes, <eob> and he was intrigued by the fact <eol> that this Haitian musician made a record <eob> in Quebec in the late '70s, <eob> so he was intrigued. <eob>
He took out his little, plastic, <eol> portable turntable <eob> that he brought with him whenever he was <eol> on these digging quests <eob> and put the record on. <eob>
So why don't we do the same thing? <eob>
(Music) <eob> He fell in love with the music instantly, <eob> but he had to know the backstory behind it. <eob>
He didn't know where it came from. <eob>
He knew the artist, <eob> at the time of the recording, <eob> was living in Montreal, <eob> so for months, he tried to track him down. <eob>
He even found Noël's business card <eol> inside the record sleeve. <eob>
That's how DIY Henri-Pierre Noël was. <eob>
So he found the card inside <eol> the record sleeve -- <eob> of course he did try to call, <eob> but after 30 years, <eol> the number didn't work anymore. <eob>
So it was only in Belgium, <eob> where the artist had once lived, <eob> that Kobal managed to find <eol> someone that knew the artist personally <eob> and gave him the contact. <eob>
So when he finally sat down with the artist, <eob> he made him a promise to someday find <eol> a way to get the album rereleased. <eob>
He then arranged <eol> for a British label called Wah Wah 45s <eob> to get the two albums reissued. <eob>
And what happens very often is, <eob> in these reissue projects, <eob> that it becomes very difficult <eol> to find the master tapes -- <eob> the original recording of the sessions. <eob>
Art can be destroyed by fires, <eol> floods, earthquakes, <eob> thrown in the garbage, <eob> or just lost forever. <eob>
But thankfully, <eob> the Henri-Pierre Noël tapes were safe <eob> and they were ready for remastering. <eob>
The record was finally rereleased <eob> and received praise from music critics, <eol> DJs and listeners worldwide -- <eob> the praise that it should <eol> have received in 1979. <eob>
The artist was so inspired that <eol> he decided to revive his music career, <eob> get back on a stage, and play <eol> for new audiences. <eob>
The artist, now in his 60s, <eob> told me, "This changed everything for me. <eob>
I went from planning my retirement <eob> to playing on the BBC Radio in London, and on Radio Canada and more." <eob> But also it gave him a chance to play <eob> in front of his three sons <eol> for the first time. <eob>
To me, this story shows perfectly the work <eol> of record diggers at its best. <eob>
Beyond the rarity and the dollar value -- <eob> and I'll be honest, we're totally obsessed by that -- <eob> the true beauty is to give <eol> art a second chance; <eob> to save art from oblivion. <eob>
The work of a good record digger <eol> is a constant loop of three phases. <eob>
The first thing we do is hunt. <eob>
We spend hours, days, <eol> years of our lives <eob> rummaging through dirty <eol> and dusty record bins. <eob>
Everything that we can do <eol> to find our hands on the gold. <eob>
Yes, you can find good records online, <eob> but for the deepest treasures, <eob> you need to get off the couch <eol> and into the wild. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> That's why we call it record digging <eol> and not record clicking. <eob>
But then the next thing <eol> we do is we gather. <eob> Based on our taste, <eol> expertise, personal agenda, <eob> we choose carefully <eol> which records to save, <eob> which records mean something to us. <eob>
We then try and find out every little <eol> thing we can about that record -- <eob> the artist, the label <eob> and supervital information <eob> like "Who's that playing trumpet on track three?" <eob> Then we file them, <eol> we contextualize them, <eob> and we keep them safe. <eob>
We are music archivists. <eob>
And the last thing we do <eol> to close the loop is we share. <eob>
Most record diggers that I know <eol> have some sort of a way <eob> to share their discovery <eol> and elevate the artist <eob> through an album reissue, <eob> a web article, a radio show. <eob>
We give records back their rightful <eol> place in music history. <eob>
We are tastemakers <eol> and curators. <eob> We are musicologists. <eob> So for myself <eob> and most of the record collectors <eol> I've encountered in 20 years, <eob> I think that we all have <eol> some sort of an outlet <eob> for these discoveries. <eob>
I think it's our way to keep our sanity <eol> and sort of sense of purpose <eob> in this very maddening obsession, <eob> because it can be sort of a lonely one. <eob>
But I think we also do it <eol> because it serves the human need <eob> to pass along cultural knowledge. <eob>
Speaking of the need for curation, <eob> in an era of overwhelming choice, <eob> it's been demonstrated <eob> that too much choice <eol> actually hinders discovery. <eob>
For example, <eob> if you're trying to watch <eol> something on Netflix, <eob> you're actually only browsing through a catalog <eol> of 6,000 titles. <eob>
Now, compare that with Spotify; <eob> if you want to pick <eol> something to listen to, <eob> you're browsing through a catalog <eol> of 30 million songs. <eob>
So I think as you can see, <eob> this notion of paralysis by choice <eob> affects music more than movies, <eob> for example. <eob>
And there's a few studies <eob> that are starting to show <eol> the effects of this. <eob>
A recent look at the UK music market <eob> shows that the top one percent of artists <eol> in the UK are actually earning 77 percent <eob> of the total revenues <eol> inside the music industry. <eob>
That's 2013, <eob> and that's progressively getting worse, <eob> or progressing. <eob>
Anyway, if you're in the one percent, <eol> I'm sure you're happy. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So the takeaway for me is <eob> it's easier for people to listen <eol> to music than ever before. <eob>
People have more music at their disposal <eol> than ever before, <eob> yet people choose to listen <eol> to more of the same music than ever before. <eob>
And that's a sad thing. <eob>
Inspired by my love for music research, <eol> record digging and curation, <eob> I started a website called "Music Is My Sanctuary" in 2007. <eob>
Our slogan has always been <eol> "Future Classics and Forgotten Treasures." <eob> And it shows our love for discovering music <eob> and introducing music both old and new. <eob>
From humble beginnings, <eob> we've built a worldwide <eol> platform with a massive audience <eob> with over 100 collaborators. <eob>
We've created over 10,000 pieces of content, <eob> over 500 hours <eol> of audio content. <eob>
Our audience consists of people <eob> who just want more than what's <eol> being offered to them <eob> by mainstream music channels. <eob>
They want to do -- <eob> they want to dig deeper, <eob> but they don't necessarily have 20 hours <eol> a week like us nerds, <eob> so they trust us to do that for them. <eob>
Curation is at the heart <eol> of everything we do. <eob>
We believe in human recommendations <eol> over algorithms. <eob>
I could talk about the passion <eol> of record digging for days, <eob> but let me conclude this way. <eob>
After many years of doing it, <eob> a record collector's collection becomes <eol> sort of his autobiography. <eob>
Last year, I was DJ-ing in Poland, <eob> and the people that were hosting me, <eob> they had this amazing record collection, <eob> and of course I was intrigued <eob> and I said, "Are you selling these?" <eob> They then explained to me <eol> that it was the collection <eob> that belonged to their dear friend Maceo <eol> who passed away a few months earlier. <eob>
And they were doing a project <eol> of inviting different people <eob> to take the collection and to create <eol> something new from it, <eob> whether it's sampling or DJ mixes, <eob> you know, just to give it a second life. <eob>
And so after a few hours <eol> of going through the collection myself <eob> and creating a DJ mix from it, <eob> even though I never got the chance to meet him, <eob> it felt like in a special way, <eob> me and him, <eob> we got to talk about records <eol> for a few hours. <eob>
So, as record diggers, <eob> our work and our record <eol> collections are there <eob> to be passed on <eol> to the next generation. <eob>
Beautiful art deserves to be cherished, <eol> shared and rediscovered. <eob>
Embrace curators; <eob> we are alternative voices <eol> to the mainstream music channels, <eob> digital or otherwise. <eob>
Go beyond the algorithm. <eob>
Whatever kind of music you like, <eob> there are so many websites, <eol> radio shows, DJs, record stores out there <eob> that are just waiting to share <eol> their discoveries with you. <eob>
We do this work for you. <eob>
All you have to do is open <eol> your ears and take risks. <eob>
This music will change your life. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
The creative process -- you know this -- <eob> from the first idea to the final product, <eob> is a long process. <eob>
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement, <eob> blood, sweat, tears and years. <eob>
And we're not saying <eol> you're going to go out for a walk <eob> and come back with the Sistine Chapel <eol> in your left hand. <eob>
So what frame of the creative process <eol> did we focus on? <eob>
Just this first part. <eob>
Just brainstorming, coming <eol> up with a new idea. <eob>
We actually ran four studies <eol> with a variety of people. <eob>
You were either walking <eol> indoors or outdoors. <eob>
And all of these studies <eol> found the same conclusion. <eob>
I'm only going to tell you <eol> about one of them today. <eob>
One of the tests we used for creativity <eol> was alternate uses. <eob>
In this test, you have four minutes. <eob>
Your job is to come up with as many other ways <eol> to use common everyday objects <eob> as you can think of. <eob>
So, for example, what else <eol> would you do with a key, <eob> other than to use it for opening up a lock? <eob>
Clearly, you could use it <eol> as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right? <eob> Maybe. That's sort of interesting, <eol> kind of new. But is it creative? <eob>
So people came up with <eol> as many ideas as they could, <eob> and we had to decide: <eob> Is this creative or not? <eob>
The definition of creativity <eol> that a lot of people go with <eob> is "appropriate novelty." <eob> For something to be appropriate, <eol> it has to be realistic, <eob> so unfortunately, you can't use a key <eol> as an eyeball. <eob> Boo! <eob> But "novel," the second thing, <eol> is that nobody had to have said it. <eob>
So for us, it had to be appropriate first, <eob> and then for novelty, <eob> nobody else in the entire population <eol> that we surveyed could have said it. <eob>
So you might think you could use <eol> a key to scratch somebody's car, <eob> but if somebody else said that, <eol> you didn't get credit for it. <eob>
Neither of you did. <eob> However, only one person said this: <eob> "If you were dying and it were a murder mystery, <eob> and you had to carve the name <eol> of the murderer into the ground <eob> with your dying words." <eob> One person said this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it's a creative idea, <eol> because it's appropriate and it's novel. <eob>
You either did this test and came up <eol> with ideas while you were seated <eob> or while you were walking on a treadmill. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They did the test twice, <eol> with different objects. <eob>
Three groups: the first group sat first <eob> and then sat again for the second test. <eob>
The second group sat first <eob> and then did the second test <eol> while walking on a treadmill. <eob>
The third group -- <eol> and this is interesting -- <eob> they walked on the treadmill <eol> first, and then they sat. <eob>
OK, so the two groups <eol> that sat together for the first test, <eob> they looked pretty similar to each other, <eob> and they averaged <eol> about 20 creative ideas per person. <eob>
The group that was walking <eol> on the treadmill <eob> did almost twice as well. <eob>
And they were just walking <eol> on a treadmill in a windowless room. <eob>
Remember, they took the test twice. <eob>
The people who sat twice for that second test <eol> didn't get any better; <eob> practice didn't help. <eob>
But these same people who were sitting <eol> and then went on the treadmill <eob> got a boost from walking. <eob>
Here's the interesting thing. <eob>
The people who were walking <eol> on the treadmill <eob> still had a residue effect of the walking, <eob> and they were still creative afterwards. <eob>
So the implication of this <eol> is that you should go for a walk <eob> before your next big meeting <eol> and just start brainstorming right away. <eob>
We have five tips for you <eob> that will help make this <eol> the best effect possible. <eob>
First, you want to pick a problem <eol> or a topic to brainstorm. <eob>
So, this is not the shower effect, <eob> when you're in the shower <eol> and all of a sudden, <eob> a new idea pops out <eol> of the shampoo bottle. <eob>
This is something you're thinking <eol> about ahead of time. <eob> They're intentionally thinking <eol> about brainstorming a different perspective <eob> on the walk. <eob>
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot: <eob> Is this OK while running? <eob>
Well, the answer for me <eol> is that if I were running, <eob> the only new idea I would have <eol> would be to stop running, so ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But if running for you is <eol> a comfortable pace, good. <eob>
It turns out, whatever physical activity <eol> is not taking a lot of attention. <eob>
So just walking at a comfortable pace <eol> is a good choice. <eob>
Also, you want to come up <eol> with as many ideas as you can. <eob>
One key of creativity is to not lock <eol> on that first idea. <eob> Keep going. <eob> Keep coming up with new ones, <eol> until you pick one or two to pursue. <eob>
You might worry <eol> that you don't want to write them down, <eob> because what if you forget them? <eob>
So the idea here is to speak them. <eob>
Everybody was speaking their new ideas. <eob>
So you can put your headphones <eol> on and record through your phone <eob> and then just pretend you're having <eol> a creative conversation, right? <eob>
Because the act of writing your idea <eol> down is already a filter. <eob>
You're going to be like, "Is this <eol> good enough to write down?" <eob> And then you write it down. <eob>
So just speak as many as you can, record them <eol> and think about them later. <eob>
And finally: don't do this forever. Right? <eob> If you're <eob> on the walk <eob> and that idea's not coming to you, <eob> come back to it later at another time. <eob>
I think we're coming up <eol> on a break right now, <eob> so I have an idea: <eob> Why don't you grab a leash <eob> and take your thoughts for a walk? <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
What images do we see <eol> from the rest of the world? <eob>
We see natural disasters, <eob> war, terror. <eob>
We see refugees, <eob> and we see horrible diseases. <eob> Right? <eob> We see beautiful beaches, <eob> cute animals, <eob> beautiful nature, <eob> cultural rites and stuff. <eob> And then we're supposed <eol> to make the connection in our head <eob> and create a worldview out of this. <eob>
And how is that possible? <eob>
I mean, the world seems so strange. <eob>
And I don't think it is. <eob>
I don't think the world <eol> is that strange, actually. <eob>
I've got an idea. <eob> So, imagine the world as a street, <eob> where the poorest live on one end <eol> and the richest on the other, <eob> and everyone in the world lives <eol> on this street. <eob>
You live there, I live there, <eob> and the neighbors we have are the ones <eol> with the same income. <eob>
People that live <eol> in the same block as me, <eob> they are from other countries, <eol> other cultures, other religions. <eob>
The street might look something like this. <eob>
And I was curious. <eob>
In Sweden where I live, <eob> I've been meeting quite a lot of students. <eob>
And I wanted to know, <eob> where would they think <eol> they belong on a street like this? <eob>
So we changed these houses into people. <eob>
This is the seven billion people <eol> that live in the world. <eob>
And just by living in Sweden, <eol> most likely you belong there, <eob> which is the richest group. <eob>
But the students, when you ask them, <eob> they think they are in the middle. <eob>
And how can you understand the world <eob> when you see all these scary <eol> images from the world, <eob> and you think you live in the middle, <eol> while you're actually atop? <eob> Not very easy. <eob>
So I sent out photographers <eob> to 264 homes in 50 countries -- <eol> so far, still counting -- <eob> and in each home, the photographers <eol> take the same set of photos. <eob>
They take the bed, <eob> the stove, <eob> the toys <eob> and about 135 other things. <eob>
So we have 40,000 images <eol> or something at the moment, <eob> and it looks something like this. <eob>
Here we see, it says on the top, <eob> "Families in the world by income," <eob> and we have the street represented <eol> just beneath it, you can see. <eob>
And then we see some <eol> of the families we have visited. <eob>
We have the poorer to the left, <eol> the richer to the right, <eob> and everybody else in between, <eol> as the concept says. <eob>
We can go down and see the different <eol> families we have been to so far. <eob>
Here, for instance, we have <eol> a family in Zimbabwe, <eob> one in India, one in Russia, <eol> and one in Mexico, for instance. <eob>
So we can go around and look <eol> at the families this way. <eob>
But of course, we can choose <eol> if we want to see some certain countries <eob> and compare them, <eob> or regions, or if we want, <eol> to see other things. <eob>
So let's go to the front doors <eob> and see what they look like. <eob>
Go here, and this is the world <eol> by front doors, ordered by income. <eob>
And we can see the big difference <eob> from India, Philippines, China, Ukraine, <eol> in these examples, for instance. <eob>
What if we go into the home? <eob> We can look at beds. <eob>
This is what beds can look like. <eob>
Doesn't look like <eol> the glossy magazines. <eob> Doesn't look like the scary <eol> images in the media. <eob>
So remember that the students in Sweden, <eob> they thought they were in the middle <eol> of the world income. <eob>
So let's go there. <eob> We zoom in here by filtering <eol> the street to the middle, <eob> like this, <eob> and then I ask the students: <eob> Is this what your bedroom <eol> looks like? <eob>
And they would actually <eol> not feel very at home. <eob>
So we go down and see, <eol> do they feel more at home here? <eob>
And they would say, <eob> no, this is not what a Swedish typical bedroom <eol> looks like. <eob>
We go up here, <eob> and suddenly, they feel sort of at home. <eob>
And we can see here in this image, <eob> we see bedrooms in China, Netherlands, <eob> South Korea, France <eol> and the United States, for instance. <eob>
So we can click here. <eob> If we want to know more about the family, <eol> the home in which this bed stands, <eob> we can just click it <eol> and go to the family, <eob> and we can see all the images <eol> from that family. <eob>
We can go this way, too. <eob>
And of course, this is free <eol> for anyone to use. <eob>
So just go here, and please add <eol> more images, of course. <eob>
My personal favorite that everyone always tries <eol> to make me not show, <eob> I'm going to show you now, <eol> and that's toilets, <eob> because you're not really allowed <eol> to look at people's toilets, <eob> but now we can just do it, right? <eob>
So here (Laughter) <eol> we have a lot of toilets. <eob>
They look pretty much <eol> as we're used to, right? <eob>
And they are in China, Netherlands, <eol> United States, Nepal and so forth, <eob> Ukraine, France. <eob>
And they look pretty similar, right? <eob>
But remember, we are in the top. <eob>
So what about checking all the toilets? <eob>
Now it looks a bit different, doesn't it? <eob>
So this way we can visually <eol> browse through categories of imagery, <eob> using photos as data. <eob>
But not everything works as a photo. <eob>
Sometimes it's easier <eol> to understand what people do, <eob> so we also do video snippets <eol> of everyday activities, <eob> such as washing hands, doing laundry, <eob> brushing teeth, and so on. <eob> And I'm going to show you a short snippet <eol> of tooth-brushing, <eob> and we ’ re going to start at the top. <eob>
So we see people brushing their teeth. <eob>
Pretty interesting to see <eob> the same type of plastic toothbrush <eol> is being used in all these places <eob> in the same way, right? <eob>
Some are more serious than others -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but still, the toothbrush is there. <eob>
And then, coming down <eol> to this poorer end, <eob> then we will see people <eol> start using sticks, <eob> and they will sometimes use their finger <eol> to brush their teeth. <eob>
So this particular woman in Malawi, <eob> when she brushes her teeth, <eob> she scrapes some mud off from her wall <eob> and she mixes it with water, <eol> and then she's brushing. <eob>
Therefore, in the Dollar Street material, <eob> we have tagged this image <eob> not only as her wall, which it is, <eob> but also as her toothpaste, <eob> because that is also what she uses it for. <eob>
So we can say, in the poorer <eol> end of the street, <eob> you will use a stick or your finger, <eob> you come to the middle, <eol> you will start using a toothbrush, <eob> and then you come up to the top, <eob> and you will start using one each. <eob>
Pretty nice, not sharing <eol> a toothbrush with your grandma. <eob>
And you can also look at some countries. <eob>
Here, we have the income <eol> distribution within the US, <eob> most people in the middle. <eob>
We have a family we visited in the richer <eol> end, the Howards. <eob> We can see their home here. <eob> And we also visited a family <eol> in the poorer end, down here. <eob>
And then what we can do now <eol> is we can do instant comparisons <eob> of things in their homes. <eob>
Let's look in their cutlery drawer. <eob>
So, observe the Hadleys: <eob> they have all their cutlery <eol> in a green plastic box. <eob> and they have a few different types <eol> and some of them are plastic, <eob> while the Howards, they have <eol> this wooden drawer <eob> with small wooden compartments in it <eob> and a section for each type of cutlery. <eob>
We can add more families, <eob> and we can see kitchen sinks, <eob> or maybe living rooms. <eob>
Of course, we can do the same <eol> in other countries. <eob>
So we go to China, we pick three families. <eob> we look at their houses, <eob> we can look at their sofas, <eob> we can look at their stoves. <eob>
And when you see these stoves, <eob> I think it's obvious <eol> that it's a stupid thing <eob> that usually, when we think <eol> about other countries, <eob> we think they have a certain way <eol> of doing things. <eob>
But look at these stoves. <eob> Very different, right, <eob> because it depends <eol> on what income level you have, <eob> how you're going to cook your food. <eob>
But the cool thing is when <eol> we start comparing across countries. <eob>
So here we have China and the US. <eob>
See the big overlap between these two. <eob>
So we picked the two homes <eol> we have already seen in these countries, <eob> the Wus and the Howards. <eob>
Standing in their bedroom, <eob> pretty hard to tell which one is China <eol> and which one is the US, right? <eob>
Both have brown leather sofas, <eob> and they have similar play structures. <eob>
Most likely both are made in China, <eob> so, I mean, that's not very strange -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but that is similar. <eob>
We can of course go down <eol> to the other end of the street, <eob> adding Nigeria. <eob>
So let's compare two homes <eol> in China and Nigeria. <eob>
Looking at the family photos, <eob> they do not look like they have <eol> a lot in common, do they? <eob> But start seeing their ceiling. <eob> They have a plastic shield and grass. <eob>
They have the same kind of sofa, <eob> they store their grain <eol> in similar ways, <eob> they're going to have fish for dinner, <eob> and they're boiling their water <eol> in identical ways. <eob>
So if we would visit <eol> any of these homes, <eob> there's a huge risk <eol> that we would say we know anything <eob> about the specific way you do things <eol> in China or Nigeria, <eob> while, looking at this, <eol> it's quite obvious -- <eob> this is how you do things <eol> on this income level. <eob>
That is what you can see when you go <eol> through the imagery in Dollar Street. <eob>
So going back to the figures, <eob> the seven billion people of the world, <eob> now we're going to do a quick recap. <eob>
We're going to look at comparisons <eol> of things in the poorest group: <eob> beds, <eob> roofs, <eob> cooking. <eob>
And observe, in all these comparisons, <eob> their homes are chosen <eob> so they are in completely different <eol> places of the world. <eob>
But what we see is pretty identical. <eob>
So the poorest billion cooking <eob> would look somewhat the same in these two places; <eob> you might not have shoes; <eob> eating, if you don't have a spoon; <eob> storing salt would be similar <eol> whether you're in Asia or in Africa; <eob> and going to the toilet <eol> would be pretty much the same experience <eob> whether you're in Nigeria or Nepal. <eob>
In the middle, we have a huge group <eol> of five billion, <eob> but here we can see <eol> you will have electric light, most likely; <eob> you will no longer sleep on the floor; <eob> you will store your salt in a container; <eob> you will have more than one spoon; <eob> you will have more than one pen; <eob> the ceiling is no longer leaking that much; <eob> you will have shoes; <eob> you might have a phone, <eob> toys, <eob> and produce waste. <eob>
Coming to our group up here, <eob> similar shoes, Jordan, US. <eob>
We have sofas, fruits, hairbrushes, <eob> bookshelves, <eob> toilet paper in Tanzania, <eol> Palestine, <eob> hard to distinguish <eob> if we would sit in US, <eol> Palestine or Tanzania from this one. <eob>
Vietnam, Kenya: <eob> wardrobes, lamps, <eol> black dogs, floors, soap, <eob> laundry, clocks, computers, <eob> phones, and so on, right? <eob>
So we have a lot of similarities <eol> all over the world, <eob> and the images we see in the media, <eob> they show us the world is a very, <eol> very strange place. <eob>
But when we look <eol> at the Dollar Street images, <eob> they do not look like that. <eob>
So using Dollar Street, <eob> we can use photos as data, <eob> and country stereotypes -- <eob> they simply fall apart. <eob>
So the person staring back at us <eol> from the other side of the world <eob> actually looks quite a lot like you. <eob>
And that implies both a call to action <eob> and a reason for hope. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We've had it all wrong. <eob> Everybody. <eob> We've had it all wrong. <eob>
The very last thing we need to do <eob> is clean the ocean. <eob> Very last. <eob> Yeah, there is a garbage truck of plastic <eob> entering the ocean <eob> every minute <eob> of every hour of every day. <eob>
And countless birds and animals <eob> are dying just from encountering plastic. <eob>
We are experiencing the fastest rate <eol> of extinction ever, <eob> and plastic is in the food chain. <eob>
is clean the ocean. <eob> Very last. <eob> And I'm still here, standing in front of you, <eob> telling you the very last thing <eol> we need to do <eob>
If you were to walk into a kitchen, <eob> sink overflowing, <eob> water spilling all over the floor, <eob> soaking into the walls, <eob> you had to think fast, <eol> you're going to panic; <eob> you've got a bucket, a mop or a plunger. <eob>
What do you do first? <eob>
Why don't we turn off the tap? <eob>
It would be pointless to mop <eob> or plunge or scoop up the water <eob> if we don't turn off the tap first. <eob>
Why aren't we doing the same <eol> for the ocean? <eob>
Even if the Ocean Cleanup project, <eob> beach plastic recycling programs <eob> or any well-meaning <eob> ocean plastic company <eob> was a hundred percent successful, <eob> it would still be too little, too late. <eob>
We're trending to produce <eol> over 300 million ton <eob> of plastic this year. <eob>
Roughly eight million ton <eob> are racing to flow <eol> into the ocean <eob> to join the estimated 150 million <eol> ton already there. <eob>
Reportedly, 80 percent of ocean plastic <eob> is coming from those countries <eol> that have extreme poverty. <eob>
And if you live in the grips of poverty <eob> concerned, always, about food <eob> or shelter <eob> or a sense of security, <eob> recycling -- <eob> it's beyond your realm of imagination. <eob>
And that is exactly why <eob> I created the Plastic Bank. <eob>
We are the world's largest chain of stores <eob> for the ultra-poor, <eob> where everything in the store <eol> is available to be purchased <eob> using plastic garbage. <eob> Everything. <eob> School tuition. <eob> Medical insurance. <eob> Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power. <eob>
Sustainable cooking fuel, <eol> high-efficiency stoves. <eob>
And we keep wanting to add everything else <eob> that the world may need and can't afford. <eob>
Our chain of stores in Haiti <eol> are more like community centers, <eob> where one of our collectors, <eob> Lise Nasis, <eob> has the opportunity to earn a living <eob> by collecting material <eol> from door to door, <eob> from the streets, <eob> from business to business. <eob>
And at the end of her day, <eol> she gets to bring the material back to us, <eob> where we weigh it, we check it for quality, <eob> and we transfer the value into her account. <eob>
Lise now has a steady, <eob> reliable source of income. <eob>
And that value we transfer <eol> into an online account for her. <eob>
And because it's a savings account, <eol> it becomes an asset <eob> that she can borrow against. <eob>
And because it's online, <eob> she has security against robbery, <eob> and I think more importantly, <eob> she has a new sense of worth. <eob>
And even the plastic <eob> has a new sense of value. <eob> Hm. <eob>
And that plastic we collect, <eob> and we add value to, <eob> we sort it, <eob> we remove labels, <eob> we remove caps. <eob>
We either shred it <eob> or we pack it into bales <eol> and get it ready for export. <eob>
Now, it's no different than walking <eol> over acres of diamonds. <eob>
If Lise was to walk <eol> over acres of diamonds <eob> but there was no store, no bank, <eob> no way to use the diamonds, no way to exchange them, <eob> they'd be worthless, too. <eob>
And Lise was widowed <eob> after the 2010 Haitian earthquake, <eob> left homeless without an income. <eob>
And as a result of the program, <eob> Lise can afford her two daughters <eol>' school tuition <eob> and uniforms. <eob>
Now, that plastic <eob> we sell. <eob>
We sell it to suppliers <eol> of great brands <eob> like Marks and Spencer, <eob> who have commissioned the use <eol> of social plastic <eob> in their products. <eob>
Or like Henkel, <eob> the German consumer-goods company, <eob> who are using social plastic directly <eol> into their manufacturing. <eob>
We've closed the loop <eob> in the circular economy. <eob>
Now buy shampoo <eob> or laundry detergent <eob> that has social plastic packaging, <eob> and you are indirectly contributing <eob> to the extraction of plastic <eol> from ocean-bound waterways <eob> and alleviating poverty <eob> at the same time. <eob>
And that model <eob> is completely replicable. <eob>
In São Paulo, <eob> a church sermon encourages parishioners <eob> to not just bring offering on Sunday, <eob> but the recycling, too. <eob>
We then match the church with the poor. <eob>
Or, I believe more powerfully, <eob> we could match a mosque in London <eol> with an impoverished church in Cairo. <eob>
Or like in Vancouver, <eob> with our bottle-deposit program: <eob> now any individual <eob> or any group <eob> can now return <eob> their deposit-refundable recyclables, <eob> and instead of taking back the cash, <eob> they have the opportunity <eol> to deposit that value <eob> into the account of the poor around the world. <eob>
We can now use our recycling <eob> to support and create recyclers. <eob>
One bottle deposited at home <eob> could help extract hundreds <eol> around the world. <eob>
Or, like Shell, <eob> the energy company, <eob> who's invested in <eol> our plastic-neutral program. <eob>
Plastic neutrality is like carbon-neutral. <eob>
But plastic neutrality invests <eol> in recycling infrastructure <eob> where it doesn't exist. <eob> And it provides an incentive for the poor <eob> by providing a price increase. <eob>
Or — <eob> like in the slums of Manila, <eob> where the smallest market <eob> with a simple scale and a phone <eob> can now accept social plastic <eob> as a new form of payment by weight, <eob> allowing them to serve more people <eob> and have their own greater social impact. <eob>
And what's common here <eob> is that social plastic <eob> is money. <eob>
at the same time. <eob> Social plastic is money, <eob> a globally recognizable <eol> and tradable currency that, when used, <eob> alleviates poverty <eol> and cleans the environment <eob>
It's not just plastic. <eob>
It's not recycled plastic, <eol> it's social plastic, <eob> a material whose value is transferred <eob> through the lives of the people <eol> who encounter it, <eob> rich and poor. <eob>
Humans have produced <eob> over eight trillion kilograms of plastic, <eob> most of it still here as waste. <eob> Eight trillion kilograms. <eob> Worth roughly 50 cents a kilo, <eob> we're potentially unleashing <eol> a four-trillion-dollar value. <eob>
See, I see social plastic <eob> as the Bitcoin for the earth -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and available for everyone. <eob>
Now the entire ecosystem <eol> is managed and supported <eob> through an online banking platform <eob> that provides for the safe, <eol> authentic transfer of value globally. <eob>
You can now deposit your recyclables <eol> in Vancouver or Berlin, <eob> and a family could withdraw building bricks <eol> or cell phone minutes <eob> in the slums of Manila. <eob> Or Lise — <eob> she could deposit recycling <eol> at a center in Port-au-Prince, <eob> and her mother could withdraw cooking fuel or cash <eob> across the city. <eob>
And the app adds rewards, <eob> incentives, <eob> group prizes, <eob> user rating. <eob>
We've gamified recycling. <eob>
We add fun and formality <eob> into an informal industry. <eob>
We're operating in Haiti <eol> and the Philippines. <eob>
We've selected staff <eob> and partners for Brazil. <eob>
And this year, we're committing <eol> to India and Ethiopia. <eob>
We're collecting hundreds <eob> and hundreds of tons of material. <eob>
We continue to add partners <eob> and customers, <eob> and we increase our collection <eol> volumes every day. <eob>
Now as a result <eol> of our program with Henkel, <eob> they've committed to use <eol> over 100 million kilograms <eob> of material every year. <eob>
That alone will put <eol> hundreds of millions of dollars <eob> into the hands of the poor <eob> in the emerging economies. <eob>
And so now, <eob> we can all <eob> be a part of the solution <eob> and not the pollution. <eob>
And so, OK, maybe cleaning <eol> the ocean is futile. <eob> It might be. <eob> But preventing ocean plastic <eob> could be humanity's richest opportunity. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Imagine that you're a member of Congress. <eob>
You've worked very hard. <eob>
You've knocked on thousands of doors, <eob> sweating and shivering, depending on the season. <eob>
You've made hundreds, <eob> maybe thousands of phone calls <eol> to people you don't even know <eob> asking for their support, <eob> begging for their money. <eob>
And now you've got one of these. <eob> It's hanging on a door <eol> in Washington, DC. <eob> It says you're a member of Congress, <eob> that you represent the people <eol> of your state. <eob>
Now, imagine you're a conservative <eol> member of Congress. <eob>
For some of you here in Boston, Massachusetts, <eob> that's going to take <eol> a powerful imagination, all right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But imagine with me <eob> that you're a conservative member <eol> of Congress. <eob>
You grew up on Milton Friedman. <eob>
You love his free markets, <eob> free enterprise and free trade. <eob>
You've watched Ronald Reagan's farewell address <eol> over and over, <eob> and you cry every time -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
he gets to the part <eol> about the shining city on the hill, <eob> and how if the city <eol> had to have walls, <eob> the walls had doors -- <eob> doors to let in those yearning <eol> to breathe free. <eob>
You get goosebumps when you think <eol> of him telling Mr. Gorbachev <eob> to tear down his wall. <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob> and you agree with President John F. Kennedy <eob> that America is an exceptional place. <eob>
For inspiration, <eob> you go to YouTube and you watch <eol> his speech at Rice University, <eob> September of 1962, <eob> the "moon shot" speech. <eob>
And you're amazed <eol> that he admits in that speech -- <eob> a speech of 17 minutes <eol> of pure American exceptionalism -- <eob> that some of the materials <eol> needed for the spacecraft <eob> hadn't been invented yet. <eob> No matter. <eob> We're going to the Moon <eol> before the decade is out. <eob>
You agree with him <eob> that the vows of this nation <eol> can be fulfilled <eob> only if we in this nation are first <eob> and therefore we intend to be first. <eob>
You've taken as your own the affect <eol> that he so embodied. <eob> That when leaders are optimistic, <eob> they're saying they believe in the people <eol> they represent. <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob> and you believe in the precautionary principle. <eob>
You believe in data-driven analysis. <eob>
You know that climate change <eol> is real and human-caused, <eob> and you see in climate change <eob> a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment. <eob>
One that calls for the greatness <eol> of your nation <eob> as much as the original Sputnik moment. <eob>
You are a conservative member of Congress. <eob>
You high-five the memory <eol> of Jack Kemp, <eob> and believe with him <eob> that the test of conservatism is that it works <eol> for everyone, <eob> regardless of skin color. <eob>
You're appalled by the alt-right. <eob>
You want them to have nothing to do <eol> with your brand, your party, your legacy. <eob>
You utterly reject them. <eob> You -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob>
You rise with compassion to protect <eol> the lives of the unborn, <eob> but otherwise you think <eol> the bedroom of consenting adults <eob> is a rather strange place <eol> for the government to be. <eob>
You are a conservative member of Congress. <eob>
With John Adams, <eob> you fear the mob. <eob>
Because you know, as he knew, <eob> that a mob is not able to protect liberty, <eob> not even its own. <eob>
And you're amazed at the wisdom <eol> that he and other framers had <eob> in establishing a slow, deliberative governing process -- <eob> an inherently conservative <eol> governing process. <eob>
It would serve a country. <eob>
It would grow far greater <eol> than they could ever imagine. <eob>
You are a conservative member of Congress. <eob>
You fear the fire <eol> of populist nationalism, <eob> because you know that those <eol> who play with fire <eob> can't control it. <eob>
You see their pitchforks and torches, <eob> and you know they're not <eol> good building tools. <eob>
The pitchforks and torches can tear <eol> down and burn up but they can't build up. <eob>
They can't build up <eol> the institutions and the communities <eob> so necessary to a stable <eol> and prosperous country. <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob> and you fear the next county party convention. <eob>
You so wish for your party <eol> to be the grand opportunity party, <eob> not the grumpy old party. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know that they want <eol> to hear from you some old saw <eob> about how a secret Muslim, <eol> non-American socialist took over in the White House <eob> and destroyed the country, <eob> and you know that none of that's true. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know that they want to hear your say <eol> that you're OK with insults, <eob> OK with "lock her up" chants <eob> and OK with policy pronouncements <eob> with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness <eol> that 140 characters can muster. <eob>
You are a conservative member of Congress. <eob>
You realize that many in your party <eol> look to some good old days <eob> that you know never existed. <eob>
They hold on, for example, <eob> to the fossils that fueled <eol> the last century of growth, <eob> but you know that better, cleaner <eol> more abundant fuels await us, <eob> and you know that that abundance can lead <eol> the world to more energy, <eob> more mobility <eob> and more freedom. <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob>
You realize that many in your party <eol> pine for the '50s and the' 60s <eob> because those were, after all, <eol> the good old days. <eob>
But you know that the Cuyahoga River <eol> was on fire back then. <eob>
You know that in Pittsburgh, <eob> street lights came on at noon <eol> because of the soot in the air. <eob>
The schools were segregated, <eob> neighborhoods redlined, <eob> that communism threatened freedom, <eob> and if you got cancer, you weren't likely <eol> to fight for long. <eob>
You're a conservative member of Congress, <eob> and you want to sound like JFK at Rice, <eob> where JFK said, "It's understandable <eob> why some would have us stay <eol> where we are <eob> a little bit longer, <eob> to wait and to rest." <eob> But everything within you says with him, <eob> this city of Houston, <eob> this state of Texas, <eob> this country of the United States <eol> was not built by those who waited <eob> and rested and wished to look behind them. <eob>
You are ready to lead. <eob>
You are ready to prove <eol> the power of free enterprise <eob> to solve challenges like climate change. <eob>
You are ready to lead. <eob>
You -- <eob> So I've got a suggestion for you then: <eob> now. <eob> Step out, <eob> step up. <eob> You know, we ask America's best <eob> to die on literal hills <eob> in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. <eob>
Is it too much to ask you to die <eol> a figurative death <eob> on a political hill <eol> in Washington, DC? <eob>
You know, at the end <eol> of your time in Washington, <eob> they're going to take <eol> this plaque off the door. <eob>
They're going to hand it to you; <eob> you're going to go home with it. <eob>
Can you imagine the emptiness <eol> of knowing that you stood for nothing, <eob> that you risk nothing, <eob> that all you did was follow fearful people <eol> to where they were already going <eob> rather than trying to lead them <eol> to a better place? <eob>
If you're not willing <eol> to lose your seat in Congress, <eob> there's really very little reason to be there. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So here's the thing: <eob> it's not too late. <eob>
There's still time to lead. <eob> Speak out, <eob> speak up, <eob> call lunacy what it is: <eob> lunacy. <eob> Tell the American people that <eol> we still have moon shots in us. <eob>
Tell the folks at the county party convention, <eob> "You bet free enterprise <eol> can solve climate change." <eob> Tell them that Milton Friedman would say <eol> to tax pollution <eob> rather than profits. <eob>
Tell them that it's OK — <eob> no, it's a good thing <eob> that progressives would agree. <eob>
Tell them the very good news <eol> that we can bring America together <eob> to solve these challenges <eol> and to lead the world. <eob>
Tell them that free enterprise <eol> can do these things. <eob>
Tell them that America must stop <eol> the dividing, <eob> and must start the uniting. <eob> Tell them. <eob> Play your part before <eol> it's too late. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
My best friend recently had a baby. <eob>
And when I met him, <eob> I was in awe of witnessing this tiny, <eol> beautiful being enter into our lives. <eob>
I also had this realization that he wasn't <eol> just entering our lives, <eob> he was entering the world -- <eob> this crazy world that, especially now, <eol> feels so incredibly challenging. <eob>
I spend a lot time in my work <eol> talking to people about who we are, <eob> who we must be <eob> and what our healing looks like. <eob>
So the first time I held him, <eob> I had my pep talk ready. <eob>
You know, I wanted him to know <eol> that the way we find our strength <eob> is through our challenges. <eob>
I wanted him to know <eol> that we can all do something big <eob> when we start small. <eob>
I wanted him to know <eol> that each of us is more resilient <eob> than we could ever imagine. <eob>
So here I am holding little Thelonious. <eob>
I look down at him, <eob> and it hits me: <eob> he's a baby. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> He's not going to understand <eol> a single word I say to him. <eob>
So instead, I thought <eol> it would probably be a better idea <eob> if I went home and wrote. <eob>
So, this is for grownups, <eob> but it's also for Thelonious, <eob> when he's old enough to read it: <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "Be a better person." <eob> Do not be afraid to say, "Yes." <eob> Start by being a better listener. <eob>
Start by being better <eol> at walking down the street. <eob> See people. <eob> Say, "Hello." <eob> Ask how they are doing and listen <eol> to what they say. <eob>
Start by being a better friend, <eob> a better parent, <eol> a better child to your parents; <eob> a better sibling, a better lover, <eol> a better partner. <eob>
Start by being a better neighbor. <eob>
Meet someone you do not know, <eol> and get to know them. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "What are you going to do?" <eob> Do not be afraid to say, <eob> "I know I can't do everything, <eob> but I can do something." <eob> Walk into more rooms saying, <eob> "I'm here to help." <eob> Become intimate with generosity. <eob>
Give what you can give, <eol> and do what you can do. <eob>
Give dollars, give cents, give your time, <eob> give your love, <eob> give your heart, give your spirit. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "We need peace." <eob> Find your peace within, <eob> hold it sacred, <eob> bring it with you everywhere you go. <eob>
Peace cannot be shared <eol> or created with others <eob> if we cannot first generate it within. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "They are the enemy." <eob> Love enough to know <eob> that just because someone disagrees with you, <eob> it does not make them your enemy. <eob>
You may not win an argument, <eob> you may not change a mind, <eob> but if you choose to, <eob> you can always achieve <eol> the triumph of radical empathy -- <eob> an understanding of the heart. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "We need justice." <eob> Investigate. <eob>
Find truth beyond the stories <eol> you are told. <eob>
Find truth beyond the way things seem. <eob>
Ask, "Why?" <eob> Ask, "Is this fair?" <eob> Ask, "How did we get here?" <eob> Do this with compassion. <eob> Do this with forgiveness. <eob> Learn to forgive others. <eob>
Start by truly learning <eol> how to forgive yourself. <eob>
We are all more than our mistakes. <eob>
We are all more <eol> than who we were yesterday. <eob>
We are all deserving of our dignity. <eob>
See yourself in others. <eob>
Recognize that your justice is my justice, <eob> and mine is yours. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> There can be no liberation <eol> for one of us if the other is not free. <eob> (Applause) <eob> "I am violent." <eob> Respond by saying, <eob> "I am not. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> Not with my words and not <eol> with my actions." <eob> "We need to heal the planet." <eob> Start by saying, "No, thank you. <eol> I don't need a plastic bag." <eob> Recycle, reuse. <eob>
Start by picking up one piece <eol> of trash on your block. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "There are too many problems." <eob> Do not be afraid to be <eol> a part of the solutions. <eob>
Start by discussing the issues. <eob>
We cannot overcome what we ignore. <eob>
The more we talk about things, <eob> the more we see that the issues <eol> are connected <eob> because we are connected. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "We need to end racism." <eob> Start by healing it in your own family. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "How do we speak <eol> to bias and bigotry?" <eob> Start by having the first conversation <eol> at your own kitchen table. <eob>
The world will say to you, <eob> "There is so much hate." <eob> Devote yourself to love. <eob>
Love yourself so much <eol> that you can love others <eob> without barriers and without judgment. <eob>
When the world asks us big questions <eol> that require big answers, <eob> we have two options. <eob>
One: to feel so overwhelmed or unqualified, <eol> we do nothing. <eob>
Two: to start with one small act <eol> and qualify ourselves. <eob>
I am the director of national security, <eob> and so are you. <eob>
Maybe no one appointed us and there <eol> were no senate confirmations, <eob> but we can secure a nation. <eob>
When you help just one person <eol> to be more secure, <eob> a nation is more secure. <eob>
With just one outstretched hand <eol> that says, "Are you OK? <eob>
I am here for you," <eob> we can transform insecurity into security. <eob>
We find ourselves saying to the world, <eob> "What should I do?" <eol> "What should we do?" <eob> The better question might be: <eob> "How am I showing up?" <eob> I ask the world for peace, <eob> but do I show up with peace <eol> when I see my family and friends? <eob>
I ask the world to end hatred, <eob> but do I show up with love <eol> not only for those I know, <eob> but those I don't know? <eob>
Do I show up with love for those <eol> whose ideas conflict with my own? <eob>
I ask the world to end suffering, <eob> but do I show up for those <eol> who are suffering on my street corner? <eob>
We say to the world, <eob> "Please change; we need change." <eob> But how do we show up <eol> to change our own lives? <eob>
How do we show up to change the lives <eol> of the people in our communities? <eob>
James Baldwin said, "Everything now, <eol> we must assume is in our own hands; <eob> we have no right to assume otherwise." <eob> This has always been true. <eob>
No one nominated Harriet Tubman to her purpose, <eob> to her mission, <eol> to her courage. <eob>
She did not say, "I'm not a congressman <eob> or the president of the United States, <eob> so how could I possibly participate <eol> in the fight to abolish <eob> a system as big as slavery?" <eob> She instead spent 10 years making 19 trips, <eob> freeing 300 people, <eob> one group of people at a time. <eob>
Think about the children of those 300 people, <eob> the grandchildren, <eol> the great-grandchildren and beyond. <eob>
Our righteous acts create immeasurable ripples <eob> in the endless river of justice. <eob>
Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey, Irma or Maria, <eol> people did not say, <eob> "There is so much damage. <eob>
What should I do? <eob> "They got to work on what they could do. <eob>
Those with boats got in their boats <eob> and started loading in every woman, <eol> man and child they came across. <eob>
Near and far, people gave their dollars, <eob> they gave their cents, <eob> they gave their hearts, <eob> they gave their spirit. <eob>
We spend so much time <eob> thinking we don't have the power <eol> to change the world. <eob>
We forget that the power to change <eol> someone's life is always in our hands. <eob>
Change-making does not belong <eol> to one group of people; <eob> it belongs to all of us. <eob>
You don't have to wait <eol> on anyone to tell you <eob> that you are in this. <eob> Begin. <eob> Start by doing what you can <eol> with what you've got, <eob> where you are <eob> and in your own way. <eob>
We don't have to be heroes, <eob> wear a uniform, <eob> call ourselves activists <eob> or get elected to participate. <eob>
We just have to be brave enough to care. <eob>
Now, around the time Thelonious was born, <eob> I went to the birthday party <eol> of a man named Gene Moretti. <eob>
It was his 100th birthday, <eob> which means he lived in the United States <eol> through the Depression, World War II, <eob> the struggle for workers' rights, <eob> the achievement <eol> of a woman's right to vote, <eob> the Civil Rights Movement, <eob> a man on the moon, the Vietnam War <eob> and the election <eol> of the first black president. <eob>
I sat with him, and I said, <eob> "Gene, you have lived <eol> in America for 100 years. <eob>
Do you have any advice <eol> during these current times?" <eob> He smiled and said to me simply, "Yes. <eob>
Be good to as many people as possible. <eob> "And as he danced with my mother, <eob> who is, by the way, half his age, <eob> in a room full of generations <eol> of his family and hundreds of people, <eob> many of whom traveled thousands of miles <eol> to be there to celebrate him, <eob> I realized that he had not just given me advice, <eob> he had given me the first step <eob> that every single one of us is capable of making <eob> if we want to create <eol> a real, wholehearted impact <eob> on the world around us, right now." <eob> Be good to as many people as possible. <eob> " <eob>
A few years ago, <eob> I set out on a mission to find God. <eob>
Now, I'm going to tell you <eol> right up front that I failed, <eob> which, as a lawyer, <eob> is a really hard thing for me to admit. <eob>
But on that failed journey, <eob> a lot of what I found was enlightening. <eob>
And one thing in particular <eol> gave me a lot of hope. <eob>
It has to do with the magnitude <eol> and significance of our differences. <eob>
So, I was raised in America <eol> by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu, <eob> but practicing a strict and relatively <eol> unknown religion outside of India <eob> called Jainism. <eob>
To give you an idea of just <eol> how minority that makes me: <eob> people from India represent roughly one percent <eol> of the US population; <eob> Hindus, about 0.7 percent; <eob> Jains, at most .00046 percent. <eob>
To put that in context: <eob> more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year <eob> than are followers of the Jain religion in America. <eob>
To add to my minority <eol> mix, my parents then decided, <eob> "What a great idea! <eob>
Let's send her to Catholic school "— <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
where my sister and I were <eol> the only non-white, <eob> non-Catholic students <eol> in the entire school. <eob>
At the Infant Jesus <eol> of Prague School in Flossmoor, Illinois -- <eob> yes, that's really what it was called -- <eob> we were taught to believe <eol> that there is a single Supreme Being <eob> who is responsible for everything, <eob> the whole shebang, <eob> from the creation of the Universe <eol> to moral shepherding to eternal life. <eob>
But at home, <eob> I was being taught something <eol> entirely different. <eob>
Followers of the Jain religion <eob> don't believe in a single Supreme Being <eob> or even a team of Supreme Beings. <eob>
Instead, we're taught <eol> that God manifests <eob> as the perfection <eol> of each of us as individuals, <eob> and that we're actually spending <eol> our entire lives <eob> striving to remove the bad karmas <eob> that stand in the way of us becoming <eol> our own godlike, perfect selves. <eob>
On top of that, one of the core <eol> principles of Jainism <eob> is something called "non-absolutism." <eob> Non-absolutists believe <eol> that no single person <eob> can hold ownership <eol> or knowledge of absolute truth, <eob> even when it comes to religious beliefs. <eob>
Good luck testing that concept out <eob> on the priests and nuns in your Catholic school. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No wonder I was confused <eob> and hyperaware of how different <eol> I was from my peers. <eob>
Cut to 20-something years later, <eob> and I found myself to be <eol> a highly spiritual person, <eob> but I was floundering. <eob>
I was spiritually homeless. <eob>
I came to learn <eol> that I was a "None," <eob> which isn't an acronym <eol> or a clever play on words, <eob> nor is it one of these. <eob>
It's simply the painfully uninspired name <eob> given to everyone who checks off the box "none" <eob> when Pew Research asks them <eol> about their religious affiliation. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, a couple of interesting <eol> things about Nones are: <eob> there are a lot of us, <eob> and we skew young. <eob>
In 2014, there were <eol> over 56 million religiously unaffiliated Nones <eob> in the United States. <eob>
And Nones account for over <eol> one-third of adults <eob> between the ages of 18 to 33. <eob>
But the most interesting <eol> thing to me about Nones <eob> is that we're often spiritual. <eob>
In fact, 68 percent of us believe, <eol> with some degree of certainty, <eob> that there is a God. <eob>
We're just not sure who it is. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the first takeaway for me <eob> when I realized I was a None <eol> and had found that information out <eob> was that I wasn't alone. <eob>
I was finally part of a group in America <eob> that had a lot of members, <eob> which felt really reassuring. <eob>
But then the second, <eol> not-so-reassuring takeaway <eob> was that, oh, man, <eob> there are a lot of us. <eob>
That can't be good, <eob> because if a lot of highly spiritual people <eol> are currently godless, <eob> maybe finding God is not going to be <eol> as easy as I had originally hoped. <eob>
So that is when I decided <eol> that on my spiritual journey, <eob> I was going to avoid the obvious places <eob> and skip the big-box religions <eol> altogether <eob> and instead venture out into the spiritual <eol> fringe <eob> of mediums <eob> and faith healers <eob> and godmen. <eob>
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist, <eob> which means I was pretty inclined <eol> to keep a fairly open mind, <eob> which turned out to be a good thing, <eob> because I went to a witch's potluck dinner <eob> at the LGBT Center in New York City, <eob> where I befriended two witches; <eob> drank a five-gallon jerrican full of volcanic water <eob> with a shaman in Peru; <eob> got a hug from a saint <eol> in the convention center -- <eob> she smelled really nice -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
chanted for hours in a smoke-filled, <eol> heat-infused sweat lodge <eob> on the beaches of Mexico; <eob> worked with a tequila-drinking <eol> medium to convene with the dead, <eob> who oddly included both my deceased <eol> mother-in-law <eob> and the deceased manager <eol> of the hip-hop group The Roots. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, my mother-in-law told me <eol> she was really happy <eob> her son had chosen me for his wife. <eob> Duh! But -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> But the manager <eol> of The Roots <eob> said that maybe I should cut back <eol> on all the pasta I was eating. <eob>
I think we can all agree <eob> that it was lucky for my husband <eol> that it wasn't his dead mother <eob> who suggested I lay off carbs. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I also joined a laughing yoga group <eol> out of South Africa; <eob> witnessed a woman have a 45-minute orgasm -- <eob> I am not making this up -- <eob> as she tapped into the energy <eol> of the universe -- <eob> I think I'm going <eol> to go back there -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
called God from a phone booth <eol> in the Nevada desert at Burning Man, <eob> wearing a unitard <eol> and ski goggles; <eob> and I had an old Indian guy <eol> lie on top of me, <eob> and no, he wasn't my husband. <eob>
This was a perfect stranger named Paramji, <eob> and he was chanting into my chakras <eob> as he tapped into the energy forces <eol> of the Universe to heal my "yoni," <eob> which is a Sanskrit word for "vagina." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was going to have a slide here, <eob> but a few people suggested <eob> that a slide of my yoni <eol> at TED -- even TEDWomen -- <eob> not the best idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Very early in my quest, <eob> I also went to see the Brazilian <eol> faith healer John of God <eob> at his compound down in Brazil. <eob>
Now, John of God is considered <eol> a full-trance medium, <eob> which basically means he can talk <eol> to dead people. <eob>
But in his case, he claims <eol> to channel a very specific group <eob> of dead saints and doctors <eob> in order to heal <eol> whatever's wrong with you. <eob>
And although John of God does not <eol> have a medical degree <eob> or even a high school diploma, <eob> he actually performs surgery -- <eob> the real kind, with a scalpel, <eob> but no anesthesia. <eob>
Yeah, I don't know. <eob>
He also offers invisible surgery, <eol> where there is no cutting, <eob> and surrogate surgery, <eob> where he supposedly can treat <eol> somebody who is thousands of miles away <eob> by performing a procedure on a loved one. <eob>
Now, when you go <eol> to visit John of God, <eob> there are all kinds of rules and regulations. <eob>
It's a whole complicated thing, <eob> but the bottom line is that <eol> you can visit John of God <eob> and present him with three things <eol> that you would like fixed, <eob> and he will set the dead saints <eol> and doctors to work on your behalf <eob> to get the job done. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, before you snicker, <eob> consider <eob> that, at least according to his website, <eob> over eight million people -- <eob> including Oprah, <eob> the Goddess of Daytime TV -- <eob> have gone to see John of God, <eob> and I was pre-wired to keep an open mind. <eob>
But to be honest, the whole thing for me <eol> was kind of weird and inconclusive, <eob> and in the end, I flew home, <eob> even more confused <eol> than I already started out. <eob>
But that doesn't mean <eol> I came home empty-handed. <eob>
In the weeks leading up <eol> to my trip to Brazil, <eob> I mentioned my upcoming plans <eol> to some friends <eob> and to a couple of colleagues at Google, <eob> where I was a lawyer at the time. <eob>
And I might have mentioned it <eol> to a couple more people <eob> because I'm chatty, <eob> including my neighbor, <eob> the guy who works at the local coffee <eol> shop I go to each morning, <eob> the checkout lady at Whole Foods <eob> and a stranger who sat next to me <eol> on the subway. <eob>
I told each of them where I was going <eob> and why, <eob> and I offered to carry three wishes <eol> of theirs down to Brazil, <eob> explaining that anyone going to see John of God <eob> could act as a proxy for others <eob> and save them the trip. <eob>
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed. <eob>
Friends told friends who told friends, <eob> and those friends <eol> apparently told more friends, <eob> other strangers <eol> and the guys at their coffee shops, <eob> until it seemed that days <eol> before I left for Brazil <eob> that there was no one <eol> who did not have my email address. <eob>
And at the time, all I could conclude <eol> was that I had offered too much <eob> to too many. <eob>
But when I actually reread those messages <eol> a few years later, <eob> I noticed something completely different. <eob>
Those emails actually shared <eol> three commonalities, <eob> the first of which was rather curious. <eob>
Almost everyone sent me meticulous details <eol> about how they could be reached. <eob>
I had told them, or their friends had told them, <eob> that along with the list <eol> of the three things they wanted fixed, <eob> I needed their photo, <eol> their name and their date of birth. <eob>
But they gave me full addresses, with, <eol> like, apartment numbers and zip codes, <eob> as if John of God was going <eol> to stop by their house <eob> and see them in person <eol> or send along a package. <eob>
It was as if, in the highly unlikely event <eol> that their wishes were granted <eob> by John of God, <eob> they just wanted to make sure <eol> that they weren't delivered <eob> to the wrong person <eol> or the wrong address. <eob>
Even if they didn't believe, <eob> they were hedging their bets. <eob>
The second commonality <eol> was just as curious, <eob> but far more humbling. <eob>
Virtually everyone -- <eob> the stranger on the subway, <eob> the guy at the coffee shop, <eob> the lawyer down the hall, <eob> the Jew, the atheist, <eol> the Muslim, the devout Catholic -- <eob> all asked for essentially <eol> the same three things. <eob>
OK, there were a couple of outliers, <eol> and yes, a few people asked for cash. <eob>
But when I eliminated what were ultimately <eol> a handful of anomalies, <eob> the similarities were staggering. <eob>
Almost every single person <eob> first asked for good health <eol> for themselves and their families. <eob>
Almost universally, <eob> they next asked for happiness <eob> and then love, <eob> in that order: <eob> health, happiness, love. <eob>
Sometimes they asked for a specific <eol> health issue to be fixed, <eob> but more often than not, they just asked <eol> for good health in general. <eob>
When it came to happiness, <eob> they each phrased it slightly differently, <eob> but they all asked for the same specific <eol> subtype of happiness, too -- <eob> the kind of happiness that sinks in <eob> and sets down roots in your soul; <eob> the kind of happiness <eol> that could sustain us, <eob> even if we were to lose absolutely everything else. <eob>
And for love, <eob> they all asked for the kind of romantic love, <eob> the soul mate that we read <eol> about in epic romantic novels, <eob> the kind of love that will stay <eol> with us till the end of our days. <eob>
Sorry, that's my husband. <eob>
Crap! Now I forgot my place. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So by and large, <eob> all of these friends and strangers, <eob> regardless of their background, race or religion, <eob> all asked for the same things, <eob> and they were the same things <eol> that I really wanted, <eob> the simplified version of the basic human needs <eob> identified by social scientists <eol> like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef. <eob>
No one asked for answers <eol> to the big existential questions <eob> or for proof of God <eol> or the meaning of life like I had set out to find. <eob>
They didn't even ask for an end <eol> to war or global hunger. <eob>
Even when they could have asked <eol> for absolutely anything, <eob> they all asked for health, happiness <eol> and love. <eob>
So now those emails had <eol> a third commonality as well. <eob>
Each of them ended in the exact same way. <eob>
Instead of thanking me for carting <eol> their wishes all the way to Brazil, <eob> everyone said, <eob> "Please don't tell anyone." <eob> So I decided to tell everyone -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
right here on this stage, <eob> not because I'm untrustworthy, <eob> but because the fact that we have so much in common <eob> feels especially important <eol> for us all to hear, especially now, <eob> when so many of the world's problems <eob> seem to be because we keep focusing <eol> on the things that make us different, <eob> not on what binds us together. <eob>
And look -- I am the first to admit <eol> that I am not a statistician, <eob> and that the data I presented to you <eol> that I just accumulated in my in-box <eob> is more anecdotal <eol> than scientific, more qualitative than quantitative. <eob>
It is, as anyone <eol> who works with data would tell you, <eob> hardly a statistically significant <eol> or demographically balanced sample. <eob>
But nonetheless, I find myself <eol> thinking about those emails <eob> every time I reflect back <eol> on the bias and prejudice <eob> that I've faced in my life, <eob> or when there's another <eol> hate crime or a senseless tragedy <eob> that underscores the disheartening sense <eob> that our differences might be insurmountable. <eob>
I then remind myself that I have evidence <eob> that the humbling, unifying commonality <eob> of our humanity <eob> is that, even when presented <eol> with the opportunity <eob> to ask for anything at all, <eob> most of us want the same things, <eob> and that this is true no matter who we are, <eob> what name we call our god, <eob> or which religion, if any, we call home. <eob>
I then also note <eob> that apparently some of us <eol> want these things so badly <eob> that we would email a None, <eob> a spiritually confused None like me -- <eob> some might say otherwise confused <eol> as well -- <eob> and that we would seek out this stranger <eol> and email her our deepest wishes, <eob> just in case there is the remote possibility <eob> that they might be granted by someone <eol> who is not a god, <eob> much less our god, <eob> someone <eol> who is not even a member of our chosen religion, <eob> someone <eol> who, when you look at him on paper, <eob> seems like an unlikely candidate to deliver. <eob>
And so now, <eob> when I reflect back <eol> on my spiritual quest, <eob> even though I did not find God, <eob> I found a home in this: <eob> even today, in a world <eol> fractured by religious, <eob> ethnic, political, philosophical, <eol> and racial divides, <eob> even with all of our obvious differences, <eob> at the end of the day, <eob> and the most fundamental level, <eob> we are all the same. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Nina Dølvik Brochmann: We grew up believing <eob> that the hymen is a proof of virginity. <eob>
But it turns out, we were wrong. <eob>
What we discovered <eob> is that the popular story <eol> we're told about female virginity <eob> is based on two anatomical myths. <eob>
The truth has been known <eol> in medical communities for over 100 years, <eob> yet somehow these two myths continue <eol> to make life difficult <eob> for women around the world. <eob>
Ellen Støkken Dahl: The first myth <eol> is about blood. <eob>
It tells us that the hymen <eol> breaks and bleeds <eob> the first time a woman <eol> has vaginal sex. <eob>
In other words, if there is no blood <eol> on the sheets afterwards, <eob> then the woman was simply not a virgin. <eob>
The second myth is a logical consequence <eol> of the first. <eob>
Since the hymen is thought <eol> to break and bleed, <eob> people also believe that it actually disappears <eob> or is in some way radically altered <eol> during a woman's first intercourse. <eob>
If that were true, <eob> one would easily be able to determine <eol> if a woman is a virgin or not <eob> by examining her genitals, <eob> by doing a virginity check. <eob>
NDB: So that's our two myths: <eob> virgins bleed, <eob> and hymens are lost forever. <eob>
Now, this may sound like <eol> a minor issue to you. <eob>
Why should you care <eob> about an obscure little skin <eol> fold on the female body? <eob>
But the truth is, <eol> this is about so much more <eob> than an anatomical misunderstanding. <eob>
The myths about the hymen <eol> have lived on for centuries <eob> because they have cultural significance. <eob>
They have been used as a powerful tool <eob> in the effort to control <eol> women's sexuality <eob> in about every culture, <eol> religion and historical decade. <eob>
Women are still mistrusted, <eob> shamed, <eob> harmed <eob> and, in the worst cases, <eol> subjected to honor killings <eob> if they don't bleed <eol> on their wedding night. <eob>
Other women are forced <eol> through degrading virginity checks, <eob> simply to obtain a job, <eob> to save their reputation <eob> or to get married. <eob>
ESD: Like in Indonesia, <eob> where women are systematically <eol> examined to enter military service. <eob>
After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011, <eob> a group of female protesters <eol> were forced to undergo virginity checks <eob> by their military. <eob>
In Oslo, doctors are examining <eol> the hymens of young girls <eob> to reassure parents that their children <eol> are not ruined. <eob>
And sadly, the list goes on. <eob>
Women are so afraid not to live up <eol> to the myths about the hymen <eob> that they choose to use <eol> different virginity quick fixes <eob> to assure a bleeding. <eob>
That could be plastic surgery, <eob> known as "revirgination," <eob> it could be vials of blood <eol> poured on the sheets after sex <eob> or fake hymens bought online, <eob> complete with theater blood <eob> and a promise to "kiss your deep, <eol> dark secret goodbye." <eob>
NDB: By telling girls <eol> that no deed can be kept secret, <eob> that their bodies will reveal them <eol> no matter what, <eob> we have endowed them with fear. <eob>
Girls are afraid of ruining themselves, <eob> either through sport, <eob> play, <eob> tampon use <eob> or a sexual activity. <eob>
We have curtailed their opportunities <eol> and their freedoms. <eob>
It's time we put an end <eol> to the virginity fraud. <eob>
It's time we break the myths <eol> about the hymen <eob> once and for all. <eob>
ESD: We are medical students, <eob> sexual health workers <eob> and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's a popular science book <eol> about the female genitals. <eob>
And in our experience, people seem to believe <eob> that the hymen is some kind <eol> of a seal covering the vaginal opening. <eob>
In Norwegian, it is even called <eol> "the virgin membrane." <eob> And with this, we picture something fragile, <eob> something easily destructible, <eob> something you can rip through, <eob> perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping. <eob>
You may have wondered <eol> why we brought a hula hoop onstage today. <eob>
We'll show you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, it is very hard to hide <eob> that something has happened <eol> to this hoop, right? <eob>
It is different before <eol> and after I punched it. <eob>
The seal is broken, <eob> and unless we change the plastic, <eob> it won't get back to its intact state. <eob>
So if we wanted to do a virginity <eol> check on this hoop right here, <eob> right now, <eob> that would be very easy. <eob>
It's easy to say that this hoop <eol> is not a virgin anymore. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
NDB: But the hymen is nothing <eol> like a piece of plastic <eob> you can wrap around your food, <eob> or a seal. <eob>
In fact ... <eob> it's more like this -- <eob> a scrunchie or a rubber band. <eob>
The hymen is a rim of tissue <eol> at the outer opening of the vagina. <eob>
And usually, it has a doughnut <eol> or a half-moon shape <eob> with a large, central hole. <eob>
But this varies a lot, <eob> and sometimes hymens can have fringes, <eob> it can have several holes, <eob> or it can consist of lobes. <eob>
In other words, hymens naturally <eol> vary a lot in looks, <eob> and that is what makes it so hard <eol> to do a virginity check. <eob>
virgins bleed, <eob> ESD: Now that we know a bit more <eol> about the hymen's anatomy, <eob> it's time to get back <eol> to our two myths: <eob> hymens are lost forever. <eob>
But the hymen doesn't have <eol> to break at all. <eob>
The hymen is like a scrunchie <eol> in function as well as in looks. <eob>
And you can stretch a scrunchie, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You can stretch a hymen, too. <eob>
In fact, it's very elastic. <eob>
And for a lot of women, <eob> the hymen will be elastic enough <eol> to handle a vaginal intercourse <eob> without sustaining any damage. <eob>
For other women, the hymen may tear <eol> a bit to make room for the penis, <eob> but that won't make it disappear. <eob>
But it may look <eol> a bit different from before. <eob>
It naturally follows that <eol> you can't examine the hymen <eob> to check for virginity status. <eob>
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906 <eob> by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet. <eob>
She examined a middle-aged sex worker <eob> and concluded that her genitalia <eol> were reminiscent of a teenage virgin. <eob>
But that makes sense, right? <eob>
Because if her hymen <eol> was never damaged during sex, <eob> then what were we expecting to see? <eob>
ESD: Since hymens come <eol> in every shape and form, <eob> it is difficult to know <eob> if a dent or a fold in it is there <eol> because of previous damage <eob> or if it's just a normal <eol> anatomical variant. <eob>
The absurdity of virgin testing <eob> is illustrated in a study <eol> done on 36 pregnant teenagers. <eob>
When doctors examined their hymens, <eob> they could only find clear signs of penetration <eob> in two out of the 36 girls. <eob>
So unless you believe <eol> in 34 cases of virgin births -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
we must all agree <eob> that also our second myth <eol> has taken a vital blow. <eob>
You simply cannot look <eol> a woman between her legs <eob> and read her sexual story. <eob>
NDB: Like most myths, the myths about the hymen <eol> are untrue. <eob>
There is no virgin seal <eol> that magically disappears after sex, <eob> and half of virgins <eol> can easily have sex without bleeding. <eob>
We wish we could say that by removing <eol> these myths, <eob> everything would be OK, <eob> that shame, harm and honor <eol> killings would all just disappear. <eob>
But of course, it's not that simple. <eob>
Sexual oppression <eol> of women comes from something much deeper <eob> than a simple anatomical misunderstanding <eol> about the properties of the hymen. <eob>
It's a question of cultural and religious <eol> control of women's sexuality. <eob>
And that is much harder to change. <eob>
But we must try. <eob>
ESD: As medical professionals, <eol> this is our contribution. <eob>
We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know <eob> what the hymen is and how it works. <eob>
We want them to know <eob> that the hymen can't be used <eol> as a proof of virginity. <eob>
And that way, we can remove one <eol> of the most powerful tools <eob> used to control young women today. <eob>
After telling you this, <eob> you may wonder what the alternative is, <eob> for if we cannot use the hymen <eol> as a proof of virginity for women, <eob> then what should we use? <eob>
We opt for using nothing. <eob>
(Cheering) <eob>
If you -- <eob>
If you really want to know <eol> if a woman is a virgin or not, <eob> ask her. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But how she answers <eol> that question is her choice. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My name is Stuart Duncan, <eob> but I'm actually probably better known online <eol> as "AutismFather." <eob> That's me on the internet. <eob>
I know the resemblance is uncanny. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I'm going to talk a little bit <eol> today about Minecraft. <eob>
That's my Minecraft character. <eob>
If you don't know the game <eol> very well, don't worry too much about it. <eob>
It's just the medium <eol> that I used at the time to fill a need. <eob>
And what I want to talk about applies <eol> to pretty much every situation. <eob>
So about four years ago, <eol> I started a Minecraft server <eob> for children with autism <eol> and their families, <eob> and I called it "Autcraft." <eob> And since then, we've been <eol> in the news all around the world, <eob> on television and radio and magazines. <eob>
Buzzfeed called us "one of the best places <eol> on the internet." <eob> We're also the subject of an <eol> award-winning research paper called <eob> "Appropriating Minecraft <eob> as an Assistive Technology <eol> for Youth with Autism." <eob> It's a bit of a mouthful. <eob>
But you get the idea, I think. <eob>
So I want to talk a little bit <eol> about that research paper <eob> and what it's about, <eob> but first I have to give you <eol> a little bit of history <eob> on how the server came to be. <eob>
Back in 2013, everybody <eol> was playing Minecraft, <eob> kids and adults alike, <eob> with and without autism, of course. <eob>
But it was the big thing. <eob>
But I saw parents on social media <eol> reaching out to other parents, <eob> asking if their autistic children <eol> could play together. <eob>
And the reason is that when they tried <eol> to play on public servers, <eob> they kept running into bullies <eol> and trolls. <eob>
When you have autism, <eol> you behave a little differently sometimes, <eob> sometimes a lot differently. <eob>
And we all know a little bit of difference <eol> is all you really need <eob> for a bully to make you their next target. <eob>
So these terrible, terrible people online, <eob> they would destroy everything <eol> that they tried to make, <eob> they would steal all their stuff, <eob> and they would kill them <eol> over and over again, <eob> making the game virtually unplayable. <eob>
But the worst part, the part <eol> that really hurt the most, <eob> was what these bullies <eol> would say to these kids. <eob>
They'd call them rejects <eob> and defects <eob> and retards. <eob>
And they would tell these kids, <eol> some as young as six years old, <eob> that society doesn't want them, <eob> and their own parents never <eol> wanted a broken child, <eob> so they should just kill themselves. <eob>
And of course, these kids, <eol> you understand, <eob> they would sign off from these <eol> servers angry and hurt. <eob>
They would break their keyboards, they'd quite <eol> literally hate themselves, <eob> and their parents felt powerless <eol> to do anything. <eob>
So I decided I had to try and help. <eob>
I have autism, <eob> my oldest son has autism, <eob> and both my kids and I love Minecraft, <eob> so I have to do something. <eob>
So I got myself a Minecraft server, <eob> and I spent some time, built <eol> a little village with some roads <eob> and a big welcome sign and this guy <eol> and a lodge up on a mountaintop, <eob> and tried to make it inviting. <eob>
The idea was pretty simple. <eob>
I had a white list, so only people <eol> that I approved could join, <eob> and I would just monitor the server <eol> as much as I could, <eob> just to make sure that nothing went wrong. <eob>
And that was it, that was the whole promise: <eol> to keep the kids safe <eob> so they could play. <eob>
When it was done, I went to Facebook <eob> and posted a pretty simple message <eol> to my friends list, not publicly. <eob>
I wanted to see <eol> if there was any interest in this, <eob> and if it really could help. <eob>
Turns out that I greatly underestimated <eol> just how much this was needed, <eob> because within 48 hours, <eol> I got 750 emails. <eob>
I don't have that many Facebook friends. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Within eight days, I had to upgrade <eol> the hosting package eight times, <eob> from the bottom package <eol> to the most expensive package they had, <eob> and now, almost four years later, <eob> I have 8,000 names on the white <eol> list from all around the world. <eob>
But the reason I'm up here today <eol> to talk to you <eob> isn't just because I gave kids <eol> a safe place to play. <eob>
It's what happened while they played. <eob>
I started hearing from parents <eob> who said their children were learning <eol> to read and write <eob> by playing on the server. <eob>
At first they spelled things <eol> by sound, like most kids do, <eob> but because they were part of a community, <eob> they saw other people spelling <eol> the same words properly <eob> and just picked it up. <eob>
I started hearing from parents <eob> who said that their nonverbal children <eob> were starting to speak. <eob>
They only talked about Minecraft, <eol> but they were talking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Some kids made friends at school <eol> for the first time ever. <eob>
Some started to share, even give things <eol> to other people. <eob> It was amazing. <eob> And every single parent came to me and said <eol> it was because of Autcraft, <eob> because of what you're doing. <eob>
But why, though? <eob> How could all of this be just <eol> from a video game server? <eob>
Well, it goes back to that research <eol> paper I was talking about. <eob>
In it, she covers some of the guidelines <eol> I used when I created the server, <eob> guidelines that I think help encourage <eol> people to be their very best. <eob> I hope. <eob> For example, communication. <eob> It can be tough for kids with autism. <eob>
It could be tough <eol> for grown-ups without autism. <eob>
But I think that kids should not be punished, <eob> they should be talked to. <eob>
Nine times out of ten, <eol> when the kids on the server act out, <eob> it's because of something <eol> that's happened in the day at school or home. <eob>
Maybe a pet died. <eob>
Sometimes it's just a miscommunication <eol> between two kids. <eob>
One doesn't say what they're about to do. <eob>
And so we just offer to help. <eob>
We always tell the children on the server <eol> that we're not mad, <eob> and they're not in trouble; <eob> we only want to help. <eob>
And it shows that not only do we care, <eob> but we respect them enough <eol> to listen to their point of view. <eob>
Respect goes a long way. <eob>
Plus, it shows them <eol> that they have everything they need <eob> to be able to resolve <eol> these problems on their own in the future <eob> and maybe even avoid them, <eol> because, you know, communication. <eob>
On most servers, as video games are, <eob> children are rewarded, <eol> well, players are rewarded, <eob> for how well they do in a competition, right? <eob>
The better you do, <eol> the better reward you get. <eob>
That can be automated; the server <eol> does the work, the code is there. <eob>
On Autcraft, we don't do that. <eob>
We have things like "Player of the Week" <eol> and "CBAs," <eob> which is "Caught Being Awesome." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We award players ranks on the servers based <eol> on the attributes they exhibit, <eob> such as the "Buddy" rank for people <eol> who are friendly towards others, <eob> and "Junior Helper" for people <eol> that are helpful towards others. <eob> We have "Senior Helper" for the adults. <eob>
But they're obvious, right? <eob>
Like, people know what to expect <eol> and how to earn these things <eob> because of how they're named. <eob>
As soon as somebody signs onto the server, <eob> they know that they're going <eol> to be rewarded for who they are <eob> and not what they can do. <eob>
Our top award, the AutismFather Sword, <eob> which is named after me because <eol> I'm the founder, <eob> is a very powerful sword <eol> that you can't get in the game any other way <eob> than to show that you completely put <eol> the community above yourself, <eob> and that compassion and kindness is at the core <eol> of who you are. <eob>
We've given away quite a few of those swords, actually. <eob>
I figure, if we're watching the server <eol> to make sure nothing bad happens, <eob> we should also watch for the good things <eol> that happen and reward people for them. <eob>
We're always trying to show all the players <eob> that everybody is considered <eol> to be equal, even me. <eob>
But we know we can't treat people <eol> equally to do that. <eob>
Some of the players get angry very easily. <eob>
Some of them have additional <eol> struggles on top of autism, <eob> such as OCD or Tourette's. <eob>
So, I have this knack <eol> of remembering all of the players. <eob>
I remember their first day, <eol> the conversations we've had, <eob> things we've talked about, things they've built. <eob>
So when somebody comes to me with a problem, <eob> I handle that situation differently <eol> than I would with any other player, <eob> based on what I know about them. <eob>
For the other admins <eol> and helpers, we document everything <eob> so that, whether it's good <eol> or bad or a concerning conversation, <eob> it's there, so everybody is aware. <eob>
I want to give you one example <eol> of this one player. <eob>
He was with us for a little while, <eob> but at some point he started <eol> spamming dashes in the chat, <eob> like a big long line <eol> of dashes all the way across the screen. <eob>
A little while later, he'd do it again. <eob>
The other players asked him not to do that, <eol> and he'd say, "OK." <eob> And then he'd do it again. <eob> It started to frustrate the other players. <eob>
They asked me to mute him or to punish him <eol> for breaking the rules, <eob> but I knew there had to be something more to it. <eob>
So I went to his aunt, <eol> who is the contact that I have for him. <eob>
She explained that he had gone <eol> blind in one eye <eob> and was losing his vision in the other. <eob>
So what he was doing <eol> was splitting up the chat <eob> into easier-to-see blocks of text, <eob> which is pretty smart. <eob>
So that very same night, <eol> I talked to a friend of mine who writes code <eob> and we created a brand-new plug-in <eol> for the server <eob> that makes it so that any player <eol> on the server, <eob> including him, of course, <eob> could just enter a command <eol> and instantly have every single line <eob> separated by dashes. <eob> Plus, they can make it asterisks or blank lines <eob> or anything they want -- whatever works best for them. <eob>
We even went a little bit extra and made it <eol> so it highlights your name, <eob> so that it's easier to see <eol> if somebody mentions you. <eob>
It's just one example <eol> of how doing a little bit extra, <eob> a small modification, <eob> still helps everybody be on equal footing, <eob> even though you did a little extra <eol> just for that one player. <eob>
The big one is to be not afraid. <eob>
The children on my server are not afraid. <eob>
They are free to just be themselves, <eob> and it's because we support <eol> and encourage and celebrate each other. <eob>
We all know what it feels like <eol> to be the outcast <eob> and to be hated simply for existing, <eob> and so when we're together on the server, <eol> we're not afraid anymore. <eob>
For the first two years or so on the server, <eob> I talked to two children per week <eol> on average that were suicidal. <eob>
But they came to me because I'm the one <eol> that made them feel safe. <eob>
They felt like I was the only person <eol> in the world they could talk to. <eob>
So I guess my message is: <eob> whether you have a charity <eol> or some other organization, <eob> or you're a teacher or a therapist <eob> or you're a parent who is just doing <eol> your very best, <eob> or you're an autistic, like I am, <eob> no matter who you are, <eob> you absolutely must help these children strip away <eol> those fears <eob> before you do anything else, <eob> because anything else is going to feel forced <eob> unless they're not afraid. <eob>
It's why positive reinforcement <eol> will always do better <eob> than any form of punishment. <eob>
They want to learn <eol> when they feel safe and happy. <eob>
It just happens naturally; <eol> they don't even try to learn. <eob>
These are words from the kids <eol> on the server to describe the server. <eob>
The one thing I would hope <eol> that you could take away <eob> is that no matter what somebody else <eol> is going through in life right now, <eob> whether they're being bullied <eol> at school or at home, <eob> if they're questioning <eol> their sexuality or even their gender, <eob> which happens a lot in the autism community, <eob> if they're feeling alone <eol> or even suicidal, <eob> you have to live your life in such a way <eob> that that person feels like <eol> they can come to and tell you. <eob>
They have to feel perfectly safe <eol> in talking to you about it. <eob>
If you want to see a group <eol> of autistic children — <eob> kids who society wrongly thinks <eol> are supposed to be antisocial <eob> and lacking in empathy — <eob> if you want to see them come together <eol> and build the most compassionate <eob> and friendly <eol> and generous community you've ever seen, <eob> the kind of place that people would write about <eob> as one of the best places on the internet, <eob> they'll do that. <eob>
I've seen it. <eob>
I'm there every day. <eob>
But they have some huge obstacles <eol> that they have to overcome to do that, <eob> and it would be really helpful <eol> to have somebody there <eob> who could help to show them <eol> that the only thing they really have to fear <eob> is self-doubt. <eob>
So I guess I'm asking you <eol> to please be that person for them, <eob> because to them, <eob> those kids -- <eob> it means everything. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm an ocean microbiologist <eol> at the University of Tennessee, <eob> and I want to tell you guys about some microbes <eob> that are so strange and wonderful <eob> that they're challenging our assumptions <eol> about what life is like on Earth. <eob>
So I have a question. <eob> Please raise your hand <eol> if you've ever thought it would be cool <eob> to go to the bottom of the ocean <eol> in a submarine? <eob> Yes. <eob> Most of you, <eol> because the oceans are so cool. <eob>
Alright, now -- please raise your hand <eob> if the reason you raised your hand <eol> to go to the bottom of the ocean <eob> is because it would get you a little bit closer <eob> to that exciting mud <eol> that's down there. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nobody. <eob> I'm the only one in this room. <eob>
Well, I think about this all the time. <eob>
I spend most of my waking hours <eob> trying to determine how deep <eol> we can go into the Earth <eob> and still find something, anything, that's alive, <eob> because we still don't know the answer <eol> to this very basic question <eob> about life on Earth. <eob>
So in the 1980s, a scientist <eol> named John Parkes, in the UK, <eob> was similarly obsessed, <eob> and he came up with a crazy idea. <eob>
He believed that there was a vast, deep, <eol> and living microbial biosphere <eob> underneath all the world's oceans <eob> that extends hundreds of meters <eol> into the seafloor, <eob> which is cool, <eob> but the only problem is that nobody believed him, <eob> and the reason that nobody believed him <eob> is that ocean sediments <eol> may be the most boring place on Earth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There's no sunlight, <eol> there's no oxygen, <eob> and perhaps worst of all, <eob> there's no fresh food deliveries <eol> for literally millions of years. <eob>
You don't have to have a PhD in biology <eob> to know that that is a bad place <eol> to go looking for life. <eob>
But in 2002, [Steven D'Hondt] <eol> had convinced enough people <eob> that he was on to something <eol> that he actually got an expedition <eob> on this drillship, called the JOIDES Resolution. <eob>
And he ran it along with Bo Barker Jørgensen of Denmark. <eob>
And so they were finally able to get <eob> good pristine deep subsurface samples <eob> some really without contamination <eol> from surface microbes. <eob>
This drill ship is capable of drilling <eol> thousands of meters underneath the ocean, <eob> and the mud comes up in sequential <eol> cores, one after the other -- <eob> long, long cores that look like this. <eob>
This is being carried by scientists <eol> such as myself who go on these ships, <eob> and we process the cores on the ships <eol> and then we send them home <eob> to our home laboratories <eol> for further study. <eob>
So when John and his colleagues <eob> got these first precious <eol> deep-sea pristine samples, <eob> they put them under the microscope, <eob> and they saw images <eol> that looked pretty much like this, <eob> which is actually taken <eol> from a more recent expedition <eob> by my PhD student, Joy Buongiorno. <eob>
You can see the hazy stuff <eol> in the background. <eob> That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud, <eob> and the bright green dots <eol> stained with the green fluorescent dye <eob> are real, living microbes. <eob>
Now I've got to tell you something <eol> really tragic about microbes. <eob>
They all look the same under a microscope, <eob> I mean, to a first approximation. <eob>
You can take the most fascinating <eol> organisms in the world, <eob> like a microbe that literally breathes uranium, <eob> and another one that makes rocket fuel, <eob> mix them up with some ocean mud, <eob> put them underneath a microscope, <eob> and they're just little dots. <eob>
It's really annoying. <eob>
So we can't use their <eol> looks to tell them apart. <eob>
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint, <eob> to say who is who. <eob>
And I'll teach you guys <eol> how to do it right now. <eob>
So I made up some data, and I'm going to show you <eol> some data that are not real. <eob>
This is to illustrate what it would look like <eob> if a bunch of species were not related <eol> to each other at all. <eob>
So you can see each species <eob> has a list of combinations <eol> of A, G, C and T, <eob> which are the four sub-units of DNA, <eob> sort of randomly jumbled, <eol> and nothing looks like anything else, <eob> and these species are totally unrelated <eol> to each other. <eob>
But this is what real DNA looks like, <eob> from a gene that these species <eol> happen to share. <eob>
Everything lines up nearly perfectly. <eob>
The chances of getting so many <eol> of those vertical columns <eob> where every species has a C <eol> or every species has a T, <eob> by random chance, are infinitesimal. <eob>
So we know that all those species <eol> had to have had a common ancestor. <eob>
They're all relatives of each other. <eob>
So now I'll tell you who they are. <eob>
The top two are us and chimpanzees, <eob> which y'all already knew were related, <eol> because, I mean, obviously. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we're also related to things <eol> that we don't look like, <eob> like pine trees and Giardia, which is that gastrointestinal disease <eob> you can get if you don't filter <eol> your water while you're hiking. <eob>
We're also related <eol> to bacteria like E. coli and Clostridium difficile, <eob> which is a horrible, opportunistic pathogen <eol> that kills lots of people. <eob>
But there's of course good microbes <eol> too, like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, <eob> which cleans up our industrial <eol> waste for us. <eob>
So if I take these DNA sequences, <eob> and then I use them, the similarities <eol> and differences between them, <eob> to make a family tree for all of us <eob> so you can see who is closely related, <eob> then this is what it looks like. <eob>
So you can see clearly, at a glance, <eob> that things like us and Giardia and bunnies and pine trees <eob> are all, like, siblings, <eob> and then the bacteria are like our ancient cousins. <eob>
But we're kin <eol> to every living thing on Earth. <eob>
So in my job, on a daily basis, <eob> I get to produce scientific evidence <eol> against existential loneliness. <eob>
So when we got <eol> these first DNA sequences, <eob> from the first cruise, of pristine samples <eol> from the deep subsurface, <eob> we wanted to know where they were. <eob>
So the first thing that we discovered <eol> is that they were not aliens, <eob> because we could get their DNA to line up <eol> with everything else on Earth. <eob>
But now check out where they go <eol> on our tree of life. <eob>
The first thing you'll notice <eol> is that there's a lot of them. <eob>
It wasn't just one little species <eob> that managed to live <eol> in this horrible place. <eob>
It's kind of a lot of things. <eob>
And the second thing <eol> that you'll notice, <eob> hopefully, is that they're not like anything <eol> we've ever seen before. <eob>
They are as different from each other <eob> as they are from anything <eol> that we've known before <eob> as we are from pine trees. <eob>
So John Parkes was completely correct. <eob>
He, and we, had discovered <eol> a completely new and highly diverse <eob> microbial ecosystem on Earth <eob> that no one even knew existed <eol> before the 1980s. <eob> So now we were on a roll. <eob>
The next step was to grow <eol> these exotic species in a petri dish <eob> so that we could do real experiments on them <eob> like microbiologists are supposed to do. <eob>
But no matter what we fed them, <eob> they refused to grow. <eob>
Even now, 15 years <eol> and many expeditions later, <eob> no human has ever gotten <eol> a single one of these exotic deep subsurface microbes <eob> to grow in a petri dish. <eob>
And it's not for lack of trying. <eob>
That may sound disappointing, <eob> but I actually find it exhilarating, <eob> because it means there are <eol> so many tantalizing unknowns to work on. <eob>
Like, my colleagues and I got <eol> what we thought was a really great idea. <eob>
We were going to read their genes <eol> like a recipe book, <eob> find out what it was they wanted to eat <eol> and put it in their petri dishes, <eob> and then they would grow and be happy. <eob>
But when we looked at their genes, <eob> it turns out that what they wanted to eat <eol> was the food we were already feeding them. <eob>
So that was a total wash. <eob>
There was something else <eol> that they wanted in their petri dishes <eob> that we were just not giving them. <eob>
So by combining measurements <eol> from many different places <eob> around the world, <eob> my colleagues at the University <eol> of Southern California, <eob> Doug LaRowe and Jan Amend, <eob> were able to calculate <eol> that each one of these deep-sea microbial cells <eob> requires only one zeptowatt of power, <eob> and before you get your phones out, <eol> a zepto is 10 to the minus 21, <eob> because I know I would want to look that up. <eob>
Humans, on the other hand, <eob> require about 100 watts of power. <eob>
So 100 watts is basically <eol> if you take a pineapple <eob> and drop it from about waist height <eol> to the ground 881,632 times a day. <eob>
If you did that and then linked it <eol> up to a turbine, <eob> that would create enough power <eol> to make me happen for a day. <eob>
A zeptowatt, <eol> if you put it in similar terms, <eob> is if you take just one grain of salt <eob> and then you imagine a tiny, <eol> tiny, little ball <eob> that is one thousandth <eol> of the mass of that one grain of salt <eob> and then you drop it one nanometer, <eob> which is a hundred times <eol> smaller than the wavelength of visible light, <eob> once per day. <eob>
That's all it takes to make <eol> these microbes live. <eob>
That's less energy than we ever thought <eol> would be capable of supporting life, <eob> but somehow, amazingly, beautifully, <eob> it's enough. <eob>
So if these deep-subsurface microbes <eob> have a very different relationship <eol> with energy than we previously thought, <eob> then it follows that they'll have to have <eob> a different relationship with time as well, <eob> because when you live <eol> on such tiny energy gradients, <eob> rapid growth is impossible. <eob>
If these things wanted to colonize <eol> our throats and make us sick, <eob> they would get muscled out by fast-growing streptococcus <eob> before they could even initiate <eol> cell division. <eob>
So that's why we never find them <eol> in our throats. <eob>
Perhaps the fact that the deep <eol> subsurface is so boring <eob> is actually an asset to these microbes. <eob>
They never get washed out by a storm. <eob>
They never get overgrown by weeds. <eob>
All they have to do is exist. <eob>
Maybe that thing that we were missing <eol> in our petri dishes <eob> was not food at all. <eob>
Maybe it wasn't a chemical. <eob>
Maybe the thing that they really want, <eob> the nutrient that they want, is time. <eob>
But time is the one thing <eol> that I'll never be able to give them. <eob>
So even if I have a cell culture <eol> that I pass to my PhD students, <eob> who pass it to their PhD students, and so on, <eob> we'd have to do that <eol> for thousands of years <eob> in order to mimic the exact conditions <eol> of the deep subsurface, <eob> all without growing any contaminants. <eob> It's just not possible. <eob> But maybe in a way we already <eol> have grown them in our petri dishes. <eob>
Maybe they looked at all that <eol> food we offered them and said, <eob> "Thanks, I'm going <eol> to speed up so much <eob> that I'm going to make <eol> a new cell next century. <eob> Ugh. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So why is it that the rest <eol> of biology moves so fast? <eob>
Why does a cell die after a day <eob> and a human dies after <eol> only a hundred years? <eob>
These seem like really <eol> arbitrarily short limits <eob> when you think about the total amount <eol> of time in the universe. <eob>
But these are not arbitrary limits. <eob>
They're dictated by one simple thing, <eob> and that thing is the Sun. <eob>
Once life figured out <eol> how to harness the energy of the Sun <eob> through photosynthesis, <eob> we all had to speed up and get on day <eol> and night cycles. <eob>
In that way, the Sun gave us <eol> both a reason to be fast <eob> and the fuel to do it. <eob>
You can view most of life <eol> on Earth like a circulatory system, <eob> and the Sun is our beating heart. <eob>
But the deep subsurface <eol> is like a circulatory system <eob> that's completely disconnected from the Sun. <eob>
It's instead being driven by long, <eol> slow geological rhythms. <eob>
There's currently no theoretical limit <eol> on the lifespan of one single cell. <eob>
As long as there is at least a tiny energy <eol> gradient to exploit, <eob> theoretically, a single cell could live <eob> for hundreds of thousands <eol> of years or more, <eob> simply by replacing <eol> broken parts over time. <eob>
To ask a microbe that lives like that <eol> to grow in our petri dishes <eob> is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic, Sun-centric, fast way of living, <eob> and maybe they've got better things <eol> to do than that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Imagine if we could figure out <eol> how they managed to do this. <eob>
What if it involves some cool, <eol> ultra-stable compounds <eob> that we could use <eol> to increase the shelf life <eob> in biomedical or industrial applications? <eob>
Or maybe if we figure out <eol> the mechanism that they use <eob> to grow so extraordinarily slowly, <eob> we could mimic it in cancer cells <eol> and slow runaway cell division. <eob>
I don't know. <eob>
I mean, honestly, that is all speculation, <eob> but the only thing I know for certain <eob> is that there are a hundred billion <eol> billion billlion <eob> living microbial cells <eob> underlying all the world's oceans. <eob>
That's 200 times more than the total <eol> biomass of humans on this planet. <eob>
And those microbes have <eol> a fundamentally different relationship <eob> with time and energy than we do. <eob>
What seems like a day to them <eob> might be a thousand years to us. <eob>
They don't care about the Sun, <eob> and they don't care about growing fast, <eob> and they probably don't give <eol> a damn about my petri dishes ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but if we can continue <eol> to find creative ways to study them, <eob> then maybe we'll finally figure out what life, <eol> all of life, is like on Earth. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to introduce you <eol> to my badass friends. <eob>
Meet Thelma and Louise. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm passionate about cows. <eob>
And although they've been getting <eol> a lot of crap lately <eob> due to methane emissions <eol> and climate change, <eob> I hope that I can redeem <eol> their reputation in part <eob> by showing you how incredibly <eol> important they are <eob> in solving one of the world's biggest problems: food security. <eob>
But more importantly, for Africa -- <eob> it's resultant childhood stunting. <eob>
Nutritional stunting manifests itself <eob> in a reduction of growth rate <eol> in human development. <eob>
And according to UNICEF, <eob> stunting doesn't come easy. <eob>
It doesn't come quickly. <eob>
It happens over a long period of time <eob> during which a child endures <eol> painful and debilitating cycles of illness, <eob> depressed appetite, <eob> insufficient nutrition <eob> and inadequate care. <eob>
And most kids simply <eol> can't endure such rigors. <eob>
But those that do survive, <eob> they carry forward long-term <eol> cognitive problems <eob> as well as losses of stature. <eob>
The numbers of stunted children <eol> under the age of five, <eob> in most regions of the world, <eob> has been declining. <eob>
And I really hate to say this, <eob> but the only place where they haven't <eol> been declining is here, <eob> in Africa. <eob>
Here, 59 million children, <eob> three in 10 in that age group, <eob> struggle to meet their genetic potential -- <eob> their full genetic potential. <eob>
Protein is one of our most important <eol> dietary requirements, <eob> and evidence shows <eol> that lack of essential amino acids, <eob> the building blocks of proteins, <eol> in young children's diets, <eob> can result in stunting. <eob>
Essential amino acids <eol> are called essential <eob> because we can't synthesize them <eol> in our bodies. <eob>
We have to get them from our foods <eob> and the best sources are animal-derived: <eob> milk, meat and eggs. <eob>
Most protein consumed on the African <eol> continent is crop-based. <eob>
And although we have millions <eol> of smallholder farmers rearing animals, <eob> livestock production is not <eol> as easy as we think. <eob>
The big livestock gaps <eol> between rich countries and poor countries <eob> are due to poor animal health. <eob>
Endemic livestock diseases, <eob> some of them transmissible to humans, <eob> threaten not only livestock producers <eol> in those poor countries, <eob> but all human health across all countries. <eob>
This is a global pathogens network. <eob>
It shows the pathogens <eol> found across the world <eob> according to the Enhanced <eol> Infectious Diseases database. <eob>
And it shows those pathogens <eol> that share hosts. <eob>
In a nutshell, <eob> we share pathogens, and thus diseases, <eob> with the species we live closest to: <eob> our livestock. <eob>
And we call these zoonotic diseases. <eob>
Recent reports show <eob> that the deadly dozen <eol> zoonotic diseases kill 2.2 million people <eob> and sicken 2.4 billion people annually. <eob>
And Jimmy says, <eob> "The greatest burden <eol> of zoonoses <eob> falls on one billion poor livestock keepers." <eob>
We totally underestimate <eol> the importance of our smallholder farmers. <eob>
We're beginning to recognize <eol> how important they are <eob> and how they influence <eol> our medical health, <eob> our biosafety <eob> and more recently, our cognitive <eol> and our physical health. <eob>
They stand at the frontline <eol> of zoonotic epidemics. <eob>
They pretty much underpin our existence. <eob>
And they need to know so much, <eob> yet most lack knowledge <eob> on livestock disease prevention and treatment. <eob>
So how do they learn? <eob> Apart from shared experiences, <eob> trial and error, <eob> conventional farming extension services <eol> are boots on the ground and radio -- <eob> expensive and hard to scale in the face <eol> of population growth. <eob>
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it? <eob>
But we're at an interesting point <eob> in Africa. <eob>
We're changing that narrative <eol> using innovative solutions, <eob> riding across scalable <eol> technologies. <eob>
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive. <eob>
My company developed an agricultural <eol> platform called iCow. <eob>
We teach farmers best livestock <eol> practices using SMS <eob> over simple, low-end phones. <eob>
Farmers receive three SMSs a week <eol> on best livestock practices, <eob> and those that execute the messages <eol> go on to see increases in productivity <eob> within as short a time <eol> as three months. <eob>
The first increases in productivity, <eol> of course, are improved animal health. <eob>
We use SMS because it is retentive. <eob>
Farmers store their messages, <eob> they write them down in books, <eob> and in effect, <eob> we're drip-feeding agricultural <eol> manuals into the fields. <eob>
We recognize that we are all part <eol> of the global food network: <eob> producers and consumers, <eob> you and me, and every farmer. <eob>
We're focusing now on trying to bring together <eob> producers and consumers <eob> to take action and take responsibility <eol> for not only food security, <eob> but for food safety. <eob>
This beautiful animal <eob> is an African-Asian Sahiwal crossed <eol> with a Dutch Fleckvieh. <eob>
She's milkier than her Sahiwal mom, <eob> and she's sturdier and more resistant <eol> to disease than her Fleckvieh father. <eob>
In Ethiopia and Tanzania, <eob> the African Dairy Genetic Gains <eol> program is using SMS and cutting-edge genomics <eob> and pioneering Africa's first <eol> tropically adapted dairy breeding centers <eob> and dairy performance recording centers. <eob>
Farmers contribute <eol> their production data -- <eob> milking records, <eob> breeding records <eol> and feeding records -- <eob> to the ADGG platform. <eob>
This stage is synthesized <eol> through algorithms <eob> from some of the top livestock <eol> institutions in the world <eob> before it lands back in the farmers' hands <eob> in actionable SMSs. <eob>
Customized data, <eob> customized responses <eob> all aimed at increasing productivity <eob> based on the potential on the ground. <eob>
We're at a very interesting <eol> place in agriculture <eob> in Africa. <eob>
By the end of this year, <eob> we'll have almost one billion <eol> mobile phone subscriptions. <eob>
We have the power in our hands <eob> to ensure that livestock production <eol> systems are not only healthy, <eob> productive and profitable, <eob> but that farmers are knowledgeable, <eob> and more importantly, <eob> that our farmers are safe. <eob>
Working with smallholder farmers <eob> is one of the best ways <eol> to guarantee food security. <eob>
Working with smallholder farmers <eob> is one of the best ways <eob> to guarantee each and every child <eol> their full opportunity <eob> and ability to reach <eob> their full genetic potential. <eob>
And harnessing the power <eol> of millions of smallholder farmers <eob> and their badass cows like mine, <eob> we should be able to bring a halt to stunting <eob> in Africa. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Hello, everyone. <eob>
Sawubona. <eob>
In South Africa, where I come from, <eob> "sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello." <eob> There's a beautiful and powerful <eol> intention behind the word <eob> because "sawubona" <eol> literally translated means, <eob> "I see you, and by seeing you, <eol> I bring you into being." <eob> So beautiful, imagine being greeted like that. <eob>
But what does it take <eol> in the way we see ourselves? <eob>
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories <eob> that help us to thrive <eob> in an increasingly complex <eol> and fraught world? <eob>
This crucial question has been <eol> at the center of my life's work. <eob>
Because how we deal <eol> with our inner world drives everything. <eob>
Every aspect of how we love, how we live, <eob> how we parent and how we lead. <eob>
The conventional view of emotions <eol> as good or bad, <eob> positive or negative, <eob> is rigid. <eob>
And rigidity in the face <eol> of complexity is toxic. <eob>
We need greater levels <eol> of emotional agility <eob> for true resilience and thriving. <eob>
My journey with this calling <eob> began not in the hallowed <eol> halls of a university, <eob> but in the messy, tender business of life. <eob>
I grew up in the white suburbs <eol> of apartheid South Africa, <eob> a country and community <eol> committed to not seeing. <eob> To denial. <eob> It's denial that makes 50 years <eol> of racist legislation possible <eob> while people convince themselves <eol> that they are doing nothing wrong. <eob>
And yet, I first learned of the destructive <eol> power of denial <eob> at a personal level, <eob> before I understood what it was doing <eol> to the country of my birth. <eob>
My father died on a Friday. <eob>
He was 42 years old and I was 15. <eob>
My mother whispered to me to go <eol> and say goodbye to my father <eob> before I went to school. <eob>
So I put my backpack down <eol> and walked the passage that ran through <eob> to where the heart of our home <eol> my father lay dying of cancer. <eob>
His eyes were closed, <eol> but he knew I was there. <eob>
In his presence, I had always felt seen. <eob>
I told him I loved him, <eob> said goodbye and headed off for my day. <eob>
At school, I drifted from science <eol> to mathematics to history to biology, <eob> as my father slipped <eol> from the world. <eob>
From May to July to September to November, <eob> I went about with my usual smile. <eob>
I didn't drop a single grade. <eob>
When asked how I was doing, <eol> I would shrug and say, "OK." <eob> I was praised for being strong. <eob>
I was the master of being OK. <eob>
But back home, we struggled -- <eob> my father hadn't been able to keep <eol> his small business going <eob> during his illness. <eob>
And my mother, alone, <eol> was grieving the love of her life <eob> trying to raise three children, <eob> and the creditors were knocking. <eob>
We felt, as a family, financially <eol> and emotionally ravaged. <eob>
And I began to spiral down, isolated, fast. <eob>
I started to use food <eol> to numb my pain. <eob> Binging and purging. <eob> Refusing to accept <eol> the full weight of my grief. <eob>
No one knew, and in a culture <eol> that values relentless positivity, <eob> I thought that no one wanted to know. <eob>
But one person did not buy into my story <eol> of triumph over grief. <eob>
My eighth-grade English teacher <eol> fixed me with burning blue eyes <eob> as she handed out blank notebooks. <eob>
She said, "Write what you're feeling. <eob> Tell the truth. <eob> Write like nobody's reading." <eob> And just like that, <eob> I was invited to show up <eol> authentically to my grief and pain. <eob>
It was a simple act <eob> but nothing short of a revolution for me. <eob>
It was this revolution <eol> that started in this blank notebook <eob> 30 years ago <eob> that shaped my life's work. <eob>
The secret, silent correspondence <eol> with myself. <eob>
Like a gymnast, <eob> I started to move <eol> beyond the rigidity of denial <eob> into what I've now come to call <eob> emotional agility. <eob>
Life's beauty is inseparable <eol> from its fragility. <eob>
We are young until we are not. <eob>
We walk down the streets sexy <eob> until one day we realize <eol> that we are unseen. <eob>
We nag our children and one day realize <eob> that there is silence where <eol> that child once was, <eob> now making his or her way in the world. <eob>
We are healthy until a diagnosis <eol> brings us to our knees. <eob>
The only certainty is uncertainty, <eob> and yet we are not navigating <eol> this frailty successfully or sustainably. <eob>
The World Health Organization <eol> tells us that depression <eob> is now the single leading cause <eol> of disability globally -- <eob> outstripping cancer, <eob> outstripping heart disease. <eob>
And at a time of greater complexity, <eob> unprecedented technological, <eol> political and economic change, <eob> we are seeing how people's tendency <eob> is more and more to lock down <eol> into rigid responses to their emotions. <eob>
On the one hand we might <eol> obsessively brood on our feelings. <eob>
Getting stuck inside our heads. <eob> Hooked on being right. <eob> Or victimized by our news feed. <eob>
On the other, <eol> we might bottle our emotions, <eob> pushing them aside <eob> and permitting only those emotions <eol> deemed legitimate. <eob>
In a survey I recently conducted <eol> with over 70,000 people, <eob> I found that a third of us -- <eob> a third -- <eob> either judge ourselves for having <eol> so-called "bad emotions," <eob> like sadness, <eob> anger or even grief. <eob>
Or actively try to push aside <eol> these feelings. <eob>
We do this not only to ourselves, <eob> but also to people we love, like our children -- <eob> we may inadvertently shame them <eol> out of emotions seen as negative, <eob> jump to a solution, <eob> and fail to help them <eob> to see these emotions as inherently valuable. <eob>
Normal, natural emotions <eol> are now seen as good or bad. <eob>
And being positive has become <eol> a new form of moral correctness. <eob>
People with cancer are automatically <eol> told to just stay positive. <eob>
Women, to stop being so angry. <eob>
And the list goes on. <eob>
It's a tyranny. <eob>
It's a tyranny <eob> of positivity. <eob>
And it's cruel. <eob> Unkind. <eob> And ineffective. <eob> And we do it to ourselves, <eob> and we do it to others. <eob>
If there's one common feature <eob> of brooding, bottling or false positivity, it's this: <eob> they are all rigid responses. <eob>
And if there's a single lesson we can learn <eob> from the inevitable <eol> fall of apartheid <eob> it is that rigid denial doesn't work. <eob> It's unsustainable. <eob> For individuals, for families, <eob> for societies. <eob>
And as we watch the ice caps melt, <eob> it is unsustainable for our planet. <eob>
Research on emotional suppression shows <eob> that when emotions are pushed <eol> aside or ignored, <eob> they get stronger. <eob>
Psychologists call this amplification. <eob>
Like that delicious chocolate cake <eol> in the refrigerator -- <eob> the more you try to ignore it ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
the greater its hold on you. <eob>
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions <eol> when you ignore them, <eob> but in fact they control you. <eob>
Internal pain always comes out. <eob> Always. <eob> And who pays the price? <eob> We do. <eob> Our children, <eob> our colleagues, <eob> our communities. <eob>
Now, don't get me wrong. <eob> I'm not anti-happiness. <eob>
I like being happy. <eob>
I'm a pretty happy person. <eob>
But when we push aside normal emotions <eol> to embrace false positivity, <eob> we lose our capacity to develop skills <eol> to deal with the world as it is, <eob> not as we wish it to be. <eob>
I've had hundreds of people tell me <eol> what they don't want to feel. <eob>
They say things like, <eob> "I don't want to try because <eol> I don't want to feel disappointed." <eob> Or, "I just want this feeling to go away." <eob>
"I understand," I say to them. <eob> "But you have dead people's goals." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Only dead people <eob> never get unwanted or inconvenienced by their feelings. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Only dead people <eob> never get stressed, <eob> never get broken hearts, <eob> never experience the disappointment <eol> that comes with failure. <eob>
Tough emotions are part <eol> of our contract with life. <eob>
You don't get to have a meaningful career <eob> or raise a family <eob> or leave the world a better place <eob> without stress and discomfort. <eob>
Discomfort is the price <eol> of admission to a meaningful life. <eob>
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity <eob> and embrace <eob> emotional agility? <eob>
As that young schoolgirl, <eob> when I leaned into those blank pages, <eob> I started to do away with feelings <eob> of what I should be experiencing. <eob>
And instead started to open my heart <eol> to what I did feel. <eob> Pain. <eob> And grief. <eob> And loss. <eob> And regret. <eob>
Research now shows <eob> that the radical acceptance <eol> of all of our emotions -- <eob> even the messy, difficult ones -- <eob> is the cornerstone to resilience, thriving, <eob> and true, authentic happiness. <eob>
But <eob> emotional agility <eob> is more that just an acceptance <eol> of emotions. <eob>
We also know that accuracy matters. <eob>
In my own research, I found <eol> that words are essential. <eob>
We often use quick and easy labels <eol> to describe our feelings. <eob> "I'm stressed" <eol> is the most common one I hear. <eob>
But there's a world of difference <eol> between stress and disappointment <eob> or stress and that knowing dread <eol> of "I'm in the wrong career." <eob> When we label our emotions accurately, <eob> we are more able to discern <eol> the precise cause of our feelings. <eob>
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain <eob> is activated, allowing us <eol> to take concrete steps. <eob>
But not just any steps -- <eol> the right steps for us. <eob>
Because our emotions are data. <eob>
Our emotions contain flashing lights <eol> to things that we care about. <eob>
We tend not to feel strong emotion <eob> to stuff that doesn't mean anything <eol> in our worlds. <eob>
If you feel rage when you read the news, <eob> that rage is a signpost, perhaps, that you value <eol> equity and fairness -- <eob> and an opportunity to take active steps <eob> to shape your life <eol> in that direction. <eob>
When we are open <eol> to the difficult emotions, <eob> we are able to generate responses <eol> that are values-aligned. <eob>
But there's an important caveat. <eob> Emotions are data, <eol> they are not directives. <eob>
We can show up to and mine <eol> our emotions for their values <eob> without needing to listen to them. <eob>
Just like I can show up to my son <eol> in his frustration with his baby sister -- <eob> but not endorse his idea <eol> that he gets to give her away <eob> to the first stranger <eol> he sees in a shopping mall. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We own our emotions, they don't own us. <eob>
When we internalize the difference <eol> between how I feel in all my wisdom <eob> and what I do in a values-aligned action, <eob> we generate the pathway <eol> to our best selves <eob> via our emotions. <eob>
So, what does this look like in practice? <eob>
When you feel a strong, tough emotion, <eob> don't race for the emotional exits. <eob>
Learn its contours, show up <eol> to the journal of your hearts. <eob>
What is the emotion telling you? <eob>
And try not to say "I am," as in, <eol> "I'm angry" or "I'm sad." <eob> When you say "I am" <eob> it makes you sound as if you are the emotion. <eob>
Whereas you are you, <eol> and the emotion is a data source. <eob>
Instead, try to notice the feeling <eol> for what it is: <eob> "I'm noticing <eol> that I'm feeling sad" <eob> or "I'm noticing <eol> that I'm feeling angry." <eob> These are essential skills for us, <eob> our families, <eob> our communities. <eob>
They're also critical to the workplace. <eob>
In my research, <eob> when I looked at what helps people to bring <eol> the best of themselves to work, <eob> I found a powerful key contributor: <eob> individualized consideration. <eob>
When people are allowed <eol> to feel their emotional truth, <eob> engagement, creativity and innovation <eol> flourish in the organization. <eob>
Diversity isn't just people, <eob> it's also what's inside people. <eob>
Including diversity of emotion. <eob>
The most agile, resilient individuals, teams, <eob> organizations, families, communities <eob> are built on an openness <eol> to the normal human emotions. <eob>
It's this that allows us to say, <eob> "What is my emotion telling me?" <eob> "Which action will bring me <eol> towards my values?" <eob> "Which will take me away <eol> from my values?" <eob> Emotional agility <eol> is the ability to be with your emotions <eob> with curiosity, compassion, <eob> and especially the courage <eol> to take values-connected steps. <eob>
When I was little, <eob> I would wake up at night <eol> terrified by the idea of death. <eob>
My father would comfort me <eol> with soft pats and kisses. <eob>
But he would never lie. <eob> "We all die, Susie," he would say. <eob> "It's normal to be scared." <eob> He didn't try to invent a buffer <eol> between me and reality. <eob>
It took me a while to understand <eob> the power of how he guided me <eol> through those nights. <eob>
What he showed me is that courage <eol> is not an absence of fear; <eob> courage is fear walking. <eob>
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years, <eob> he would be gone. <eob>
And that time for each of us <eol> is all too precious <eob> and all too brief. <eob>
But when our moment comes <eob> to face our fragility, <eob> in that ultimate time, <eob> it will ask us, <eob> "Are you agile?" <eob> "Are you agile?" <eob> Let the moment be an unreserved "yes." <eob> A "yes" born of a lifelong <eol> correspondence with your own heart. <eob>
And in seeing yourself. <eob>
Sawubona. <eob> Because in seeing yourself, <eob> you are also able to see others, too: <eob> the only sustainable way forward <eob> in a fragile, beautiful world. <eob>
And thank you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
There's something really incredible <eol> happening. <eob>
So there's over a billion people <eob> who have no access <eol> to energy whatsoever across the world, <eob> 620 million of them <eol> here in Africa. <eob>
It costs about 1,500 dollars <eol> to connect each household up to the grid. <eob>
If you are going to wait for it, <eol> it takes about nine years, on average, <eob> and that feels like a lifetime <eol> when you're trying to make that happen. <eob>
That's kind of unbelievable, <eob> and it's also unacceptable. <eob>
So let's do something about it. <eob>
The lightbulb comes from this idea <eol> that you have an energy system <eob> that's made up of the ideas of Tesla <eob> and the ideas of Thomas Edison. <eob>
There was an evolution that said it's not <eol> just about the lightbulb, <eob> it's about the whole system, <eob> the whole energy system <eol> that goes with that lightbulb, <eob> and what happened in that gilded age <eob> was the creation of an industrial system <eob> that every country around the world <eol> has now started to emulate. <eob>
So to get to the appliances, <eol> you need to have power stations. <eob>
From power stations, <eol> you need to have infrastructure, <eob> and that infrastructure takes you <eol> to the point of having electricity, <eob> and you get to the lightbulbs <eol> and the appliances <eob> that we all take for granted. <eob>
But the amazing thing, in a way, is that <eol> there's a revolution happening <eob> in the villages and towns all around us here <eol> in East Africa. <eob>
And the revolution is an echo <eol> of the cell phone revolution. <eob>
It's wireless, <eob> and that revolution is about solar and it's <eol> about distributed solar. <eob>
Photons are wireless, <eob> they fall on every rooftop, <eob> and they generate enough power <eol> to be sufficient for every household need. <eob>
So that's an incredible thing. <eob>
There's also a problem with it. <eob>
Up until now, the technology <eol> hasn't been there to make it happen, <eob> and the mindset has been <eol> that we have to have the grid <eob> to provide industrial growth <eob> and let countries develop and create jobs <eol> and industrialize. <eob>
So we've gotten ourselves to the point <eob> where actually the costs <eol> of building these grids <eob> and following that pattern of development <eob> are really unsustainable. <eob>
If you add up the deficits that all <eol> of the utilities run in Africa, <eob> sub-Saharan Africa, <eob> you get to a number <eol> of 21 billion dollars every year <eob> to maintain that system <eol> and keep it going. <eob>
So an extraordinary amount of resources <eob> that's been put in to creating a system <eob> that ultimately we will have to wait <eol> a very long time for, <eob> and when it comes, <eob> it often doesn't come with sufficient robustness <eob> to allow us to go down that path to development. <eob>
So what a shame. <eob>
But here's what's happening, <eob> and here's the opportunity <eol> that I think we should all get excited about. <eob>
So there's a group of companies <eob> that have been chipping away <eol> at this problem over the last 10 years, <eob> and this group of companies <eob> have recognized the reality <eol> that there's a great big nuclear reactor <eob> up there in the sky, <eob> and that Africa is more endowed <eol> with that solar power <eob> that comes from the sky, the sun, <eob> than almost any other continent. <eob>
So the opportunity has come to convert <eol> some of that solar power, <eob> wireless power, into energy <eol> at the household level. <eob>
And three things have happened <eol> at the same time. <eob>
First, the costs of solar productivity <eol> have come down. <eob>
So putting a panel on your roof <eol> and generating power from it, <eob> that cost has absolutely collapsed <eol> over the last 30 years, <eob> and it's gone down by 95 percent. <eob>
Second, the appliance network. <eob>
So the group of appliances <eol> that we've all gotten used to, <eob> we all want and we all need, <eol> we all see as part of our everyday lives <eob> that give us health and security, <eob> those appliances <eol> have come down in cost. <eob>
So if you take the LED lightbulb, for example, <eol> a very simple thing, <eob> they're now 85 percent less than they were five years ago, <eob> and their efficiency, when you compare them <eol> to an incandescent bulb, <eob> like the lightbulb I showed <eol> in the previous slide, <eob> is incredible. <eob>
They give you 10 times <eol> the amount of light, <eob> and they last 30 times as long. <eob>
And then the last thing that's happened <eol> is of course the cell phone revolution, <eob> so we're piggybacking off <eol> the cell phone revolution, <eob> and we can now make decentralized customers <eol> make small payments <eob> for bits of equipment and appliances <eob> where actually they're now affordable. <eob>
We can pay them off over a daily <eol> or a weekly schedule. <eob>
So this is an incredible change <eol> in the economy that's happening, <eob> and it's really opened up something <eol> very, very innovative. <eob>
So I'm going to introduce you <eol> to a lady I met with last week. <eob>
Her name's Susan. <eob>
It may not look like it, <eob> but Susan is a representative <eol> of a $27 billion market. <eob>
27 billion dollars is what people <eol> like Susan spend every year <eob> on cell phone charging, <eob> flashlight batteries and kerosene <eol> to light their homes. <eob>
So Susan is a proud owner <eol> of a small solar system. <eob>
It's a kit rather than a planetary thing, <eob> so a small solar system, <eob> and her small solar system allows her <eol> to have a couple of lightbulbs, <eob> and she's made this transition, <eol> this jump, from kerosene into light. <eob>
She has four or five lights and a radio. <eob>
It's fantastic, and she talks about it. <eob>
She talks about her kids doing homework <eol> at night because she has light. <eob>
I'm not sure what the kids feel <eol> about that. <eob>
She talks about the fact that she can go out <eol> at 4am and look after the cows, <eob> and she's not so worried, <eob> but also, with a little twinkle in her eye, <eob> she talks about how light <eol> turns her house into a home at night. <eob>
She's not scared <eol> of her own house at night, <eob> because it has light in it, <eol> and I thought that was amazing. <eob>
So Susan does something <eol> that many customers of these companies <eob> that I talked about do, <eob> and she forces us to innovate. <eob>
She challenges companies, saying, "I've got <eol> the radio and the lights. <eob> You know what? I'd like a TV. <eob>
I'd like to entertain, educate me <eol> and my kids. <eob>
And then I would like to have <eol> some hair clippers for my kids, <eob> you know, to cut my kids' hair, <eol> and I'd love to have a fridge. <eob>
And she's coined something <eob> that the energy world <eol> is really hungry to do. <eob>
The idea that she's coined <eol> is the energy ladder. <eob>
It starts, again, <eol> with a lightbulb. Right? <eob> And the lightbulb is an idea that we can get <eol> our kids to do homework, <eob> and very cheap, about five dollars, <eob> and we can get it distributed. <eob>
But then let's go up from there. <eob> This is the kit that Susan has: <eob> four lightbulbs, radio, <eol> maybe a little flashlight, <eob> a little solar panel on the roof. <eob>
And then let's go up again. <eob>
We can get maybe at about 500 dollars, <eob> the previous kit was maybe $150, <eob> again, paid for over time, <eob> two years to pay it all off, <eob> you can get the TV, <eob> so the lightbulbs and the TV. <eob>
And you start to ask yourself, <eol> "So where is this headed?" <eob> Is this headed here, <eob> where we can have distributed systems <eob> with the right infrastructure to provide power <eob> for our hospitals and our schools? <eob>
And really how far can this go? <eob>
And this is the mindset shift that I think is really exciting. <eob>
How far can we go? <eob>
Could it get up to here? <eob>
You know, this is the conceptual design <eol> for one of the world's biggest factories, <eob> designed to be fully solar-powered <eol> and fully off grid. <eob>
Maybe we can get that. <eob>
So there's a generation of these companies <eob> that are out there doing this work <eol> and creating thousands of jobs, <eob> creating, selling, tens <eol> of thousands of these solar systems, <eob> so bringing tens <eob> of thousands of families <eol> into light, <eob> and tackling that big $1 billion problem <eol> that I talked about at the beginning, <eob> and really innovating. <eob>
And what they're doing is, <eol> they're not only energy companies, <eob> they're also credit finance companies, <eob> so they're bringing people <eol> into an economy. <eob>
They're retail companies, <eob> so they're taking products out to people <eol> in the connecting markets. <eob>
And they're appliance companies, <eob> so they're developing extraordinary products <eob> that are very efficient and very cheap. <eob>
So an extraordinary thing is happening out there <eob> that's worth recognizing. <eob>
And where does it take us? <eob>
From a governmental perspective, <eol> from a social perspective, <eob> it takes us out to two really big goals. <eob>
We aspire towards energy <eol> access for everybody, <eob> and we aspire towards a fully-functioning <eol> low-carbon economy. <eob>
And we're getting to the point <eol> where we're seeing <eob> the fully-functioning low-carbon economy <eob> is not just about getting people <eol> onto the grid, <eob> it's about getting people onto electricity <eob> and doing it in a way <eol> that's really dignified. <eob>
So I want us all to picture it <eol> for a moment, <eob> really picture what this could mean: <eob> [New energy ecosystem] <eob> an energy system <eol> that's not just about subsistence power, <eob> getting the family off the kerosene, <eob> but it's actually the full suite <eol> of appliances and tools <eob> and productivity that we've all gotten used to, <eob> so actually energy at a scale <eol> that can drive industrial development. <eob> And it's the ability to have powerful tools. <eob>
It's the ability to be productive <eol> in the households, as a farmer, <eob> or as a carpenter <eol> or as a tailor <eob> and get your businesses to work <eol> and bring you into the economy. <eob>
And I was working again a couple <eol> of days ago with a farmer <eob> just outside of Nairobi, small field, <eob> and he has an irrigation <eol> pump that's run off solar, <eob> and he was bragging about <eol> how much of a difference it made <eob> to his productivity. <eob>
When we were listening to him, <eol> we were asking ourselves, <eob> at what point will it be <eob> that actually, you will be charging an electric scooter <eol> off your rooftop <eob> and taking your crops to market <eob> with mobility that you've charged yourself, <eol> using your own power? <eob>
And that's an extraordinary thing <eol> that's happening, <eob> and if you listen to Susan and Francis, <eob> you get to this point where you say, <eob> "These guys have this extraordinary sense of dignity <eob> about the way they're achieving their power, <eob> the sense of ownership <eol> and the sense of pride, <eob> and I'm going to flip into a little tiny video clip, <eob> which is from a distributor of one of these companies <eol> that I'm talking about. <eob>
And he puts it better <eol> than anyone I've ever heard it. <eob> So just listen to this. <eob>
Martin: So if it does happen <eol> that we get to a point <eob> where every home has their own <eol> independent supply of energy, <eob> that will give us the democracy <eol> of energy. <eob> That's it. <eob> And everybody has that choice, <eob> and everybody knows <eol> when they want to switch it on or off, <eob> whether they want to sell access <eol> or whether they want to store it. <eob>
That freedom getting back <eol> into the hands of the consumer, <eob> that would be the most exciting <eol> thing. <eob>
Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right? <eob>
That was Martin, <eob> and he has a really wonderful <eol> turn of phrase, <eob> and what a sense of vision <eol> that he captures. <eob>
So picture that for a moment: <eob> every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy ... <eob> the ability to generate power, <eob> to share power, <eol> to sell power, <eob> all coming from your own generating <eol> asset sitting on your own property. <eob>
Maybe even think about crowdsourcing <eol> with your neighbors <eob> the grid from the ground up, <eob> rather than waiting for the government <eol> to bring it from the top down. <eob>
So in Africa, we have this <eol> extraordinary opportunity right now, <eob> an extraordinary opportunity, <eob> to change the world <eol> and create an energy system <eob> that everybody will be jealous of, <eob> and everybody will look to us <eol> as the innovators of. <eob>
And that's the democracy of energy. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob> Chris Anderson: Quick question. <eob>
So it's a really exciting vision. <eob>
Help us understand, <eol> what are the key roadblocks right now? <eob>
Like, what could make this go faster? <eob>
AI: So the first one, I think, is really <eol> the intermittency of solar power. <eob>
So the problem is that the sun <eol> only shines for 12 hours a day, <eob> so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day, <eob> and we need to have storage solutions <eob> that are better to help us <eol> take us down that path. <eob>
So storage is really one. <eob>
CA: And those prices are coming down. <eob>
AI: And those prices <eol> are coming down very quickly. <eob>
Second, the appliance set. <eob>
So it needs to get more efficient, <eob> and it needs to get more diverse. <eob>
We need to do more of the things <eob> we in Africa want to do <eol> with the appliance set. <eob>
CA: DC appliances. <eob>
AI: DC appliances, <eob> and I think there's a real opportunity <eol> there, Chris. <eob>
I think the opportunity <eob> is that we could shift some <eol> of these 21 billion dollars of subsidies <eob> that governments are spending <eol> on the current electricity system <eob> and we could promote R & amp; <eol> D here in Africa <eob> to create some <eol> of these products, <eob> to be some <eob> of these entrepreneurs, <eol> and make this happen. <eob>
So create this new system here. <eob>
CA: And some of the companies themselves, <eob> I mean, there's plenty of demand there. <eob>
What's holding them back <eol> from supplying that demand? <eob>
I mean, some of them talk about, <eob> they would like to sell 10x <eol> what they can currently sell. <eob>
AI: Exactly. So for many of these capitals, <eob> it's that markets <eol> don't price consumer risk very well, <eob> and particularly in markets like ours, <eob> in emerging markets <eol> and here in Africa. <eob>
So there's not enough working capital <eol> coming into this space <eob> because the big financiers <eol> look at this space and say, <eob> "I don't know how to price <eol> that risk, so I'm going to stay away from it." <eob> And that's holding a lot of these companies back. <eob>
CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting <eol> to picture what could happen here. <eob>
In my mind, this might be the biggest <eol> leapfrog of them all. <eob>
And thank you for all you're doing <eol> and for sharing that vision <eob> so powerfully. <eob>
My name is Mwende Katwiwa <eob> and I am a poet, <eob> a Pan-Africanist <eob> and a freedom fighter. <eob>
I was 23 years old <eob> when I first heard <eol> about Reproductive Justice. <eob>
I was working at Women with a Vision, <eob> where I learned that Reproductive Justice was defined by Sister Song as: <eob> One: A woman's right to decide <eol> if and when she will have a baby <eob> and the conditions under <eol> which she will give birth. <eob>
Two: A woman's right to decide <eol> if she will not have a baby <eob> and her options for preventing <eol> or ending a pregnancy. <eob>
And three: A woman's right <eol> to parent the children she already has <eob> in safe and healthy environments <eob> without fear of violence <eob> from individuals or the government. <eob>
I've always wanted to be a mother. <eob>
Growing up, I heard all about <eol> the joys of motherhood. <eob>
I used to dream of watching my womb <eol> weave wonder into this world. <eob>
See, I knew I was young. <eob>
But I figured, <eob>
it couldn't hurt to start planning <eol> for something so big, so early. <eob>
But now, <eob> I'm 26 years old. <eob>
And I don't know if I have what it takes <eol> to stomach motherhood in this country. <eob>
See, over the years, America <eol> has taught me more about parenting <eob>
than any book on the subject. <eob>
It has taught me how some women <eol> give birth to babies <eob>
and others to suspects. <eob>
It has taught me that this body <eol> will birth kin <eob>
who are more likely to be <eol> held in prison cells <eob>
than to hold college degrees. <eob>
There is something about <eol> being Black in America <eob>
that has made motherhood seem <eob>
complicated. <eob>
Seem like, <eob> I don't know what to do <eol> to raise my kids right <eob>
and keep them alive. <eob>
Do I tell my son not to steal <eol> because it is wrong, <eob>
or because they will use it <eol> to justify his death? <eob>
Do I tell him <eob>
that even if he pays <eol> for his Skittles and sweet tea <eob>
there will still be those <eol> who will watch him <eob>
and see a criminal before child; <eob>
who will call the police <eol> and not wait for them to come. <eob>
Do I even want the police to come? <eob>
Too many Sean Bells go off in my head <eol> when I consider calling 911. <eob>
I will not take it for Oscar Grant-ed that they will not come and kill my son. <eob>
So, we may have gotten rid of the nooses, <eob>
but I still consider it lynching <eol> when they murder Black boys <eob>
and leave their bodies <eol> for four hours in the sun. <eob>
As a historical reminder <eob>
that there is something <eol> about being Black in America <eob>
that has made motherhood sound <eob>
like mourning. <eob>
Sound like one morning I could wake up <eob>
and see my son as a repeat <eol> of last week's story. <eob>
Sound like I could wake up and realize <eob>
the death of my daughter <eol> wouldn't even be newsworthy. <eob>
So you can't tell me <eol> that Sandra Bland is the only Black woman <eob>
whose violence deserves <eol> more than our silence. <eob>
What about our other dark-skinned <eol> daughters in distress <eob>
whose deaths we have yet to remember? <eob>
What about our children <eob>
whose lives don't fit neatly <eol> between the lives of your genders? <eob>
See, apparently, <eol> nothing is a great protector <eob>
if you come out of a body <eol> that looks like this. <eob>
See, there is something <eol> about being Black in America <eob>
that has made motherhood sound <eob>
like something I'm not sure <eol> I look forward to. <eob>
I've written too many poems about dead Black <eol> children to be naïve <eob>
about the fact that there could one day <eol> be a poem written about my kids. <eob>
But I do not want to be a mother <eol> who gave birth to poems. <eob>
I do not want a stanza for a son <eob>
nor a line for a little girl <eob>
nor a footnote for a child <eol> who doesn't fit into this world. <eob>
No. <eob>
I do not want children <eol> who will live forever <eob>
in the pages of poetry, <eob>
yet can't seem to outlive <eob>
me. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was invited to the TEDWomen conference <eob> to perform a poem. <eob>
But for me, poetry is not <eol> about art and performance. <eob>
It is a form of protest. <eob>
Yesterday, <eob> during rehearsal, <eob> I was told that there had been <eob> two to three recent TED Talks about Black <eol> Lives Matter. <eob>
That maybe I should cut <eol> down my TED Talk <eob> so it could "just" be about Reproductive Justice. <eob>
But that poem and this talk <eob> is fundamentally about my inability <eol> to separate the two. <eob>
I was 21 years old -- <eob>
I was 21 years old <eol> when Trayvon Martin was murdered. <eob>
Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy, <eob> a Black child, <eob> reminded me <eob> reminded us <eob> how little this nation actually values Black life. <eob>
The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter <eob> became the most recognized call <eob> for Black people and our children <eob> to live in safe environments <eol> and healthy communities <eob> without fear <eob> from violence from individuals <eol> or the state or government. <eob>
Months later, <eob> when George Zimmerman <eol> was not held responsible <eob> for murdering Trayvon Martin, <eob> I heard Sybrina Fulton, <eob> Trayvon Martin's mother, speak. <eob>
Her testimony so deeply impacted me <eob> that I found myself constantly asking, <eob> what would it mean to mother <eol> in the United Stated of America <eob> in this skin? <eob>
What does motherhood really mean, <eob> when for so many who look like me <eob> it is synonymous with mourning? <eob>
Without realizing it, <eob> I had begun to link <eol> the Reproductive Justice framework <eob> and the Movement for Black Lives. <eob>
As I learned more about Reproductive Justice <eob> at Women With A Vision, <eob> and as I continued to be active <eol> in the Movement for Black Lives, <eob> I found myself wanting others <eol> to see and feel these similarities. <eob>
I found myself asking: <eob> Whose job is it in times like this <eob> to connect ideas realities and people? <eob>
I want to dedicate this talk and that poem <eob> to Constance Malcolm. <eob>
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham <eob> who was another Black child <eob> who was murdered before their time. <eob>
She <eob> reminded me <eob> once over dinner, <eob> as I was struggling to write that poem, <eob> that it is the artist's job <eob> to unearth stories that people try to bury <eob> with shovels of complacency and time. <eob>
Recently, <eob> Toni Morrison wrote, <eob> "In times of dread, <eob> artists must never <eol> choose to remain silent. <eob>
There is no time for self-pity, <eob> no room for fear. <eob> "Yesterday, <eob> during rehearsal, <eob> when I was told that I should" <eob> maybe cut the Black Lives <eol> Matter portion from my talk, <eob> "I found myself fearful for a moment. <eob>
Fearful that again our stories <eol> were being denied <eob> the very stages they deserve <eol> to be told on. <eob>
"In times of dread, <eob> artists must never choose <eol> to remain silent. <eob> And then I remembered the words <eol> I had just spoken. <eob>
There is no time for self-pity, <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There is no time for self-pity, <eob>
And <eob> no room for fear. <eob> "And I have made my choice. <eob>
And I am always choosing. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Like many of you, I'm often frustrated <eol> by the democratic process. <eob>
It's messy, it's complicated, <eob> it's often inefficient. <eob>
Our political leaders feel disconnected <eob> from the concerns of ordinary people. <eob>
Many feel that voting every few years <eob> for leaders disconnected <eol> from their daily challenges <eob> is pointless. <eob>
But before we reject democracy, <eob> let's imagine what it could be. <eob>
And I believe that African activists <eol> are redefining democracy <eob> by putting protest at its center, <eob> what I refer to as "protest democracy." <eob>
International organizations <eol> and academic experts <eob> define democracy as regular, <eol> multiparty electoral competition. <eob>
But democracy should not only be <eol> about elites competing at the ballot box. <eob>
For it to have meaning, <eob> it's something we must engage in every day. <eob>
When I say "protest democracy," <eob> I'm challenging how we think <eol> about democratic action. <eob>
Viewing democracy as only elections <eol> is no longer adequate <eob> and threatens democracy itself. <eob>
So we must protest democracy <eol> to give it a renewed meaning. <eob>
What would this look like? <eob> We need to turn to African societies, <eob> where ordinary people are increasingly <eol> taking to the streets <eob> to transform their lives. <eob>
African social movements <eol> have often been at the forefront <eob> of conceptualizing democracy in this way. <eob>
This may come as a surprise <eol> to those of who think <eob> that the only way Africans <eol> engage in politics <eob> is through the barrel of the gun. <eob>
But increasingly, young people <eol> are taking to the streets <eob> and abandoning organized violence <eob> in favor of more effective nonviolent action. <eob>
I've spent much of the past two decades <eol> talking to African activists, <eob> both violent and nonviolent. <eob>
Across Africa, young people are rising up <eob> to challenge almost every type of regime <eol> known to humanity. <eob>
This is my friend Thiat. <eob>
He's a rapper from Senegal. <eob>
He led a large movement in Senegal <eob> that was successful in preventing the president <eol> from stealing a third term. <eob>
From Morocco to Lesotho, <eob> young people are rising up <eol> against entrenched monarchies: <eob> in Egypt and Sudan, <eob> against brutal dictatorships; <eob> in Uganda and Ethiopia, <eob> against powerful militarized states <eob> with quasi-democratic veneers; <eob> in South Africa, where this image was taken, <eob> and Burundi, <eob> against democratically elected leaders <eob> who have done little to improve <eol> the conditions for ordinary people. <eob>
Across the continent, <eol> protest is not exceptional, <eob> but a normal part of life. <eob>
Africans use protests <eol> to challenge both dictators <eob> as well as power cuts. <eob>
In a way, Africans <eol> are protesting democracy itself, <eob> enriching its possibilities <eol> for us all. <eob>
There have been two major waves <eol> of African protest, <eob> and we are currently living <eol> through the third, <eob> which began around 2005. <eob>
It includes the so-called Arab Spring, <eob> which took place mostly on the continent. <eob>
The first wave took place <eol> in the 1940s and 1950s <eob> and led to Africa's decolonization. <eob>
Kwame Nkrumah led <eol> a broad coalition in Ghana <eob> that overthrew British rule, <eob> providing a template <eol> for nonviolent movements globally. <eob>
The second wave took place <eol> in the 1980s and 1990s <eob> against austerity measures <eol> that imposed harsh conditions <eob> on African economies. <eob>
These protests led to the overthrow <eol> of autocratic regimes <eob> and led to the introduction <eob> of multiparty elections <eol> across the continent. <eob>
The ongoing third wave <eol> is correcting the shortcomings of the earlier two. <eob>
If the first wave brought liberation <eol> but not democracy, <eob> and the second, elections <eol> but only for the elites, <eob> then it is the third wave <eob> that is most concerned with transforming democracy <eob> into the rule of the people. <eob>
It includes movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal, <eob> Le Balai Citoyen in Burkina Faso, <eob> Tajamuka in Zimbabwe, <eob> LUCHA and Filimbi <eol> in the Democratic Republic of Congo, <eob> movements that work outside of more conventional <eol> nongovernmental organizations <eob> and political parties <eob> to challenge the economic and political system itself, <eob> often at great risk. <eob>
Brilliant young activists like LUCHA's Fred Bauma <eob> have been detained and tortured, <eob> often with little to no outcry from the international community. <eob>
The list goes on, as you can see <eol> from some of the data we collected. <eob>
There have been large popular protests <eob> in over 40 African countries since 2005, <eob> and if you look, you'll recognize that in 2011, <eob> the year of the so-called Arab Spring, <eob> was actually the spike of this broader wave. <eob>
Contrary to popular belief, <eob> many of these protests <eol> have been successful. <eob>
We know of the dictators <eol> falling in Tunisia and in Egypt, <eob> but popular movements have prevented <eol> presidents from stealing third terms <eob> in Senegal, in Malawi and Burkina Faso as well. <eob>
What's driving this upsurge of protest? <eob>
Demographically, Africa is both the youngest <eob> and the fastest-growing continent, <eob> with the largest age gap between <eol> the people and their rulers. <eob>
It is urbanizing at a tremendous pace. <eob>
Economically, African countries have been <eol> growing for over a decade now, <eob> largely driven by investments from Asia. <eob>
But little of this wealth <eol> is trickling down. <eob>
Formal jobs in the industrial sector <eol> are actually decreasing, <eob> with informal labor the only option <eol> left for people to eke out a living. <eob>
As a result, inequality <eol> is skyrocketing, <eob> and political leaders <eol> are increasingly disconnected <eob> from their much younger populations. <eob>
For those of us from outside of Africa, <eob> we're familiar <eol> with parts of this story: <eob> a massive spike in inequality, <eob> the product of a decline <eol> in good jobs for good wages <eob> that were once considered the hallmark <eol> of an advanced society; <eob> the capture of our political parties <eol> by elites <eob> accompanied by the hollowing out of civil society <eob> that once provided a voice <eol> to ordinary people; <eob> that sinking feeling that no matter what you do, <eob> external factors related to the global economy <eob> can disrupt our lives for the worse. <eob>
Our political leaders seem helpless, <eob> insisting on austerity, <eob> even as public goods diminish <eol> to levels unseen in decades. <eob>
And this is when they're not succumbing <eol> to exclusionary nationalism, <eob> blaming our woes <eol> on the weak rather than the powerful. <eob>
What those of us from North America <eol> and Western Europe consider to be new <eob> has been the normal condition <eol> of African life since the 1970s. <eob>
So who better to learn from <eob> than those who have been engaged <eol> in resistance to these conditions <eob> for the longest period of time? <eob>
What can we learn <eol> from African protest democracy? <eob>
First, democracy must begin <eol> with ordinary people. <eob>
Viewing democracy as only elections <eol> has led to widespread disillusionment. <eob>
We must instead work <eol> to center ordinary people in democratic life. <eob>
Protest provides us one way to do that. <eob>
Regardless of your age, <eol> sexuality, your gender, <eob> whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen, <eol> able-bodied or disabled, <eob> anyone can participate. <eob>
In contrast to elections, <eob> protests are not confined <eol> by rigid electoral cycles. <eob>
They offer a much more immediate <eol> form of action <eob> in our era of instant feedback. <eob>
Second, while protests may be messy, <eob> this is what makes them powerful. <eob>
Protests are contentious <eol> and contested processes, <eob> defined by contingent actions, <eob> often devoid of clear messaging, <eob> characterized by incomplete organization. <eob>
These dynamics are what makes it easy <eol> to dismiss protests as riots <eob> or to assume they are <eol> of limited political utility. <eob>
But it also makes them easier to suppress. <eob>
Too often, governments do not view <eol> protests as elementary to democracy. <eob>
Instead, they violently crush <eol> social movements <eob> or work to discredit their message. <eob>
Third, as I already hinted, <eob> protest is the space from which new political <eol> imaginations may emerge. <eob>
Protests are about coloring <eol> outside the lines, <eob> a way for ordinary people to rewrite <eol> the rules of the game <eob> that too many feel <eol> are stacked against them. <eob>
Many young people in Africa <eol> have grown up in societies <eob> where a single ruler <eol> has ruled their entire lives. <eob>
Protest is the space <eol> for new possibilities to emerge, <eob> as young people begin <eol> to discover their own power. <eob>
Consider the situation <eol> of my friend Linda Masarira, <eob> a single mother of five, <eob> who is leading protests <eol> against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. <eob>
She has been beaten, arrested, harassed. <eob>
But Linda perseveres, because <eol> as she told me a few months ago, <eob> protest has given her a sense <eol> of meaning and direction. <eob>
And though she knows the odds against her, <eob> Linda perseveres. <eob>
Like Linda and other young African activists, <eob> we all must work <eol> to redefine democracy <eob> as something more than just elections <eob> and political parties. <eob>
Democracy is a creative process, <eob> and protest has always been the vehicle <eob> for expanding our political imaginations <eol> beyond what we are told is possible. <eob>
(In Swahili) Thank you very much. <eob>
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, <eob> Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh. <eob>
There is a moment on the birthing table <eob> that feels like dying. <eob>
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle. <eob>
The contractions <eol> are less than a minute apart. <eob>
Wave after wave, there is barely <eol> time to breathe. <eob>
The medical term: <eob> "transition," <eob> because "feels like dying" <eol> is not scientific enough. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I checked. <eob>
During my transition, <eob> my husband was pressing down on my sacrum <eob> to keep my body from breaking. <eob>
My father was waiting <eol> behind the hospital curtain ... <eob> more like hiding. <eob>
But my mother was at my side. <eob>
The midwife said she could see <eol> the baby's head, <eob> but all I could feel <eol> was a ring of fire. <eob>
I turned to my mother and said, <eol> "I can't," <eob> but she was already pouring <eol> my grandfather's prayer in my ear. <eob>
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi, Par Brahm Sarnai." <eob> "The hot winds cannot touch you." <eob>
"You are brave," she said. <eob> "You are brave." <eob> And suddenly I saw my grandmother <eol> standing behind my mother. <eob>
And her mother behind her. <eob>
And her mother behind her. <eob>
A long line of women who had pushed <eol> through the fire before me. <eob>
I took a breath; <eob> I pushed; <eob> my son was born. <eob>
As I held him in my arms, <eol> shaking and sobbing <eob> from the rush of oxytocin <eol> that flooded my body, <eob> my mother was already preparing <eol> to feed me. <eob>
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine. <eob>
My mother had never stopped <eol> laboring for me, <eob> from my birth to my son's birth. <eob>
She already knew what I was <eol> just beginning to name. <eob>
That love is more than a rush of feeling <eob> that happens to us if we're lucky. <eob>
Love is sweet labor. <eob> Fierce. <eob> Bloody. <eob> Imperfect. <eob> Life-giving. <eob> A choice we make over and over again. <eob>
I am an American civil rights activist <eob> who has labored with communities <eol> of color since September 11, <eob> fighting unjust policies by the state <eol> and acts of hate in the street. <eob>
And in our most painful moments, <eob> in the face of the fires of injustice, <eob> I have seen labors of love deliver us. <eob>
My life on the frontlines of fighting <eol> hate in America has been a study <eob> in what I've come to call revolutionary love. <eob>
Revolutionary love is the choice <eol> to enter into labor <eob> for others who do not look like us, <eob> for our opponents who hurt us <eob> and for ourselves. <eob>
In this era of enormous rage, <eob> when the fires are burning all around us, <eob> I believe that revolutionary love <eol> is the call of our times. <eob>
Now, if you cringe when people say, <eol> "Love is the answer ..." <eob> I do, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am a lawyer. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So let me show you how I came <eol> to see love as a force for social justice <eob> through three lessons. <eob>
My first encounter <eol> with hate was in the schoolyard. <eob>
I was a little girl growing up in California, <eob> where my family has lived <eol> and farmed for a century. <eob>
When I was told that I would go to hell <eol> because I was not Christian, <eob> called a "black dog" <eol> because I was not white, <eob> I ran to my grandfather's arms. <eob>
Papa Ji dried my tears — <eob> gave me the words of Guru Nanak, <eob> the founder of the Sikh faith. <eob> "I see no stranger," <eol> said Nanak. <eob> "I see no enemy." <eob> My grandfather taught me <eob> that I could choose to see <eol> all the faces I meet <eob> and wonder about them. <eob>
And if I wonder about them, <eob> then I will listen to their stories <eol> even when it's hard. <eob>
I will refuse to hate them <eol> even when they hate me. <eob>
I will even vow to protect them <eol> when they are in harm's way. <eob>
That's what it means to be a Sikh: <eob> S-i-k-h. <eob>
To walk the path of a warrior saint. <eob>
He told me the story of the first <eol> Sikh woman warrior, <eob> Mai Bhago. <eob>
The story goes there were 40 soldiers <eol> who abandoned their post <eob> during a great battle <eol> against an empire. <eob>
They returned to a village, <eob> and this village woman <eol> turned to them and said, <eob> "You will not abandon the fight. <eob>
You will return to the fire, <eob> and I will lead you." <eob> She mounted a horse. <eob>
She donned a turban. <eob>
And with sword in her hand <eol> and fire in her eyes, <eob> she led them where no one else would. <eob>
She became the one she was waiting for. <eob> "Don't abandon your posts, my dear." <eob> My grandfather saw me as a warrior. <eob>
I was a little girl in two long braids, <eob> but I promised. <eob>
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old, <eob> watching the Twin Towers fall, <eob> the horror stuck in my throat, <eob> and then a face flashes on the screen: <eob> a brown man with a turban and beard, <eob> and I realize that our nation's new enemy <eol> looks like my grandfather. <eob>
And these turbans meant to represent <eol> our commitment to serve <eob> cast us as terrorists. <eob>
And Sikhs became targets of hate, <eob> alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters. <eob>
The first person killed in a hate crime <eol> after September 11 was a Sikh man, <eob> standing in front of his gas station in Arizona. <eob>
Balbir Singh Sodhi was a family friend <eol> I called "uncle," <eob> murdered by a man who called himself "patriot." <eob> He is the first of many to have been killed, <eob> but his story -- <eob> our stories barely made the evening news. <eob>
I didn't know what to do, <eob> but I had a camera, <eob> I faced the fire. <eob>
I went to his widow, <eob> Joginder Kaur. <eob>
I wept with her, and I asked her, <eob> "What would you like to tell <eol> the people of America?" <eob> I was expecting blame. <eob>
But she looked at me and said, <eob> "Tell them, 'Thank you.' <eob> 3,000 Americans came to my husband's memorial. <eob>
They did not know me, <eob> but they wept with me. <eob>
"Tell them, 'Thank you.' <eob> Thousands of people showed up, <eob> because unlike national news, <eob> the local media told Balbir Uncle's story. <eob>
Stories can create the wonder <eob> that turns strangers <eol> into sisters and brothers. <eob>
This was my first lesson <eol> in revolutionary love — <eob> that stories can help us see <eol> no stranger. <eob>
And so ... <eob> my camera became my sword. <eob>
My law degree became my shield. <eob>
My film partner became my husband. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I didn't expect that. <eob>
And we became part of a generation of advocates <eob> working with communities <eol> facing their own fires. <eob>
I worked inside of supermax prisons, <eob> on the shores of Guantanamo, <eob> at the sites of mass shootings <eob> when the blood was still fresh on the ground. <eob>
And every time, <eob> for 15 years, <eob> with every film, with every lawsuit, <eob> with every campaign, <eob> I thought we were making the nation safer <eob> for the next generation. <eob>
And then <eob> my son was born. <eob>
In a time... <eob> when hate crimes against our communities <eob> are at the highest they have been since 9 / 11. <eob> When right-wing nationalist movements <eol> are on the rise around the globe <eob> and have captured the presidency <eol> of the United States. <eob> When white supremacists march <eol> in our streets, <eob> torches high, hoods off. <eob> And I have to reckon with the fact <eob> that my son is growing up <eol> in a country more dangerous for him <eob> than the one I was given. <eob>
And there will be moments <eob> when I cannot protect him <eob> when he is seen as a terrorist ... <eob> just as black people in America <eob> are still seen as criminal. <eob> Brown people, illegal. <eob>
Women and girls as property. <eob> And when they fail to see <eol> our bodies as some mother's child, <eob> it becomes easier to ban us, <eob> detain us, <eob> deport us, <eob> imprison us, <eob> sacrifice us for the illusion <eol> of security. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I wanted to abandon my post. <eob>
But I made a promise, <eob> so I returned to the gas station <eob> where Balbir Singh Sodhi <eol> was killed 15 years to the day. <eob>
I set down a candle in the spot <eol> where he bled to death. <eob>
His brother, Rana, turned to me <eob> and said, "Nothing has changed." <eob>
And I asked, <eob> "Who have we not yet tried to love?" <eob>
We decided to call the murderer in prison. <eob> The phone rings. <eob> My heart is beating in my ears. <eob>
I hear the voice of Frank Roque, <eob> a man who once said ... <eob> "I'm going to go out and shoot <eol> some towel heads. <eob>
We should kill their children, too. <eob> "And every emotional impulse <eol> in me says," I can't. <eob> "It becomes an act of will to wonder." <eob> Why? "I ask." <eob> Why did you agree to speak with us? <eob> " <eob>
Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened, <eob> but I'm also sorry for all the people <eol> killed on 9 / 11." <eob> He fails to take responsibility. <eob>
I become angry to protect Rana, <eob> but Rana is still wondering about Frank -- <eob> listening -- <eob> responds. <eob>
"Frank, this is the first time <eol> I'm hearing you say <eob> that you feel sorry." <eob>
And Frank -- <eob> Frank says, "Yes. <eob>
I am sorry for what I did to your brother. <eob>
One day when I go to heaven <eol> to be judged by God, <eob> I will ask to see your brother. <eob>
And I will hug him. <eob>
And I will ask him for forgiveness." <eob>
And Rana says ... <eob> "We already forgave you." <eob>
Forgiveness is not forgetting. <eob> Forgiveness is freedom from hate. <eob>
Because when we are free from hate, <eob> we see the ones <eol> who hurt us not as monsters, <eob> but as people who themselves are wounded, <eob> who themselves feel threatened, <eob> who don't know what else to do <eol> with their insecurity <eob> but to hurt us, to pull the trigger, <eob> or cast the vote, <eob> or pass the policy aimed at us. <eob>
But if some of us begin <eol> to wonder about them, <eob> listen even to their stories, <eob> we learn that participation <eol> in oppression comes at a cost. <eob>
It cuts them off from their own <eol> capacity to love. <eob>
This was my second lesson <eol> in revolutionary love. <eob>
We love our opponents <eol> when we tend the wound in them. <eob>
Tending to the wound <eol> is not healing them -- <eob> only they can do that. <eob>
Just tending to it allows us <eob> to see our opponents: <eob> the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue. <eob>
They've been radicalized by cultures <eol> and policies that we together can change. <eob>
I looked back on all of our campaigns, <eob> and I realized that any time <eol> we fought bad actors, <eob> we didn't change very much. <eob>
But when we chose to wield <eol> our swords and shields <eob> to battle bad systems, <eob> that's when we saw change. <eob>
I have worked on campaigns <eob> that released hundreds of people <eol> out of solitary confinement, <eob> reformed a corrupt police department, <eob> changed federal hate crimes policy. <eob>
The choice to love our opponents <eol> is moral and pragmatic, <eob> and it opens up the previously <eol> unimaginable possibility <eob> of reconciliation. <eob>
But remember ... <eob> it took 15 years to make that phone call. <eob>
I had to tend to my own rage <eol> and grief first. <eob>
Loving our opponents <eol> requires us to love ourselves. <eob>
Gandhi, King, Mandela -- <eob> they taught a lot about how to love <eol> others and opponents. <eob>
They didn't talk <eol> a lot about loving ourselves. <eob>
This is a feminist intervention. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yes. <eob> Yes. <eob>
Because for too long have women <eol> and women of color been told <eob> to suppress their rage, <eob> suppress their grief in the name of love <eol> and forgiveness. <eob>
But when we suppress our rage, <eob> that's when it hardens <eol> into hate directed outward, <eob> but usually directed inward. <eob>
But mothering has taught me <eol> that all of our emotions are necessary. <eob>
Joy is the gift of love. <eob>
Grief is the price of love. <eob>
Anger is the force that protects it. <eob>
This was my third lesson <eol> in revolutionary love. <eob>
We love ourselves <eob> when we breathe through the fire of pain <eob> and refuse to let it harden into hate. <eob>
That's why I believe <eob> that love must be practiced <eol> in all three directions <eob> to be revolutionary. <eob>
Loving just ourselves feels good, <eob> but it's narcissism. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Loving only our opponents <eol> is self-loathing. <eob>
Loving only others is ineffective. <eob>
This is where a lot of our movements <eol> live right now. <eob>
We need to practice <eol> all three forms of love. <eob> And so, how do we practice it? <eob> Ready? <eob>
Number one ... <eob> in order to love others, <eob> see no stranger. <eob>
We can train our eyes to look <eol> upon strangers on the street, <eob> on the subway, on the screen, <eob> and say in our minds, <eob> "Brother, <eob> sister, <eob> aunt, <eob> uncle." <eob> And when we say this, <eol> what we are saying is, <eob> "You are a part of me <eol> I do not yet know. <eob>
I choose to wonder about you. <eob>
I will listen for your stories <eob> and pick up a sword when you <eol> are in harm's way." <eob>
And so, number two: <eob> in order to love our opponents, <eob> tend the wound. <eob>
Can you see the wound <eol> in the ones who hurt you? <eob>
Can you wonder even about them? <eob>
And if this question sends panic through your body, <eob> then your most revolutionary act <eob> is to wonder, listen and respond <eol> to your own needs. <eob>
Number three: <eob> in order to love ourselves, <eob> breathe and push. <eob>
When we are pushing into <eol> the fires in our bodies <eob> or the fires in the world, <eob> we need to be breathing together <eob> in order to be pushing together. <eob>
How are you breathing each day? <eob> Who are you breathing with? <eob> Because... <eob> when executive orders and news of violence <eol> hits our bodies hard, <eob> sometimes less than a minute apart, <eob> it feels like dying. <eob>
In those moments, <eob> my son places <eol> his hand on my cheek and says, <eob> "Dance time, mommy?" <eob> And we dance. <eob>
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance. <eob>
Our family becomes a pocket <eol> of revolutionary love. <eob>
Our joy is an act of moral resistance. <eob>
How are you protecting your joy each day? <eob>
Because in joy we see even darkness <eol> with new eyes. <eob>
And so the mother in me asks, <eob> what if this darkness is not <eol> the darkness of the tomb, <eob> but the darkness of the womb? <eob>
What if our future is not dead, <eob> but still waiting to be born? <eob>
What if this is our great transition? <eob>
Remember the wisdom of the midwife. <eob> "Breathe," she says. <eob>
And then — <eob> "push." <eob> Because if we don't push, we will die. <eob>
If we don't breathe, we will die. <eob>
Revolutionary love requires us to <eob> breathe and push <eob> through the fire <eob> with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes <eob> so that one day... <eob> one day you will see my son as your own <eob> and protect him when I am not there. <eob>
You will tend to the wound <eol> in the ones who want to hurt him. <eob>
You will teach him how to love himself <eob> because you love yourself. <eob>
You will whisper in his ear, <eob> as I whisper in yours, <eob> "You are brave." <eob> You are brave. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, <eob> Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm a scientist, <eob> and I'm a big fan of Star Trek, <eob> especially of Mr. Spock. <eob>
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well, <eob> and at the same time, he's the first [officer] <eob> of the starship Enterprise, <eob> and during the adventures <eol> of the Enterprise crew, <eob> he and his colleagues are dealing a lot <eob> with the presence or absence <eol> of Mr. Spock's emotions. <eob>
Mr. Spock is half-human <eol> and half-Vulcan, <eob> and Vulcans are an alien race <eob> who learn to control and suppress <eol> their feelings <eob> and to act purely out of logic. <eob>
As Mr. Spock is only half-Vulcan, <eob> he sees himself constantly in conflict <eol> in between logic and emotions, <eob> and as he's part of a team, <eob> the whole crew is struggling with, <eob> is analyzing, <eob> and is making fun <eol> of this conflict. <eob>
And also the fans of Star Trek watch <eol> with amusement <eob> this seemingly contradictory behavior. <eob>
They find it quite fascinating. <eob>
And the matter is a golden thread <eob> through the whole Star Trek series <eol> and movies from the '60s until today. <eob>
And that's actually what I want <eol> to talk about today: <eob> the role of emotions in science. <eob>
We tend to think that science <eol> is all about facts and logic <eob> and human feelings are often neglected <eol> or considered an obstacle to get rid of. <eob>
I would like to suggest that emotions <eol> are as important in science <eob> as they are in any other part of our lives. <eob>
Science is made by humans, <eob> and as human beings, <eob> even if we try hard, <eol> we cannot get rid of our emotions. <eob>
So instead of fighting them, <eob> I believe that even in science, <eol> we should make use of our feelings, <eob> because for breakthroughs and innovation, <eob> they are equally important <eol> as facts and logic. <eob>
I will come back to Mr. Spock, <eob> but first let me share my experience on <eob> the role of emotions in science, <eob> and one story in particular kept me thinking about it <eob> for the last couple of years. <eob>
I'm working in research <eol> on organic light-emitting diodes, <eob> so-called OLEDs. <eob>
This is how you might know them, <eob> as new generation of displays. <eob>
OLEDs are more and more used <eol> in smartphone displays and TV screens. <eob>
They make them appear bright, <eol> truly colorful and bendable. <eob>
This is how they look like <eob> in the research lab <eol> of my physicist colleagues. <eob>
And this is what I, as a chemist, <eob> have in mind when I think about them. <eob>
I've loved it ever since <eol> I started to work on it. <eob>
So I didn't really like the news <eob> when the company I had been working for -- <eob> that was my previous employer -- <eob> announced that they wanted to stop OLED research. <eob>
At the time, the management <eol> had reasons for this decision, <eob> and the company handled it <eol> very well, actually. <eob>
Nobody lost their jobs, <eob> and everybody was rewarded <eol> for their performed work. <eob>
What I want to show you today <eob> is what happened <eol> with my scientist colleagues and me <eob> during the time in between the announcement <eob> and the last working <eol> day on our project. <eob>
Consider it a small case study <eol> on emotions in science. <eob>
In 2015, our research team <eol> had grown to more than 80 people, <eob> and even after the announcement <eol> that our project was discontinued, <eob> we could not stop working <eol> from one day to another. <eob>
It took several months <eol> to bring all activities to a sound end <eob> and to find new jobs <eol> within the company for everyone. <eob>
Here's what happened. <eob> Even though we knew <eol> that we were working on a project <eob> that was to be stopped, <eob> during those months our output hit the roof. <eob>
We were actually working on two different OLED projects: <eob> first, the development of materials <eol> for blue-shining OLEDs, <eob> which had started in 2001; <eob> and second, materials for green OLEDs, <eol> which had started in 2014. <eob>
And the results I show you here <eol> concern the green OLED project. <eob>
In the graph, <eol> you can see how the lifetime, <eob> which is a crucial measure <eol> for the durability of our devices, <eob> developed over time. <eob>
In 2015, just half a year into the project, <eob> we were told to scale down, <eob> to stop working on the project <eol> as soon as possible <eob> and to start over in other jobs. <eob>
Nevertheless, from this time on, <eob> our results continued to improve rapidly. <eob>
How did that happen? <eob> After the announcement, pretty quickly, colleagues <eol> started leaving the team, <eob> and soon, we were left in a small group, <eob> all pretty much sharing <eol> the same attitude of, <eob> "I'm going to be <eol> the last person leaving the ship." <eob> What I mean is, <eob> while the number of scientists <eol> working on the project was decreasing, <eob> the dedication of people remaining grew dramatically. <eob>
And also, a new and more intense <eol> team spirit formed. <eob>
We all shared the same passion for our work, <eob> we all were sad <eol> that it was about to end, <eob> and we all wanted to show <eol> that we could turn our ideas into reality. <eob>
We felt that we belonged <eol> to something bigger. <eob>
And furthermore, <eob> our project was less and less <eol> in the focus of the management, <eob> because they started to think <eol> about new projects, <eob> restructuring and so on. <eob>
This resulted in additional freedom <eob> and the possibility to take a few things <eol> into our own hands. <eob>
Of course, more freedom also <eol> means more responsibility, <eob> which we were happy to take, <eol> because we believed in our work. <eob> We felt empowered. <eob> And these three pillars -- <eob> dedication, belonging and empowerment -- <eob> worked together in a kind of self-reinforcing cycle, <eob> and the closer we got to shutdown, <eob> the better our output became. <eob>
So we were working with such personal engagement <eob> on a project already sentenced to death <eob> because we felt connected to something meaningful. <eob>
Of course, it was also a hard <eol> and sometimes frustrating time, <eob> but we were sitting together in the lab, <eob> or occasionally in the café, <eob> sharing our sadness about the end <eol> of our project <eob> as well as the joy in our work. <eob>
So overall, we had a very intense <eol> and mesmerizingly exciting time. <eob>
And the lifetime we finally obtained <eol> for our materials <eob> was on one level with already <eol> commercialized materials <eob> for green OLEDs at the time, <eob> and we achieved this within just one year. <eob>
And those results helped our employer <eob> to sell the patents for real value. <eob>
Now, let me tell you the same story <eob> with different characters <eol> and a slightly different operation. <eob>
The story is part of Star Trek. <eob>
And sorry for those of you <eol> who haven't seen the movies, <eob> but I need to introduce <eol> a spoiler here. <eob>
After Mr. Spock sacrificed himself <eol> to save the starship Enterprise <eob> at the end of Star Trek II, <eob> Captain Kirk and his core team <eob> were determined to hunt <eol> through the universe to search for Spock, <eob> even though they could see <eol> only very little chance <eob> in finding him alive. <eob>
And Starfleet Command did not give them permission <eob> nor a starship to do so, <eob> so they took it very passionately <eol> into their own hands <eob> to travel out to find Spock. <eob>
And after dealing with great challenges, <eol> they eventually found Spock, <eob> and he happily and gratefully <eol> joined the team again. <eob>
He could feel the dedication <eol> and the connection of his team <eob> towards their project, which was to save him <eob> and to hold the crew together. <eob>
And over the years, <eol> over the episodes of the saga, <eob> Mr. Spock came to realize <eob> that the combination of both logic and emotions <eob> is crucial for facing challenges <eol> and exploring new worlds, <eob> and there was no contradiction anymore. <eob>
So the storyline here for both our OLED story <eol> and Star Trek <eob> is actually the basic setting for a lot <eol> of breakthrough stories, <eob> in and out of science. <eob>
The main characters <eol> are all part of a great team. <eob>
All team members show a huge dedication <eol> towards reaching their goal. <eob>
They strive to seize all the freedom <eol> they can get, <eob> and they take the responsibility <eol> they need to take. <eob>
During the time our OLED project <eol> was nearing the end, <eob> I received one piece of advice several times. <eob> "Don't take it to your heart. <eob>
You can work on something else." <eob> If I had followed it, <eob> it would have saved me several depressed evenings <eob> and many tears, <eob> but at the same time, <eob> I would have failed to gain a great deal <eol> in personal development and happiness. <eob>
And as the same is true <eol> for my colleagues and our whole project, <eob> we would have achieved far less. <eob>
So of course, science <eol> should be based on facts and logic. <eob>
When I say we should use <eol> our emotions in science, <eob> I do not suggest we should use feelings <eol> instead of facts. <eob>
But I say we should not be afraid <eol> of using our feelings <eob> to implement and to catalyze fact-based science <eol> and innovation. <eob>
Emotions and logic <eol> do not oppose each other. <eob>
They complement each other, <eob> and they reinforce each other. <eob>
The feeling of being dedicated <eol> to something meaningful, <eob> of belonging to something bigger <eob> and of being empowered <eob> is crucial for creativity and innovation. <eob>
Whatever you are working on, <eob> make sure that it matters, <eob> and take it to your heart <eol> as much as you like. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Automation anxiety <eol> has been spreading lately, <eob> a fear that in the future, <eob> many jobs will be performed by machines <eob> rather than human beings, <eob> given the remarkable advances <eol> that are unfolding <eob> in artificial intelligence <eol> and robotics. <eob>
What's clear is that there will be <eol> significant change. <eob>
What's less clear is what <eol> that change will look like. <eob>
My research suggests that the future <eol> is both troubling and exciting. <eob>
The threat of technological unemployment <eol> is real, <eob> and yet it's a good problem to have. <eob>
And to explain how I came <eol> to that conclusion, <eob> I want to confront three myths <eob> that I think are currently obscuring <eol> our vision of this automated future. <eob>
A picture that we see <eol> on our television screens, <eob> in books, in films, <eol> in everyday commentary <eob> is one where an army of robots <eol> descends on the workplace <eob> with one goal in mind: <eob> to displace human beings <eol> from their work. <eob>
And I call this the Terminator myth. <eob>
Yes, machines displace human beings <eol> from particular tasks, <eob> but they don't just substitute <eol> for human beings. <eob>
They also complement them <eol> in other tasks, <eob> making that work more valuable <eol> and more important. <eob>
Sometimes they complement human beings directly, <eob> making them more productive <eol> or more efficient at a particular task. <eob>
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system <eol> to navigate on unfamiliar roads. <eob>
An architect can use computer-assisted design software <eob> to design bigger, more complicated buildings. <eob>
But technological progress <eol> doesn't just complement human beings directly. <eob>
It also complements them indirectly, <eol> and it does this in two ways. <eob>
The first is if we think <eol> of the economy as a pie, <eob> technological progress <eol> makes the pie bigger. <eob>
As productivity increases, incomes <eol> rise and demand grows. <eob>
The British pie, for instance, <eob> is more than a hundred times <eol> the size it was 300 years ago. <eob>
And so people displaced <eol> from tasks in the old pie <eob> could find tasks to do <eol> in the new pie instead. <eob>
But technological progress <eol> doesn't just make the pie bigger. <eob>
It also changes the ingredients in the pie. <eob>
As time passes, people spend <eol> their income in different ways, <eob> changing how they spread it <eol> across existing goods, <eob> and developing tastes for entirely <eol> new goods, too. <eob>
New industries are created, <eob> new tasks have to be done <eob> and that means often new roles <eol> have to be filled. <eob>
So again, the British pie: <eob> 300 years ago, most people <eol> worked on farms, <eob> 150 years ago, in factories, <eob> and today, most people work in offices. <eob>
And once again, people displaced <eob> from tasks <eol> in the old bit of pie <eob> could tumble into tasks <eol> in the new bit of pie instead. <eob>
Economists call these effects <eol> complementarities, <eob> but really that's just a fancy word <eol> to capture the different way <eob> that technological progress <eol> helps human beings. <eob>
Resolving this Terminator myth <eob> shows us that there are <eol> two forces at play: <eob> one, machine substitution <eol> that harms workers, <eob> but also these complementarities <eol> that do the opposite. <eob>
Now the second myth, <eob> what I call the intelligence myth. <eob>
What do the tasks of driving a car, <eol> making a medical diagnosis <eob> and identifying a bird at a fleeting <eol> glimpse have in common? <eob>
Well, these are all tasks <eol> that until very recently, <eob> leading economists thought <eol> couldn't readily be automated. <eob>
And yet today, all of these tasks <eol> can be automated. <eob>
You know, all major car manufacturers <eol> have driverless car programs. <eob>
There's countless systems out there <eol> that can diagnose medical problems. <eob>
And there's even an app <eol> that can identify a bird <eob> at a fleeting glimpse. <eob>
Now, this wasn't simply a case of bad <eol> luck on the part of economists. <eob>
They were wrong, <eob> and the reason why they were wrong <eol> is very important. <eob>
They've fallen for the intelligence myth, <eob> the belief that machines <eol> have to copy the way <eob> that human beings think and reason <eob> in order to outperform them. <eob>
When these economists were trying to figure out <eob> what tasks machines could not do, <eob> they imagined the only way <eol> to automate a task <eob> was to sit down with a human being, <eob> get them to explain to you <eol> how it was they performed a task, <eob> and then try and capture that explanation <eob> in a set of instructions <eol> for a machine to follow. <eob>
This view was popular in artificial intelligence <eol> at one point, too. <eob>
I know this because Richard Susskind, <eob> who is my dad and my coauthor, <eob> wrote his doctorate in the 1980s <eol> on artificial intelligence and the law <eob> at Oxford University, <eob> and he was part of the vanguard. <eob>
And with a professor called Phillip Capper <eob> and a legal publisher <eol> called Butterworths, <eob> they produced the world's first commercially <eol> available <eob> artificial intelligence system in the law. <eob>
This was the home screen design. <eob>
He assures me this was <eol> a cool screen design at the time. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I've never been entirely convinced. <eob>
He published it in the form of two <eol> floppy disks, <eob> at a time where floppy <eol> disks genuinely were floppy, <eob> and his approach was the same <eol> as the economists': <eob> sit down with a lawyer, <eob> get her to explain to you <eol> how it was she solved a legal problem, <eob> and then try and capture that explanation <eob> in a set of rules <eob> for a machine to follow. <eob>
In economics, if human beings <eol> could explain themselves in this way, <eob> the tasks are called routine, <eol> and they could be automated. <eob>
But if human beings <eol> can't explain themselves, <eob> the tasks are called non-routine, <eol> and they're thought to be out reach. <eob>
Today, that routine-nonroutine <eol> distinction is widespread. <eob>
Think how often you hear people say to you <eob> machines can only perform tasks <eol> that are predictable or repetitive, <eob> rules-based or well-defined. <eob>
Those are all just different words <eol> for routine. <eob>
And go back to those three cases <eol> that I mentioned at the start. <eob>
Those are all classic cases <eol> of nonroutine tasks. <eob>
Ask a doctor, for instance, <eol> how she makes a medical diagnosis, <eob> and she might be able to give you <eol> a few rules of thumb, <eob> but ultimately she'd struggle. <eob>
She'd say it requires things like creativity <eol> and judgment and intuition. <eob>
And these things are very difficult to articulate, <eob> and so it was thought these tasks <eol> would be very hard to automate. <eob>
If a human being can't explain themselves, <eob> where on earth do we begin <eol> in writing a set of instructions <eob> for a machine to follow? <eob>
Thirty years ago, this view was right, <eob> but today it's looking shaky, <eob> and in the future it's simply <eol> going to be wrong. <eob>
Advances in processing power, <eol> in data storage capability <eob> and in algorithm design <eob> mean that this routine-nonroutine distinction <eob> is diminishingly useful. <eob>
To see this, go back to the case <eol> of making a medical diagnosis. <eob>
Earlier in the year, <eob> a team of researchers <eol> at Stanford announced they'd developed a system <eob> which can tell you whether or not <eol> a freckle is cancerous <eob> as accurately as leading dermatologists. <eob> How does it work? <eob> It's not trying to copy the judgment <eol> or the intuition of a doctor. <eob>
It knows or understands <eol> nothing about medicine at all. <eob>
Instead, it's running a pattern <eol> recognition algorithm <eob> through 129,450 past cases, <eob> hunting for similarities between those cases <eob> and the particular lesion in question. <eob>
It's performing these tasks in an unhuman way, <eob> based on the analysis <eol> of more possible cases <eob> than any doctor could hope <eol> to review in their lifetime. <eob>
It didn't matter that that human being, <eob> that doctor, couldn't explain <eol> how she'd performed the task. <eob>
Now, there are those <eol> who dwell upon that the fact <eob> that these machines aren't built <eol> in our image. <eob>
As an example, take IBM's Watson, <eob> the supercomputer that went <eol> on the US quiz show "Jeopardy!" in 2011, <eob> and it beat the two human champions at "Jeopardy!" <eob> The day after it won, <eob> The Wall Street Journal ran a piece by the philosopher John Searle <eob> with the title "Watson Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!'" <eob> Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true. <eob>
You know, Watson didn't let out <eol> a cry of excitement. <eob>
It didn't call up its parents <eol> to say what a good job it had done. <eob>
It didn't go down to the pub for a drink. <eob>
This system wasn't trying to copy the way <eol> that those human contestants played, <eob> but it didn't matter. <eob>
It still outperformed them. <eob>
Resolving the intelligence myth <eob> shows us that our limited <eol> understanding about human intelligence, <eob> about how we think and reason, <eob> is far less of a constraint on automation <eol> than it was in the past. <eob>
What's more, as we've seen, <eob> when these machines perform <eol> tasks differently to human beings, <eob> there's no reason to think <eob> that what human beings <eol> are currently capable of doing <eob> represents any sort of summit <eob> in what these machines might be capable <eol> of doing in the future. <eob>
Now the third myth, <eob> what I call the superiority myth. <eob>
It's often said that those who forget <eob> about the helpful side <eol> of technological progress, <eob> those complementarities from before, <eob> are committing something known <eol> as the lump of labor fallacy. <eob>
Now, the problem is the lump <eol> of labor fallacy <eob> is itself a fallacy, <eob> and I call this the lump <eob> of labor fallacy <eol> fallacy, <eob> or LOLFF, for short. <eob> Let me explain. <eob> The lump <eob> of labor fallacy <eol> is a very old idea. <eob>
It was a British economist, <eol> David Schloss, who gave it this name in 1892. <eob>
He was puzzled <eol> to come across a dock worker <eob> who had begun to use a machine to make washers, <eob> the small metal discs that fasten <eol> on the end of screws. <eob>
And this dock worker felt guilty <eol> for being more productive. <eob>
Now, most of the time, <eol> we expect the opposite, <eob> that people feel guilty <eol> for being unproductive, <eob> you know, a little too much time <eol> on Facebook or Twitter at work. <eob>
But this worker felt guilty <eol> for being more productive, <eob> and asked why, he said, "I know <eol> I'm doing wrong. <eob>
I'm taking away the work of another man." <eob> In his mind, there was some fixed lump of work <eob> to be divided up between him and his pals, <eob> so that if he used this <eol> machine to do more, <eob> there'd be less left <eol> for his pals to do. <eob>
Schloss saw the mistake. <eob>
The lump of work wasn't fixed. <eob>
As this worker used the machine <eol> and became more productive, <eob> the price of washers would fall, <eol> demand for washers would rise, <eob> more washers would have to be made, <eob> and there'd be more work <eol> for his pals to do. <eob>
The lump of work would get bigger. <eob>
Schloss called this "the lump <eol> of labor fallacy." <eob>
And today you hear people talk <eol> about the lump of labor fallacy <eob> to think about the future <eol> of all types of work. <eob>
There's no fixed lump of work out there <eol> to be divided up <eob> between people and machines. <eob>
Yes, machines substitute <eol> for human beings, making the original lump of work smaller, <eob> but they also complement human beings, <eob> and the lump of work gets bigger and changes. <eob> But LOLFF. <eob> Here's the mistake: <eob> it's right to think that technological progress <eob> makes the lump of work <eol> to be done bigger. <eob>
Some tasks become more valuable. <eol> New tasks have to be done. <eob>
But it's wrong to think <eol> that necessarily, <eob> human beings will be best placed <eol> to perform those tasks. <eob>
And this is the superiority myth. <eob>
Yes, the lump of work might get bigger <eol> and change, <eob> but as machines become more capable, <eob> it's likely that they'll take <eol> on the extra lump of work themselves. <eob>
Technological progress, rather than complement <eol> human beings, <eob> complements machines instead. <eob>
To see this, go back to the task <eol> of driving a car. <eob>
Today, satnav systems directly <eol> complement human beings. <eob>
They make some human beings <eol> better drivers. <eob>
But in the future, <eob> software is going to displace <eol> human beings from the driving seat, <eob> and these satnav systems, <eol> rather than complement human beings, <eob> will simply make these driverless cars <eol> more efficient, <eob> helping the machines instead. <eob>
Or go to those indirect complementarities <eol> that I mentioned as well. <eob>
The economic pie may get larger, <eob> but as machines become more capable, <eob> it's possible that any new demand <eol> will fall on goods that machines, <eob> rather than human beings, <eob> are best placed to produce. <eob>
but as machines become more capable, <eob> The economic pie may change, <eob> it's possible that they'll be <eob> best placed to do the new tasks <eol> that have to be done. <eob>
In short, demand for tasks isn't demand <eol> for human labor. <eob>
Human beings only stand to benefit <eob> if they retain the upper hand <eol> in all these complemented tasks, <eob> but as machines become more capable, <eob> that becomes less likely. <eob>
So what do these three myths tell us then? <eob>
one, machine substitution <eol> that harms workers, <eob> Well, resolving the Terminator myth <eob> shows us that the future of work depends <eol> upon this balance between two forces: <eob> but also those complementarities that do the opposite. <eob>
And until now, this balance <eol> has fallen in favor of human beings. <eob>
But resolving the intelligence myth <eob> shows us that that first force, <eol> machine substitution, <eob> is gathering strength. <eob>
Machines, of course, <eol> can't do everything, <eob> but they can do far more, <eob> encroaching ever deeper <eol> into the realm of tasks performed by human beings. <eob>
What's more, <eob> there's no reason to think <eob> that what human beings <eol> are currently capable of <eob> represents any sort of finishing line, <eob> that machines are going <eol> to draw to a polite stop <eob> once they're as capable as us. <eob>
Now, none of this matters <eob> so long as those helpful <eol> winds of complementarity <eob> blow firmly enough, <eob> but resolving the superiority myth <eob> shows us that that process of task <eol> encroachment <eob> not only strengthens <eol> the force of machine substitution, <eob> but it wears down those helpful <eol> complementarities too. <eob>
Bring these three myths together <eob> and I think we can capture <eol> a glimpse of that troubling future. <eob>
Machines continue to become more capable, <eob> encroaching ever deeper <eol> on tasks performed by human beings, <eob> strengthening the force <eol> of machine substitution, <eob> weakening the force of machine <eol> complementarity. <eob>
rather than human beings, <eob> And at some point, <eol> that balance falls in favor of machines <eob>
This is the path we're currently on. <eob>
I say "path" deliberately, because <eol> I don't think we're there yet, <eob> but it is hard to avoid the conclusion <eol> that this is our direction of travel. <eob>
That's the troubling part. <eob>
Let me say now why I think actually <eol> this is a good problem to have. <eob>
For most of human history, <eol> one economic problem has dominated: <eob> how to make the economic pie large <eol> enough for everyone to live on. <eob>
Go back to the turn <eol> of the first century AD, <eob> and if you took the global economic pie <eob> and divided it up into equal slices <eol> for everyone in the world, <eob> everyone would get a few hundred dollars. <eob>
Almost everyone lived on or around <eol> the poverty line. <eob>
And if you roll forward a thousand years, <eob> roughly the same is true. <eob>
But in the last few hundred years, <eol> economic growth has taken off. <eob>
Those economic pies have exploded in size. <eob>
Global GDP per head, <eob> the value of those individual <eol> slices of the pie today, <eob> they're about 10,150 dollars. <eob>
If economic growth continues at two percent, <eob> our children <eol> will be twice as rich as us. <eob>
If it continues at a more measly one percent, <eob> our grandchildren will be twice <eol> as rich as us. <eob>
By and large, we've solved <eol> that traditional economic problem. <eob>
Now, technological unemployment, <eol> if it does happen, <eob> in a strange way <eol> will be a symptom of that success, <eob> will have solved one problem -- <eol> how to make the pie bigger -- <eob> but replaced it with another -- <eob> how to make sure that everyone <eol> gets a slice. <eob>
As other economists have noted, solving <eol> this problem won't be easy. <eob>
Today, for most people, <eob> their job is their seat <eol> at the economic dinner table, <eob> and in a world with less work or even without work, <eob> it won't be clear how they get their slice. <eob>
There's a great deal <eol> of discussion, for instance, <eob> about various forms <eol> of universal basic income <eob> as one possible approach, <eob> and there's trials underway <eob> in the United States <eol> and in Finland and in Kenya. <eob>
And this is the collective challenge <eol> that's right in front of us, <eob> to figure out how this material prosperity <eol> generated by our economic system <eob> can be enjoyed by everyone <eob> in a world in which our traditional mechanism <eob> for slicing up the pie, <eob> the work that people do, <eob> withers away and perhaps disappears. <eob>
Solving this problem is going to require us <eol> to think in very different ways. <eob>
There's going to be a lot of disagreement <eol> about what ought to be done, <eob> but it's important to remember <eol> that this is a far better problem to have <eob> than the one that haunted <eol> our ancestors for centuries: <eob> how to make that pie big enough <eol> in the first place. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
It's 4am in the morning. <eob>
I'm waking up in a Boston hotel room <eob> and can only think of one thing: <eob> tooth pain. <eob>
One of my ceramic inlays <eol> fell off the evening before. <eob>
Five hours later, <eol> I'm sitting in a dentist's chair. <eob>
But instead of having <eol> a repair of my inlay so that I can get rid of my pain, <eob> the dentist pitches me on the advantages <eol> of a titanium implant surgery. <eob>
Ever heard of that? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It essentially means to replace a damaged tooth <eob> by an artificial one, <eob> that is screwed into your jaw. <eob>
Estimated costs for the implant surgery <eol> may add up to 10,000 US dollars. <eob>
Replacing the ceramic inlay I had before <eob> would come in at 100 US dollars. <eob>
Was it my health or the money <eol> that could be earned with me <eob> that was the biggest concern <eol> for my dentist? <eob>
As it turned out, my experience <eol> wasn't an isolated case. <eob>
A study by a US national newspaper <eol> estimated that in the United States, <eob> up to 30 percent of all surgical procedures -- <eob> including stent and pacemaker implantations, <eob> hip replacements and uterus removals -- <eob> were conducted <eob> although other nonsurgical treatment options had not been fully exploited <eob> by the physician in charge. <eob>
Isn't that figure shocking? <eob>
Numbers may be slightly <eol> different in other countries, <eob> but what it means is that if you go <eol> to a doctor in the US, <eob> you have a not-insignificant chance <eol> to be subjected to a surgical intervention <eob> without there being an immediate <eol> need for it. <eob> Why is this? <eob> Why are some practitioners incentivized <eol> to run such unnecessary procedures? <eob>
Well, perhaps it is because health care <eol> systems themselves <eob> incentivize in a nonideal way <eob> towards applying or not applying <eol> certain procedures or treatments. <eob>
As most health care systems reimburse practitioners <eob> in a fee-for-service-based fashion <eob> on the number and kind of treatments performed, <eob> it may be this economic incentive <eol> that tempts some practitioners <eob> to rather perform high-profit surgical treatments <eob> instead of exploring other treatment options. <eob>
Although certain countries started to implement <eob> performance-based reimbursement, <eob> anchored on a quality <eol> and efficacy matrix, <eob> overall, there's very little in today's health care <eol> systems' architecture <eob> to incentivize practitioners broadly <eob> to actively prevent the appearance <eol> of a disease in the first place <eob> and to limit the procedures applied to a patient <eob> to the most effective options. <eob>
So how do we fix this? <eob> What it may take is a fundamental redesign <eob> of our health care system's architecture -- <eob> a complete rethinking of the incentive structure. <eob>
What we may need is a health care system <eob> that reimburses practitioners <eol> for keeping their customers healthy <eob> instead of almost only paying for services <eol> once people are already sick. <eob>
What we may need is a transformation <eob> from today's system <eol> that largely cares for the sick, <eob> to a system that cares <eol> for the healthy. <eob>
To change our current "sick care" approach <eob> into a true "health care" approach. <eob>
It is a paradigm shift from treating <eol> people once they have become sick <eob> to preserving the health of the healthy <eol> before they get sick. <eob>
This shift may move the focus <eol> of all those involved — <eob> from doctors, to hospitals, <eol> to pharmaceutical and medical companies — <eob> on the product that this industry <eol> ultimately sells: <eob> health. <eob>
Imagine the following. <eob> What if we redesign our health care system <eob> into one that does not reimburse practitioners <eob> for the actual procedures performed on a patient <eob> but rather reimburses doctors, hospitals, <eob> pharmaceutical and medical companies <eob> for every day a single individual is kept healthy <eob> and doesn't develop a disease? <eob>
for every day a single individual is kept healthy <eob> and doesn't develop a disease? <eob> In practical terms, we could, for example, <eob> use public money to pay a health fee <eol> to an insurance company <eob> or doesn't require any other form <eol> of acute medical intervention. <eob>
If the individual becomes sick, <eob> the insurance company <eol> will not receive any further monetary compensation <eob> for the medical interventions required <eol> to treat the disease of that individual, <eob> but they would be obliged to pay <eol> for every evidence-based treatment option <eob> to return the customer back to <eob> health. <eob>
Once the customer's healthy again, <eob> the health fee for that individual <eol> will be paid again. <eob>
In effect, all players in the system <eob> are now responsible for keeping <eol> their customers healthy, <eob> and they're incentivized to avoid <eol> any unnecessary medical interventions <eob> by simply reducing the number of people <eol> that eventually become sick. <eob>
The more healthy people there are, <eob> the less the cost to treat <eol> the sick will be, <eob> and the higher the economic benefit <eol> for all parties being involved <eob> in keeping these individuals healthy is. <eob>
This change of the incentive structure <eol> shifts, now, <eob> the attention of the complete health care system <eob> away from providing isolated <eol> and singular treatment options, <eob> towards a holistic view of what is useful <eob> for an individual to stay <eol> healthy and live long. <eob>
Now, to effectively preserve health, <eob> people will need to be willing <eol> to share their health data <eob> on a constant basis, <eob> so that the health care system <eol> understands early enough <eob> if any assistance with regard <eol> to their health is needed. <eob>
Physical examination, <eob> monitoring of lifetime health data <eob> as well as genetic sequencing, <eol> cardiometabolic profiling <eob> and imaging-based technologies <eob> will allow customers to make, <eob> together with health coaches and general practitioners, <eob> optimal and science-guided decisions -- <eob> for their diet, their medication <eol> and their physical activity -- <eob> to diminish their unique probability <eob> to fall sick of an identified, individual high-risk disease. <eob>
Artificial intelligence-based data analysis <eob> and the miniaturization <eol> of sensor technologies <eob> are already starting to make monitoring <eol> of the individual health status possible. <eob>
Measuring cardiometabolic parameters <eol> by devices like this <eob> or the detection of circulating tumor DNA <eol> in your bloodstream <eob> early on after cancer disease onset <eob> are only two examples <eol> for such monitoring technologies. <eob>
Take cancer. <eob> One of the biggest problems in certain <eol> oncological diseases <eob> is that a large number <eol> of patients is diagnosed too late <eob> to allow them to be cured, <eob> although the drugs and treatments <eol> that could potentially have cured them <eob> are already existing today, <eob> if the disease had only been detected earlier. <eob>
New technologies allow now, <eol> based on a few milliliters of blood, <eob> to detect the presence <eol> of circulating tumor DNA <eob> and thus, the presence of cancer, <eob> early on in a really convenient manner. <eob>
The impact that this early-stage detection <eol> can have <eob> may be dramatic. <eob>
The five-year survival rate <eol> for non-small cell lung cancer <eob> when diagnosed at stage one, <eol> which is early, is 49 percent. <eob>
The same, when diagnosed at stage four, <eol> which is late, <eob> is below one percent. <eob>
Being potentially able to prevent <eol> a large number of deaths <eob> by something as simple <eol> as a blood test for circulating tumor DNA <eob> could make certain cancer types <eol> a manageable disease, <eob> as disease onset can be detected earlier <eob> and positive treatment outcomes <eol> can likely be increased. <eob>
In 2012, <eob> 50 percent of all Americans <eol> had a single chronic disease, <eob> resulting in 86 percent of the $3 trillion US health care budget <eob> being spent for treating such chronic diseases. <eob> Eighty-six percent. <eob> If new technologies <eol> allow now to reduce this 86 percent, <eob> why have health care systems <eol> not reacted and changed already? <eob>
Well, a redesign <eol> of what today is a sick care system <eob> into a true health care system <eol> that focuses on prevention <eob> and behavioral changes <eob> requires every actor in the system to change. <eob>
It requires the political willingness <eol> to shift budgets and policies <eob> towards prevention and health education <eob> to design a new set of financial <eol> and non-financial incentives. <eob>
It requires creating a regulatory framework <eob> for the gathering, <eol> using and sharing of personal health data <eob> that's at the same time stringent <eol> and sensible. <eob>
It needs doctors, hospitals, insurers, <eob> pharmaceutical and medical companies <eob> to reframe their approach and, most important, <eob> it can't happen <eol> without the willingness and motivation <eob> of individuals to change their lifestyle <eol> in a sustained way, <eob> to prioritize staying healthy, <eob> in addition to opening up for sharing the health data <eob> on a constant basis. <eob>
This change may not come overnight. <eob>
But by refocusing the incentives <eol> within the health care industry today <eob> to actively keep people healthy, <eob> we may not only be able to prevent <eol> more diseases in the first place <eob> but we may also be able to detect <eol> the onset of certain preventable diseases <eob> earlier than we do today, <eob> which will lead to longer <eol> and healthier lives for more people. <eob>
are already existing today, <eob> Most of the technologies <eol> that we need to initiate that change <eob>
But this is not a technology question. <eob>
It is primarily a question of vision <eob> and will. <eob>
Thanks a lot. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
For as long as I remember, <eol> I've loved mathematics. <eob>
Actually, it's not 100 percent true. <eob>
I've loved mathematics <eol> for all but a two-week period <eob> in senior high school. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was top of my class, <eob> and we were about to start <eol> the Extension Maths course. <eob>
I was really excited about <eol> this brand new topic coming up, <eob> complex numbers. <eob> I like complex. <eob> My teacher was priming us <eol> for the concepts <eob> with some questions about square roots. <eob>
Square of nine -- three; <eob> square of 256 -- sixteen. <eob> Too easy. <eob> Then she asked the trick question: <eob> What about the square root of negative one? <eob>
Of course, we were all over it -- <eob> "Come on, Miss! <eob>
We all know you can't take <eol> the square root of a negative." <eob> "That's true in the real world," she said. <eob> "But in the complex world, <eob> the square root of negative one <eol> is the imaginary number i." <eob>
That day, <eob> my entire mathematical world <eol> came crashing down on me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Imaginary numbers? <eob> Seriously? <eob> But mathematics is a source of truth, <eob> please don't go abstract on me. <eob>
I would have studied art <eob> if I wanted to play <eol> with imaginary numbers." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"This is Extension Maths, <eol> let's get back with our program!" <eob> She didn't, <eob> and over the next couple of weeks, <eob> I reluctantly performed meaningless calculations, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
finding imaginary solutions <eol> to quadratic equations. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But then something amazing happened. <eob>
We began finding elegant solutions <eob> to real-world problems <eol> we previously had no answers to, <eob> starting with the complex world <eol> of imaginary numbers. <eob>
So some mathematician 500 years ago <eob> decides to have some fun <eol> and make up these imaginary numbers, <eob> and because of that we can now <eol> derive these amazing identities <eob> with applications in the real world, <eob> in fields like electrical engineering. <eob> Wow! <eob> I gained a whole new level <eol> of appreciation for mathematics. <eob>
And after my brief mistrust, <eob> I was now in love with the subject <eol> more than ever. <eob>
Francis Su, the mathematician, <eol> sums it up beautifully when he says, <eob> "We study mathematics for play, <eol> for beauty, <eob> for truth, <eob> for justice and for love." <eob> But if you ask a student today, <eob> you'll probably hear a different story. <eob>
You might hear "difficult" and "boring." <eob> And they might be right about difficult. <eob>
But it's certainly not boring. <eob>
In fact, I'd say being difficult to master <eob> is part of what makes it beautiful. <eob>
Because nothing worth doing is easy. <eob>
So we need students to stick around long enough <eol> through the difficult parts <eob> to appreciate the beauty <eol> when it all ties together. <eob>
Much like I did for that brief <eol> couple of weeks in high school. <eob>
Unfortunately, our school systems -- <eob> we move students through mathematics <eol> in a lockstep process. <eob>
So those who fall a little behind <eob> find it near impossible to ever catch up <eol> and appreciate that beauty. <eob>
But why is this a problem? <eob> Why should we care? <eob>
Well today, more than ever, <eob> our world needs every citizen <eol> to be skilled in mathematics. <eob>
With the advent of artificial intelligence <eol> and automation, <eob> many of the jobs we see today <eol> will either not exist <eob> or be transformed to require less routine work <eob> and more analysis and application of expertise. <eob>
But we're not producing <eol> the extra mathematics students <eob> to fill these new roles. <eob>
This graph shows the number of students <eob> taking Standard Mathematics <eob> and Advanced Mathematics <eob> over a period of 20 years in Australia. <eob>
It's clear that while we have demand <eol> for mathematics skills rapidly increasing, <eob> supply is in steady decline. <eob>
To put things in perspective, <eob> half of the students completing <eol> high school today in Australia <eob> are not prepared to understand <eol> any argument <eob> about rates of change in data. <eob>
In this digital age <eob> where fake news can influence <eol> election results, <eob> this is very concerning. <eob>
Let me give you a concrete example. <eob> Let's take a closer look at that graph. <eob>
Can everyone see what I've done <eol> there to stress my point? <eob>
If you can't, let me show you now, <eob> with the vertical axis starting <eol> at zero, where it should be. <eob>
There, you see it now, right? <eob>
It's the exact same data <eob> but I've manipulated the representation <eol> to influence you. <eob>
And that's cool, that's my job up here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But in all seriousness, <eob> unless we do something <eob> to drastically improve <eol> student engagement with mathematics, <eob> we'll not only have a huge skills shortage crisis <eob> but a fickle population, <eob> easily manipulated by whoever <eol> can get the most air time. <eob>
So what's the solution? <eob>
There are a lot of things we have to do. <eob>
We need curriculum reform. <eob>
We need our best and brightest encouraged <eol> to become teachers. <eob>
We need to put an end <eol> to high-stakes tests <eob> and instead follow a mastery-based learning approach. <eob>
But all these things take time. <eob>
And I'm impatient. <eob>
See, I've been thinking about <eol> this for eight years now. <eob>
Ever since I left my job <eol> as a derivative trader <eob> to build a web application <eol> to help students learn mathematics. <eob>
Today, our app is used by schools <eol> across the globe. <eob>
And we're seeing big improvements <eob> for students who use <eol> the program regularly. <eob>
But here's the thing — <eob> we're only seeing it <eob> for students who use the program regularly. <eob>
And most of them don't. <eob>
So after years <eol> of developing and refining the application, <eob> our biggest challenge was not so much product related, <eob> our biggest challenge was motivating students <eob> to want to work on their gaps <eol> in understanding. <eob>
You can imagine in today's attention economy, <eob> we're competing against Facebook, <eol> Snapchat and PlayStation <eob> to try and get these students' time. <eob>
So we went back to the drawing board <eob> and started to think <eol> about how we could make it worthwhile <eob> for students to spend some <eol> of their "attention budget" <eob> on their education. <eob>
We tinkered with gamification elements <eob> like points, badges and avatars, <eob> and we'd see a temporary spike in engagement <eob> but things would go back to normal <eol> as soon as the novelty wore off. <eob>
Then one day, my cofounder, Alvin, <eob> came across a study of students in Chicago <eob> led by the behavioral economist, <eol> Steven Levitt, <eob> where they paid students who improved <eol> on their test scores. <eob>
He started telling me about <eol> some of the things they tested for <eob> and the interesting findings they had. <eob>
For instance, they found that incentivizing <eol> students for inputs, <eob> like effort, <eob> worked a lot better than incentivizing <eol> for outputs, <eob> like test scores. <eob>
They found that for younger students, <eol> you could win them over with a trophy <eob> but for older students, <eob> you really needed cash. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And the amount of cash mattered -- <eol> 10 dollars was good, <eob> 20 dollars -- even better. <eob>
But perhaps most importantly, <eob> they found that the rewards <eol> had to be instant <eob> rather than promised at a later date. <eob>
They went as far as to give <eol> the students 20 dollars and say, <eob> "Touch it, feel it, <eol> smell it --" <eob>
(Sniffing) <eob>
"It's all yours. <eob> But if you fail, <eol> I'm going to take it back." <eob> And that worked really well. <eob>
I immediately got excited <eob> about the possibilities of implementing <eol> this in our program. <eob>
But once the excitement settled down, <eob> there were a few concerns <eol> that crept in our minds. <eob>
Firstly, <eob> was this ethical? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Secondly, how would we fund this thing? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And finally, <eob> would the results be sustained <eol> if the students were no longer paid? <eob>
Now, let's look at the ethical part first. <eob>
I'm a bit of a mathematical purist. <eob>
So I'd be one of the first people <eol> to say that we should study mathematics <eob> for the sake of mathematics. <eob>
Remember — for play, for beauty, <eob> for truth, <eob> for justice and for love! <eob> Not for money! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As I struggled with this, <eol> I came to see that, <eob> while it's a way I look at mathematics now, <eob> it's only because I studied it <eol> long enough to appreciate it. <eob>
It's very difficult to tell a student <eol> struggling with mathematics today <eob> to work hard for a payoff <eol> in the distant future. <eob>
And it's not so much bribery <eol> that's at work here, <eob> because I could bribe students <eob> by telling them about my big bonuses <eol> in my derivative trading days <eob> as a reward for doing well at maths. <eob>
But it doesn't pay off <eol> for a very long time. <eob>
So it's practically naught. <eob>
Behavioral economists call <eol> this hyperbolic discounting. <eob>
And Levitt goes as far as to say <eob> that all motivating power vanishes <eob> when rewards are handed out with a delay. <eob>
So, from a purely economic point of view: <eob> if we don't use immediate incentives, <eob> we are underinvesting in student outcomes. <eob>
I took heart from that, and came <eol> to see that as a society, <eob> we're actually quite used <eol> to financial incentives. <eob>
Whether it be by the government, <eol> by employers or at home. <eob>
For instance, many parents <eol> would pay their children <eob> an allowance or pocket money <eol> for doing chores in the house. <eob>
So it wasn't really <eol> all that controversial. <eob>
As I thought about that, <eob> it started to answer that second question <eol> of how we were going to fund this. <eob>
Naturally, parents are the most invested <eol> in their children's education. <eob>
So, let's charge them a weekly <eol> subscription fee <eob> to use our program, <eob> but -- <eob> if the students complete <eol> their weekly maths goal, <eob> we'll refund the subscription amount directly <eol> into the child's bank account. <eob>
We chose three exercises completed <eob> over a one week period <eob> for a 10 dollar reward. <eob>
That way we're incentivizing effort <eol> rather than performance <eob> over a short enough period <eob> and with a substantial enough payout <eol> for the students to care. <eob>
Now, I remember when I first told <eol> my wife about this new business model. <eob>
If she had any doubt left <eol> that I've gone completely mad, <eob> that pretty much confirmed it for her. <eob>
She said to me, "Mo ... <eob> you realize that if everybody does <eol> their homework, which you want, <eob> you're not going to make <eol> any revenue, which you don't want. <eob>
Great business model." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I say it's more like <eol> an antibusiness model, <eob> it's free if you use it, <eol> but you pay if you don't. <eob> Now, I knew from experience <eob> that not everybody in the country <eol> was going to jump on <eob> and do their maths homework every week. <eob>
And if they did, sure we'd go <eol> bust pretty quickly, <eob> but hey, we would have solved <eol> the country's maths skills crisis. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As a company, we've always run <eol> a double bottom line, <eob> looking to both make a return for investors <eob> as well as improve student outcomes. <eob>
We know that our path <eol> to long-term profitability <eob> is through improving student outcomes. <eob>
So our dual objectives <eol> should never be at odds. <eob>
So we're always looking <eob> to make our product decisions <eob> around helping students <eol> reach their weekly maths goal, <eob> effectively ensuring that they get paid <eob> and not us. <eob>
Now you must be wondering: How is <eol> this crazy business model going? <eob>
You'll be glad to know <eol> we're still in business. <eob>
We've been testing this now <eol> for the last five months <eob> on just our personal home users in Australia <eob> before we think about rolling it <eol> out to schools. <eob>
And here are the early results. <eob>
The green represents students <eol> who are completing their weekly maths goal <eob> and the red those who aren't. <eob>
You can see a lot more completing <eol> their homework than not. <eob>
In fact, as our user base has grown, <eob> we found the percentage <eol> to be pretty steady, at around 75 percent. <eob>
So on average, we receive our weekly <eol> subscription fee <eob> once every four weeks, <eob> and the other three weeks, <eol> we're rewarding the students. <eob>
Now of course we're leaving <eol> some money on the table here, <eob> but guess what? <eob>
It turns out these students <eob> are 70 percent more engaged <eol> than students not on the reward program. <eob> Check. <eob>
From a business perspective, <eob> they are less likely to churn <eob> and more likely to refer friends, <eob> so we're hoping <eol> to trade off a lower revenue per user <eob> for a bigger and more engaged user base. <eob> Check and check. <eob>
Now for that final question. <eob>
Would they keep coming back <eol> if they were no longer paid? <eob>
Mathematics is so much more <eol> than just a subject you study at school. <eob>
It's a human endeavor. <eob>
It's what helps us to understand <eol> the world around us. <eob>
And the more you know, <eol> the more you want to know. <eob>
So yes, we've triggered initial engagement <eob> with a financial reward. <eob>
But in the long run, <eob> the money won't matter anymore. <eob>
Because in the long run, <eob> the wonder of mathematics <eol> will be the incentive <eob> and understanding it <eob> will be the reward. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
At some point in our lives, <eob> almost every one of us <eol> will have our heart broken. <eob>
My patient Kathy planned her <eol> wedding when she was in middle school. <eob>
She would meet her future husband <eob> by age 27, <eob> get engaged a year later <eob> and get married a year after that. <eob>
But when Kathy turned 27, <eol> she didn't find a husband. <eob>
She found a lump in her breast. <eob>
She went through many months <eol> of harsh chemotherapy <eob> and painful surgeries, <eob> and then just as she was ready to jump back <eol> into the dating world, <eob> she found a lump in her other breast <eob> and had to do it all over again. <eob>
Kathy recovered, though, <eob> and she was eager to resume <eol> her search for a husband <eob> as soon as her eyebrows <eol> grew back in. <eob>
When you're going on first <eol> dates in New York City, <eob> you need to be able to express <eol> a wide range of emotions. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Soon afterwards, she met <eol> Rich and fell in love. <eob>
The relationship was everything <eol> she hoped it would be. <eob>
Six months later, <eob> after a lovely weekend <eol> in New England, <eob> Rich made reservations <eol> at their favorite romantic restaurant. <eob>
Kathy knew he was going to propose, <eob> and she could barely contain her excitement. <eob>
But Rich did not propose <eol> to Kathy that night. <eob>
He broke up with her. <eob>
As deeply as he cared <eol> for Kathy -- and he did -- <eob> he simply wasn't in love. <eob>
Kathy was shattered. <eob> Her heart was truly broken, <eol> and she now faced yet another recovery. <eob>
But five months after the breakup, <eob> Kathy still couldn't stop <eol> thinking about Rich. <eob>
Her heart was still very much broken. <eob>
The question is: <eob> Why? <eob>
Why was this incredibly strong <eol> and determined woman <eob> unable to marshal the same emotional resources <eob> that got her through four years of cancer treatments? <eob>
Why do so many of us flounder <eob> when we're trying to recover <eol> from heartbreak? <eob>
Why do the same coping mechanisms <eob> that get us through <eol> all kinds of life challenges <eob> fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken? <eob>
In over 20 years of private practice, <eob> I have seen people of every age <eol> and background <eob> face every manner of heartbreak, <eob> and what I've learned is this: <eob> when your heart is broken, <eob> the same instincts you ordinarily rely on <eob> will time and again lead you <eol> down the wrong path. <eob>
You simply cannot trust <eol> what your mind is telling you. <eob>
For example, we know <eol> from studies of heartbroken people <eob> that having a clear understanding <eol> of why the relationship ended <eob> is really important <eol> for our ability to move on. <eob>
Yet time and again, <eob> when we are offered a simple <eol> and honest explanation <eob> like the one Rich offered Kathy, <eob> we reject it. <eob>
Heartbreak creates such <eol> dramatic emotional pain, <eob> our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic. <eob>
And that gut instinct is so powerful, <eob> it can make even the most reasonable <eol> and measured of us <eob> come up with mysteries and conspiracy <eol> theories <eob> where none exist. <eob>
Kathy became convinced something <eol> must have happened <eob> during her romantic getaway with Rich <eob> that soured him on the relationship, <eob> and she became obsessed with figuring out <eol> what that was. <eob>
And so she spent countless hours <eob> going through every minute <eol> of that weekend in her mind, <eob> searching her memory for clues <eol> that were not there. <eob>
Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating <eol> this wild goose chase. <eob>
But what compelled her to commit <eol> to it for so many months? <eob>
Heartbreak is far more <eol> insidious than we realize. <eob>
There is a reason we keep going <eol> down one rabbit hole after another, <eob> even when we know it's going <eol> to make us feel worse. <eob>
Brain studies have shown <eob> that the withdrawal of romantic love <eob> activates the same mechanisms <eol> in our brain that get activated <eob> when addicts are withdrawing <eol> from substances like cocaine or opioids. <eob>
Kathy was going through withdrawal. <eob>
And since she could not have the heroin <eol> of actually being with Rich, <eob> her unconscious mind chose the methadone <eol> of her memories with him. <eob>
Her instincts told her she was trying <eol> to solve a mystery, <eob> but what she was actually doing <eob> was getting her fix. <eob>
This is what makes heartbreak <eol> so difficult to heal. <eob>
Addicts know they're addicted. <eob>
They know when they're shooting up. <eob>
But heartbroken people do not. <eob>
But you do now. <eob>
And if your heart is broken, <eol> you cannot ignore that. <eob>
You have to recognize that, <eol> as compelling as the urge is, <eob> with every trip down memory lane, <eol> every text you send, <eob> every second you spend stalking <eol> your ex on social media, <eob> you are just feeding your addiction, <eob> deepening your emotional pain <eob> and complicating your recovery. <eob>
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. <eob>
It's a fight, and your reason <eol> is your strongest weapon. <eob>
There is no breakup explanation <eol> that's going to feel satisfying. <eob>
No rationale can take away the pain <eol> you feel. <eob>
So don't search for one, <eol> don't wait for one, <eob> just accept the one you were offered <eol> or make up one yourself <eob> and then put the question to rest, <eob> because you need that closure <eol> to resist the addiction. <eob>
And you need something else as well: <eob> you have to be willing to let go, <eob> to accept that it's over. <eob>
Otherwise, your mind <eol> will feed on your hope <eob> and set you back. <eob>
Hope can be incredibly destructive <eob> when your heart is broken. <eob>
Heartbreak is a master manipulator. <eob>
The ease with which it gets our mind <eol> to do the absolute opposite <eob> of what we need in order to recover <eob> is remarkable. <eob>
One of the most common tendencies <eol> we have when our heart is broken <eob> is to idealize the person <eol> who broke it. <eob>
We spend hours remembering their smile, <eob> how great they made us feel, <eob> that time we hiked up the mountain <eol> and made love under the stars. <eob>
All that does is make our loss <eol> feel more painful. <eob> We know that. <eob> Yet we still allow our mind to cycle <eol> through one greatest hit after another, <eob> like we were being held hostage <eol> by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Heartbreak will make those thoughts <eol> pop into your mind. <eob>
And so to avoid idealizing, <eol> you have to balance them out <eob> by remembering their frown, <eol> not just their smile, <eob> how bad they made you feel, <eob> the fact that after the lovemaking, <eol> you got lost coming down the mountain, <eob> argued like crazy and didn't speak for two days. <eob>
What I tell my patients is to compile <eol> an exhaustive list <eob> of all the ways the person <eol> was wrong for you, <eob> all the bad qualities, <eol> all the pet peeves, <eob> and then keep it on your phone. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And once you have your list, <eob> you have to use it. <eob>
When I hear even a hint <eol> of idealizing <eob> or the faintest whiff <eol> of nostalgia in a session, <eob> I go, "Phone, please." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Your mind will try to tell you <eol> they were perfect. <eob>
But they were not, <eol> and neither was the relationship. <eob>
And if you want to get over them, <eol> you have to remind yourself of that, <eob> frequently. <eob>
None of us is immune to heartbreak. <eob>
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old <eol> senior executive in a software company. <eob>
Five years after his wife died, <eob> he finally felt ready to start <eol> dating again. <eob>
He soon met Sharon, <eob> and a whirlwind romance ensued. <eob>
They introduced each other <eol> to their adult children after one month, <eob> and they moved in together after two. <eob>
When middle-aged people date, <eol> they don't mess around. <eob>
It's like "Love, Actually" meets <eol> "The Fast and the Furious." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Miguel was happier than he had <eol> been in years. <eob>
But the night <eol> before their first anniversary, <eob> Sharon left him. <eob>
She had decided to move <eol> to the West Coast to be closer to her children, <eob> and she didn't want a long-distance relationship. <eob>
Miguel was totally blindsided <eol> and utterly devastated. <eob>
He barely functioned at work <eol> for many, many months, <eob> and he almost lost his job as a result. <eob>
Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling <eol> alone and in pain <eob> can significantly impair our intellectual functioning, <eob> especially when performing complex <eol> tasks involving logic and reasoning. <eob>
It temporarily lowers our IQ. <eob>
But it wasn't just <eol> the intensity of Miguel's grief <eob> that confused his employers; <eob> it was the duration. <eob>
Miguel was confused <eol> by this as well <eob> and really quite embarrassed by it. <eob> "What's wrong with me?" <eol> he asked me in our session. <eob> "What adult spends almost a year <eol> getting over a one-year relationship?" <eob> Actually, many do. <eob>
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks <eol> of traditional loss and grief: <eob> insomnia, intrusive thoughts, <eob> immune system dysfunction. <eob>
Forty percent of people <eol> experience clinically measurable depression. <eob>
Heartbreak is a complex <eol> psychological injury. <eob>
It impacts us in a multitude of ways. <eob>
For example, Sharon was both very social <eob> and very active. <eob>
She had dinners at the house every week. <eob>
She and Miguel went on camping <eol> trips with other couples. <eob>
Although Miguel was not religious, <eob> he accompanied Sharon <eol> to church every Sunday, <eob> where he was welcomed into the congregation. <eob>
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; <eob> he lost his entire social life, <eob> the supportive community of Sharon's church. <eob>
He lost his identity as a couple. <eob>
Now, Miguel recognized <eol> the breakup had left this huge void in his life, <eob> but what he failed to recognize <eob> is that it left far more than just one. <eob>
And that is crucial, <eob> not just because it explains <eol> why heartbreak could be so devastating, <eob> but because it tells us how to heal. <eob>
To fix your broken heart, <eob> you have to identify these voids <eol> in your life and fill them, <eob> and I mean all of them. <eob>
The voids in your identity: <eob> you have to reestablish who you <eol> are and what your life is about. <eob>
The voids in your social life, <eob> the missing activities, <eol> even the empty spaces on the wall <eob> where pictures used to hang. <eob>
But none of that will do any good <eob> unless you prevent the mistakes <eol> that can set you back, <eob> the unnecessary searches <eol> for explanations, <eob> idealizing your ex instead <eol> of focusing on how they were wrong for you, <eob> indulging thoughts and behaviors <eol> that still give them a starring role <eob> in this next chapter of your life <eob> when they shouldn't be an extra. <eob>
Getting over heartbreak is hard, <eob> but if you refuse to be misled by your mind <eol> and you take steps to heal, <eob> you can significantly minimize your suffering. <eob>
And it won't just be <eol> you who benefit from that. <eob>
You'll be more present with your friends, <eob> more engaged with your family, <eob> not to mention the billions <eol> of dollars of compromised productivity <eob> in the workplace <eol> that could be avoided. <eob>
So if you know someone <eol> who is heartbroken, <eob> have compassion, <eob> because social support has been found <eol> to be important for their recovery. <eob>
And have patience, <eob> because it's going to take them longer <eol> to move on than you think it should. <eob>
And if you're hurting, <eob> know this: <eob> it's difficult, it is a battle <eol> within your own mind, <eob> and you have to be diligent to win. <eob>
But you do have weapons. <eob> You can fight. <eob> And you will heal. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
For me, it was not being invited <eol> to a friend's wedding. <eob>
At first, I didn't really mind. <eob>
I thought he was having a small reception. <eob>
But then I kept meeting people <eol> who were going to the same wedding, <eob> and they weren't as close to the groom <eol> as I was ... <eob> and I felt left out. <eob> That really sucked. <eob> It felt really unfair. <eob>
For my daughters, Lipsi and Greta, <eol> it was last week. <eob>
They were taking turns massaging their mom's back <eob> with a toy for back rubs, <eob> and then one of the girls felt <eol> that the other girl had a longer go. <eob>
That's when I walk into the room <eob> to find Greta in a rage, shouting, <eol> "That's not fair!" <eob> and Lipsi in tears, <eob> and my wife holding a stopwatch <eob> to make sure that each girl had precisely <eol> one minute on the toy. <eob>
So if you're anything like me or my girls, <eob> the last thing that upset you <eob> probably also had to do with unfairness. <eob>
That's because unfairness <eol> triggers us so strongly <eob> that we can't think straight. <eob>
We become afraid and suspicious. <eob>
Our unfairness antennae stick up. <eob>
We feel pain, and we walk away. <eob>
Unfairness is one of the defining <eol> issues of our society, <eob> it's one of the root causes of polarization, <eob> and it's bad news for business. <eob>
At work, unfairness makes <eol> people defensive and disengaged. <eob>
A study shows that 70 percent <eol> of workers in the US are disengaged, <eob> and this is costing the companies <eob> 550 billion dollars a year every year. <eob>
This is, like, half the total spent <eol> on education in the US. <eob> This is the size of the GDP <eol> of a country like Austria. <eob>
So removing unfairness <eol> and promoting fairness <eob> should be our priority. <eob>
But what does it mean in practice? <eob>
Is it about more rules? Is it about systems? <eob> Is it about equality? <eob> Well, partly, but fairness is more interesting <eol> than rules and equality. <eob>
Fairness works in surprising ways. <eob>
15 years ago, I left a US investment bank <eob> to join a large Italian state-owned oil company. <eob>
It was a different world. <eob>
I thought the key <eol> to getting the best performance <eob> was a risk-reward system <eob> where you could give the high <eol> performers bonuses and promotions <eob> and give the underperformers something <eol> to worry about. <eob>
But in this company, we had fixed salaries <eob> and lifelong jobs. <eob>
Careers were set, <eob> so my toolkit wasn't very effective, <eob> and I was frustrated. <eob>
But then I saw that this company <eol> was producing some pockets of excellence, <eob> areas in which they beat the competition <eob> in very tough, competitive sectors. <eob>
This was true in trading, <eob> in project management -- <eob> it was very true in exploration. <eob>
Our exploration team was finding more oil and gas <eob> than any other company in the world. <eob> It was a phenomenon. <eob> Everyone was trying to figure out <eol> how this was possible. <eob>
I thought it was luck, <eob> but after each new discovery, <eol> that became less and less likely. <eob>
So did we have a special tools No. <eob> Did we have a killer application <eol> that no one else had? No. <eob> Was it one genius who was <eol> finding oil for the whole team? <eob>
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years. <eob>
So what was our secret sauce? <eob>
I started looking at them <eol> really carefully. <eob>
I looked at my friend, <eob> who drilled seven dry wells, <eob> writing off more <eol> than a billion dollars for the company, <eob> and found oil on the eighth. <eob>
I was nervous for him ... <eob> but he was so relaxed. <eob>
I mean, these guys knew <eol> what they were doing. <eob>
And then it hit me: it was about fairness. <eob>
These guys were working in a company <eob> where they didn't need to worry <eol> about short-term results. <eob>
They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck <eol> or for an honest mistake. <eob>
They knew they were valued <eol> for what they were trying to do, <eob> not the outcome. <eob>
They were valued as human beings. <eol> They were part of a community. <eob>
Whatever happened, <eol> the company would stand by them. <eob>
And for me, this <eol> is the definition of fairness. <eob>
It's when you can lower those unfairness <eol> antennae, put them at rest. <eob> Then great things follow. <eob>
These guys could be true to their purpose, <eol> which was finding oil and gas. <eob>
They didn't have to worry <eol> about company politics or greed or fear. <eob>
They could be good risk-takers, <eob> because they weren't too defensive <eob> and they weren't gambling <eol> to take huge rewards. <eob>
And they were excellent team workers. <eob>
They could trust their colleagues. <eob>
They didn't need to look <eol> behind their backs. <eob>
And they were basically having fun. <eob>
They were having so much fun, <eob> one guy even confessed <eob> that he was having more fun <eol> at the company Christmas dinner <eob> than at his own Christmas dinner. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But these guys, essentially, <eol> were working in a fair system <eob> where they could do <eol> what they felt was right <eob> instead of what's selfish, <eol> what's quick, what's convenient, <eob> and to be able to do <eol> what we feel is right <eob> is a key ingredient for fairness, <eol> but it is also a great motivator. <eob>
And it wasn't just explorers <eol> who were doing the right thing. <eob>
There was an HR director who proposed <eol> that I hire someone internally <eob> and give him a managerial job. <eob>
This guy was very good, <eol> but he didn't finish high school, <eob> so formally, he had no qualifications. <eob>
But he was so good, it made sense, <eol> and so we gave him the job. <eob>
Or the other guy, who asked me <eol> for a budget to build a cheese factory <eob> next to our plant in Ecuador, in the village. <eob>
It didn't make any sense: <eol> no one ever built a cheese factory. <eob>
But this is what the village <eol> wanted, because the milk they had would spoil <eob> before they could sell it, <eol> so that's what they needed. <eob>
And so we built it. <eob>
So in these examples and many others, <eob> I learned that to be fair, <eob> my colleagues and I, we needed to take <eol> a risk and stick our head out, <eob> but in a fair system, you can do that. <eob>
You can dare to be fair. <eob>
So I realized that these guys and other colleagues <eob> were achieving great results, <eol> doing great things, <eob> in a way that no bonus could buy. <eob> So I was fascinated. <eob> I wanted to learn how this thing really worked, <eob> and I wanted to learn it also for myself, <eol> to become a better leader. <eob>
So I started talking <eol> to colleagues, to coaches, <eob> to headhunters and neuroscientists, <eob> and what I discovered <eob> is that what these guys were up <eol> to and the way they worked <eob> is really supported by recent brain science. <eob>
And I've also discovered <eol> that this can work at all levels <eob> in any type of company. <eob>
You don't need the fixed <eol> salaries or the stable careers. <eob>
This is because science shows <eob> that humans have an innate <eol> sense of fairness. <eob>
We know what is right and what is wrong <eob> before we can talk or think about it. <eob>
My favorite experiment <eob> has six-month old babies <eob> watching a ball trying to struggle <eol> up a hill. <eob>
And there's a helpful, friendly <eol> square that pushes the ball up the hill, <eob> and then a mean triangle <eol> pushes the ball back down. <eob>
After watching this several times, <eob> they ask the babies to pick, <eob> to choose what to play with. <eob>
They can pick a ball, <eol> a square or a triangle. <eob>
They never pick up the triangle. <eob>
All the babies want to be the square. <eob>
And science also shows <eob> that when we see <eol> or perceive fairness, <eob> our brain releases a substance <eol> that gives us pleasure, <eob> proper joy. <eob>
But when we perceive unfairness, <eol> we feel pain ... <eob> even greater pain <eob> than the same type of pain <eol> as if I really hurt myself. <eob>
That's because unfairness triggers <eol> the primitive, reptile part of our brain, <eob> the part that deals <eol> with threats and survival, <eob> and when unfairness triggers a threat, <eol> that's all we can think about. <eob>
Motivation, creativity, teamwork, <eob> they all go way back. <eob>
And it makes sense <eol> that we're wired this way, <eob> because we're social animals. <eob>
We need to be part <eol> of a community to survive. <eob>
We're born so helpless <eob> that someone needs to look after us <eol> until we're maybe 10 years old, <eob> so our brain evolves towards food. <eob>
We need to be in that community. <eob>
So whether I like it or not, <eob> not being invited to the friend's wedding, <eob> my lizard brain is generating the same response <eob> as if I'm about to be pushed out <eol> from my community. <eob>
So science explains quite nicely <eol> why fairness is good <eob> and why unfairness makes us really defensive, <eob> but science also shows <eol> that in a fair environment, <eob> not only do we all want to be the square, <eob> but we tend to be the square, <eob> and this allows other people to be fair in turn. <eob>
This creates a beautiful fairness circle. <eob>
But while we start off fair ... <eob> one drop of unfairness <eol> contaminates the whole pool, <eob> and unfortunately, there's plenty of drops <eol> in that pool. <eob>
So our effort should be to filter out <eob> as much unfairness <eol> as we can from everywhere, <eob> starting from our communities, <eol> starting from our companies. <eob>
I worry about this a lot because I lead <eol> a team of 3,000 excellent people, <eob> and the difference between 3,000 happy, <eol> motivated team workers <eob> and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything. <eob>
So the first thing I try to do <eol> in my fairness crusade <eob> is to try to take myself <eol> out of the equation. <eob>
That means being aware of my own biases. <eob>
For example, I really like <eol> people who say yes <eob> to whatever I suggest. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But that's not very good for the company <eob> and not very good for anyone <eol> who has different ideas. <eob>
So we try to actively <eol> promote a culture of diversity of opinions <eob> and diversity of character. <eob>
The second thing we do <eol> is a little more procedural. <eob>
We look at all the rules, <eol> the processes, the systems in the company, <eob> the ones we use to take decisions <eol> and allocate resources, <eob> and we try to get rid of anything <eol> that's not very clear, <eob> not very rational, <eol> doesn't make sense, <eob> and we also try to fix anything that's limiting <eob> the transfer of information within the company. <eob>
We then look at the culture <eol> and the motivation for the same reasons. <eob>
But my point is that however hard <eol> you look at the rules, <eob> the processes, the systems -- <eol> and we have to do that -- <eob> but however hard we look, <eob> we're never going to do enough to get to the real essence of fairness. <eob>
That's because the last mile of fairness <eol> requires something else. <eob> It's about what people's emotions are, <eob> what their needs are, <eob> what's going on in their private lives, <eob> what society needs. <eob>
These are all questions and elements <eob> that are very hard to put <eol> into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm. <eob>
It's very hard to make them part <eol> of our rational decision. <eob>
But if we miss these, <eol> we're missing key important points, <eob> and the outcome is likely <eol> to feel unfair. <eob>
So we should cross-check <eol> our decisions with our fairness center switched on. <eob>
Is it right that this guy should get <eol> the job he's really hoping to get? <eob>
Is it right that this guy should be fired? <eob>
Is it right that we should be charging <eol> so much for this product? <eob>
These are tough questions. <eob>
But if we take the time to ask ourselves <eob> whether the rational answer <eol> is the right one ... <eob> we all know deep inside what the answer is. <eob>
We've known since we were babies. <eob>
And to know what the right answer is <eob> is pretty cool for decision-making. <eob>
And if we turn on our hearts, <eob> that's the key to getting <eol> the real best out of people, <eob> because they can smell it if you care, <eob> and only when you really care <eol> will they leave their fears behind <eob> and bring their true selves to work. <eob>
So if fairness is a keystone of life, <eob> why isn't every leader making it <eol> their priority? <eob>
Wouldn't it be cool to work <eol> in a company that was more fair? <eob>
Wouldn't it be great <eol> to have colleagues and bosses <eob> that were selected and trained for fairness <eol> and for character <eob> and not based on 60-year-old GMATs? <eob>
Wouldn't it be nice <eol> to be able to knock on the door <eob> of a Chief Fairness Officer? <eob>
We'll get there, but why is it <eol> not happening now? <eob>
Well, partly, it's because <eol> of inertia, <eob> partly, it's because fairness <eol> isn't always easy. <eob>
It requires judgment and risk. <eob>
Drilling that eighth well was a risk. <eob>
Promoting the guy who didn't finish <eol> high school was a risk. <eob>
Building a cheese factory <eol> in Ecuador was a risk. <eob>
But fairness is a risk worth taking, <eob> so we should be asking ourselves, <eob> where can we take this risk? <eob>
Where can we push ourselves <eol> a little bit further, <eob> to go beyond what's rational <eol> and do what's right? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, what is capitalism? <eob> Capitalism, fundamentally, <eol> is a series of marketplaces. <eob>
You can have a marketplace <eol> for lemonade, <eob> a marketplace for lemons, <eob> a marketplace for trucks <eol> that transport lemons, <eob> a marketplace that fuels those trucks, <eob> marketplaces that sell wood <eol> to build lemonade stands. <eob>
However, capitalism of course, as we know, <eob> is this either celebrated term <eob> or condemned term. <eob>
It's either revered or it's reviled. <eob>
And I'm here to argue <eol> that this is because capitalism, <eob> in the modern iteration, <eol> is largely misunderstood. <eob>
In my view, <eob> capitalism should not be thought <eol> of as an ideology, <eob> but instead should be thought <eol> of as an operating system. <eob>
Think of your iPhone. <eob>
Your iPhone merges hardware <eol> with software. <eob> Apps and hardware. <eob> Now think about all the hardware <eol> as the physical reality all around you, <eob> and think of the apps <eol> as entrepreneurial activity, <eob> creative energy. <eob>
And in-between, you have <eol> an operating system. <eob>
As you have advances in hardware, <eob> you have advances in software. <eob>
And the operating system needs to keep up. <eob> It needs to be patched, <eol> it needs to be updated, <eob> new releases have to happen. <eob>
And all of these things have to happen <eol> symbiotically. <eob>
The operating system needs to keep getting <eol> more and more advanced <eob> to keep up with innovation. <eob>
And this is why, fundamentally, <eob> when you think about it <eol> as an operating system, <eob> it devolves the language <eol> of ideology <eob> away from what traditional <eol> defenders of capitalism think. <eob>
But even if you go to the constitution, <eob> you'll notice, before the founders <eol> even got to the First Amendment — <eob> with free speech, free religion, free press, <eob> they thought about patents <eol> and copyright. <eob>
They talked about the government's role <eol> in promoting arts and sciences. <eob>
It's the reason why I could not <eol> start a search engine tomorrow called Goggle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Google doesn't own Gs, <eob> but I couldn't do it because <eol> there could be some confusion. <eob>
So even property rights have <eol> ambiguity built into them. <eob>
And on and on. <eob>
And by 1900, you have other types <eol> of property that come into being. <eob>
For instance, imagine that in 1900, <eol> you owned 100 acres of land <eob> someplace in the Midwest. <eob>
It's very easy to see <eol> where your fence ends, <eob> your neighbor's property begins. <eob>
Now let me ask you, <eob> where in the sky does your property end? <eob>
Does it end at 1,000 feet, <eob> 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet? <eob>
It makes no difference, <eob> because other than the novelty <eol> of a few hot-air balloons, <eob> man couldn't fly. <eob>
But within three years, he could. <eob>
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet? <eob> Now all of a sudden, it was very much relevant <eob> whether your land ends at 1,000 <eol> feet in the sky, <eob>
And you have to have <eol> someone arbitrate that. <eob>
And indeed, that's exactly what happened. <eob>
And five or ten years from now, <eob> when Amazon wants to deliver a package <eol> over your house to your neighbor <eob> from that UPS truck, <eob> we're going to have to decide: <eol> Does you property end at five feet, <eob> 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet? <eob> Where does it end? <eob> And there is no ideology <eob> that will tell you where your property ends. <eob>
It's an operating system. <eob>
And similarly, <eob> we're going to see this with automobiles. <eob>
A few years after the Wright brothers <eol> figured out flight, <eob> human beings started using more <eol> and more cars. <eob>
And all of a sudden, <eob> the regulatory system -- the operating system -- <eob> had to be patched to all of a sudden <eol> address the safety of consumers. <eob>
That the consumers of vehicles <eol> were presenting danger to horses, <eob> other pedestrians, <eol> trolleys, what have you. <eob>
And all of a sudden, <eob> the drivers of these automobiles <eol> had to have driver's licenses, eye exams, <eob> registered motor vehicles, speed limits, <eob> rules of the road, <eob> so that horses, pedestrians, <eol> could coexist with cars. <eob>
It had to be backwards compatible. <eob>
So a new invention had to basically <eol> fit advances from the past. <eob>
Similarly, five or ten years from now, <eob> we're going to see the same thing <eol> with self-driving cars -- <eob> coexisting with human-driven cars. <eob>
The reason why this is important, <eol> is in 10 years, <eob> another thing is going to happen <eol> beyond drones and self-driving cars, <eob> but you're going to see <eol> the most valuable economy in the world -- <eob> the largest economy in the world -- <eob> is going to be a country run by communists. <eob>
The Chinese seem to be <eol> very good at capitalism. <eob>
And this is going to have fundamental problems <eob> and present an identity crisis <eol> for the United States. <eob>
Because for a long time, <eob> free markets coincided <eol> with liberties such as free speech, free press, <eob> free religion. <eob>
And all of a sudden, <eob> this equation is going to be decoupled. <eob>
And when it gets decoupled, <eob> we might find that democracy, <eol> the multitude of voices, <eob> actually impedes capitalism <eob> because a state that does not have <eol> any pretense of limited government <eob> can very quickly mandate <eol> a regulatory framework for drones, <eob> for electric cars, <eol> for self-driving cars, <eob> for any new innovation <eob> where they feel that they can leapfrog <eol> Western societies. <eob>
And this is a very unique thing <eol> in the American experience. <eob>
And this is why it's very important <eol> to think of American capitalism <eob> as an operating system and not <eol> as an ideology. <eob>
Because when you think <eol> about it as an ideology, <eob> you can have good politics make <eol> for very, very bad policy. <eob>
That market outcomes and democratic voices <eob> and battles for votes <eob> can end up stifling progress. <eob>
So over the next few years, <eob> as this political cycle plays out, <eob> you're going to see American democracy <eob> rise to meet the challenges that capitalism <eol> poses and modernity poses. <eob>
And I ask policymakers to think about -- <eob> decoupling ideology <eol> from economics, <eob> and think about how good policy <eol> can ultimately become good politics. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A few years ago, I found myself <eob> looking for the most cost-effective <eol> way to be stylish. <eob>
So naturally, I wound up <eol> at my local thrift store, <eob> a wonderland of other people's trash <eob> that was ripe to be plucked <eol> to become my treasure. <eob>
Now, I wasn't just looking <eol> for your average <eob> off-the-secondhand-rack vintage T-shirt to wear. <eob>
For me, real style lives <eol> at the intersection of design <eob> and individuality. <eob>
So to make sure that I was getting <eol> the most out of the things I was finding, <eob> I bought a sewing machine <eob> so I could tailor the 90's-style garments <eol> that I was finding, <eob> to fit a more contemporary aesthetic. <eob>
I've been tailoring and making <eol> my own clothes from scratch ever since, <eob> so everything in my closet <eol> is uniquely my own. <eob>
But as I was sorting <eol> through the endless racks of clothes at these thrift stores, <eob> I started to ask myself, <eob> what happens to all the clothes <eol> that I don't buy? <eob>
The stuff that isn't really cool or trendy <eob> but kind of just sits there <eol> and rots away at these secondhand stores. <eob>
I work in the fashion industry <eol> on the wholesale side, <eob> and I started to see some <eol> of the products that we sell <eob> end up on the racks <eol> of these thrift stores. <eob>
So the question started to work <eol> its way into my work life, as well. <eob>
I did some research <eob> and I pretty quickly found <eol> a very scary supply chain <eob> that led me to some <eol> pretty troubling realities. <eob>
It turned out that the clothes <eol> I was sorting though <eob> at these thrift stores <eob> represented only a small fraction <eol> of the total amount of garments <eob> that we dispose of each year. <eob>
In the US, only 15 percent <eol> of the total textile and garment waste <eob> that's generated each year <eob> ends up being donated <eol> or recycled in some way, <eob> which means that the other <eol> 85 percent of textile and garment waste <eob> end up in landfills every year. <eob>
Now, I want to put this <eol> into perspective, <eob> because I don't quite think <eob> that the 85 percent does the problem justice. <eob>
This means that almost 13 million tons <eol> of clothing and textile waste <eob> end up in landfills every year <eob> in just the United States alone. <eob> This averages out to be roughly <eol> 200 T-shirts per person <eob> ending up in the garbage. <eob>
In Canada, we throw away enough clothing <eob> to fill the largest stadium <eol> in my home town of Toronto, <eob> one that seats 60,000 people, <eob> with a mountain of clothes three times <eol> the size of that stadium. <eob>
Now, even with this, <eob> I still think that Canadians <eol> are the more polite North Americans, <eob> so don't hold it against us. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What was even more surprising <eol> was seeing that the fashion industry <eob> is the second-largest <eol> polluter in the world <eob> behind the oil and gas industry. <eob>
This is an important comparison to make. <eob>
I don't want to defend <eol> the oil and gas industry <eob> but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised <eol> to hear they were the number one polluter. <eob>
I just assumed, fairly or not, <eol> that that's an industry <eob> that doesn't really mind sticking <eol> to the status quo. <eob>
One where the technology <eol> doesn't really change <eob> and the focus is more so <eol> on driving profitability <eob> at the expense of a sustainable future. <eob>
But I was really surprised to see <eol> that the fashion industry was number two. <eob>
Because maintaining that status quo <eob> is the opposite of what <eol> the fashion industry stands for. <eob>
The unfortunate reality is, <eob> not only do we waste a lot <eol> of the things we do consume, <eob> but we also use a lot to produce the clothes <eol> that we buy each year. <eob>
On average, a household's purchase <eol> of clothing per year <eob> requires 1,000 bathtubs <eol> of water to produce. <eob>
A thousand bathtubs <eol> of water per household, per year. <eob>
That's a lot of water. <eob>
It seems that the industry <eol> that always has been <eob> and probably always will be <eol> on the forefront of design, <eob> creates products that are designed <eol> to be comfortable, designed to be trendy <eob> and designed to be expressive <eob> but aren't really designed to be sustainable <eob> or recyclable for that matter. <eob>
But I think that can change. <eob>
I think the fashion industry's aptitude for change <eob> is the exact thing that should make it <eob> patient zero for sustainable <eol> business practices. <eob>
And I think to get started, <eol> all we have to do <eob> is start to design clothes to be recyclable <eol> at the end of their life. <eob>
Now, designing recyclable clothing <eob> is definitely something to leave <eol> to the professionals. <eob> But as a 24-year-old thrift store aficionado <eob> armed with a sewing machine, <eob> if I were to very humbly posit one perspective, <eob> it would be to approach clothing design <eol> kind of like building with Lego. <eob>
When we put together a brick of Lego, <eob> it's very strong but very easily <eol> manipulated. <eob> It's modular in its nature. <eob>
Clothing design as it stands today <eol> is very rarely modular. <eob>
Take this motorcycle jacket as an example. <eob>
It's a pretty standard jacket <eol> with its buttons, zippers and trim. <eob>
But in order for us to efficiently <eol> recycle a jacket like this, <eob> we need to be able <eol> to easily remove these items <eob> and quickly get down to just the fabric. <eob>
Once we have just the fabric, <eob> we're able to break it down <eol> by shredding it <eob> and getting back to thread level, <eob> make new thread that then gets made <eol> into new fabric <eob> and ultimately new clothing, <eob> whether it be a new jacket <eol> or new T-shirts, for example. <eob>
But the complexity lies with all <eol> of these extra items, <eob> the buttons, the zippers <eol> and the trim. <eob>
Because in reality, these items <eol> are actually quite difficult to remove. <eob>
So in many cases it requires <eol> more time or more money <eob> to disassemble <eol> a jacket like this. <eob> In some cases, it's just more cost-effective <eol> to throw it away <eob> rather than recycle it. <eob>
But I think this can change <eol> if we design clothes in a modular way <eob> to be easily disassembled <eol> at the end of their lives. <eob>
We could redesign this jacket <eol> to have a hidden wireframe, <eob> kind of like the skeleton <eol> of a fish, that holds all important items together. <eob>
This invisible fish-bone structure <eol> can have all of these extra items, <eob> the zippers and the buttons <eol> and the trim, <eob> sewn into it and then attached <eol> to the fabric. <eob>
So at the end of the jacket's life, <eob> all you have to do is remove its fish bone <eob> and the fabric comes with it <eob> a lot quicker and a lot easier than before. <eob>
Now, recycling clothing <eol> is definitely one piece of the puzzle. <eob>
But if we want to take <eob> fixing the environmental impact <eol> that the fashion industry has <eob> more seriously, <eob> then we need to take this <eol> to the next step and start to design clothes <eob> to also be compostable <eol> at the end of their lives. <eob> For most of the types of clothes <eol> we have in our closet <eob> the average lifespan is about three years. <eob>
Now, I'm sure there's many of us <eol> that have gems in our drawers <eob> that are much older than that, which is great. <eob>
Because being able to extend the life <eol> of a garment by even only nine months <eob> reduces the waste and water impact <eol> that that garment has <eob> by 20 to 30 percent. <eob>
But fashion is fashion. <eob>
Which means that styles are always going to change <eob> and you're probably going to be wearing <eol> something different than you were today <eob> eight seasons from now, <eob> no matter how environmentally friendly you want to be. <eob>
But lucky for us, there are some items <eol> that never go out of style. <eob>
I'm talking about your basics -- <eol> your socks, underwear, even your pajamas. <eob>
We're all guilty of wearing <eol> these items right down to the bone, <eob> and in many cases throwing them in the garbage <eob> because it's really difficult <eob> to donate your old ratty socks <eol> that have holes in them <eob> to your local thrift store. <eob>
But what if we were able <eol> to compost these items <eob> rather than throw them in the trash bin? <eob>
The environmental savings could be huge, <eob> and all we would have to do <eol> is start to shift more of our resources <eob> to start to produce more of these items <eol> using more natural fibers, <eob> like 100 percent organic cotton. <eob>
Now, recycling and composting <eol> are two critical priorities. <eob>
But one other thing <eol> that we have to rethink <eob> is the way that we dye our clothes. <eob>
Currently, 10 to 20 percent <eol> of the harsh chemical dye that we use <eob> end up in water bodies that neighbor production <eol> hubs in developing nations. <eob>
The tricky thing <eol> is that these harsh chemicals <eob> are really effective at keeping a garment <eol> a specific color <eob> for a long period of time. <eob>
It's these harsh chemicals <eol> that keep that bright red dress <eob> bright red for so many years. <eob>
But what if we were able <eol> to use something different? <eob>
What if we were able to use something <eob> that we all have in our kitchen <eol> cabinets at home <eob> to dye our clothes? <eob>
What if we were able to use <eol> spices and herbs <eob> to dye our clothes? <eob>
There's countless food options <eol> that would allow for us to stain material, <eob> but these stains change color over time. <eob> This would be pretty different than the clothes <eol> that were dyed harshly <eob> with chemicals that we're used to. <eob>
But dyeing clothes naturally this way <eol> would allow for us <eob> to make sure they're more unique <eol> and environmentally friendlier. <eob> Let's think about it. <eob>
Fashion today is all about individuality. <eob>
It's about managing your own <eol> personal appearance <eob> to be just unique enough to be cool. <eob>
These days, everybody has the ability <eol> to showcase their brand <eob> their personal style, <eob> across the world, through social media. <eob> The pocket-sized billboards <eob> that we flick through on our Instagram feeds <eob> are chock-full of models <eol> and taste-makers <eob> that are showcasing their individuality <eob> through their personal microbrands. <eob>
But what could be more <eol> personalized, more unique, <eob> than clothes that change color over time? <eob>
Clothes that with each wash <eol> and with each wear <eob> become more and more one of a kind. <eob>
People have been buying and wearing <eol> ripped jeans for years. <eob> So this would just be another example <eol> of clothes that exist in our wardrobe <eob> that evolve with us over our lives. <eob>
This shirt, for example, is one that, <eob> much to the dismay of my mother <eol> and the state of her kitchen, <eob> I dyed at home, using turmeric, before coming here today. <eob>
This shirt is something <eob> that none of my friends are going <eol> to have on their Instagram feed. <eob>
So it's unique, <eob> but more importantly, it's naturally dyed. <eob>
Now, I'm not suggesting <eob> that everybody dye their clothes <eol> in their kitchen sink at home. <eob>
But if we were able to apply this <eob> or a similar process <eol> on a commercial scale, <eob> then our need to rely on these harsh chemical dyes for our clothes <eob> could be easily reduced. <eob>
The 2.4-trillion-dollar <eol> fashion industry is fiercely competitive. <eob>
So the business <eol> that can provide a product at scale <eob> while also promising its customers <eob> that each and every garment <eol> will become more unique over time <eob> will have a serious competitive advantage. <eob>
Brands have been playing <eol> with customization for years. <eob> The rise of e-commerce services, <eob> like Indochino, a bespoke <eol> suiting platform, <eob> and Tinker Tailor, a bespoke dress-making platform, <eob> have made customization possible <eol> from your couch. <eob>
Nike and Adidas have been mastering <eol> their online shoe customization platforms <eob> for years. <eob>
Providing individuality at scale <eob> is a challenge that most consumer-facing <eol> businesses encounter. <eob>
So being able to tackle this <eob> while also providing an environmentally friendly product <eob> could lead to a pretty seismic industry shift. <eob> And at that point, <eob> it's not just about doing <eol> what's best for our environment <eob> but also what's best for the bottom line. <eob>
There's no fix-all, <eol> and there's no one-step solution. <eob>
But we can get started <eob> by designing clothes with their death in mind. <eob>
The fashion industry <eol> is the perfect industry <eob> to experiment <eol> with and embrace change <eob> that can one day get us <eol> to the sustainable future <eob> we so desperately need. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are <eol> if you've met me in the last five years <eob> I've asked you, after a few minutes, <eol> a bit of an odd question: <eob> Can I have your brain? <eob>
Now, it only seems like a strange question <eol> if you don't know my story <eob> so please let me share it with you. <eob>
I grew up outside of Chicago, <eol> and I was an athlete <eob> and I was very lucky to get recruited <eol> to play football at Harvard University. <eob>
So that's me. <eob>
So that's also me. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
Sure you remember me <eol> from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003, <eob> and I had a blast <eob> playing what people affectionately like to call <eob> Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was perfect for me. <eob>
But unfortunately, <eob> I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley, <eob> and I suffered a severe concussion. <eob>
And it led to what became permanent <eol> postconcussion symptoms: <eob> constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, <eol> feeling in a fog. <eob>
And in that first year, <eob> I tried to figure out how <eol> could I make this pain go away. <eob>
And I wasn't getting the answers <eol> I needed from doctors, <eob> and so I started digging <eol> into the medical literature. <eob>
And I found there's this whole story <eol> about concussions <eob> that we weren't really being told. <eob>
So I decided to write a book about it, <eob> called "Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis" <eob> that came out in 2006. <eob>
But in that process, I learned it's not <eol> really just about concussions. <eob>
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. <eob>
What we used to call punch-drunk, <eol> because we only knew about it from boxers. <eob>
We knew that getting hit in the head <eol> too many times with boxers <eob> would cause their brain to essentially start <eol> to rot, to degenerate. <eob>
And they'd have symptoms <eob> like memory problems and problems <eol> with cognition, <eob> depression, impulse control <eol> issues, aggression. <eob>
So basically, I got ... <eob> I got injured at the right time, <eob> in which the first two NFL players <eol> were studied for this disease. <eob>
And it turned out they both had it. <eob>
The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, <eol> already had dementia. <eob>
The second, Terry Long, 45 years old <eol> when he took his life. <eob>
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided <eol> to look at their brains <eob> and found this disease. <eob>
I wrote a chapter about it, <eob> and I thought people would make <eol> a big deal out of it. <eob>
But shockingly, even when the first <eol> two cases came in positive, <eob> there was never a national news story about this, <eob> what's going on in football <eol> with these cases of CTE. <eob>
So the book comes out, <eob> not a whole lot is happening, <eob> and one day I read the newspaper -- <eol> November 20, 2006. <eob>
I find out that Andre Waters <eol> just took his life. <eob>
Those of you who know football, <eob> Andre Waters was someone <eol> I grew up watching. <eob>
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety, <eob> [44] years old, <eol> a Division II football coach <eob> when he decided to put <eol> a gun to his head. <eob>
In the article they reminded me, <eol> his nickname was Dirty Waters. <eob>
He was known for leading with his head, <eob> so I thought I'm just going to look up <eob> did he ever talk about the concussions <eol> he had. <eob>
And I found a quote from 1994 <eol> where Andre Waters said, <eob> "I stopped counting my concussions at 15. <eob>
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts and go back out there." <eob> And I thought, I wonder <eol> if he might have CTE, too. <eob>
If that might have contributed <eol> to whatever made him choose to end his life. <eob> So I ended up calling the doctor who did <eol> the first two studies, and I said, <eob> "Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters." <eob> And he said, "I'd be happy to. <eob>
The problem is, the first two cases died <eol> in the county in which I work, <eob> and I could study them <eol> as part of my job. <eob>
I can't do that with Andre Waters, <eol> he died in Florida. <eob>
If you want me to study him, <eol> you're going to have to figure out <eob> how to get me the brain. <eob> "So I said," OK. <eob>
How does one get a brain?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So I racked my brain <eob> and I thought, why don't I call <eol> the medical examiner <eob> who I think has the brain right now? <eob>
So I called up the medical examiner <eol> in Florida, and I said, <eob> "Hey, you don't know me, but do you still have <eol> the brain of Andre Waters?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he said, "Yes, I do." <eob> I said, "OK, are you going to study him <eol> for CTE?" <eob> And he said no, in fact at that time <eol> he didn't believe that was a real disease. <eob>
I said, "OK, if you're not, <eol> do you mind if I have it?" <eob> And he said, "Well, young man, <eob> I can't give you the brain. <eob>
You need his family's permission. <eob>
But if you do get the permission <eol> of his next of kin, <eob> I will release the brain to you. <eob> "And I said," Great! <eob> "And then I realized I had to figure out <eol> who his next of kin was and ask them, <eob> and it turned out it was Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother. <eob>
And I sat there, and I took <eol> a breath and I thought, <eob> "Am I really going to cold-call <eol> an 88-year-old grieving mother <eob> who just lost her son to suicide?" <eob> And almost everything in me said, <eol> "Don't do it. <eob>
It's too much to put <eol> this poor woman through, <eob> she's been through so much already." <eob> But then this other voice in my head said, <eob> "You know what? <eob>
If guys are killing themselves from this disease <eob> and we could study it to maybe <eol> prevent this from happening in the future, <eob> sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do something <eol> that's very hard." <eob>
So I called her. <eob> First time, nobody answered. <eob>
Second time, no one answered, <eol> third... no voice mails. <eob>
The fifth time, I got an answer. <eob>
And thank God that Andre Waters's <eol> family was so gracious about the call and said, <eob> "You know what, <eob> we want to know what happened to Andre. <eob> We want to know why he changed so much <eol> in the last five years of his life." <eob> And so we studied the brain, <eob> and it turned out that he did have CTE. <eob>
He became the third NFL player <eol> diagnosed with the disease. <eob>
This is what it looks like. <eob>
He was somewhere between mild and severe. <eob>
OK, we have three <eol> of three NFL players here. <eob> Maybe this needs to get <eol> a little bit more serious. <eob>
Maybe something's happening here. <eob>
So I ended up starting <eol> the Concussion Legacy Foundation, <eob> actually formalized the work, <eob> so it wasn't just some guy <eol> calling for brains. <eob>
And I searched the world. <eob> And I put together the best <eol> research team I could find. <eob>
So we partnered with Boston University, <eob> we partnered with scientists <eol> at the VA here in Boston, <eob> and we started a brain bank. <eob>
Turns out, if you want to know how to cure <eol> degenerative brain disease, <eob> you have to start by actually studying the brains. <eob>
At this point, we were the first center <eol> in the world focused on CTE. <eob> It just had not been studied formally. <eob>
And so we start this brain bank, <eol> and it's my job to get the brains <eob> for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, <eol> right in the middle. <eob>
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu, <eob> truly my dream team <eol> of scientists that I support. <eob>
So my job is to get the brains. <eob>
And I was very successful <eol> in those early years. <eob>
Since 2007 I've started every day <eol> by reading the obituaries. <eob>
And it's a tough way to live. <eob>
And it's hard on me <eob> and it's even worse on these poor families <eol> that I've been calling <eob> for the last 10 years, <eol> to ask for their brains. <eob>
And so early on in the process, as it started <eol> to really eat away at me, <eob> I decided, you know what, <eol> can I find another way <eob> to get people to donate <eol> their brains to this research? <eob>
And I figured out, what if we could create <eol> a culture <eob> of brain donation in this country? <eob>
What if it became normal for athletes <eol> to donate their brain after they died? <eob>
And so what I started <eol> was a brain donation registry. <eob>
And I started asking athletes <eob> if they would publicly pledge <eol> to donate their brain to science. <eob>
And it started with, actually, <eol> a hockey player in 2009. <eob>
One of my first pledges was <eol> a former Harvard hockey player, <eob> Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time. <eob>
It was a slow start people understanding <eol> what this was about. <eob>
So when the news hit the front page, <eob> "Noah Welch pledging his brain to science," <eob> he said he went to the locker <eol> room the next day, <eob> one of his teammates <eol> pulled him aside and said, <eob> "Hey, I heard you're <eol> donating your brain to science." <eob> And he said, "Yep." <eob> And he said, "Wow. <eob>
How many games are you going to miss? " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> True story. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But we've been remarkably successful -- <eob> over 2,500 athletes have signed up. <eob>
They get a brain-donation card <eol> they keep in their wallet. <eob> This is mine, I was obviously first, <eol> it says 01. <eob>
And I will donate my brain to this. <eob>
We've also been lucky to have <eol> people like Brandi Chastain, <eob> the women's soccer icon, <eob> NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr. <eob>
Just two weeks ago, Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti <eob> who had been diagnosed with dementia, <eol> signed up to pledge his brain. <eob> So it's been wonderful, and the great thing about it <eob> is that it has worked in changing <eol> how we're able to get brains. <eob>
So now, instead of me having to call, <eol> more families call us. <eob>
And our phones ring off the hook. <eob>
And so I can now focus <eol> on taking this information, <eob> figuring out how do we work <eol> towards a cure, <eob> how do we work towards prevention, <eob> and so my life has gotten a lot easier. <eob>
This is just some of the headlines <eol> that we've able to get over the years <eob> from athletes pledging their brain. <eob>
The problem has been what we learned. <eob>
So when we started this, <eob> only 45 cases <eol> existed in the world of this disease <eob> that had been studied <eol> in brain banks. <eob>
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains <eob> and found over 300 of them had CTE. <eob>
To put that in perspective, <eob> the rest of the world has not studied <eol> 100 brains since we started this. <eob>
What we've seen though <eol> is very frightening. <eob>
So some of you might have seen <eol> the headline in July <eob> in the "New York Times." <eob> And a recent study we published, <eob> that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at <eob> 110 were positive <eol> for this disease. <eob>
Of the first 53 college football players <eol> we looked at, <eob> 48 had this disease. <eob>
That's something <eol> that's a very big concern to me. <eob>
And so now, I'm very much focused <eob> on what can we do to actually <eol> treat this disease? <eob>
We still can't diagnose <eol> CTE in living people, <eob> we have no treatments <eol> that are going to be coming <eob> out of the pharmaceutical industry <eol> in the next five years. <eob>
This is a long, long fight. <eob>
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation <eol> is here to not only facilitate this work, <eob> and that's the long game, <eob> but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this. <eob>
We can prevent this disease <eob> if we just stopped hitting people <eol> in the head so much. <eob>
And frankly, we need to stop <eol> hitting children in the head. <eob>
Turns out, it's not a great idea <eol> to hit a five-year-old in the head <eob> 500 times each year. <eob>
And it does actually open up <eol> the door to this disease. <eob>
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. <eob> But I have great hope <eol> that we're on our way to curing this disease. <eob>
But I hope you understand <eol> my story a little more now. <eob>
Can I have your brain? <eob> And now that we've gotten to know <eol> each other a little bit better, <eob> this is the time where I ask you, <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I started teaching MBA students <eob> 17 years ago. <eob>
Sometimes I run into <eol> my students years later. <eob>
And when I run into them, <eol> a funny thing happens. <eob>
I don't remember just their faces; <eob> I also remember where exactly <eol> in the classroom they were sitting. <eob>
And I remember who they were <eol> sitting with as well. <eob>
This is not because I have <eol> any special superpowers of memory. <eob>
The reason I can remember them <eob> is because they are creatures of habit. <eob>
They are sitting with their favorite <eol> people in their favorite seats. <eob>
They find their twins, they stay with them <eol> for the whole year. <eob>
Now, the danger of this for my students <eol> is they're at risk <eob> of leaving the university with just a few people <eob> who are exactly like them. <eob>
They're going to squander their chance <eol> for an international, diverse network. <eob>
How could this happen to them? <eob>
My students are open-minded. <eob>
They come to business school precisely <eol> so that they can get great networks. <eob>
Now, all of us socially narrow <eol> in our lives, in our school, in work, <eob> and so I want you to think about this one. <eob>
How many of you here brought a friend <eol> along for this talk? <eob>
I want you to look <eol> at your friend a little bit. <eob>
Are they of the same nationality as you? <eob>
Are they of the same gender as you? <eob>
Are they of the same race? <eob> Really look at them closely. <eob> Don't they kind of look like you as well? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The muscle people are together, <eob> and the people with the same hairstyles <eob> and the checked shirts. <eob>
We all do this in life. <eob>
We all do it in life, and in fact, <eol> there's nothing wrong with this. <eob>
It makes us comfortable to be around <eol> people who are similar. <eob>
The problem is when we're <eol> on a precipice, right? <eob>
When we're in trouble, <eol> when we need new ideas, <eob> when we need new jobs, <eol> when we need new resources -- <eob> this is when we really pay a price <eol> for living in a clique. <eob>
Mark Granovetter, the sociologist, <eol> had a famous paper <eob> "The Strength of Weak Ties," <eob> and what he did in this paper <eol> is he asked people <eob> how they got their jobs. <eob>
And what he learned was that most <eol> people don't get their jobs <eob> through their strong ties -- <eol> their father, their mother, their significant other. <eob> They instead get jobs through weak ties, <eol> people who they just met. <eob>
So if you think about what the problem <eol> is with your strong ties, <eob> think about your significant other, for example. <eob>
The network is redundant. <eob>
Everybody that they know, you know. <eob>
Or I hope you know them. Right? <eob> Your weak ties -- people <eol> you just met today -- <eob> they are your ticket <eol> to a whole new social world. <eob>
The thing is that we have this amazing ticket <eol> to travel our social worlds, <eob> but we don't use it very well. <eob>
Sometimes we stay awfully close to home. <eob>
And today, what I want to talk about is: <eob> What are those habits <eol> that keep human beings so close to home, <eob> and how can we be <eol> a little bit more intentional <eob> about traveling our social universe? <eob>
So let's look at the first strategy. <eob> The first strategy is to use <eol> a more imperfect social search engine. <eob>
What I mean by a social search engine <eob> is how you are finding <eol> and filtering your friends. <eob>
And so people always tell me, <eob> "I want to get lucky through the network. <eob>
I want to get a new job. <eol> I want to get a great opportunity." <eob> And I say, "Well, that's really hard, <eob> because your networks are so fundamentally <eol> predictable." <eob> Map out your habitual daily footpath, <eob> and what you'll probably discover <eol> is that you start at home, <eob> you go to your school or your workplace, <eob> you maybe go up the same staircase <eol> or elevator, <eob> you go to the bathroom -- the same bathroom -- <eob> and the same stall in that bathroom, <eob> you end up in the gym, <eob> then you come right back home. <eob>
It's like stops on a train schedule. <eob> It's that predictable. <eob> It's efficient, but the problem is, you're seeing <eol> exactly the same people. <eob>
Make your network <eol> slightly more inefficient. <eob>
Go to a bathroom on a different floor. <eob>
You encounter a whole new <eol> network of people. <eob>
The other side of it is how <eol> we are actually filtering. <eob>
And we do this automatically. <eob>
The minute we meet someone, <eol> we are looking at them, we meet them, <eob> we are initially seeing, <eob> "You're interesting." <eob> "You're not interesting." "You're relevant." <eob> We do this automatically. <eol> We can't even help it. <eob>
And what I want to encourage you to do <eol> instead is to fight your filters. <eob>
I want you to take a look around this room, <eob> and I want you to identify <eol> the least interesting person that you see, <eob> and I want you to connect with them <eol> over the next coffee break. <eob>
And I want you to go <eol> even further than that. <eob>
What I want you to do is find the most <eol> irritating person you see as well <eob> and connect with them. <eob>
What you are doing with this exercise <eol> is you are forcing yourself <eob> to see what you don't want to see, <eob> to connect with who you don't <eol> want to connect with, <eob> to widen your social world. <eob>
To truly widen, what we have to do is, <eob> we've got to fight our sense of choice. <eob>
We've got to fight our choices. <eob>
And my students hate this, <eol> but you know what I do? <eob>
I won't let them sit <eol> in their favorite seats. <eob> I move them around <eol> from seat to seat. <eob>
I force them to work with different people <eob> so there are more accidental bumps in the network <eob> where people get a chance <eol> to connect with each other. <eob>
And we studied exactly this kind <eol> of an intervention at Harvard University. <eob>
At Harvard, when you look <eol> at the rooming groups, <eob> there's freshman rooming groups, <eol> people are not choosing those roommates. <eob>
They're of all different races, <eol> all different ethnicities. <eob>
Maybe people are initially uncomfortable <eol> with those roommates, <eob> but the amazing thing is, <eob> at the end of a year <eol> with those students, <eob> they're able to overcome <eol> that initial discomfort. <eob>
They're able to find deep-level <eol> commonalities with people. <eob>
So the takeaway here is not <eol> just "take someone out to coffee." <eob> It's a little more subtle. <eob>
It's "go to the coffee room." <eob> When researchers talk <eol> about social hubs, <eob> what makes a social hub so special <eol> is you can't choose; <eob> you can't predict who you're <eol> going to meet in that place. <eob>
And so with these social hubs, the paradox <eol> is, interestingly enough, <eob> to get randomness, <eob> it requires, actually, some planning. <eob>
In one university that I worked at, <eob> there was a mail room <eol> on every single floor. <eob>
What that meant is that the only people <eol> who would bump into each other <eob> are those who are actually on that floor <eob> and who are bumping into each other anyway. <eob>
At another university I worked at, <eol> there was only one mail room, <eob> so all the faculty from all over that building <eob> would run into each other <eol> in that social hub. <eob>
A simple change in planning, <eob> a huge difference in the traffic of people <eob> and the accidental bumps in the network. <eob>
Here's my question for you: <eob> What are you doing that breaks you <eol> from your social habits? <eob>
Where do you find yourself <eob> in places where you get injections <eol> of unpredictable diversity? <eob>
And my students give me <eol> some wonderful examples. <eob>
They tell me when they're doing <eol> pickup basketball games, <eob> or my favorite example <eol> is when they go to a dog park. <eob>
They tell me it's even better <eol> than online dating when they're there. <eob>
So the real thing that I want <eol> you to think about <eob> is we've got to fight our filters. <eob>
We've got to make ourselves <eol> a little more inefficient, <eob> and by doing so, we are creating a more imprecise <eol> social search engine. <eob>
And you're creating that randomness, <eob> that luck that is going to cause <eol> you to widen your travels, <eob> through your social universe. <eob>
But in fact, there's more to it than that. <eob>
Sometimes we actually buy <eol> ourselves a second-class ticket <eob> to travel our social universe. <eob>
We are not courageous <eol> when we reach out to people. <eob>
Let me give you an example of that. <eob>
A few years ago, I had <eol> a very eventful year. <eob>
That year, I managed to lose a job, <eob> I managed to get <eol> a dream job overseas and accept it, <eob> I had a baby the next month, <eob> I got very sick, <eob> I was unable to take the dream job. <eob>
And so in a few weeks, <eol> what ended up happening was, <eob> I lost my identity <eol> as a faculty member, <eob> and I got a very stressful <eol> new identity as a mother. <eob>
What I also got was tons <eol> of advice from people. <eob>
And the advice I despised more <eol> than any other advice was, <eob> "You've got to go network <eol> with everybody." <eob> When your psychological world <eol> is breaking down, <eob> the hardest thing to do <eol> is to try and reach out <eob> and build up your social world. <eob>
And so we studied exactly this idea <eol> on a much larger scale. <eob>
What we did was we looked at high <eol> and low socioeconomic status people, <eob> and we looked at them in two situations. <eob>
We looked at them first <eol> in a baseline condition, <eob> when they were quite comfortable. <eob>
And what we found was that our lower socioeconomic status people, <eob> when they were comfortable, <eol> were actually reaching out to more people. <eob>
They thought of more people. <eob>
They were also less constrained <eol> in how they were networking. <eob>
They were thinking of more diverse people <eob> than the higher-status people. <eob>
Then we asked them to think <eol> about maybe losing a job. <eob> We threatened them. <eob> And once they thought about that, <eob> the networks they generated completely differed. <eob>
The lower socioeconomic status <eol> people reached inwards. <eob>
They thought of fewer people. <eob>
They thought of less-diverse people. <eob>
The higher socioeconomic status <eol> people thought of more people, <eob> they thought of a broader network, <eob> they were positioning themselves to bounce <eol> back from that setback. <eob>
Let's consider what this actually means. <eob>
Imagine that you were <eol> being spontaneously unfriended <eob> by everyone in your network <eob> other than your mom, <eol> your dad and your dog. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is essentially what we are doing <eob> at these moments when we need <eol> our networks the most. <eob>
Imagine — this is what we're doing. <eob>
We're doing it to ourselves. <eob>
We are mentally compressing <eol> our networks <eob> when we are being harassed, when we are being bullied, <eob> when we are threatened <eol> about losing a job, <eob> when we feel down and weak. <eob>
We are closing ourselves <eol> off, isolating ourselves, <eob> creating a blind spot <eol> where we actually don't see our resources. <eob>
We don't see our allies, <eol> we don't see our opportunities. <eob>
How can we overcome this? <eob> Two simple strategies. <eob> One strategy is simply to look <eol> at your list of Facebook friends <eob> and LinkedIn friends <eob> just so you remind yourself <eol> of people who are there <eob> beyond those that automatically <eol> come to mind. <eob>
And in our own research, <eol> one of the things we did was, <eob> we considered Claude Steele's research <eol> on self-affirmation: <eob> simply thinking about your own values, <eob> networking from a place <eol> of strength. <eob>
What Leigh Thompson, Hoon-Seok Choi <eol> and I were able to do is, <eob> we found that people who had affirmed <eol> themselves first <eob> were able to take advice from people <eob> who would otherwise be threatening to them. <eob>
Here's a last exercise. <eob> I want you to look <eol> in your email in-box, <eob> and I want you to look at the last time <eol> you asked somebody for a favor. <eob>
And I want you to look <eol> at the language that you used. <eob>
Did you say things like, <eob> "Oh, you're a great resource," <eob> or "I owe you one," <eob> "I'm obligated to you." <eob> All of this language represents a metaphor. <eob>
It's a metaphor of economics, <eob> of a balance sheet, of accounting, <eob> of transactions. <eob>
And when we think <eol> about human relations in a transactional way, <eob> it is fundamentally uncomfortable <eol> to us as human beings. <eob>
We must think about human relations <eol> and reaching out to people <eob> in more humane ways. <eob>
Here's an idea as to how to do so. <eob>
Look at words like "please," <eob> "thank you," "you're welcome" <eol> in other languages. <eob>
Look at the literal translation <eol> of these words. <eob>
Each of these words is a word that helps us <eol> impose upon other people <eob> in our social networks. <eob>
And so, the word "thank you," <eob> if you look at it in Spanish, <eol> Italian, French, <eob> "gracias," "grazie," "merci" in French. <eob>
Each of them are "grace" and "mercy." <eob> They are godly words. <eob>
There's nothing economic <eol> or transactional about those words. <eob>
The word "you're welcome" is interesting. <eob>
The great persuasion theorist <eol> Robert Cialdini says <eob> we've got to get our favors back. <eob>
So we need to emphasize <eol> the transaction a little bit more. <eob>
He says, "Let's not say <eol> 'You're welcome.' <eob> Instead say, 'I know you'd do the same for me.'" <eob> But sometimes it may be helpful <eol> to not think in transactional ways, <eob> to eliminate the transaction, <eol> to make it a little bit more invisible. <eob>
And in fact, if you look in Chinese, <eob> the word "bú kè qì" in Chinese, <eol> "You're welcome," means, <eob> "Don't be formal; we're family. <eob>
We don't need to go <eol> through those formalities. <eob> "And" kembali <eol> "in Indonesian is" Come back to me. <eob> "When you say" You're welcome <eol> "next time, <eob> think about how you can maybe eliminate the transaction <eob> and instead strengthen that social tie. <eob>
Maybe "It's great to collaborate," <eol> or "That's what friends are for." <eob>
I want you to think about how you think <eol> about this ticket that you have <eob> to travel your social universe. <eob>
Here's one metaphor. <eob>
It's a common metaphor: <eol> "Life is a journey." Right? <eob>
It's a train ride, <eob> and you're a passenger on the train, <eob> and there are certain people with you. <eob>
Certain people get on this train, <eob> and some stay with you, some leave <eol> at different stops, <eob> new ones may enter. <eob>
I love this metaphor, <eol> it's a beautiful one. <eob>
But I want you to consider <eol> a different metaphor. <eob>
This one is passive, <eol> being a passenger on that train, <eob> and it's quite linear. <eob>
You're off to some particular destination. <eob>
Why not instead think of yourself <eob> as an atom, <eob> bumping up against other atoms, <eob> maybe transferring energy with them, <eob> bonding with them a little <eob> and maybe creating something new <eob> on your travels through the social universe. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob> And I hope we bump into each other again. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
On a warm August morning in Harare, <eob> Farai, <eob> a 24-year-old mother of two, <eob> walks towards a park bench. <eob>
She looks miserable and dejected. <eob>
Now, on the park bench sits <eol> an 82-year-old woman, <eob> better known to the community <eol> as Grandmother Jack. <eob>
Farai hands Grandmother Jack <eol> an envelope from the clinic nurse. <eob>
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down <eob> as she opens the envelope and reads. <eob>
There's silence for three minutes <eol> or so as she reads. <eob>
And after a long pause, Grandmother <eol> Jack takes a deep breath, <eob> looks at Farai and says, <eob> "I'm here for you. <eob>
Would you like to share <eol> your story with me?" <eob>
Farai <eob> begins, <eob> her eyes swelling with tears. <eob>
She says, "Grandmother Jack, <eob> I'm HIV-positive. <eob>
I've been living with HIV <eol> for the past four years. <eob>
My husband left me a year ago. <eob>
I have two kids <eob> under the age of five. <eob> I'm unemployed. <eob> I can hardly take care of my children." <eob>
Tears are now flowing down her face. <eob>
And in response, Grandmother Jack <eol> moves closer, <eob> puts her hand on <eob> Farai, <eob> and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry. <eob>
You've been through a lot. <eob>
Would you like to share more with me?" <eob>
And Farai continues. <eob> "In the last three weeks, <eob> I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, <eob> taking my two children with me. <eob>
I can't take it anymore. <eob>
The clinic nurse sent me to see you." <eob> There's an exchange between the two, <eol> which lasts about 30 minutes. <eob>
And finally, Grandmother Jack says, <eob> "Farai, <eob> it seems to me that you have <eol> all the symptoms of kufungisisa." <eob>
The word "kufungisisa" opens up <eol> a floodgate of tears. <eob>
So, kufungisisa is the local <eol> equivalent of depression <eob> in my country. <eob>
It literally means <eob> "thinking too much." <eob> The World Health Organization estimates <eob> that more than 300 million people globally, <eol> today, suffer from depression, <eob> or what <eob> in my country <eob> we call kufungisisa. <eob>
And the World Health Organization <eol> also tells us <eob> that every 40 seconds, <eob> someone somewhere <eol> in the world commits suicide <eob> because they are unhappy, <eob> largely due to depression or kufungisisa. <eob>
And most of these deaths are occurring <eol> in low- and middle-income countries. <eob>
In fact, <eob> the World Health Organization <eol> goes as far as to say <eob> that when you look at the age group <eol> between 15 to 29, <eob> a leading cause of death now <eol> is actually suicide. <eob>
But there are wider events <eol> that lead to depression <eob> and in some cases, suicide, <eob> such as abuse, <eob> conflict, violence, <eob> isolation, loneliness -- <eob> the list is endless. <eob>
But one thing that we do know <eob> is that depression can be treated <eol> and suicides averted. <eob>
But the problem is <eob> we just don't have enough psychiatrists <eol> or psychologists in the world <eob> to do the job. <eob>
In most low- and middle-income countries, <eol> for instance, <eob> the ratio of psychiatrists to the population <eob> is something like one for every one <eol> and a half million people, <eob> which literally means that 90 <eol> percent of the people <eob> needing mental health services <eob> will not get it. <eob>
In my country, <eob> there are 12 psychiatrists, <eob> and I'm one of them, <eob> for a population of approximately 14 million. <eob>
Now, let me just put that into context. <eob>
One evening while I was at home, <eob> I get a call from the ER, <eob> or the emergency room, <eob> from a city which is some 200 kilometers away <eob> from where I live. <eob>
And the ER doctor says, <eob> "One of your patients, <eob> someone you treated four months ago, <eob> has just taken an overdose, <eob> and they are in the ER department. <eob>
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, <eob> but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation." <eob> Now, I obviously can't get into my car <eol> in the middle of the night <eob> and drive 200 kilometers. <eob>
So as best as we could, <eob> over the phone with the ER doctor, <eob> we come up with an assessment. <eob>
We ensure that suicidal observations <eol> are in place. <eob>
We ensure that we start reviewing <eol> the antidepressants <eob> that this patient has been taking, <eob> and we finally conclude <eob> that as soon as Erica -- <eol> that was her name, 26-year-old -- <eob> as soon as Erica is ready <eol> to be released from the ER, <eob> she should come directly to me <eol> with her mother, <eob> and I will evaluate <eob> and establish what can be done. <eob>
And we assumed <eol> that that would take about a week. <eob> A week passes. <eob> Three weeks pass. <eob> No Erica. <eob> And one day I get a call <eol> from Erica's mother, <eob> and she says, <eob> "Erica committed suicide <eol> three days ago. <eob>
She hanged herself <eol> from the mango tree <eob> in the family garden." <eob> Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, <eob> I couldn't help but ask, <eob> "But why didn't you come to Harare, <eol> where I live? <eob>
We had agreed that as soon <eol> as you're released from the ER, <eob> you will come to me." <eob> Her response was brief. <eob> "We didn't have <eol> the 15 dollars bus fare <eob> to come to Harare." <eob>
Now, suicide is not an unusual event <eob> in the world of mental health. <eob>
But there was something <eol> about Erica's death <eob> that struck me at the core <eol> of my very being. <eob>
That statement from Erica's mother: <eob> "We didn't have 15 dollars <eol> bus fare to come to you," <eob> made me realize <eob> that it just wasn't going to work, <eob> me expecting people to come to me. <eob>
And I got into this state <eol> of soul-searching, <eob> trying to really discover my role <eob> as a psychiatrist in Africa. <eob>
And after considerable <eol> consultation and soul-searching, <eob> talking to colleagues, friends and family, <eob> it suddenly dawned on me <eob> that actually, one the most reliable resources <eol> we have in Africa <eob> are grandmothers. <eob> Yes, grandmothers. <eob> And I thought, <eob> grandmothers are in every community. <eob>
There are hundreds of them. <eob> And -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they don't leave their communities <eol> in search of greener pastures. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
See, the only time they leave <eob> is when they go to a greener pasture <eol> called heaven. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I thought, how about training grandmothers <eob> in evidence-based talk therapy, <eob> which they can deliver on a bench? <eob>
Empower them with the skills <eol> to listen, <eob> to show empathy, <eob> all of that rooted <eol> in cognitive behavioral therapy; <eob> empower them with the skills <eol> to provide behavior activation, <eob> activity scheduling; <eob> and support them using digital technology. <eob> You know, mobile phone technology. <eob> Pretty much everyone in Africa <eol> has a mobile phone today. <eob>
So in 2006, <eob> I started my first group <eob> of grandmothers. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today, there are hundreds <eob> of grandmothers <eob> who are working in more <eol> than 70 communities. <eob>
And in the last year alone, <eob> more than 30,000 people received treatment <eob> on the Friendship Bench <eob> from a grandmother in a community <eol> in Zimbabwe. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And -- <eob> And recently, we published this work <eol> that is done by these grandmothers <eob> in the Journal of the American <eol> Medical Association. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And our results show <eol> that six months after receiving treatment <eob> from a grandmother, <eob> people were still symptom-free: <eob> no depression, <eob> suicidal ideation <eol> completely reduced. <eob>
In fact, <eob> our results — this was a clinical trial — <eob> in fact, this clinical trial showed <eob> that grandmothers were more effective <eol> at treating depression <eob> than doctors and — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And so, <eob> we're now working <eol> towards expanding this program. <eob>
There are more than 600 million people <eol> currently aged above 65 in the world. <eob>
And by the year 2050, <eob> there will be 1.5 billion people <eol> aged 65 and above. <eob>
Imagine if we could create <eol> a global network of grandmothers <eob> in every major city in the world, <eob> who are trained <eob> in evidence-based talk therapy, <eob> supported through digital platforms, <eob> networked. <eob>
And they will make <eol> a difference in communities. <eob>
They will reduce the treatment gap <eob> for mental, neurological <eol> and substance-use disorders. <eob>
Finally, <eob> this is a file photograph <eol> of Grandmother Jack. <eob>
So, Farai had six sessions <eol> on the bench with Grandmother Jack. <eob>
Today, <eob> Farai <eob> is employed. <eob>
She has her two children at school. <eob>
And as for Grandmother Jack, <eob> one morning in February, we expected her to see <eol> her 257th client on the bench. <eob>
She didn't show up. <eob>
She had gone to a greener <eol> pasture called heaven. <eob>
But I believe that Grandmother Jack, <eob> from up there, <eob> she's cheering on all the other grandmothers — <eob> the increasing number <eob> of grandmothers <eob> who are making a difference <eob> in the lives of thousands of people. <eob>
And I'm sure she's in awe <eob> when she realizes that something <eol> that she helped to pioneer <eob> is now spreading to other countries, <eob> like Malawi, <eob> the island of Zanzibar <eob> and coming closer to home here <eol> in the Unites States <eob> in the city of New York. <eob>
May her soul rest in peace. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Currently, most refugees <eol> live in the cities <eob> rather than in the refugee camps. <eob>
We represent over 60 percent <eob> of the number of refugees globally. <eob>
With the majority of refugees <eol> living in urban areas, <eob> there is a strong need for a paradigm <eol> shift and new thinking. <eob>
Rather than wasting money <eol> on building walls, <eob> it would be better to spend on programs <eob> to help refugees to help themselves. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We always have to leave <eol> behind all our possessions. <eob> But not our skills and knowledge. <eob>
If allowed to live a productive life, <eob> refugees can help themselves <eob> and contribute to the development <eol> of their host country. <eob>
I was born in the city called Bukavu, <eob> South Kivu, <eob> in the Democratic Republic of Congo. <eob>
I am the fifth-born in <eol> a family of 12 children. <eob>
My father, a mechanic by profession, <eob> worked very hard to send me to school. <eob>
Just like other young people, <eob> I had a lot of plans and dreams. <eob>
I wanted to complete my studies, <eob> get a nice job, <eob> marry and have my own children <eob> and support my family. <eob>
But this didn't happen. <eob>
War in my homeland forced me <eol> to flee to Uganda in 2008, <eob> nine years ago. <eob>
My family joined a steady exodus of refugees <eob> who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala. <eob>
In my country, <eob> I lived already in the city, <eob> and we felt Kampala was much better <eol> than a refugee camp. <eob>
Refugees in the cities <eob> have always been denied <eol> international assistance, <eob> even after their recognition <eol> by UNHCR in 1997. <eob>
In addition to the poverty <eol> problem we were confronted with <eob> as the local urban poor, <eob> we were facing challenges <eol> due to our refugee status, <eob> such as a language barrier. <eob>
In Congo, the official language is French. <eob>
But in Uganda, it is English. <eob>
We didn't have access <eol> to education and health. <eob>
We were exposed to harassment, <eob> exploitation, intimidation <eol> and discrimination. <eob>
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused <eob> on the formal settlement in rural areas, <eob> and there was nothing in place for us. <eob>
But we didn't want handouts. <eob>
We wanted to work and support ourselves. <eob>
I joined my other two colleagues in exile <eob> and set up an organization <eol> to support other refugees. <eob>
YARID -- Young African Refugees <eol> for Integral Development -- <eob> began as a conversation <eol> within the Congolese community. <eob>
We asked the community <eob> how they could organize themselves <eol> to solve these challenges. <eob>
The YARID programs <eol> for support evolve in stages, <eob> progressing from soccer community, <eol> to English language <eob> to sewing livelihoods. <eob>
The soccer changed the energy <eob> of unemployed youth <eob> and connected people from different communities. <eob>
The free English classes <eob> help empower people to engage <eol> with the Ugandan community, <eob> allowing them to get to know <eol> their neighbors and sell wares. <eob>
The vocational training program <eol> offers livelihood skills, <eob> and with them, important opportunities <eol> for economic self-reliance. <eob>
We've seen so many families <eob> become self-sustaining. <eob>
We've seen who no longer needs our help. <eob>
As YARID's programs <eol> have expanded, <eob> it has included an increasing range <eol> of nationalities -- <eob> Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian, <eob> Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese. <eob>
Today, YARID has supported <eol> over 3,000 refugees across Kampala <eob> and continues supporting more. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Refugees want empowerment, not handouts. <eob>
We know our community better than anyone. <eob>
We understand the challenges <eol> and opportunities we face <eob> to become self-reliant. <eob>
I know better than anyone <eob> that initiatives created by refugees work. <eob>
They need to be internationally <eol> recognized and supported. <eob>
Give us the support we deserve, <eob> and we will pay you back with interest. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know who I'm envious of? <eob>
People who work in a job that has to do <eol> with their college major. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Journalists who studied journalism, <eob> engineers who studied engineering. <eob>
The truth is, these folks <eol> are no longer the rule, <eob> but the exception. <eob>
A 2010 study found <eol> that only a quarter of college graduates <eob> work in a field that relates <eol> to their degree. <eob>
I graduated with not one <eol> but two degrees in biology. <eob>
To my parents' dismay, <eol> I am neither a doctor nor a scientist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Years of studying DNA replication <eol> and photosynthesis <eob> did little to prepare me <eol> for a career in technology. <eob>
I had to teach myself everything <eol> from sales, marketing, strategy, <eob> even a little programming, on my own. <eob>
I had never held the title <eol> of Product Manager <eob> before I sent my resume <eol> in to Etsy. <eob>
I had already been turned down by Google <eol> and several other firms <eob> and was getting frustrated. <eob>
The company had recently gone public, <eob> so as part of my job application, <eob> I read the IPO filings from cover to cover <eob> and built a website from scratch <eol> which included my analysis of the business <eob> and four ideas for new features. <eob>
It turned out the team was actively <eol> working on two of those ideas <eob> and had seriously considered a third. <eob>
I got the job. <eob>
We all know people who were <eol> ignored or overlooked at first <eob> but went on to prove <eol> their critics wrong. <eob> My favorite story? <eob> Brian Acton, an engineering manager <eob> who was rejected by both Twitter and Facebook <eob> before cofounding WhatsApp, <eob> the mobile messaging platform that would sell for 19 billion dollars. <eob>
The hiring systems we built <eol> in the 20th century are failing us <eob> and causing us to miss out <eol> on people with incredible potential. <eob>
The advances in robotics <eol> and machine learning <eob> and transforming the way we work, <eob> automating routine tasks <eol> in many occupations <eob> while augmenting and amplifying human labor in others. <eob>
At this rate, we should all be expecting <eol> to do jobs we've never done before <eob> for the rest of our careers. <eob>
So what are the tools <eol> and strategies we need <eob> to identify tomorrow's high performers? <eob>
In search for answers, I've consulted <eol> with leaders across many sectors, <eob> read dozens of reports <eol> and research papers <eob> and conducted some of my own talent experiments. <eob>
My quest is far from over, <eob> but here are three ideas to take forward. <eob>
One: expand your search. <eob>
If we only look for talent <eol> in the same places we always do -- <eob> gifted child programs, <eol> Ivy League schools, <eob> prestigious organizations -- <eob> we're going to get the same results <eol> we always have. <eob>
Baseball was transformed <eol> when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics <eob> started recruiting players who didn't score highly <eob> on traditionally valued metrics, <eol> like runs batted in, <eob> but who had the ability to help <eol> the team score points <eob> and win games. <eob>
This idea is taking <eol> hold outside of sports. <eob>
The Head of Design and Research at Pinterest <eob> told me that they've built <eol> one of the most diverse <eob> and high-performing <eol> teams in Silicon Valley <eob> because they believe <eol> that no one type of person <eob> holds a monopoly on talent. <eob>
They've worked hard <eol> to look beyond major tech hubs <eob> and focus on designers' portfolios, <eob> not their pedigrees. <eob>
Two: hire for performance. <eob>
Inspired by my own job experience, <eob> I cofounded a hiring platform <eol> called Headlight, <eob> which gives candidates <eol> an opportunity to shine. <eob>
Just as teams have tryouts <eol> and plays have auditions, <eob> candidates should be asked <eol> to demonstrate their skills <eob> before they're hired. <eob>
Our clients are benefiting <eol> from 85 years of employment research, <eob> which shows that work samples <eob> are one of the best predictors <eol> of success on the job. <eob>
If you're hiring a data analyst, <eob> give them a spreadsheet of historical data <eol> and ask them for their key insights. <eob>
If you're hiring a marketing manager, <eob> have them plan a launch campaign <eol> for a new product. <eob>
And if you're a candidate, don't wait <eol> for an employer to ask. <eob>
Seek out ways to showcase <eol> your unique skills and abilities <eob> outside of just the standard resume <eol> and cover letter. <eob>
Three: get the bigger picture. <eob>
I've heard about recruiters who are quick <eol> to label a candidate a job-hopper <eob> based on a single short stint <eol> on their resume; <eob> read about professors who are more likely <eol> to ignore identical messages from students <eob> because their name was black <eol> or Asian instead of white. <eob>
I was almost put on a special <eol> needs track as a child. <eob>
A month into kindergarten, <eob> my teacher wrote a page-long memo <eob> noting that I was impulsive, <eob> had a short attention span, <eob> and despite my wonderful curiosity, <eob> I was exhausting to work with. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The principal asked my parents <eol> into a meeting, <eob> asked my mother if there had been <eol> complications at birth <eob> and suggested I meet with a school psychologist. <eob>
My father saw what was happening <eob> and quickly explained our family situation. <eob>
As recent immigrants, we lived <eol> in the attic <eob> of a home that cared for adults <eol> with mental disabilities. <eob>
My parents worked nights to make ends meet, <eob> and I had little opportunity <eol> to spend time with kids my own age. <eob>
Is it really a surprise <eol> that an understimulated five-year-old boy <eob> might be a little excited in a kindergarten classroom <eob> after an entire summer by himself? <eob>
Until we get a holistic view of someone, <eob> our judgment of them <eol> will always be flawed. <eob>
Let's stop equating <eol> experience with ability, <eob> credentials with competence. <eob>
Let's stop settling <eol> for the safe, familiar choice <eob> and leave the door open for someone <eol> who could be amazing. <eob>
We need employers to let go <eol> of outdated hiring practices <eob> and embrace new ways <eol> of identifying and cultivating talent, <eob> and candidates can help <eol> by learning to tell their story <eob> in powerful and compelling ways. <eob>
We could live in a world where people are seen <eol> for what they're truly capable of <eob> and have the opportunity to realize <eol> their full potential. <eob>
So let's go out and build it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's an African proverb that goes, <eob> "The lion's story <eol> will never be known <eob> as long as the hunter is the one to tell it." <eob>
More than a racial conversation, <eol> we need a racial literacy <eob> to decode the politics <eol> of racial threat in America. <eob>
Key to this literacy <eol> is a forgotten truth, <eob> that the more we understand <eob> that our cultural differences <eol> represent the power <eob> to heal the centuries <eob> of racial discrimination, <eob> dehumanization and illness. <eob>
Both of my parents were African-American. <eob>
My father was born in Southern Delaware, <eob> my mother, North Philadelphia, <eob> and these two places are as different <eol> from each other as east is from west, <eob> as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama. <eob>
My father's way of dealing <eol> with racial conflict <eob> was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy <eol> and I in church <eob> what seemed like 24 hours a day, <eol> seven days a week. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If anybody bothered us because <eol> of the color of our skin, <eob> he believed that you should pray for them, <eob> knowing that God would get them <eol> back in the end. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You could say that his racial-coping <eol> approach was spiritual -- <eob> for later on, one day, <eob> like Martin Luther King. <eob>
My mother's coping approach <eol> was a little different. <eob>
She was, uh, you could say, <eol> more relational -- <eob> right now, like, in your face, <eob> right now. <eob> More like Malcolm X. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She was raised from neighborhoods <eob> in which there was racial violence <eol> and segregation, <eob> where she was chased out of neighborhoods, <eob> and she exacted violence <eol> to chase others out of hers. <eob>
When she came to Southern Delaware, <eob> she thought she had come <eol> to a foreign country. <eob>
She didn't understand anybody, <eob> particularly the few black and brown folks <eob> who were physically deferential <eol> and verbally deferential <eob> in the presence of whites. <eob> Not my mother. <eob> When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked. <eob>
She didn't care what you thought. <eob>
And she pissed a lot of people off <eol> with her cultural style. <eob>
Before we get into the supermarket, <eob> she would give us the talk: <eob> "Don't ask for nothin', <eob> don't touch nothin'. <eob>
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? <eob>
I don't care if all the other children <eol> are climbing the walls. <eob>
They're not my children. <eob>
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? <eob> "In three-part harmony:" <eob> Yes, Mom. <eob> "Before we'd get into the supermarket, <eob> that talk was all we needed. <eob>
Now, how many of you ever got that talk? <eob>
How many of you ever give that talk? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How many of you ever give that talk <eob> today? <eob>
My mother didn't give us the talk <eol> because she was worried about money <eob> or reputation <eob> or us misbehaving. <eob> We never misbehaved. <eob> We were too scared. <eob>
We were in church 24 hours a day, <eob> seven days a week. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She gave us that talk to remind us <eob> that some people in the world <eol> would interpret us as misbehaving <eob> just by being black. <eob>
Not every parent has to worry <eol> about their children being misjudged <eob> because of the color of their skin, <eob> just by breathing. <eob>
So we get into the supermarket, <eob> and people look at us -- <eob> stare at us as if we just stole something. <eob>
Every now and then, a salesperson <eol> would do something or say something <eob> because they were pissed <eol> with our cultural style, <eob> and it would usually happen <eol> at the conveyor belt. <eob>
And the worst thing they could do <eol> was to throw our food into the bag. <eob>
And when that happened, it was on. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My mother began to tell them who they were, <eob> who their family was, <eob> where to go, <eob> how fast to get there. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If you haven't been cursed out by my mother, <eol> you haven't lived. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The person would be on the floor, <eob> writhing in utter decay and decomposition, <eob> whimpering in a pool of racial shame. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, both my parents were Christians. <eob>
The difference is my father <eol> prayed before a racial conflict <eob> and my mother prayed after. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is a time, if you use <eol> both of their strategies, <eob> if you use them <eol> in the right time and the right way. <eob>
But it's never a time -- <eob> there's a time for conciliation, <eob> there's a time for confrontation, <eob> but it's never a time to freeze up <eol> like a deer in the headlights, <eob> and it's never a time to lash out <eol> in heedless, thoughtless anger. <eob>
The lesson in this is <eob> that when it comes to race relations, <eob> sometimes, we've got to know how to pray, <eob> think through, process, prepare. <eob>
And other times, we've got <eol> to know how to push, <eob> how to do something. <eob>
And I'm afraid that neither <eol> of these two skills -- <eob> preparing, <eob> pushing -- <eob> are prevalent in our society today. <eob>
If you look at the neuroscience research <eob> which says that when we are racially threatened, <eob> our brains go on lockdown, <eob> and we dehumanize black and brown people. <eob>
Our brains imagine that children and adults <eol> are older than they really are, <eob> larger than they really are <eob> and closer than they really are. <eob>
When we're at our worst, <eol> we convince ourselves <eob> that they don't deserve affection <eol> or protection. <eob>
At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, <eob> we know that some of the scariest <eol> moments are racial encounters, <eob> some of the scariest <eol> moments that people will ever face. <eob>
If you look at the police encounters <eol> that have led to some wrongful deaths <eob> of mostly Native Americans <eol> and African-Americans in this country, <eob> they've lasted about two minutes. <eob>
our brains go on lockdown, <eob> Within 60 seconds, <eob>
And when we're unprepared, <eob> we overreact. <eob>
At best, we shut down. <eob>
At worst, we shoot first <eol> and ask no questions. <eob>
Imagine if we could reduce <eol> the intensity of threat <eob> within those 60 seconds <eob> and keep our brains from going <eol> on lockdown. <eob>
Imagine how many children <eol> would get to come home from school <eob> or 7-Eleven <eob> without getting expelled or shot. <eob>
Imagine how many mothers and fathers <eol> wouldn't have to cry. <eob>
Racial socialization <eol> can help young people negotiate 60-second encounters, <eob> but it's going to take more than a chat. <eob>
It requires a racial literacy. <eob>
Now, how do parents <eol> have these conversations, <eob> and what is a racial literacy? <eob> Thank you for asking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A racial literacy involves the ability to read, <eob> recast and resolve a racially <eol> stressful encounter. <eob>
Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens <eob> and noticing our stress reactions to it. <eob>
Recasting involves <eob> taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami <eol> interpretation of this moment <eob> and reducing it to a mountain-climbing experience, <eob> one that is -- <eob> from impossible situation <eol> to one that is much more doable <eob> and challenging. <eob>
Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves <eob> being able to make a healthy decision <eob> that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, <eol> "That didn't bother me," <eob> or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment. <eob>
Now, we can teach parents <eol> and children how to read, recast and resolve <eob> using a mindfulness strategy <eol> we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate, <eob> breathe and exhale." <eob> Stay with me. <eob> "Calculate" asks, <eob> "What feeling am I having right now, <eob> and how intense is it on a scale <eol> of one to 10?" <eob> "Locate" asks, "Where in my body do I feel it?" <eob> And be specific, <eob> like the Native American girl <eol> at a Chicago fifth-grade school said to me, <eob> "I feel angry at a nine because I'm the only Native American. <eob>
And I can feel it in my stomach, <eob> like a bunch of butterflies <eol> are fighting with each other, <eob> so much so that they fly up <eol> into my throat and choke me. <eob> "The more detailed you can be, <eob> the easier it is to reduce that spot." <eob> Communicate "asks," <eob> What self-talk and what images <eol> are coming in my mind? <eob> "And if you really want help, try breathing in <eob> and exhaling slowly. <eob>
With the help of my many colleagues <eol> at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, <eob> we use in-the-moment stress-reduction <eob> in several research and therapy projects. <eob>
One project is where we use basketball <eol> to help youth manage their emotions <eob> during 60-second eruptions <eol> on the court. <eob>
Another project, with the help <eol> of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott, <eob> we leverage the cultural style <eol> of African-American barbershops, <eob> where we train black barbers to be health <eol> educators in two areas: <eob> one, to safely reduce the sexual risk <eol> in their partner relationships; <eob> and the other, <eob> to stop retaliation violence. <eob>
The cool part is the barbers use <eol> their cultural style <eob> to deliver this health education <eol> to 18- to 24-year-old men <eob> while they're cutting their hair. <eob>
Another project is where we teach teachers <eob> how to read, recast and resolve <eol> stressful moments in the classroom. <eob>
And a final project, in which we teach <eol> parents and their children separately <eob> to understand their racial traumas <eob> before we bring them together <eol> to problem-solve daily microaggressions. <eob>
Now, racially literate conversations <eol> with our children can be healing, <eob> but it takes practice. <eob>
And I know some of you are saying, <eol> "Practice? <eob> Practice? <eob> We're talking about practice?" <eob> Yes, we are talking about practice. <eob>
I have two sons. <eob> My oldest, Bryan, is 26, <eob> and my youngest, Julian, is 12. <eob>
And we do not have time <eol> to talk about how that happened. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But, <eob> when I think of them, <eob> they are still babies to me, <eob> and I worry every day that the world <eol> will misjudge them. <eob>
In August of 2013, <eob> Julian, who was eight at the time, <eol> and I were folding laundry, <eob> which in and of itself is such <eol> a rare occurrence, <eob> I should have known something <eol> strange was going to happen. <eob>
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents, <eob> and they were crying <eob> because of the acquittal <eol> of George Zimmerman. <eob>
And Julian was glued to the TV. <eob>
He had a thousand questions, <eol> and I was not prepared. <eob>
He wanted to know why: <eob> Why would a grown man stalk <eol> and hunt down and kill <eob> an unarmed 17-year-old boy? <eob>
And I did not know what to say. <eob>
The best thing that could <eol> come out of my mouth was, <eob> "Julian, sometimes in this world, <eol> there are people <eob> who look down on black and brown people <eob> and do not treat them -- <eol> and children, too -- <eob> do not treat them as human." <eob> He interpreted the whole situation <eol> as sad. <eob>
(Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad. <eob> "We don't care. <eob>
You're not our kind. " <eob>
HS: Yes. <eob>
JS: It's like, "We're better than you." <eob>
JS: "And there's nothing <eol> you can do about that. <eob>
And if you scare me, <eol> or something like that, <eob> I will shoot you because <eol> I'm scared of you." <eob>
HS: Exactly. <eob> But if somebody's stalking you -- <eob>
JS: It's not the same for everyone else. <eob>
HS: It's not always the same, no. <eob>
JS: Yeah, because <eol> people can disrespect you. <eob>
HS: Exactly. <eob>
JS: And think that you're, <eob> "You don't look -- <eol> you don't look like you're ..." <eob> It's like they're saying <eol> that "You don't look right, <eob> so I guess I have the right <eol> to disrespect you." <eob>
HS: Yeah, and that's what we call, <eob> we call that racism. <eob>
And <eob> we call that racism, <eob> Julian, <eob> and yes, some people — other people — can wear a hoodie, <eob> and nothing happens to them. <eob>
But you and Trayvon might, <eob> and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe. <eob>
(Voice-over) HS: And that's why -- <eob>
JS: So you mean like, <eol> when you said "other people," <eob> you mean, like if Trayvon <eol> was a white, <eob> um, that he wouldn't <eol> be disrespected like that? <eob>
HS: Yes, <eob> Julian, Daddy meant white people <eob> when I said, "other people," all right? <eob>
So there was a way <eol> in which I was so awkward in the beginning, <eob> but once I started getting <eol> my rhythm and my groove, <eob> I started talking about stereotypes <eol> and issues of discrimination, <eob> and just when I was <eol> getting my groove on, <eob> Julian interrupted me. <eob>
(Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous, <eol> or you're a criminal because you're black, <eob> and you're a child or a boy -- <eob> That is wrong, it doesn't matter who does it. <eob>
JS: Dad, I need to stop you there. <eob>
HS: What? <eob>
JS: Remember when we were ... <eob>
HS: So he interrupts me <eol> to tell me a story <eob> about when he was racially <eol> threatened at a swimming pool with a friend <eob> by two grown white men, <eob> which his mother confirmed. <eob>
And I felt happy that he was able <eol> to talk about it; <eob> it felt like he was getting it. <eob>
We moved from the sadness <eol> of Trayvon's parents <eob> and started talking <eol> about George Zimmerman's parents, <eob> which, I read in a magazine, <eob> condoned the stalking of Trayvon. <eob>
And Julian's reaction to me was priceless. <eob>
It made me feel like he was getting it. <eob>
(Voice-over) JS: <eol> What did they say about him? <eob>
HS: Well, I think they basically felt <eol> that he was justified <eob> to follow and stalk -- <eob>
JS: What the -- ? <eob>
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong. <eob>
JS: That's -- one minute. <eob>
So they're saying he has the right <eol> to follow a black kid, <eob> get in a fight with him and shoot him? <eob>
HS: As Julian was getting it, <eob> I started to lose it. <eob>
Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking: <eob> What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon? <eob> I calculated my anger at a 10. <eob>
I found, located, my right leg <eol> was shaking uncontrollably <eob> like I was running. <eob>
And in my mind's eye, <eol> I could see somebody chasing Julian, <eob> and I was chasing them. <eob>
And the only thing <eol> that could come out of my mouth <eob> was if anybody tries <eol> to bother my child ... <eob>
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody <eol> tries to bother my child ... <eob> mmm, mmm, mmm. <eob>
JS: What will happen? <eob>
HS: Well, they better run. <eob>
JS: Because what? HS: I'm gonna get 'em. <eob>
JS: See? (Laughs) <eob>
HS: Oh, yeah. <eob>
JS: Then they're gonna get you <eol> because they might have weapons. <eob>
HS: Well, you know what, <eol> I'm gonna call police, too, like I should. <eob>
But I feel like I wanna get 'em. <eob>
But you can't; you're right, <eol> you can't just go chasing people. <eob>
JS: They can be armed. <eob>
HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right. <eob>
I feel like I wanna chase 'em. <eob>
JS: Plus they could be an army <eol> or something. <eob>
HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna go get 'em, messing with my son. <eob>
I don't like that. <eob>
JS: Um ... <eob>
HS: But you right. <eob>
You gotta be careful. <eob>
And um, you gotta be careful. <eob>
You never know what some crazy <eol> people will think about you. <eob>
Just as long as you believe <eol> you're beautiful <eob> like Daddy believes you're <eol> beautiful and handsome, <eob> and Mommy believes you're <eol> beautiful and handsome and smart. <eob>
And you deserve to be on this planet, <eob> just as happy and beautiful <eol> and smart as you want to be. <eob>
You can do anything you want, baby. <eob>
HS: Racial socialization is not <eol> just what parents teach their children. <eob>
It's also how children respond <eol> to what their parents teach. <eob>
Is my child prepared? <eob>
Can they recognize when a racial elephant <eol> shows up in a room? <eob>
Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation <eob> down to a mountain-climbing adventure <eob> that they can engage and not run away? <eob>
Can they make a healthy <eol> and just decision in 60 seconds? <eob> Can I? <eob> Can you? <eob>
Yes, we can. <eob> We can build healthier relationships around race <eob> if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, <eob> breathe and exhale <eob> in the middle of our most threatening moments, <eob> when we come face-to-face <eol> with our lesser selves. <eob>
If you take the centuries <eol> of racial rage <eob> that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls -- <eob> and anything that affects <eol> our bodies, minds and souls affects our health -- <eob> we could probably use gun control <eol> for our hearts. <eob>
I just want what all parents <eol> want for their children <eob> when we're not around: <eob> affection and protection. <eob>
When police and teachers see my children, <eob> I want them to imagine <eol> their own, <eob> because I believe if you see <eol> our children as your children, <eob> you won't shoot them. <eob>
With racial literacy, and yes, practice, <eob> we can decode the racial trauma <eol> from our stories, <eob> and our healing will come in the telling. <eob>
But we must never forget <eob> that our cultural differences <eol> are full of <eob> affection and protection, <eob> and remember always that the lion's story <eol> will never be known <eob> as long as the hunter is the one to tell it. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was around 10 when one day, <eob> I discovered a box of my father's old things. <eob> In it, under a bunch of his college textbooks, <eob> was a pair of black corduroy bell-bottom pants. <eob>
These pants were awful -- <eob> musty and moth-eaten. <eob>
And of course, I fell in love with them. <eob>
I'd never seen anything like them. <eob>
Until that day, <eob> all I'd ever known and worn <eol> was my school uniform, <eob> which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for, <eob> because from quite a young age, <eob> I'd realized I was somewhat different. <eob>
I'd never been one of the boys my age; <eob> terrible at sports, <eob> possibly the unmanliest little boy ever. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was bullied quite a bit. <eob>
And so, I figured that to survive <eol> I would be invisible, <eob> and the uniform helped me <eob> to seem no different from any other child. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, almost. <eob> This became my daily prayer: <eob> "God, please make me <eol> just like everybody else." <eob> I think this went straight <eol> to God's voicemail, though. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And eventually, it became pretty clear <eob> that I was not growing up to be <eol> the son that my father always wanted. <eob> Sorry, Dad. <eob>
No, I was not going to magically change. <eob>
And over time, I grew less and less sure <eol> that I actually wanted to. <eob>
Therefore, the day those black corduroy bell-bottom pants <eol> came into my life, <eob> something happened. <eob>
I didn't see pants; <eob> I saw opportunity. <eob>
The very next day, <eol> I had to wear them to school, <eob> come what may. <eob>
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants <eol> and belted them tight, <eob> almost instantly, I developed <eol> what can only be called a swagger. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> All the way to school, <eob> and then all the way back <eol> because I was sent home at once -- <eob>
I finally didn't care anymore <eol> that I could not conform. <eob> That day, I was suddenly celebrating it. <eob>
That day, instead of being invisible, <eob> I chose to be looked at, <eob> just by wearing something different. <eob>
That day, I discovered <eol> the power of what we wear. <eob>
That day, I discovered <eol> the power of fashion, <eob> and I've been in love with it ever since. <eob>
Fashion can communicate our differences <eol> to the world for us. <eob>
And with this simple act of truth, <eob> I realized that these differences -- <eob> they stopped being our shame. <eob>
They became our expressions, <eob> expressions of our very unique identities. <eob>
And we should express ourselves, <eob> wear what we want. <eob>
What's the worst that could happen? <eob>
The fashion police are going to get <eol> you for being so last season? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> Well, unless the fashion police <eol> meant something entirely different. <eob>
Nobel Prize laureate Malala <eol> survived Taliban extremists <eob> in October 2012. <eob>
However, in October 2017, <eol> she faced a different enemy, <eob> when online trolls viciously attacked the photograph <eob> that showed the 20-year-old <eol> wearing jeans that day. <eob>
The comments, <eob> the hatred she received, <eob> ranged from "How long before <eol> the scarf comes off?" <eob> to, and I quote, <eob> "That's the reason the bullet directly targeted her head <eob> a long time ago." <eob> Now, when most of us decide <eol> to wear a pair of jeans <eob> someplace like New York, London, Milan, Paris, <eob> we possibly don't stop to think that it's a privilege; <eob> something that somewhere else can have consequences, <eob> something that can one day be taken away from us. <eob>
My grandmother was a woman <eol> who took extraordinary pleasure <eob> in dressing up. <eob>
Her fashion was colorful. <eob>
And the color she loved to wear <eol> so much was possibly the only thing <eob> that was truly about her, <eob> the one thing she had agency over, <eob> because like most other women <eol> of her generation in India, <eob> she'd never been allowed to exist <eob> beyond what was dictated <eol> by custom and tradition. <eob>
She'd been married at 17, <eob> and after 65 years of marriage, <eol> when my grandfather died suddenly one day, <eob> her loss was unbearable. <eob>
But that day, she was going <eol> to lose something else as well, <eob> the one joy she had: <eob> to wear color. <eob>
In India, according to custom, <eob> when a Hindu woman becomes a widow, <eob> all she's allowed to wear is white <eob> from the day of the death of her husband. <eob>
No one made my grandmother wear white. <eob>
However, every woman she'd known <eol> who had outlived her husband, <eob> including her mother, <eob> had done it. <eob>
This oppression was so internalized, <eob> so deep-rooted, <eob> that she herself refused a choice. <eob>
She passed away this year, <eob> and until the day she died, <eob> she continued to wear only white. <eob>
I have a photograph <eol> with her from earlier, happier times. <eob>
In it, you can't really see <eol> what she's wearing -- <eob> the photo is in black and white. <eob>
However, from the way she's smiling in it, <eob> you just know she's wearing color. <eob>
This is also what fashion can do. <eob>
It has the power to fill us with joy, <eob> the joy of freedom to choose <eol> for ourselves how we want to look, <eob> how we want to live -- <eob> a freedom worth fighting for. <eob>
And fighting for freedom, <eol> protest, comes in many forms. <eob>
Widows in India like my grandmother, <eol> thousands of them, <eob> live in a city called Vrindavan. <eob>
And so, it's been a sea <eol> of white for centuries. <eob>
However, only as recently as 2013, <eob> the widows of Vrindavan have started to celebrate Holi, <eob> the Indian festival of color, <eob> which they are prohibited <eol> from participating in. <eob>
On this one day in March, <eob> these women take the traditional <eol> colored powder of the festival <eob> and color each other. <eob>
With every handful of the powder <eol> they throw into the air, <eob> their white saris slowly start <eol> to suffuse with color. <eob> And they don't stop <eol> until they're completely covered <eob> in every hue of the rainbow <eol> that's forbidden to them. <eob>
The color washes off the next day, <eob> however, for that moment in time, <eob> it's their beautiful disruption. <eob>
This disruption, <eob> any kind of dissonance, <eob> can be the first gauntlet we throw down <eol> in a battle against oppression. <eob>
And fashion -- <eob> it can create visual disruption for us -- <eob> on us, literally. <eob>
Lessons of defiance have always been taught <eob> by fashion's great revolutionaries: <eob> its designers. <eob>
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us <eol> that women can be kings. <eob>
Thom Browne -- <eob> he taught us that men can wear heels. <eob>
And Alexander McQueen, <eol> in his spring 1999 show, <eob> had two giant robotic arms <eol> in the middle of his runway. <eob>
And as the model, Shalom Harlow <eol> began to spin in between them, <eob> these two giant arms -- <eob> furtively at first and then furiously, <eob> began to spray color onto her. <eob>
McQueen, thus, <eob> before he took his own life, <eob> taught us that this body <eol> of ours is a canvas, <eob> a canvas we get <eol> to paint however we want. <eob>
Somebody who loved this world of fashion <eob> was Karar Nushi. <eob>
He was a student and actor from Iraq. <eob>
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes. <eob>
However, he soon started receiving <eol> death threats for how he looked. <eob> He remained unfazed. <eob> He remained fabulous, <eob> until July 2017, <eob> when Karar was discovered <eol> dead on a busy street in Baghdad. <eob>
He'd been kidnapped. <eob>
He'd been tortured. <eob>
And eyewitnesses say that his body <eol> showed multiple wounds. <eob> Stab wounds. <eob>
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar, <eob> Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot <eol> multiple times in May 2016. <eob>
She was taken to the hospital, <eob> but because she dressed <eol> in women's clothing, <eob> she was refused access to either the men's <eol> or the women's wards. <eob>
What we choose to wear can sometimes <eol> be literally life and death. <eob>
And even in death, we sometimes <eol> don't get to choose. <eob>
Alisha died that day <eob> and then was buried as a man. <eob>
What kind of world is this? <eob>
Well, it's one in which <eol> it's natural to be afraid, <eob> to be frightened of this surveillance, <eob> this violence against our bodies <eol> and what we wear on them. <eob>
However, the greater fear <eol> is that once we surrender, <eob> blend in <eob> and begin to disappear one after the other, <eob> the more normal this false conformity will look, <eob> the less shocking this oppression <eol> will feel. <eob>
For the children we are raising, <eob> the injustice of today <eol> could become the ordinary of tomorrow. <eob>
They'll get used to this, <eob> and they, too, might begin <eol> to see anything different as dirty, <eob> something to be hated, <eob> something to be extinguished, <eob> like lights to be put out, <eob> one by one, <eob> until darkness becomes a way of life. <eob>
However, if I today, <eob> then you tomorrow, <eob> maybe even more of us someday, <eob> if we embrace our right to look like ourselves, <eob> then in the world <eol> that's been violently whitewashed, <eob> we will become the pinpricks <eol> of color pushing through, <eob> much like those widows of Vrindavan. <eob>
How then, with so many of us, <eob> will the crosshairs of a gun <eob> be able to pick out Karar, <eob> Malala, <eob> Alisha? <eob>
Can they kill us all? <eob>
The time is now to stand up, <eob> to stand out. <eob>
Where sameness is safeness, <eob> with something as simple <eol> as what we wear, <eob> we can draw every eye to ourselves <eob> to say that there are differences <eol> in this world, and there always will be. <eob>
Get used to it. <eob>
And this we can say without a single word. <eob>
Fashion can give us a language <eol> for dissent. <eob>
It can give us courage. <eob>
Fashion can let us literally wear <eol> our courage on our sleeves. <eob> So wear it. <eob> Wear it like armor. <eob>
Wear it because it matters. <eob>
And wear it because you matter. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A room full of boys. <eob>
A girl child, hardly nine or ten years old, <eob> she is sitting in the center <eol> of the room, surrounded by books. <eob>
She is the only girl among boys, <eob> and is barely missing her <eol> female cousins and friends, <eob> who are inside the home instead of the school, <eob> because they are not allowed <eol> to get an education alongside boys. <eob>
There isn't a single functional <eol> girls' school in her village. <eob>
She was born in a Baloch conservative tribe, <eob> where women and girls <eol> are a matter of honor. <eob>
She is the eldest in her family, <eob> and when she was about to be born, <eol> her parents wanted a baby boy. <eob>
But they had bad luck; <eol> a baby girl arrived. <eob>
It was customary in her family <eol> to keep girls inside the homes. <eob>
But her uncle, who was a university graduate, <eob> he wanted to give her an opportunity <eol> to see the world, <eob> to be part of the society. <eob>
Luckily, she has a name that can be used <eol> for both men and women. <eob>
So he saw a chance <eol> to change her course of life. <eob>
So he decided to raise her as a boy. <eob>
At three months old, <eob> she went from being a baby girl, <eol> to baby boy. <eob>
She is given a boy's getup. <eob>
She is allowed to go outside <eob> and get an education alongside boys. <eob>
She is free, she is confident. <eob>
She observes, she notes small, everyday injustices <eob> faced by women <eol> and girls in her village. <eob>
When newspapers arrive at her home, <eob> she watches as it passes <eol> from the eldest man to the youngest man. <eob>
By the time women get hold of the paper, <eob> it is old news. <eob>
She completes her eighth-grade year. <eob> Now fear starts to come in. <eob>
This will be the end <eol> of her education, <eob> because the only option <eol> for high school for further study <eob> is five kilometers away. <eob>
Boys have bicycles, they are free. <eob>
But she knows <eob> her father will not allow her <eol> to travel on her own, <eob> even if she were posing as a boy. <eob> "I can't let you do that. <eob>
And I don't have the time <eol> to walk you there and back. <eob>
Sorry, it is impossible." <eob> She gets very upset. <eob>
But a miracle happened. <eob>
A long-distance relative offers <eol> to teach her <eob> ninth- and tenth-grade curricula <eob> during summer vacations. <eob>
This is how she completed her matriculation. <eob>
The girl whom I am talking about to you <eob> is me, Shameem, who is talking before you now. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Throughout centuries, people <eol> have been fighting for their identity. <eob>
People have been loved, privileged, <eol> because of their identity, <eob> their nationality, their ethnicity. <eob>
Again, people have been hated, denied, <eob> because of their nationality, their identity, <eob> their race, their gender, <eol> their religion. <eob>
Identity determines <eol> your position in society, wherever you live. <eob>
So if you ask me, I would say <eol> I hate this question of identity. <eob>
Millions of girls in this world <eol> are being denied their basic rights <eob> because of being female. <eob>
I would have faced the same, <eol> if I hadn't been raised as a boy. <eob>
I was determined to continue <eol> my studies, to learn, to be free. <eob>
After my schooling, even enrolling in college <eol> was not easy for me. <eob>
I went on a three-day hunger strike. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Then, I got permission for college. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In that way, I completed my college. <eob>
Two years later, when the time came <eol> for me to go to university, <eob> my father turned his eyes, <eol> his attention, to my younger brothers. <eob>
They need to be in school, <eol> secure jobs and support the family. <eob>
And as a woman, my place was to be home. <eob>
But, I don't give up. <eob>
I sign up for a two-year program <eol> to become a lady health visitor. <eob>
Then I hear about Thardeep Rural Development Program, <eob> a non-profit organization <eol> working to empower rural communities. <eob> I sneak away. <eob> I travel five hours to interview <eol> for a position. <eob>
It is the first time I am the farthest from my home <eol> I have ever been. <eob>
I am closest to my freedom <eol> I have ever been. <eob>
Luckily, I got the job, <eob> but the hardest part is facing my father. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Relatives are already scaring him <eob> about his daughter wandering off, <eob> teasing him with talk of his daughter <eol> crossing the border. <eob>
When I return home, <eob> I want nothing more than just to accept <eol> the position in Thardeep. <eob>
So that night, I packed <eol> all my things in a bag, <eob> and I walked into <eol> my father's room and told him, <eob> "Tomorrow morning, <eol> the bus is going to come in. <eob>
If you believe in me, <eob> if you believe in me, <eob> you will wake me up <eol> and take me to the bus station. <eob>
If you don't, I'll understand." <eob> Then I went to sleep. <eob>
The next morning, my father <eol> was standing beside me <eob> to take me to the bus stop. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
That day, I understood <eol> the importance of words. <eob>
I understood how words <eol> affect our hearts, <eob> how words play an important role <eol> in our lives. <eob>
I understood words are <eol> more powerful than fighting. <eob>
At TRDP, I saw there was a Pakistan <eol> which I didn't know, <eob> a country much more complex <eol> than I had realized. <eob>
Until that, I thought <eol> I had a difficult life. <eob>
But here, I saw what women in other parts <eol> of Pakistan were experiencing. <eob>
It really opened my eyes. <eob>
Some women had 11 children <eol> but nothing to feed them. <eob>
For getting water, they would walk <eol> three hours every day to wells. <eob>
The nearest hospital <eol> was at least 32 kilometers away. <eob>
So if a woman is in labor, <eob> she travels by camel <eol> to get to the hospital. <eob>
The distance is great; <eol> she may die on her way. <eob>
So now, this became more <eol> than just a job for me. <eob>
I discovered my power. <eob>
Now, as I was getting salary, <eob> I started sending back money to my home. <eob>
Relatives and neighbors <eol> were noticing this. <eob>
Now they started to understand <eol> the importance of education. <eob>
By that time, some other parents <eol> started sending their daughters to school. <eob>
Slowly, it became easier and acceptable <eob> for young women to be in college. <eob>
Today, there isn't a single <eol> girl out of school in my village. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Girls are doing jobs in health sites, <eol> even in police. <eob> Life was good. <eob> But somewhere in my heart, <eob> I realized that my region, beyond my village <eob> needs further change. <eob>
This was also the time <eol> when I joined Acumen Fellowship. <eob>
There, I met leaders like me <eol> across the country. <eob>
And I saw they are <eol> taking risks in their lives. <eob>
I started to understand <eob> what leadership really means. <eob>
So I decided to go back to my region <eob> and take a position <eol> as a teacher in a remote school, <eob> a school that I have to reach by bus -- <eob> two hours traveling, every morning and evening. <eob>
Though it was hard, on my first day I knew <eob> I made the right decision. <eob>
The first day I walked into the school, <eob> I saw all these little Shameems staring back at me -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
with dreams in their eyes, <eob> the same dream of freedom <eol> which I had in my childhood. <eob>
So the girls are eager to learn, <eol> but the school is understaffed. <eob>
Girls sit hopeful, <eob> learn nothing, <eob> and they leave. <eob>
I can't bear to see this happening. <eob>
There was no turning back. <eob>
I found my purpose. <eob>
I enlisted a few of my friends <eol> to help me to teach. <eob>
I'm introducing my girls <eol> to the outside world <eob> by extracurricular activities and books. <eob>
I share with them the profiles <eol> of the world's best leaders, <eob> like Martin Luther King <eol> and Nelson Mandela. <eob>
Last year, a few of our students <eol> went to college. <eob>
For me, I never stop studying. <eob>
Today, I'm working <eol> to complete my PhD in education -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
which will allow me <eol> to gain a management position <eob> in the school system, <eob> and I will be able <eol> to make more decisions <eob> and play a pivotal role in the system. <eob>
I believe that <eol> without educating the girls, <eob> we may not make world peace. <eob>
We may not reduce child marriage. <eob>
We may not reduce infant mortality rate. <eob>
We may not reduce maternal mortality rate. <eob>
For this, we have to continuously <eob> and collectively work together. <eob>
At least I am playing my role, <eob> though the destination is not close. <eob>
The road is not easy. <eob>
But I have dreams in my eyes, <eob> and I am not going to look back now. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
One winter morning, a couple of years ago, <eob> I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, <eob> and noticed a haze hanging over the city. <eob>
I make that drive on most days, <eob> so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed <eol> this before. <eob>
Johannesburg <eol> is known for its distinctive skyline, <eob> which I could barely see that morning. <eob>
It didn't take long for me to realize <eol> that I was looking at an enormous cloud <eob> of air pollution. <eob>
The contrast between the scenic environment <eol> I knew <eob> and this smog-covered skyline <eob> stirred up something within me. <eob>
I was appalled by the possibility <eol> of this city of bright and vivid sunsets <eob> being overrun by a dull haze. <eob>
At that moment, I felt an urge <eol> to do something about it, <eob> but I didn't know what. <eob>
All I knew was I couldn't <eol> just stand idly by. <eob>
The main challenge was, <eob> I didn't know much about environmental <eol> science <eob> air-quality management <eob> or atmospheric chemistry. <eob>
I am a computer engineer, <eob> and I was pretty sure I couldn't code <eol> my way out of this air pollution problem. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Who was I to do anything about this issue? <eob>
I was but a citizen. <eob>
In the following years, <eol> I learned a very important lesson, <eob> a lesson we all need to take to heart <eol> if we are to work towards a better future. <eob>
Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, <eob> your outside expertise may hold the key <eob> to solving big problems within that domain. <eob>
Sometimes the unique perspective <eol> you have <eob> can result in unconventional thinking <eol> that can move the needle, <eob> but you need to be bold <eol> enough to try. <eob>
That's the only way you'll ever know. <eob>
What I knew back then <eob> was that if I was even going <eol> to try to make a difference, <eob> I had to get smart about air pollution first, <eob> and so I became a student again. <eob>
I did a bit of basic research <eob> and soon learned that air pollution <eob> is the world's biggest environmental <eol> health risk. <eob>
Data from the World Health Organization <eob> shows that almost 14 percent <eol> of all deaths worldwide in 2012 <eob> were attributable to household <eol> and ambient air pollution, <eob> with most occurring in low- <eol> and middle-income countries. <eob>
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year <eob> than malaria and HIV / AIDS. <eob>
In Africa, premature deaths <eol> from unsafe sanitation <eob> or childhood malnutrition <eob> pale in comparison to deaths <eol> due to air pollution, <eob> and it comes at a huge economic cost: <eob> over 400 billion <eol> US dollars as of 2013, <eob> according to a study by the Organisation <eol> for Economic Cooperation and Development. <eob>
Now, in my work, <eob> I explore new frontiers <eol> for artificial intelligence, <eob> where the symbiotic relationship <eol> between man and machine <eob> can find a beneficial footing and help us <eol> to make better decisions. <eob>
As I thought about the air pollution problem, <eob> it became clear that we needed <eol> to find a way to make better decisions <eob> about how we manage air pollution, <eob> and given the scale of the problem, <eob> it was necessary to do it <eol> in a collaborative way. <eob>
So I decided I'd better get to know <eol> some people working within the field. <eob>
I started to speak to officials <eol> from the City of Johannesburg <eob> and other surrounding cities, <eob> and I engaged the local <eol> scientific community, <eob> and I also made a few cold calls. <eob>
The process of engagement <eol> I embarked upon <eob> helped me to develop <eol> a deeper understanding of the problem. <eob>
It also helped me to avoid the trap <eob> people in my profession <eol> sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, <eob> where we are quick to apply a technology <eob> before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand. <eob>
I began to develop an idea <eob> about what I could do <eol> to improve the situation. <eob>
I started by simply asking myself <eob> how I could bring together in some meaningful way <eob> my skills in software engineering <eol> and artificial intelligence <eob> and the expertise of the people <eol> I'd reached out to. <eob>
I wanted to create an online <eob> air-quality management <eob> platform <eob> that would uncover trends in pollution <eob> and project into the future <eob> to determine what outcomes can be expected. <eob>
I was determined to see my idea <eol> translate into a practical solution, <eob> but I faced uncertainty <eob> and had no guarantee of success. <eob>
What I had was a very particular set <eol> of engineering skills, <eob> skills I'd acquired <eol> over my career <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
that were new to people who had been working <eol> on the air pollution problem <eob> for so many years. <eob>
What I have come to realize <eol> is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, <eob> one new skill set, <eob> can make the conditions right <eol> for something remarkable to happen. <eob>
Our willpower and imagination <eol> are a guiding light, <eob> enabling us to chart new paths <eol> and navigate through obstacles. <eob>
Armed with a firmer understanding <eol> of the air pollution problem, <eob> and having managed to source <eol> over a decade's worth of data <eob> on air pollutant levels <eob> and the meteorological conditions <eol> for in and around Johannesburg, <eob> my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself <eob> created an air-quality decision support system <eob> that lives in the cloud. <eob>
This software system analyzes historical <eol> and real-time data <eob> to uncover the spatial-temporal <eol> trends in pollution. <eob>
We then used new machine learning technology <eob> to predict future levels of pollution <eob> for several different pollutants days in advance. <eob>
This means that citizens <eol> can make better decisions <eob> about their daily movements <eob> and about where to settle <eol> their families. <eob>
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, <eob> identify heavy polluters, <eob> and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities <eob> to scale back their operations. <eob>
Through assisted scenario planning, <eob> city planners can also <eol> make better decisions <eob> about how to extend infrastructure, <eob> such as human settlements <eol> or industrial zones. <eob>
We completed a pilot of our technology <eob> that was run over a period of 120 days, <eob> covering all of South Africa. <eob>
Our results were confirmed <eob> when we demonstrated <eol> a tight correlation <eob> between the forecasting data <eob> and the data we were getting on the ground. <eob>
Through our leadership, <eob> we have brought cutting-edge, <eol> world-leading assets <eob> that can perform air-quality forecasting <eob> at an unprecedented resolution <eol> and accuracy, <eob> benefiting the city that I drove into one winter <eol> morning not very long ago, <eob> and thought to myself, <eob> "Something is wrong here. <eob>
I wonder what can be done? " <eob>
So here is the point: <eob> What if I'd not investigated the problem <eob> of air pollution <eob> further? <eob>
What if I'd not shown some concern <eol> for the state of the environment <eob> and just hoped that someone, somewhere, <eol> was taking care of the matter? <eob>
What I have learned is that, <eob> when embarking <eol> on a challenging endeavor <eob> that advances a cause <eol> that we firmly believe in, <eob> it is important to focus <eol> on the possibility of success <eob> and consider the consequence of not acting. <eob>
We should not get distracted <eol> by resistance and opposition, <eob> but this should motivate us further. <eob>
So wherever you are in the world, <eob> the next time you find <eob> that there's some natural curiosity you have <eob> that is being piqued, <eob> and it's about something <eol> you care about, <eob> and you have some crazy <eol> or bold ideas, <eob> and perhaps it's outside <eol> the realm of your expertise, <eob> ask yourself this: <eob> Why not? <eob>
Why not <eob> just go ahead and tackle the problem <eob> as best as you can, in your own way? <eob>
You may be pleasantly surprised. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In 1996, I was commissioned <eol> by the Guggenheim Museum <eob> to execute a large body of work <eol> called "Uses of Evidence." <eob> It was a cube -- <eob> a very well large cube, at that. <eob>
Each side had a window <eob> in order for the spectators <eol> to view the interior of the structure. <eob>
The exterior of the structure <eol> was a collage of Africa and Africans <eob> as portrayed in the Western media <eol> and literature. <eob>
A look through the windows <eol> revealed a sharp contrast: <eob> within the cubes <eol> are tranquil, civilized, domestic images <eob> of African family members, friends <eob> and Nigerian professionals, <eob> ranging from writers, <eol> poets, fashion designers, etc. <eob> The thing is, <eob> both the exterior and the interior images <eol> are quite true. <eob>
But the images captured by Western media <eob> overwhelmingly depict Africans <eol> as basically primitive at best, <eob> or barely distinguishable <eol> from the African animals. <eob>
Not much has changed, <eol> I'm afraid, since 1996, <eob> when I executed this work. <eob>
I began my professional <eol> photography practice in 1994, <eob> but my passion and enthusiasm <eol> for photography <eob> goes back to childhood, <eob> when my parents arranged <eol> for us to be photographed <eob> by a professional photographer <eob> on almost a monthly basis. <eob>
It was also an opportunity <eol> for my siblings to dress up in our latest gear, <eob> made by our tailor. <eob>
Later, when I was in boarding school, <eob> my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras, <eob> and then I began to experiment <eol> with self-portraiture, <eob> or what I would call <eob> "proto-selfie auto-portraits." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> "Cover Girl 1994" was my first major work <eob> that was critically well received <eol> in the US and Europe <eob> and quite instantly became a part <eol> of the school anthologies <eob> at universities and colleges. <eob>
With the "Cover Girl" series, <eob> I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover <eob> with imagery totally unexpected, <eol> yet profoundly reasonable. <eob>
The "Cover Girl" series <eol> proposed a different way <eob> the African can be represented <eol> in a more complex manner. <eob>
Like "Cover Girl," <eol> the "Sartorial Anarchy" series <eob> is made up of self-portraits. <eob>
It is an ongoing body <eol> of work, started in 2010. <eob>
In each image, <eol> I married disparate costumes <eob> from widely diverse traditions, <eol> countries and time frames. <eob>
And in mixing eras, cultures, <eob> I was able to bring harmony, as it were, <eob> to their similarly irreconcilable differences. <eob>
These differences became a source <eob> of inspired artistic celebration. <eob>
For example, <eob> in "Sartorial Anarchy #4," <eob> I mixed a boater hat, <eob> inspired by the traditional <eol> Eton-Oxford College Boat Race, <eob> with a green Afghan traditional coat <eob> and an American Boy Scout shirt -- <eob> a culture clash that works. <eob>
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5," <eob> I wore a macaroni wig, <eob> inspired by eighteenth-century macaroni headgear <eol> from England. <eob>
This was paired with a British <eol> Norfolk jacket, <eob> Yoruba Nigerian trousers, <eob> and, improbably, <eol> a South African Zulu fighting stick. <eob>
All harmoniously coexist on one body. <eob>
And with "Sartorial Anarchy," <eol> I began to invest more <eob> into the organization of my pictures. <eob>
I also began to investigate <eol> the vast possibilities of color: <eob> its emotional values, <eob> psychological impulse, <eob> poetic allure <eob> and a boundless capacity <eol> beyond the realm of meaning and logic. <eob>
Now, enter Nollywood. <eob> In October of 2014, <eob> I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, <eol> after over three decades away <eob> and took photographs <eol> of 64 Nollywood personalities. <eob>
I captured a cross section <eol> of the industry, <eob> as well as the next generation <eol> of rising stars. <eob>
Nollywood is the first time <eol> that you have a school of African filmmakers <eob> truly, truly, profoundly in charge <eol> of telling African stories. <eob>
In their varied movies -- <eob> from romantic movies, horror films, <eol> gangster movies to action movies -- <eob> one sees Nigerians portrayed <eol> with many layers of complexities. <eob>
All the Nigerian, or "Naija," archetypes, <eol> if you allow, are there -- <eob> from the divvers, the "Shakara," <eol> the coquette, <eob> the gangsters, the rich, <eol> the corrupt politicians, <eob> the whore, the pimp -- <eob> all in their swagger. <eob>
And of course, you have <eol> the lowlifes and the losers, too, <eob> all vividly portrayed. <eob>
Nollywood is Africa's mirror par excellence. <eob>
Typically, I direct <eol> all of my portraits, <eob> from the way my subject conducts his or her head, <eob> the way the neck is tilted, <eob> the expression of the fingers, <eob> the gestures of the hands, <eob> to the gaze <eob> and overall bearing and countenance. <eob>
Let me describe some of the photographs <eol> for you. <eob> Genevieve Nnaji. <eob> She is the reigning queen <eol> of Nollywood. <eob>
Here, I was quoting <eol> from the grand, Pharaonic African cultures <eob> of the Nile Valley civilizations; <eob> namely, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, <eob> so as to imbue her <eol> with a stately, ironic, calm grandeur. <eob>
Taiwo Ajai-Lycett <eol> is the grande dame of Nollywood. <eob>
Every aspect of her being <eol> commands attention. <eob>
So I posed her <eol> with her back to the audience. <eob>
Her face turned to meet us <eol> with a redoubtable gaze. <eob>
She doesn't need to seek our approval. <eob>
She's all that. <eob> Sadiq Daba. <eob> There was an unspoken authoritarian <eol> and imperial bearing <eob> that Sadiq Daba exudes upon meeting him. <eob>
In this portrait, he simply sat <eob> and allowed his massive, <eol> massive Nigerian caftan <eob> to signal his status. <eob> Quite an accomplishment. <eob> Belinda Effah. <eob> Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me <eol> to indulge my passion for color, <eob> dressed in a long, fitted blue dress <eol> that emphasizes her curves, <eob> seated on an upholstered green velvet bench. <eob>
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet <eob> and a vibrant color, <eob> in order to evoke the splendor <eol> of the multicolored painted bunting bird. <eob>
Everything was designed <eol> to harmonize the figure of Belinda within the frame. <eob>
Monalisa Chinda is, shall we say, <eob> the epitome of the luxe <eol> existence and lifestyle. <eob>
Her picture, or portrait, <eol> pretty much speaks for itself. <eob>
Alexx Ekubo is a sharp study <eob> in simplified elegance and dignity <eob> and a harmony in blue and white, as well. <eob>
Enyinna Nwigwe <eol> is a Nollywood matinee idol. <eob>
There is whiff of the rake about him, <eob> and that gives him an enchanting edge. <eob>
That's what I felt when I designed <eol> and organized the portrait. <eob>
Now, Nollywood is a new phase of Africa. <eob>
It is modern, post-modern, <eob> meta-modern, bold <eob> sexy, shrewd <eob> and with a contagious <eol> attitude worth catching. <eob>
As the finale of the project, <eob> I assembled the Nollywood stars <eob> into a group grand portrait <eol> of 64 subjects, <eob> called "The School of Nollywood," <eob> which was inspired by Rafael's "School of Athens," <eob> that was done circa 1509. <eob>
It is at the Vatican. <eob>
This grand group portrait <eob> is the exact same size as Rafael's "School of Athens." <eob> It measures roughly 27 feet in width <eob> by six and a half feet in height. <eob>
Nollywood also exemplifies <eol> a type of modernity <eob> never before seen in Africa. <eob>
Think of it: <eob> there has never been anything <eol> so ubiquitous <eob> with such iconic optics <eob> to come out of Africa <eob> since the Nile Valley civilizations <eob> of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia. <eob>
Outside of Nollywood, <eob> the image of Africa remains <eol> frozen in the old "National Geographic" mode <eob> and safari perspective. <eob>
But as Africans continue to step and see <eol> themselves portrayed by Nollywood <eob> in their varied <eol> and fantastic complexities, <eob> they will, in turn, propagate <eol> and perpetuate <eob> the positive image of themselves. <eob>
This is what Hollywood did and continues <eol> to do for the West. <eob>
As shocking as this may be, <eob> it is almost a taboo in the art world <eob> to show Africans in a modern framework -- <eob> that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned, <eob> manicured, pedicured and coiffed. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Part of my job is to keep beautifying Africa for the world, <eob> one portrait at a time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
There's a question I've been <eol> puzzling over and writing about <eob> for pretty much all of my adult life. <eob>
Why do some large-scale crises <eob> jolt us awake and inspire us <eol> to change and evolve <eob> while others might jolt us a bit, <eob> but then it's back to sleep? <eob>
Now, the kind of shocks I'm talking about are big -- <eob> a cataclysmic <eol> market crash, rising fascism, <eob> an industrial accident <eol> that poisons on a massive scale. <eob>
Now, events like this can act like <eol> a collective alarm bell. <eob>
Suddenly, we see a threat, <eol> we get organized. <eob>
We discover strength and resolve <eol> that was previously unimaginable. <eob>
It's as if we're no longer walking, <eol> but leaping. <eob>
Except, our collective alarm <eol> seems to be busted. <eob>
Faced with a crisis, we often fall apart, <eol> regress <eob> and that becomes a window <eol> for antidemocratic forces <eob> to push societies backwards, <eol> to become more unequal and more unstable. <eob>
Ten years ago, I wrote about <eol> this backwards process <eob> and I called it the "Shock Doctrine." <eob> So what determines which road <eol> we navigate through crisis? <eob>
Whether we grow up fast <eol> and find those strengths <eob> or whether we get knocked back. <eob>
And I'd say this is a pressing question <eol> these days. <eob>
Because things are pretty shocking out there. <eob>
Record-breaking storms, <eol> drowning cities, <eob> record-breaking fires <eol> threatening to devour them, <eob> thousands of migrants disappearing <eol> beneath the waves. <eob>
And openly supremacist movements rising, <eob> in many of our countries there <eol> are torches in the streets. <eob>
And now there's no shortage of people <eol> who are sounding the alarm. <eob>
But as a society, <eol> I don't think we can honestly say <eob> that we're responding <eol> with anything like the urgency <eob> that these overlapping crises <eol> demand from us. <eob>
And yet, we know from history <eob> that it is possible for crisis <eol> to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap. <eob>
And one of the most striking examples <eol> of this progressive power of crisis <eob> is the Great Crash of 1929. <eob>
There was the shock <eol> of the sudden market collapse <eob> followed by all of the aftershocks, <eob> the millions who lost <eol> everything thrown onto breadlines. <eob>
And this was taken by many as a message <eol> that the system itself was broken. <eob>
And many people listened <eol> and they leapt into action. <eob>
In the United States and elsewhere, governments <eol> began to weave a safety net <eob> so that the next time there was a crash <eob> there would be programs like social security <eol> to catch people. <eob>
There were huge job-creating public investments <eob> in housing, electrification <eol> and transit. <eob>
And there was a wave <eol> of aggressive regulation <eob> to reign in the banks. <eob>
Now, these reforms were far from perfect. <eob>
In the US, African American workers, <eol> immigrants and women <eob> were largely excluded. <eob>
But the Depression period, <eob> along with the transformation <eol> of allied nations and economies <eob> during the World War II effort, <eob> show us that it is possible <eol> for complex societies <eob> to rapidly transform themselves <eol> in the face of a collective threat. <eob>
Now, when we tell this story <eol> of the 1929 Crash, <eob> that's usually the formula <eol> that it follows -- <eob> that there was a shock <eol> and it induced a wake-up call <eob> and that produced a leap <eol> to a safer place. <eob>
Now, if that's really what it took, <eob> then why isn't it working anymore? <eob>
Why do today's non-stop shocks -- <eob> why don't they spur us into action? <eob>
Why don't they produce leaps? <eob>
Especially when it comes <eol> to climate change. <eob>
So I want to talk to you today <eob> about what I think is a much more complete recipe <eol> for deep transformation <eob> catalyzed by shocking events. <eob>
And I'm going to focus <eol> on two key ingredients <eob> that usually get left out <eol> of the history books. <eob>
One has to do with imagination, <eol> the other with organization. <eob>
Because it's in the interplay <eol> between the two <eob> where revolutionary power lies. <eob>
So let's start with imagination. <eob>
The victories of the New Deal <eol> didn't happen just because suddenly <eob> everybody understood the brutalities <eol> of laissez-faire. <eob>
This was a time, let's remember, <eol> of tremendous ideological ferment, <eob> when many different ideas <eol> about how to organize societies <eob> did battle with one another <eol> in the public square. <eob>
A time when humanity dared to dream big <eob> about different kinds of futures, <eob> many of them organized along radically <eol> egalitarian lines. <eob>
Now, not all of these ideas were good <eob> but this was an era <eol> of explosive imagining. <eob>
This meant that the movements demanding change <eob> knew what they were against -- <eol> crushing poverty, widening inequality -- <eob> but just as important, they knew <eol> what they were for. <eob>
They had their "no" and they had <eol> their "yes," too. <eob>
They also had very different models <eol> of political organization <eob> than we do today. <eob>
For decades, social and labor movements <eob> had been building up their membership bases, <eob> linking their causes together <eol> and increasing their strength. <eob>
Which meant that by the time <eol> the Crash happened, <eob> there was already a movement <eol> that was large and broad enough <eob> to, for instance, stage strikes <eol> that didn't just shut down factories, <eob> but shut down entire cities. <eob>
The big policy wins of the New Deal <eol> were actually offered as compromises. <eob>
Because the alternative <eol> seemed to be revolution. <eob>
So, let's adjust that equation <eol> from earlier. <eob>
A shocking event plus utopian imagination <eob> plus movement muscle, <eob> that's how we get a real leap. <eob>
So how does our present moment measure up? <eob>
We are living, once again, at a time <eol> of extraordinary political engagements. <eob>
Politics is a mass obsession. <eob>
Progressive movements are growing and resisting <eol> with tremendous courage. <eob>
And yet, we know from history <eob> that "no" is not enough. <eob>
Now, there are some "yeses" out there <eol> that are emerging. <eob>
And they're actually getting <eol> a lot bolder quickly. <eob>
Where climate activists used to talk <eol> about changing light bulbs, <eob> now we're pushing for 100 percent <eol> of our energy <eob> to come from the sun, <eol> wind and waves, <eob> and to do it fast. <eob>
Movements catalyzed by police violence <eol> against black bodies <eob> are calling for an end to militarized police, <eol> mass incarceration <eob> and even for reparations <eol> for slavery. <eob>
Students are not just opposing <eol> tuition increases, <eob> but from Chile to Canada to the UK, <eob> they are calling for free tuition <eol> and debt cancellation. <eob>
And yet, this still doesn't add up <eob> to the kind of holistic <eol> and universalist vision <eob> of a different world <eol> than our predecessors had. <eob> So why is that? <eob>
Well, very often we think about political change <eob> in defined compartments these days. <eob>
Environment in one box, inequality in another, <eob> racial and gender justice in <eol> a couple of other boxes, <eob> education over here, health over there. <eob>
And within each compartment, <eob> there are thousands upon thousands <eol> of different groups and NGOs, <eob> each competing with one another <eol> for credit, name recognition <eob> and of course, resources. <eob>
In other words, we act a lot <eol> like corporate brands. <eob>
Now, this is often referred <eol> to as the problem of silos. <eob>
Now, silos are understandable. <eob>
They carve up our complex world <eol> into manageable chunks. <eob>
They help us feel less overwhelmed. <eob>
But in the process, <eol> they also train our brains to tune out <eob> when somebody else's issue comes up <eob> and when somebody else's issue <eol> needs our help and support. <eob>
And they also keep us from seeing <eol> glaring connections between our issues. <eob>
So for instance, the people <eol> fighting poverty and inequality <eob> rarely talk about climate change. <eob>
Even though we see time and again <eob> that it's the poorest of people <eob> who are the most vulnerable <eol> to extreme weather. <eob>
The climate change people rarely talk <eol> about war and occupation. <eob>
Even though we know <eol> that the thirst for fossil fuels <eob> has been a major driver of conflict. <eob>
The environmental movement <eol> has gotten better at pointing out <eob> that the nations that are getting hit <eol> hardest by climate change <eob> are populated overwhelmingly <eol> by black and brown people. <eob>
But when black lives are treated as disposable <eob> in prisons, <eol> in schools and on the streets, <eob> these connections are too rarely made. <eob>
The walls between our silos <eob> also means that our solutions, <eol> when they emerge, <eob> are also disconnected from each other. <eob>
So progressives now have this long list <eol> of demands that I was mentioning earlier, <eob> those "yeses." <eob> But what we're still missing <eob> is that coherent picture of the world <eol> we're fighting for. <eob>
What it looks like, what it feels like, and most of all, <eol> what its core values are. <eob>
And that really matters. <eob> Because when large-scale crises hit us <eob> and we are confronted with the need <eol> to leap somewhere safer, <eob> there isn't any agreement <eol> on what that place is. <eob>
And leaping without a destination <eob> looks a lot like jumping up and down. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Fortunately, there are all kinds <eol> of conversations and experiments going on <eob> to try to overcome these divisions <eol> that are holding us back. <eob>
And I want to finish by talking <eol> about one of them. <eob>
A couple of years ago, <eol> a group of us in Canada <eob> decided that we were hitting the limits <eob> of what we could accomplish <eol> in our various silos. <eob>
So we locked ourselves <eol> in a room for two days, <eob> and we tried to figure out <eol> what bound us together. <eob>
In that room were people <eol> who rarely get face to face. <eob>
There were indigenous elders <eol> with hipsters working on transit. <eob>
There was the head of Greenpeace <eob> with a union leader <eol> representing oil workers and loggers. <eob>
There were faith leaders and feminist icons <eol> and many more. <eob>
And we gave ourselves <eol> a pretty ambitious assignment: <eob> agreeing on a short statement <eol> describing the world after we win. <eob>
The world after we've already made <eol> the transition to a clean economy <eob> and a much fairer society. <eob>
In other words, <eob> instead of trying to scare people <eol> about what will happen if we don't act, <eob> we decided to try to inspire them <eol> with what could happen if we did act. <eob>
Sensible people are always telling us <eob> that change needs to come <eol> in small increments. <eob>
That politics is the art of the possible <eob> and that we can't let <eol> the perfect be the enemy of the good. <eob>
Well, we rejected all of that. <eob>
We wrote a manifesto, <eol> and we called it "The Leap." <eob> I have to tell you that agreeing <eol> on our common "yes" <eob> across such diversity <eol> of experiences <eob> and against a backdrop <eol> of a lot of painful history <eob> was not easy work. <eob>
But it was also pretty thrilling. <eob>
Because as soon as we gave ourselves <eol> permission to dream, <eob> those threads connecting much of our work <eol> became self-evident. <eob>
We realized, for instance, <eob> that the bottomless quest for profits <eob> that is forcing so many people <eol> to work more than 50 hours a week, <eob> without security, <eob> and that is fueling <eol> this epidemic of despair <eob> is the same quest for bottomless profits <eol> and endless growth <eob> that is at the heart of our ecological crisis <eob> and is destabilizing our planet. <eob>
It also became clear what we need to do. <eob>
We need to create a culture <eol> of care-taking. <eob>
In which no one and nowhere <eol> is thrown away. <eob>
In which the inherent value <eol> of all people and every ecosystem is foundational. <eob>
So we came up with this people's platform, <eob> and don't worry, I'm not going to read <eol> the whole thing to you out loud -- <eob> if you're interested, you can read it <eol> at theleap.org. <eob> But I will give you a taste <eol> of what we came up with. <eob>
So we call for that 100 percent renewable <eol> economy in a hurry, <eob> but we went further. <eob>
Calls for new kinds <eol> of trade deals, <eob> a robust debate <eol> on a guaranteed annual income, <eob> full rights for immigrant workers, <eob> getting corporate money out of politics, <eob> free universal day care, <eol> electoral reform and more. <eob>
What we discovered is that a great many of us <eob> are looking for permission to act <eol> less like brands and more like movements. <eob>
Because movements don't care about credit. <eob>
They want good ideas <eol> to spread far and wide. <eob>
What I love about The Leap <eob> is that it rejects the idea <eol> that there is this hierarchy of crisis, <eob> and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize <eol> one struggle over another <eob> or wait their turn. <eob>
And though it was birthed in Canada, <eob> we've discovered that it travels well. <eob>
Since we launched, The Leap <eol> has been picked up around the world <eob> with similar platforms, <eob> being written from Nunavut to Australia, <eob> to Norway to the UK and the US, <eob> where it's gaining a lot of traction <eol> in cities like Los Angeles, <eob> where it's being localized. <eob>
And also in rural communities <eol> that are traditionally very conservative, <eob> but where politics is failing <eol> the vast majority of people. <eob>
Here's what I've learned from studying shocks and disasters for two decades. <eob> Crises test us. <eob> We either fall apart <eol> or we grow up fast. <eob>
Finding new reserves of strength <eol> and capacity that we never knew we had. <eob>
The shocking events <eol> that fill us with dread today <eob> can transform us, and they <eol> can transform the world for the better. <eob>
But first we need to picture <eol> the world that we're fighting for. <eob>
And we have to dream it up together. <eob>
Right now, every alarm in our house <eol> is going off simultaneously. <eob>
It's time to listen. <eob>
It's time to leap. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Tom Zimmerman: We'd like to take you <eol> on a fantastic journey <eob> to visit the creatures we call the Elders. <eob>
We call them the Elders <eol> because a half a billion years ago <eob> they tripled the amount <eol> of oxygen in the air, <eob> which led to an explosion of life, <eob> which led to all of us. <eob>
We call them the Elders, but you probably know <eol> them as plankton. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, Simone is a physicist, <eol> and I'm an inventor. <eob>
A couple of years ago, <eob> I was giving a talk <eol> about an invention I made -- <eob> it was a 3D microscope. <eob> And Simone was in the audience. <eob>
He realized that my microscope <eol> could solve a big problem he was having. <eob> Which was, how to measure <eol> the movement of plankton in 3D fast enough <eob> so he could mathematically model their sensing and behavior. <eob>
And I frankly needed an application <eol> for my microscope, so ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was like peanut butter meets chocolate. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we started working together, <eol> studying these amazing creatures. <eob> And then we were alarmed <eol> to discover something. <eob>
And that's why we're here today. <eob>
And I just want to do something with you. <eob>
Now, please, <eol> just hold your breath for a second. <eob>
Yes, literally hold your breath. <eob>
This is the world without plankton. <eob>
You see, plankton generate two-thirds <eol> of our oxygen using the sun. <eob>
OK, now you can breathe, <eol> because they're still here. <eob> For now. <eob>
Simone Bianco: As many of you know, <eob> since 1950, the average surface <eol> temperature of the earth <eob> has increased by one degree Centigrade <eob> due to all the carbon dioxide <eol> we are pumping into the air. <eob>
Now, while this temperature increase <eol> may not seem like a big deal to us, <eob> it is to plankton. <eob>
Indirect measurements have shown <eol> that the global phytoplankton population <eob> may have decreased by as much as 40 percent <eol> between 1950 and 2010 <eob> because of climate change. <eob>
And you see, this is a problem <eob> also because it's starving <eol> the fish that eat them. <eob>
And about a billion people around the world <eob> depend on fish as their primary <eol> source of protein from animals. <eob>
So you see, this isn't just about breathing. <eob>
No plankton means no fish. <eob>
And that is a lot of food <eol> we will need to replace. <eob>
There's something else that is interesting. <eob> The bodies of plankton's ancestors <eob> actually make up a for lot of the carbon <eol> we burn today. <eob>
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me. <eob> Because the plankton that are here today <eol> clean that carbon out of the air. <eob>
But you see, they don't really <eol> hold a grudge. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The problem is they cannot keep up <eob> with the tremendous amount <eol> of carbon we are dumping into the air. <eob>
So what does all of this mean? <eob>
Well, it means that our big carbon footprint <eob> is crushing the very creatures <eol> that sustain us. <eob>
And yes, like Tom said, <eob> killing almost half of the creatures <eol> that allow us to breathe <eob> is a really big deal. <eob>
So you're probably asking yourself: <eob> Why aren't we doing something about it? <eob>
Our theory is that plankton <eol> are tiny, <eob> and it's really, really hard to care <eol> about something you cannot see. <eob>
You see, there's a quote I really like <eol> in "The Little Prince" that goes, <eob> "What is essential is invisible to the eye." <eob> We really believe that if more people could come <eob> face to ... cilia with plankton, <eob> there is a greater chance we could <eol> all rally together <eob> and save these creatures <eob> that are so important to life on our planet. <eob>
TZ: Exactly, Simone. <eob>
So to do this, <eob> we're going to bring you scuba <eol> diving with plankton. <eob>
But I just need to shrink <eol> you by a factor of 1000, <eob> to a scale where the diameter <eol> of a human hair is as big as my hand. <eob>
And I happen to have invented <eol> a machine to do just that. <eob>
SB: Anyone here remember <eol> "Fantastic Voyage" <eob> or "Innerspace?" <eob> Yeah, yeah. <eob> Martin Short is one of my all-time favorite actors. <eob>
And now this -- this is just like that. <eob>
TZ: Indeed, yes. <eob>
When I was a boy, <eol> I saw "Fantastic Voyage," <eob> and I really loved how I could travel <eol> through the bloodstream <eob> and see biology work <eol> on a cellular level. <eob>
I've always been inspired <eol> by science fiction. <eob>
As an inventor, <eol> I try and turn fantasy into reality. <eob>
And I once invented this glove <eob> which let me travel and help people <eol> like you explore the virtual world. <eob>
So now I've invented this machine <eob> to let us explore the microscopic world. <eob>
It's not virtual, it's real. <eob> Just really, really tiny. <eob>
It's based on the microscope <eol> that got Simone's attention. <eob>
So, here's how it works. <eob>
I have an image sensor <eob> like the kind in your cell phone, <eol> behind the lens. <eob>
And then I have a little tray <eol> of plankton water <eob> like you might find from a river <eob> or my fish tank, <eol> which I never change the water on. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Because I love plankton. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And underneath I have a light, an LED, <eob> which is going to cast shadows <eol> of the plankton on the image sensor. <eob>
And now this silver thing is an XY plotter, <eob> so I can move the image sensor <eol> to follow the plankton as they swim. <eob>
Now comes the fantasy part. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I put a tilt sensor on this helmet <eob> so I can control the microscope <eol> with my head. <eob>
And now let's look at the video <eol> from this image sensor. <eob>
These are all plankton. <eob> This is in that little tray, <eob> and with my head, <eol> I can move the microscope. <eob>
So now we're ready <eol> to go scuba diving with plankton. <eob>
My head will be the navigator, <eob> and Simone will be our tour guide. <eob>
SB: Yes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So welcome all to the wonderful world <eol> of life in a drop of water. <eob>
Actually, as you can see, <eob> with this instrument, we are not at all <eol> limited to a single drop. <eob>
Alright, let's find something. <eob>
The little creatures you see <eol> in the center of your screen, <eob> they are called rotifer. <eob> They are the garbage <eol> collectors of our waters. <eob>
They break down organic matter <eob> and allow it to be reclaimed <eol> by the environment. <eob>
Now, you know, <eol> nature is an amazing recycler. <eob>
Structures are continuously built, <eol> they are decomposed and recycled, <eob> and all of that is powered <eol> by solar energy. <eob> But just think. <eob> Think about what will happen <eol> if, you know, our garbage collectors <eob> didn't come anymore, if they disappeared. <eob> Something else? Let's look for something else. <eob>
Oh, look at that. <eob> You see the big ice-cream-cone-shaped things? <eob>
Those are called Stentor, <eol> those are amazing creatures. <eob>
You know, they are big, <eol> but they are a single cell. <eob>
You remember the rotifer we just met? <eob>
That's about half a millimeter, <eol> it's about 1,000 cells -- <eob> it's typically 15 for the brain, 15 for the stomach <eob> and you know, about the same for reproduction, <eob> which is kind of the right mix, <eol> if you ask me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But ... right? <eob>
TZ: I agree. <eob>
SB: But a Stentor <eol> is only a single cell. <eob> And it's able to sense <eol> and react to its environment. <eob>
You see, it will swim forward <eol> when it's happy; <eob> it will swim backward <eol> when it's trying to get away from something <eob> like, you know, a toxic chemical. <eob>
With our friends in the Center <eol> for Cellular Construction <eob> and the help of the National Science Foundation, <eob> we are using Stentor to sense the presence <eol> of contamination in food and water, <eob> which I think is really cool. <eob> Alright, last one. <eob>
They are the creatures that provide <eol> the majority of oxygen in the air. <eob> They convert solar light <eol> and carbon dioxide <eob> into the oxygen that is filling <eol> your lungs right now. <eob>
So you see, we all got algae breath. <eob>
TZ: (Exhales) <eob> SB: Yay! <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
You know, there's something interesting. <eob>
About a billion years ago, ancient plants <eol> got their photosynthesis capability <eob> by incorporating tiny, tiny plankton <eol> into their cells. <eob>
That's exactly like us putting solar panels <eol> on top of our roofs. <eob>
So you see, the microscopic world <eol> is even more amazing than science fiction. <eob>
TZ: Oh, indeed. <eob>
So now you've seen how vital plankton <eol> are to our lives <eob> and how much we need them. <eob>
If we kill the plankton, we will die <eob> of asphyxiation or starvation, <eol> take your pick. <eob>
Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In the game of plankton, <eol> you win or you die. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, what amazes me is, <eol> we have known about global warming <eob> for over a century. <eob>
Ever since the Swedish scientist, Arrhenius, <eob> calculated the effect <eol> of burning fossil fuel <eob> on the earth's temperature. <eob>
We've known about this for a long time, <eol> but it's not too late if we act now. <eob>
Yes, yes, I know, I know, <eol> our world is based on fossil fuels, <eob> but we can adjust our society <eol> to run on renewable energy from the Sun <eob> to create a more sustainable and secure future. <eob>
That's good for the little creatures <eol> here, the plankton, <eob> and that good for us -- here's why. <eob>
The three greatest concerns <eol> of people all around the globe <eob> typically are jobs, violence and health. <eob>
A job means food and shelter. <eob>
Look at these creatures, <eol> they're swimming around, <eob> they're looking for a place <eol> to eat and reproduce. <eob>
If a single cell is programmed to do that, <eob> it's no surprise that 30 trillion <eol> cells have the same agenda. <eob> Violence. <eob> Dependence on fossil fuels <eol> makes a country vulnerable. <eob> Which leads to conflicts <eol> all around the oil resources. <eob>
Solar energy, on the other hand, <eol> is distributed around the whole globe, <eob> and no one can blockade the sun. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then, finally, health. <eob> Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette. <eob>
And in my opinion, coal <eol> is like an unfiltered type. <eob>
Now, just like smoking, the best time <eol> to quit is when? <eob>
Audience: Now. <eob>
TZ: Now! Not when you get lung cancer. <eob>
Now I know if you look around, some people <eol> may abandon facts and reason. <eob> Only until suffering -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Yes, they will abandon facts and reason. <eob>
But suffering will eventually <eol> and inevitably force change. <eob>
But let's instead use our neocortex, <eol> our new brain, <eob> to save the Elders, some of the oldest creatures on the earth. <eob> And let's apply science <eol> to harness the energy <eob> that has fueled <eol> the Elders for millions of years -- <eob> the sun. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As an elementary school teacher, <eob> my mom did everything she could to ensure <eol> I had good reading skills. <eob>
This usually consisted of weekend <eol> reading lessons at our kitchen table <eob> while my friends played outside. <eob>
My reading ability improved, <eob> but these forced reading lessons didn't exactly <eol> inspire a love of reading. <eob>
High school changed everything. <eob> In 10th grade, my regular English class <eol> read short stories and did spelling tests. <eob>
Out of sheer boredom, I asked <eol> to be switched into another class. <eob>
The next semester, I joined <eol> advanced English. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We read two novels and wrote <eol> two book reports that semester. <eob>
The drastic difference and rigor <eol> between these two English classes <eob> angered me and spurred questions like, <eob> "Where did all these white people come from?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My high school was over 70 percent black and Latino, <eob> but this advanced English class had <eol> white students everywhere. <eob>
This personal encounter <eol> with institutionalized racism <eob> altered my relationship <eol> with reading forever. <eob>
I learned that I couldn't depend <eol> on a school, a teacher or curriculum <eob> to teach me what I needed to know. <eob>
And more out of like, rebellion, <eol> than being intellectual, <eob> I decided I would no longer <eol> allow other people to dictate <eob> when and what I read. <eob>
And without realizing it, <eol> I had stumbled upon a key <eob> to helping children read. <eob> Identity. <eob>
Instead of fixating on skills <eob> and moving students <eol> from one reading level to another, <eob> or forcing struggling readers <eol> to memorize lists of unfamiliar words, <eob> we should be asking ourselves this question: <eob> How can we inspire children <eol> to identify as readers? <eob>
DeSean, a brilliant first-grader <eol> I taught in the Bronx, <eob> he helped me understand <eol> how identity shapes learning. <eob>
One day during math, <eol> I walk up to DeSean, and I say, <eob> "DeSean, you're a great mathematician." <eob> He looks at me and responds, <eob> "I'm not a mathematician, <eol> I'm a math genius!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK DeSean, right? <eob> Reading? <eob> Completely different story. <eob> "Mr. Irby, I can't read. <eob>
I'm never going to learn to read," <eol> he would say. <eob>
I taught DeSean to read, <eob> but there are countless black boys <eol> who remain trapped in illiteracy. <eob>
According to the US Department of Education, <eob> more than 85 percent <eol> of black male fourth graders <eob> are not proficient in reading. <eob> 85 percent! <eob> The more challenges to reading children face, <eob> the more culturally competent <eol> educators need to be. <eob>
Moonlighting as a stand-up comedian <eol> for the past eight years, <eob> I understand the importance <eol> of cultural competency, <eob> which I define as the ability to translate <eob> what you want someone else <eol> to know or be able to do <eob> into communication or experiences <eol> that they find relevant and engaging. <eob>
Before going on stage, <eol> I assess an audience. <eob>
Are they white, are they Latino? <eob>
Are they old, young, <eol> professional, conservative? <eob>
Then I curate and modify my jokes <eob> based on what I think <eol> would generate the most laughter. <eob>
While performing in a church, <eol> I could tell bar jokes. <eob>
But that might not result in laughter. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As a society, we're creating <eol> reading experiences for children <eob> that are the equivalent <eol> of telling bar jokes in a church. <eob>
And then we wonder why <eol> so many children don't read. <eob>
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire <eob> believed that teaching <eol> and learning should be two-way. <eob>
Students shouldn't be viewed <eol> as empty buckets to be filled with facts <eob> but as cocreators of knowledge. <eob>
Cookie-cutter curriculums and school policies <eob> that require students <eol> to sit statue-still <eob> or to work in complete silence -- <eob> these environments often exclude <eol> the individual learning needs, <eob> the interest and expertise <eol> of children. <eob> Especially black boys. <eob>
Many of the children's books <eol> promoted to black boys <eob> focus on serious topics, like slavery, civil rights and biographies. <eob>
Less than two percent of teachers <eol> in the United States are black males. <eob>
And a majority of black boys <eol> are raised by single mothers. <eob>
There are literally young black boys <eol> who have never seen a black man reading. <eob>
Or never had a black man <eol> encourage him to read. <eob>
What cultural factors, <eol> what social cues are present <eob> that would lead a young black boy to conclude <eob> that reading is even something he should do? <eob>
This is why I created Barbershop Books. <eob>
It's a literacy nonprofit <eob> that creates child-friendly <eol> reading spaces in barber shops. <eob>
The mission is simple: <eob> to help young black boys <eol> identify as readers. <eob>
Lots of black boys go to the barber shop <eol> once or twice a month. <eob>
Some see their barbers more <eol> than they see their fathers. <eob>
Barbershop Books connects <eol> reading to a male-centered space <eob> and involves black men and boys' early <eol> reading experiences. <eob>
This identity-based reading program <eob> uses a curated list of children's books <eol> recommended by black boys. <eob>
These are the books <eol> that they actually want to read. <eob>
Scholastic's 2016 Kids <eol> and Family Report <eob> found that the number one thing children <eol> look for when choosing a book <eob> is a book that will make them laugh. <eob>
So if we're serious about helping <eol> black boys and other children to read <eob> when it's not required, <eob> we need to incorporate relevant <eol> male reading models <eob> into early literacy. <eob>
In exchange, some of the children's books <eol> that adults love so much <eob> for funny, silly or even gross books, <eol> like "Gross Greg". <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"You call them boogers. <eob>
Greg calls them delicious little sugars. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That laugh, that positive reaction <eob> or gross reaction some of you just had, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
black boys deserve <eol> and desperately need more of that. <eob>
Dismantling the savage inequalities <eol> that plague American education <eob> requires us to create reading experiences <eob> that inspire all children <eol> to say three words: <eob> I'm a reader. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I grew up white, secular and middle class <eob> in 1950s America. <eob>
That meant watching fireworks <eol> on the Fourth of July, <eob> trick-or-treating on Halloween <eob> and putting presents under a tree at Christmas. <eob>
But by the time those traditions <eol> got to me, <eob> they were hollow, commercial enterprises, <eob> which just left me feeling empty. <eob>
So from a relatively young age, <eob> I found myself looking <eol> to fill an existential hole, <eob> to connect with something bigger than myself. <eob>
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah <eol> in my family in over a century, <eob> so I thought I'd take a shot at that -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
only to be devastated <eol> when my one encounter with the rabbi, <eob> a really tall, godlike figure <eol> with flowing white hair, <eob> consisted of him asking me <eol> for my middle name <eob> so we could fill out a form. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Yep, that was it. <eob>
So I got the fountain pen, <eob> but I didn't get the sense <eol> of belonging and confidence <eob> I was searching for. <eob>
Many years later, <eob> I couldn't bear the thought <eol> of my son turning 13 <eob> without some kind of rite of passage. <eob>
So I came up with the idea <eol> of a 13th birthday trip, <eob> and I offered to take Murphy <eol> anywhere in the world <eob> that had meaning for him. <eob>
A budding young naturalist who loved turtles, <eob> he immediately settled <eol> on the Galapagos. <eob>
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13, <eob> she and I spent two weeks <eol> at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, <eob> where Katie learned for the first time <eol> that she was powerful and brave. <eob>
Since then, my partner, Ashton, <eol> and lots of our friends and relatives <eob> have taken their kids <eol> on 13th birthday trips, <eob> with everyone finding it transformative <eol> for both the child and the parent. <eob>
I wasn't brought up saying grace. <eob>
But for the last 20 years, <eob> we've been holding hands <eol> before every meal. <eob>
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence <eob> that brings us all together in the moment. <eob>
Ashton tells everyone <eol> to "pass the squeeze," <eob> while she assures them <eol> it's not religious. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So recently, when my family asked me <eob> if I could please do something <eol> with the more than 250 boxes of stuff <eob> that I've collected over a lifetime, <eob> my ritual-making impulse kicked in. <eob>
I started wondering if I could go further <eol> than simple death cleaning. <eob> "Death cleaning" is the Swedish term <eol> for clearing out your closets, <eob> your basement and your attic <eol> before you die, <eob> so your kids don't have <eol> to do it later. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I pictured my children <eol> opening up box after box <eob> and wondering why I'd kept <eol> any of that stuff. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I imagined them looking <eol> at a specific picture <eob> of me with a beautiful young woman, <eob> and asking, "Who on earth is that with Dad?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that was the aha moment. <eob>
It wasn't the things <eol> I'd saved that were important; <eob> it was the stories that went with them <eol> that gave them meaning. <eob>
Could using the objects to tell the stories <eob> be the seed of a new ritual, <eob> a rite of passage -- <eol> not for a 13-year-old, <eob> but for someone much further <eol> down the road? <eob>
So I started experimenting. <eob> I got a few dozen things <eol> out of the boxes, <eob> I put them about in a room, <eob> and I invited people to come in <eob> and ask me about anything <eol> that they found interesting. <eob>
The results were terrific. <eob>
A good story became a launching pad <eol> for a much deeper discussion, <eob> in which my visitors <eol> made meaningful connections <eob> to their own lives. <eob>
Derrius [Quarles] asked me <eol> about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt <eob> that I'd worn a lot in the '80s, <eob> that, sadly, <eol> is still relevant today. <eob>
Our conversation moved quickly, <eob> from a large number <eol> of political prisoners in American jails, <eob> to Derrius wondering about the legacy <eob> of the Black Liberation Movement <eol> of the '60s, <eob> and how his life might be <eol> different if he'd come of age then, <eob> instead of 30-odd years later. <eob>
At the end of our conversation, <eob> Derrius asked me if he could have <eol> the T-shirt. <eob>
And giving it to him felt <eol> just about perfect. <eob>
As these conversations established common ground, <eob> especially across generations, <eob> I realized I was opening a space <eob> for people to talk about things <eol> that really mattered to them. <eob>
And I started seeing myself <eol> with a renewed sense of purpose -- <eob> not as the old guy on the way out, <eob> but as someone with a role <eol> to play <eob> going forward. <eob>
When I was growing up, <eob> life ended for most people in their 70s. <eob>
People are living far longer now, <eob> and for the first time <eol> in human history, <eob> it's common for four generations <eol> to be living side by side. <eob>
I'm 71, <eob> and with a bit of luck, <eob> I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me. <eob>
Giving away my stuff now <eob> and sharing it with friends, <eol> family, and I hope strangers, too, <eob> seems like the perfect way <eol> to enter this next stage of my life. <eob>
Turns out to be just <eol> what I was looking for: <eob> a ritual that's less about dying <eob> and more about opening the door <eob> to whatever comes next. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Onward! <eob>
The history of civilization, in some ways, <eol> is a history of maps: <eob> How have we come to understand <eol> the world around us? <eob>
One of the most famous maps works <eol> because it really isn't a map at all. <eob>
[Small thing. Big idea.] <eob>
The London Underground came <eol> together in 1908, <eob> when eight different independent <eol> railways merged <eob> to create a single system. <eob>
They needed a map to represent that system <eob> so people would know where to ride. <eob>
The map they made is complicated. <eob>
You can see rivers, bodies of water, trees and parks -- <eob> the stations were all crammed together <eol> at the center of the map, <eob> and out in the periphery, <eol> there were some that couldn't even fit on the map. <eob>
So the map was geographically accurate, <eol> but maybe not so useful. <eob>
Enter Harry Beck. <eob> Harry Beck was a 29-year-old engineering draftsman <eob> who had been working on and off <eol> for the London Underground. <eob>
And he had a key insight, <eob> and that was that people riding <eol> underground in trains <eob> don't really care <eol> what's happening aboveground. <eob>
They just want to get from station to station -- <eob> "Where do I get on? <eol> Where do I get off?" <eob> It's the system that's important, <eol> not the geography. <eob>
He's taken this complicated <eol> mess of spaghetti, <eob> and he's simplified it. <eob>
The lines only go in three directions: <eob> they're horizontal, they're vertical, <eol> or they're 45 degrees. <eob>
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally, <eob> he's made every station color <eol> correspond to the color of the line, <eob> and he's fixed it all so <eol> that it's not really a map anymore. <eob>
What it is is a diagram, <eob> just like circuitry, <eob> except the circuitry here isn't wires conducting electrons, <eob> it's tubes containing trains conducting people from place to place. <eob>
In 1933, the Underground decided, <eol> at last, to give Harry Beck's map a try. <eob>
The Underground did a test run <eol> of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size. <eob>
They were gone in one hour. <eob>
They realized they were onto something, <eob> they printed 750,000 more, <eob> and this is the map that you see today. <eob>
Beck's design really became the template <eob> for the way we think of metro maps today. <eob>
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, <eol> São Paulo, Sydney, Washington, D.C. -- <eob> all of them convert complex geography <eob> into crisp geometry. <eob>
All of them use different colors <eol> to distinguish between lines, <eob> all of them use simple symbols <eol> to distinguish between types of stations. <eob>
They all are part <eol> of a universal language, seemingly. <eob>
I bet Harry Beck <eol> wouldn't have known what a user interface was, <eob> but that's really what he designed <eob> and he really took that challenge <eol> and broke it down to three principles <eob> that I think can be applied <eol> in nearly any design problem. <eob>
First one is focus. <eob>
Focus on who you're doing this for. <eob>
The second principle is simplicity. <eob>
What's the shortest way <eol> to deliver that need? <eob>
Finally, the last thing is: <eob> Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way. <eob>
Who would've thought <eol> that an electrical engineer <eob> would be the person <eol> to hold the key <eob> to unlock what was then one of the most complicated <eol> systems in the world -- <eob> all started by one guy <eol> with a pencil and an idea. <eob>
The hoodie is an amazing object. <eob>
It's one of those timeless objects <eol> that we hardly think of, <eob> because they work so well <eol> that they're part of our lives. <eob>
We call them "humble masterpieces." <eob>
[Small thing.] <eob> [Big idea.] <eob>
[Paola Antonelli on the Hoodie] <eob>
The hoodie has been -- <eol> even if it was not called so -- <eob> it's been an icon throughout history <eol> for good and for bad reasons. <eob>
The earliest ones that we can trace <eob> are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome. <eob>
The Middle Ages, you see a lot of monks <eob> that were wearing garments <eol> that were cape-like, with hoods attached, <eob> so therefore, "hoodies." <eob> Ladies in the 17th century <eol> would wear hoodies <eob> to kind of hide themselves <eol> when they were going to meet their lovers. <eob>
And then, of course, there's the legend, <eol> there's fantasy. <eob>
There's the image of the hoodie <eol> connected to the grim reaper. <eob>
There's the image of the hoodie <eol> connected to the executioner. <eob>
So there's the dark side of the hoodie. <eob>
The modern incarnation of the hoodie -- <eob> a garment that's made <eol> usually of cotton jersey, <eob> that has a hood attached with a drawstring; <eob> sometimes it has a marsupial pocket -- <eob> was introduced in the 1930s by Knickerbocker Knitting Company. <eob> Now it's called Champion. <eob> It was meant to keep athletes warm. <eob>
Of course, though, it was such <eol> a functional, comfortable garment <eob> that it was very rapidly adopted <eol> by workmen everywhere. <eob>
And then, around the 1980s, <eol> it also gets adopted <eob> by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders, <eob> and it takes on this kind <eol> of youth street culture. <eob>
It was, at the same time, <eol> super-comfortable, <eob> perfect for the streets <eob> and also had that added value of anonymity <eob> when you needed it. <eob>
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg, <eob> who defies convention <eol> of respectable attire for businesspeople. <eob>
But interestingly, it's also a way to show <eol> how power has changed. <eob>
If you're wearing a two-piece suit, <eol> you might be the bodyguard. <eob>
The real powerful person <eol> is wearing a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans. <eob>
It's easy to think of the physical <eol> aspects of the hoodie. <eob>
You can immediately think <eol> of wearing the hood up, <eob> and you feel this warmth <eol> and this protection, <eob> but at the same time, <eob> you can also feel the psychological <eol> aspects of it. <eob>
I mean, think of donning a hoodie, <eob> all of a sudden, you feel more protected, <eob> you feel that you are in your own shell. <eob>
We know very well what the hoodie <eol> has come to signify <eob> in the past few years <eol> in the United States. <eob>
When Trayvon Martin, <eol> a 17-year-old African-American kid, <eob> was shot by a neighborhood vigilante, <eob> and Million Hoodie Marches happened <eol> all over the United States, <eob> in which people wore hoodies with the hood up <eob> and marched in the streets <eol> against this kind of prejudice. <eob>
It doesn't happen that often <eob> for a garment <eol> to have so much symbolism and history <eob> and that encompasses so many different universes <eob> as the hoodie. <eob>
So, like all garments, <eob> especially all truly utilitarian garments, <eob> it is very basic in its design. <eob>
But at the same time, <eob> it has a whole universe <eol> of possibilities attached. <eob>
The sound is a really big part, I think, <eol> of the experience of using a pencil, <eob> and it has this really audible scratchiness. <eob>
(Scratching) <eob>
[Small thing. Big idea.] <eob>
The pencil is a very simple object. <eob>
It's made of wood with some layers <eol> of paint <eob> an eraser and a core, <eob> which is made out of graphite, <eol> clay and water. <eob>
Yeah, it took hundreds of people <eol> over centuries <eob> to come to this design. <eob>
And it's that long history <eol> of collaboration <eob> that, to me, makes it <eol> a very perfect object. <eob>
The story of the pencil <eol> starts with graphite. <eob>
People started finding really useful applications <eob> for this new substance. <eob>
They cut it into small sticks <eob> and wrapped it in string <eol> or sheepskin or paper <eob> and sold it on the streets of London <eob> to be used for writing or for drawing <eob> or, a lot of times, by farmers <eol> and shepherds, <eob> who used it to mark their animals. <eob>
Over in France, <eob> Nicolas-Jacques Conté <eol> figured out a method of grinding the graphite, <eob> mixing it with powdered clay <eol> and water to make a paste. <eob>
From there, this paste was filled <eol> into a mold and fired in a kiln, <eob> and the result was a really strong graphite core <eob> that wasn't breakable, <eol> that was smooth, usable -- <eob> it was so much better than anything <eol> else that existed at the time, <eob> and to this day, that's the method <eol> that's still used in making pencils. <eob>
Meanwhile, over in America, <eol> in Concord, Massachusetts, <eob> it was Henry David Thoreau <eol> who came up with the grading scale <eob> for different hardnesses of pencil. <eob>
It was graded one through four, <eob> number two being the ideal hardness <eol> for general use. <eob>
The softer the pencil, <eol> the more graphite it had in it, <eob> and the darker and smoother <eol> the line will be. <eob>
The firmer the pencil, the more clay it had in it <eob> and the lighter and finer it will be. <eob>
Originally, when pencils were handmade, <eol> they were made round. <eob>
There was no easy way to make them, <eob> and it was the Americans <eol> who really mechanized the craft. <eob>
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon <eob> for being one of the first people <eol> to start developing actual machines <eob> to do things like cut wood slats, <eol> cut grooves into the wood, <eob> apply glue to them ... <eob> And they figured out it <eol> was easier and less wasteful <eob> to do a hexagonal pencil, <eob> and so that became the standard. <eob>
Since the early days of pencils, <eob> people have loved that they can be erased. <eob>
Originally, it was bread crumbs <eob> that were used to scratch away <eol> pencil marks <eob> and later, rubber and pumice. <eob>
The attached eraser happened in 1858, <eob> when American stationer Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil <eob> with an attached eraser, <eob> which really changed the pencil game. <eob>
The world's first yellow pencil was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500. <eob>
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing <eob> where they painted this pencil with 14 coats of yellow paint <eob> and dipped the end in 14-carat gold. <eob>
There is a pencil for everyone, <eob> and every pencil has a story. <eob>
The Blackwing 602 is famous for being used by a lot of writers, <eob> especially John Steinbeck and Vladimir Nabokov. <eob>
And then, you have the Dixon pencil company. <eob>
They're responsible for the Dixon Ticonderoga. <eob>
It's an icon, <eob> it's what people think of when they think of a pencil <eob> and what they think of when they think of school. <eob>
And the pencil's really a thing that, I think, <eob> the average user has never thought twice about, <eob> how it's made or why it's made the way it is, <eob> because it's just always been that way. <eob>
In my opinion, there's nothing that can be done <eob> to make the pencil better than it is. <eob> It's perfect. <eob>
If you do it right, it should sound like: <eob> TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat. <eob> If you do it wrong, it sounds like: <eob> Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT. <eob>
[Small thing. Big idea.] <eob>
The jump rope is such a simple object. <eob> It can be made out of rope, a clothesline, twine. <eob>
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs) <eob> I'm not sure how to describe that. <eob>
What's important is that it has a certain weight, <eob> and that they have that kind of whip sound. <eob>
It's not clear what the origin of the jump rope is. <eob>
There's some evidence that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia, <eob> and then it most likely traveled to North America with Dutch settlers. <eob>
The rope became a big thing when women's clothes became more fitted <eob> and the pantaloon came into being. <eob>
And so, girls were able to jump rope <eob> because their skirts wouldn't catch the ropes. <eob>
Governesses used it to train their wards to jump rope. <eob>
Even formerly enslaved African children in the antebellum South <eob> jumped rope, too. <eob>
In the 1950s, in Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, <eob> you could see on the sidewalk, lots of girls playing with ropes. <eob>
Sometimes they would take two ropes and turn them as a single rope together, <eob> but you could separate them and turn them in like an eggbeater on each other. <eob>
The skipping rope was like a steady timeline -- <eob> tick, tick, tick, tick -- <eob> upon which you can add rhymes and rhythms and chants. <eob>
Those ropes created a space <eob> where we were able to contribute to something <eob> that was far greater than the neighborhood. <eob>
Double Dutch jump rope remains a powerful symbol of culture and identity <eob> for black women. <eob>
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s, <eob> girls weren't supposed to play sports. <eob>
Boys played baseball, basketball and football, <eob> and girls weren't allowed. <eob>
A lot has changed, but in that era, <eob> girls would rule the playground. <eob>
They'd make sure that boys weren't a part of that. <eob>
It's their space, it's a girl-power space. <eob>
It's where they get to shine. <eob>
But I also think it's for boys, <eob> because boys overheard those, <eob> which is why, I think, so many hip-hop artists <eob> sampled from things that they heard in black girls' game songs. <eob>
Why "Country Grammar" by Nelly became a Grammy Award-winning single <eob> was because people already knew <eob> "We're going down down baby your street in a Range Rover ... " <eob> That's the beginning of "Down down, baby, down down the roller coaster, <eob> sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go." <eob> All people who grew up in any black urban community <eob> would know that music. <eob>
And so, it was a ready-made hit. <eob>
The Double Dutch rope playing helped maintain these songs <eob> and helped maintain the chants and the gestures that go along with it, <eob> which is very natural to what I call "kinetic orality" -- <eob> word of mouth and word of body. <eob>
It's the thing that gets passed down over generations. <eob>
In some ways, the rope is the thing that helps carry it. <eob>
You need some object to carry memory through. <eob>
So, a jump rope, you can use it for all different kinds of things. <eob> It crosses cultures. <eob> And I think it lasted because people need to move. <eob>
And I think sometimes the simplest objects can make the most creative uses. <eob>
I remember thinking to myself, <eob> "This is going to change everything about how we communicate." <eob>
[Small thing.] <eob> [Big idea.] <eob>
[Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink] <eob>
A hyperlink is an interface element, <eob> and what I mean by that is, <eob> when you're using software on your phone or your computer, <eob> there's a lot of code behind the interface <eob> that's giving all the instructions for the computer on how to manage it, <eob> but that interface is the thing that humans interact with: <eob> when we press on this, then something happens. <eob>
When they first came around, they were pretty simple <eob> and not particularly glamorous. <eob>
Designers today have a huge range of options. <eob>
The hyperlink uses what's called a markup language -- HTML. <eob>
There's a little string of code. <eob>
And then you put the address of where you want to send the person. <eob>
It's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do. <eob>
And so, the whole range of references to information elsewhere on the internet <eob> is the domain of the hyperlink. <eob>
Back when I was in school -- <eob> this is before people had wide access to the internet -- <eob> if I was going to do a research paper, <eob> I would have to physically walk to the library, <eob> and if they had the book that you needed, great. <eob>
You sometimes had to send out for it, <eob> so the process could take weeks. <eob>
And it's kind of crazy to think about that now, <eob> because, like all great innovations, <eob> it's not long after we get access to something <eob> that we start to take it for granted. <eob>
Back in 1945, <eob> there was this guy, Vannevar Bush. <eob>
He was working for the US government, <eob> and one of the ideas that he put forth was, <eob> "Wow, humans are creating so much information, <eob> and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read <eob> or the connections between important ideas." <eob> And he had this idea called the "memex," <eob> where you could put together a personal library <eob> of all of the books and articles that you have access to. <eob>
And that idea of connecting sources captured people's imaginations. <eob>
Later, in the 1960s, <eob> Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu, <eob> and he said, <eob> "Well, what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have? <eob>
What if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?" <eob> In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland <eob> developed a system they called HyperTIES. <eob>
They were the first to use text itself as a link marker. <eob>
They figured out that this blue link on a gray background <eob> was going to work really well in terms of contrast, <eob> and people would be able to see it. <eob>
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987. <eob>
You had these stacks of cards, <eob> and you could create links in between the cards. <eob>
HyperCard actually created the ability to jump around in a story. <eob>
These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling <eob> got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along, <eob> because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative. <eob>
These ideas and inventions, among others, <eob> inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. <eob>
The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block, <eob> this very basic building block to a very complex web of connections <eob> that exists all around the world. <eob>
Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed, <eob> they were intended to be not only used by many people, <eob> but created by many people. <eob>
To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created. <eob>
[It's time to start talking about engineering our climate] <eob>
What if there was a way to build a thermostat <eob> that allowed you to turn down the temperature of the earth <eob> anytime you wanted? <eob>
Now, you would think if somebody had a plausible idea about how to do that, <eob> everybody would be very excited about it, <eob> and there would be lots of research on how to do it. <eob>
But in fact, a lot of people do understand how to do that. <eob>
But there's not much support for research in this area. <eob>
And I think part of it <eob> is because there are some real misunderstandings about it. <eob>
So I'm not going to try to convince you today that this is a good idea. <eob>
But I am going to try to get your curiosity going about it <eob> and clear up some of the misunderstandings. <eob>
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering <eob> is that we can cool things down <eob> just by reflecting a little bit more sunlight <eob> back into space. <eob>
And ideas about how to do this have been around literally for decades. <eob>
Clouds are a great way to do that, these low-lying clouds. <eob>
Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud. <eob>
I like this cloud because it has exactly the same water content <eob> as the transparent air around it. <eob>
And it just shows that even a little bit of a change in the flow of the air <eob> can cause a cloud to form. <eob>
We make artificial clouds all the time. <eob> These are contrails, which are artificial water clouds <eob> that are made by the passing of a jet engine. <eob>
And so, we're already changing the clouds on earth. <eob> By accident. <eob> Or, if you like to believe it, by supersecret government conspiracy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we are already doing this quite a lot. <eob>
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes. <eob>
Passing ships actually cause clouds to form, <eob> and this is a big enough effect <eob> that it actually helps reduce global warming already by about a degree. <eob>
So we already are doing solar engineering. <eob>
There's lots of ideas about how to do this. <eob>
People have looked at everything, <eob> from building giant parasols out into space <eob> to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean. <eob>
And some of these are actually very plausible ideas. <eob>
One that was published recently by David Keith at Harvard <eob> is to take chalk and put dust up into the stratosphere, <eob> where it reflects off sunlight. <eob>
And that's a really neat idea, <eob> because chalk is one of the most common minerals on earth, <eob> and it's very safe -- it's so safe, we put it into baby food. <eob>
And basically, if you throw chalk up into the stratosphere, <eob> it comes down in a couple of years all by itself, dissolved in rainwater. <eob>
Now, before you start worrying about all this chalk in your rainwater, <eob> let me explain to you how little of it it actually takes. <eob>
And that turns out to be very easy to calculate. <eob>
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I made. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I assure you, people have done much more careful calculations, <eob> and it comes out with the same answer, <eob> which is that you have to put chalk up at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year <eob> to undo the effects of the CO2 that we've already done -- <eob> just in terms of temperature, not all the effects, but the temperature. <eob>
So what does that look like? <eob>
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year. <eob>
So I asked the Cambridge Fire Department and Taylor Milsal <eob> to lend me a hand. <eob>
This is a hose pumping water at 10 teragrams a year. <eob>
And that is how much <eob> you would have to pump into the stratosphere <eob> to cool the earth back down to pre-industrial levels. <eob>
And it's amazingly little; it's like one hose for the entire earth. <eob>
Now of course, you wouldn't really use a hose, <eob> you'd fly it up in airplanes or something like that. <eob>
But it's so little, it would be like putting a handful of chalk <eob> into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain. <eob>
It's almost nothing. <eob>
So why don't people like this idea? <eob>
Why isn't it taken more seriously? <eob>
And there are some very good reasons for that. <eob>
A lot of people really don't think we should be talking about this at all. <eob>
And, in fact, I have some very good friends in the audience <eob> who I respect a lot, <eob> who really don't think I should be talking about this. <eob>
And the reason is that they're concerned <eob> that if people imagine there's some easy way out, <eob> that we won't give up our addiction to fossil fuels. <eob>
And I do worry about that. <eob>
I think it's actually a serious problem. <eob>
But there's also, I think, a deeper problem, <eob> which is: nobody likes the idea of messing with the entire earth -- <eob> I certainly don't. <eob> I love this planet, I really do. <eob> And I don't want to mess with it. <eob>
But we're already changing our atmosphere, <eob> we're already messing with it. <eob>
And so I think it makes sense for us to look for ways <eob> to mitigate that impact. <eob>
And we need to do research to do that. <eob>
We need to understand the science behind that. <eob>
I've noticed that there's a theme that's kind of developed at TED, <eob> which is kind of, "fear versus hope," <eob> or "creativity versus caution." <eob> And of course, we need both of those. <eob>
So there aren't any silver bullets. <eob>
This is certainly not a silver bullet. <eob>
But we need science to tell us what our options are; <eob> that informs both our creativity and our caution. <eob>
So I am an optimist about our future selves, <eob> but I'm not an optimist because I think our problems are small. <eob>
I'm an optimist because I think our capacity to deal with our problems <eob> is much greater than we imagine. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This talk sparked a lot of controversy at TED2017, <eob> and we encourage you to look at discussions online <eob> to see other points of view. <eob>
"Will the blight end the chestnut? <eob>
The farmers rather guess not. <eob>
It keeps smouldering at the roots <eob> And sending up new shoots <eob> Till another parasite <eob> Shall come to end the blight." <eob>
At the beginning of the 20th century, <eob> the eastern American chestnut population, counting nearly four billion trees, <eob> was completely decimated by a fungal infection. <eob>
Fungi are the most destructive pathogens of plants, <eob> including crops of major economic importance. <eob>
Can you imagine that today, <eob> crop losses associated with fungal infection <eob> are estimated at billions of dollars per year, worldwide? <eob>
That represents enough food calories to feed half a billion people. <eob>
And this leads to severe repercussions, <eob> including episodes of famine in developing countries, <eob> large reduction of income for farmers and distributors, <eob> high prices for consumers <eob> and risk of exposure to mycotoxin, poison produced by fungi. <eob>
The problems that we face <eob> is that the current method used to prevent and treat <eob> those dreadful diseases, <eob> such as genetic control, exploiting natural sources of resistance, <eob> crop rotation or seed treatment, among others, <eob> are still limited or ephemeral. <eob>
They have to be constantly renewed. <eob>
Therefore, we urgently need to develop more efficient strategies <eob> and for this, research is required to identify biological mechanisms <eob> that can be targeted by novel antifungal treatments. <eob>
One feature of fungi is that they cannot move <eob> and only grow by extension to form a sophisticated network, <eob> the mycelium. <eob>
In 1884, Anton de Bary, the father of plant pathology, <eob> was the first to presume that fungi are guided by signals <eob> sent out from the host plant, <eob> meaning a plant upon which it can lodge and subsist, <eob> so signals act as a lighthouse <eob> for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach <eob> and finally invade and colonize a plant. <eob>
He knew that the identification of such signals <eob> would unlock a great knowledge that then serves to elaborate strategy <eob> to block the interaction between the fungus and the plant. <eob>
However, the lack of an appropriate method at that moment <eob> prevented him from identifying this mechanism at the molecular level. <eob>
Using purification and mutational genomic approaches, <eob> as well as a technique <eob> allowing the measurement of directed hyphal growth, <eob> today I'm glad to tell you that after 130 years, <eob> my former team and I could finally identify such plant signals <eob> by studying the interaction between a pathogenic fungus <eob> called Fusarium oxysporum <eob> and one of its host plants, the tomato plant. <eob>
As well, we could characterize <eob> the fungal receptor receiving those signals <eob> and part of the underlying reaction occurring within the fungus <eob> and leading to its direct growth toward the plant. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
The understanding of such molecular processes <eob> offers a panel of potential molecules <eob> that can be used to create novel antifungal treatments. <eob>
And those treatments would disrupt <eob> the interaction between the fungus and the plant <eob> either by blocking the plant signal <eob> or the fungal reception system which receives those signals. <eob>
Fungal infections have devastated agriculture crops. <eob>
Moreover, we are now in an era <eob> where the demand of crop production is increasing significantly. <eob> And this is due to population growth, economic development, <eob> climate change and demand for bio fuels. <eob>
Our understanding of the molecular mechanism <eob> of interaction between a fungus and its host plant, <eob> such as the tomato plant, <eob> potentially represents a major step towards developing more efficient strategy <eob> to combat plant fungal diseases <eob> and therefore solving of problems that affect people's lives, <eob> food security and economic growth. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
