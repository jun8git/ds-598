Again, what we're seeing here <eol> is blue light hitting this image. <eob>
These animals are absorbing the blue light <eob> and immediately transforming this light. <eob>
So if you think about it, the ocean <eol> is 71 percent of the planet, <eob> and blue light can extend down <eol> to almost a 1,000 meters. <eob>
As we go down underwater, <eob> after about 10 meters, <eol> all the red is gone. <eob>
So if you see anything <eol> under 10 meters that's red, <eob> it's an animal transforming <eol> and creating its own red. <eob>
This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment <eol> on our planet. <eob>
And my gateway into this world <eol> of biofluorescence begins with corals. <eob>
And I want to give <eol> a full TED Talk on corals <eob> and just how cool these things are. <eob>
One of the things that they do, <eol> one of their miraculous feats, <eob> is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, <eob> fluorescent molecules. <eob>
And in this coral, it could be making up <eol> to 14 percent of its body mass -- <eob> could be this fluorescent protein. <eob>
So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle <eol> and not using it, <eob> so it's likely doing something <eol> that has a functional role. <eob>
And for the last 10, 15 years, <eol> this was so special to me, <eob> because this molecule has turned out <eol> to be one of the most revolutionary tools <eob> in biomedical science, <eob> and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves. <eob>
So, how do I study this? <eob>
In order to study biofluorescence, <eol> we swim at night. <eob>
And when I started out, <eob> I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, <eob> so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light <eob> that's being transformed <eol> by the animals. <eob>
We're making an exhibit <eol> for the Museum of Natural History, <eob> and we're trying to show off how great <eol> the fluorescent corals are on the reef, <eob> and something happened <eol> that just blew me away: <eob> this. <eob>
In the middle of our corals, <eob> is this green fluorescent fish. <eob>
It's the first time we've ever seen <eol> a green fluorescent fish <eob> or any vertebrate <eol> for that matter. <eob>
And we're rubbing our eyes, <eol> checking the filters, <eob> thinking that somebody's maybe playing <eol> a joke on us with the camera, <eob> but the eel was real. <eob>
It was the first green fluorescent <eol> eel that we found, <eob> and this just changed my trajectory completely. <eob>
So I had to put down my corals and team up <eob> with a fish scientist, John Sparks, <eob> and begin a search around the world <eob> to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. <eob>
And fish are much more interesting <eol> than corals, <eob> because they have really advanced vision, <eob> and some of the fish even have, the way <eol> that I was photographing it, <eob> they have lenses in their eyes <eol> that would magnify the fluorescence. <eob>
So I wanted to seek this out further. <eob>
So we designed a new set of gear <eob> and we're scouring <eol> the reefs around the world, <eob> looking for fluorescent life. <eob>
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home." <eob> We're out there swimming with this blue light, <eob> and we're looking for a response, <eob> for animals to be absorbing the light <eol> and transferring this back to us. <eob>
And eventually, we found our photobombing <eol> Kaupichphys eel. <eob>
It's a really shy, reclusive eel <eol> that we know almost nothing about. <eob>
They're only about the size <eol> of my finger, <eob> and they spend about 99.9 percent <eol> of their time hidden under a rock. <eob>
But these eels do come out to mate <eol> under full-moon nights, <eob> and that full-moon night <eol> translates underwater to blue. <eob>
Perhaps they're using this <eol> as a way to see each other, <eob> quickly find each other, mate, <eob> go back into their hole <eol> for the next long stint of time. <eob>
But then we started to find <eol> other fluorescent marine life, <eob> like this green fluorescent bream, <eob> with its, like, racing stripes <eol> along its head and its nape, <eob> and it's almost camouflaged <eol> and fluorescing at the same intensity <eob> as the fluorescent coral there. <eob>
After this fish, <eob> we were introduced to this red fluores <eol>cent scorpionfish <eob> cloaked and hidden on this rock. <eob>
The only time we've ever seen this, <eol> it's either on red fluorescent algae <eob> or red fluorescent coral. <eob>
Later, we found this stealthy <eol> green fluorescent lizardfish. <eob>
These lizardfish come in many varieties, <eob> and they look almost exactly <eol> alike under white light. <eob> But if you look at them <eol> under fluorescent light, <eob> you see lots of patterns, <eob> you can really see <eol> the differences among them. <eob>
And in total -- we just reported <eol> this last year -- <eob> we found over 200 species <eol> of biofluorescent fish. <eob>
One of my inspirations is French artist <eol> and biologist Jean Painlevé. <eob>
He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology. <eob>
He would design his own gear, <eol> make his own cameras, <eob> and he was fascinated with the seahorse, <eol> Hippocampus erectus, <eob> and he filmed for the first time <eol> the seahorse giving birth. <eob>
So this is the male seahorse. <eob>
They were one of the first fish <eol> to start swimming upright <eob> with their brain above their head. <eob>
The males give birth, <eob> just phenomenal creatures. <eob>
So he stayed awake for days. <eob>
He even put this electrical visor <eol> on his head that would shock him, <eob> so he could capture this moment. <eob>
Now, I wish I could have shown <eol> Painlevé <eob> the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses <eob> in the exact same species <eol> that he was studying. <eob>
And here's our footage. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
They're the most cryptic fish. <eob>
You could be swimming right on top of them <eol> and not see the seahorse. <eob>
They would blend right into the algae, <eol> which would also fluoresce red, <eob> but they've got great vision, <eob> and they go through this long mating ritual, <eob> and perhaps they're using it in that effect. <eob>
But things got pretty edgy <eob> when we found green fluorescence <eol> in the stingray, <eob> because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, <eob> which includes ... <eob> sharks. <eob>
So I'm, like, a coral biologist. <eob> Somebody's got to go down and check to see <eol> if the sharks are fluorescent. <eob> And there I am. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I was like, "Maybe <eol> I should go back to corals." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It turns out that these sharks <eol> are not fluorescent. <eob>
And then we found it. <eob>
In a deep, dark canyon <eol> off the coast of California, <eob> we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, <eob> right underneath all the surfers. <eob> Here it is. <eob> They're just about a meter long. <eol> It's called a swellshark. <eob> And they call them a swellshark <eol> because if they're threatened, <eob> they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, <eob> about twice their size, <eob> and wedge themselves under a rock, <eol> so they don't get eaten by a predator. <eob>
And here is our first footage <eol> of these biofluorescent swellsharks. <eob>
Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing <eol> these distinct patterns, <eob> and there are areas that are fluorescent <eol> and areas that are not fluorescent, <eob> but they've also got these twinkling spots on them <eob> that are much brighter than other parts <eol> of the shark. <eob>
But this is all beautiful to see. <eob>
I was like, this is gorgeous. <eob> But what does it mean to the shark? <eob> Can they see this? <eob> And we looked in the literature, <eob> and nothing was known <eol> about this shark's vision. <eob>
So I took this shark <eol> to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, <eob> and we found out that this shark <eol> sees discretely and acutely <eob> in the blue-green interface, <eob> probably about 100 times better <eol> than we can see in the dark, <eob> but they only see blue-green. <eob>
So what it's doing <eol> is taking this blue world <eob> and it's absorbing the blue, creating green. <eob>
It's creating contrast <eol> that they can indeed see. <eob>
So we have a model, <eob> showing that it creates an ability <eol> for them to see all these patterns. <eob>
And males and females also have, <eol> we're finding, <eob> distinct patterns among them. <eob>
But our last find came really just a few miles <eol> from where we are now, <eob> in the Solomon Islands. <eob>
Swimming at night, I encountered <eol> the first biofluorescent sea turtle. <eob>
So now it's going from fish <eol> and sharks into reptiles, <eob> which, again, this is only one month old, <eob> but it shows us that we know <eol> almost nothing <eob> about this hawksbill turtle's vision. <eob>
And it makes me think about how much more <eol> there is to learn. <eob>
And here <eob> in the Solomon Islands, <eob> there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, <eob> and this is one of the hotspots for them. <eob>
So it shows us how much we need <eol> to really protect these animals <eob> while they're still here, and understand them. <eob>
In thinking about biofluorescence, <eob> I wanted to know, how deep does it go? <eob>
Does this go all the way <eol> to the bottom of the ocean? <eob>
So we started using submarines, <eol> and we equipped them <eob> with special blue lights <eol> on the front here. <eob>
And we dropped down, <eob> and we noticed one important thing -- <eob> that as we get down to 1,000 meters, <eob> it drops off. <eob>
There's no biofluorescent marine life <eol> down there, below 1,000 meters -- <eob> almost nothing, it's just darkness. <eob>
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. <eob>
And below 1,000 meters, <eob> we encountered the bioluminescent zone, <eob> where nine out of 10 animals <eol> are actually making their own lights <eob> and flashing and blinking. <eob>
As I try to get deeper, <eob> this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- <eob> some people call this my <eol> "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But as we explore down here, <eob> I was thinking about: <eol> How do we interact with life delicately? <eob>
Because we're entering <eol> a new age of exploration, <eob> where we have to take great care, <eob> and we have to set examples <eol> how we explore. <eob>
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, <eob> and we've been designing squishy <eol> underwater robot fingers, <eob> so we can delicately interact <eol> with the marine life down there. <eob>
The idea is that most of our technologies <eol> to explore the deep ocean <eob> come from oil and gas and military, <eob> who, you know, they're not really caring <eol> to be gentle. <eob>
Some corals could be 1,000 years old. <eob>
You don't want to just go <eol> and crush them with a big claw. <eob> So my dream is something like <eob> this. <eob>
At night, I'm in a submarine, <eob> I have force-feedback gloves, <eob> and I could delicately set up a lab <eol> in the front of my submarine, <eob> where the squishy robot fingers <eob> are delicately collecting <eol> and putting things in jars, <eob> and we can conduct our research. <eob>
Back to the powerful applied applications. <eob> Here, you're looking at a living brain <eob> that's using the DNA <eol> of fluorescent marine creatures, <eob> this one from jellyfish and corals, <eob> to illuminate the living brain <eol> and see its connections. <eob>
It's funny that we're using RGB <eob> just to kind of satisfy <eol> our own human intuition, <eob> so we can see our brains better. <eob>
And even more mind-blowing, <eob> is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, <eob> who has actually designed <eol> and engineered a fluorescent protein <eob> that responds to voltage. <eob>
So he could see <eol> when a single neuron fires. <eob>
You're essentially looking <eol> at a portal into consciousness <eob> that was designed <eol> by marine creatures. <eob>
So this brings me all back <eol> to perspective and relationship. <eob>
From deep space, <eob> our universe looks like a human brain cell, <eob> and then here we are in the deep ocean, <eob> and we're finding marine creatures and cells <eob> that can illuminate <eol> the human mind. <eob>
And it's my hope <eol> that with illuminated minds, <eob> we could ponder the overarching <eol> interconnectedness of all life, <eob> and fathom how much more lies in store <eob> if we keep our oceans healthy. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine you're in Rome, <eob> and you've made your way <eol> to the Vatican Museums. <eob>
And you've been shuffling <eol> down long corridors, <eob> past statues, frescoes, <eol> lots and lots of stuff. <eob>
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
At last -- a long corridor, <eol> a stair and a door. <eob>
You're at the threshold <eol> of the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
So what are you expecting? <eob> Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? <eob> We don't really have any of that there. <eob>
Instead, you may ask yourself, <eol> what do we have? <eob>
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
And I mean literally, you're surrounded <eol> by painted curtains, <eob> the original decoration <eol> of this chapel. <eob>
Churches used tapestries <eol> not just to keep out cold during long masses, <eob> but as a way to represent <eol> the great theater of life. <eob>
The human drama in which each one of us <eol> plays a part is a great story, <eob> a story that encompasses the whole world <eob> and that came to unfold <eol> in the three stages <eob> of the painting <eol> in the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
Now, this building started out <eol> as a space for a small group <eob> of wealthy, educated Christian priests. <eob> They prayed there. <eol> They elected their pope there. <eob>
Five hundred years ago, <eob> it was the ultimate ecclesiastical <eol> man cave. <eob>
So, you may ask, how can it be <eol> that today it attracts and delights <eob> five million people a year, <eob> from all different backgrounds? <eob>
Because in that compressed space, <eol> there was a creative explosion, <eob> ignited by the electric excitement <eol> of new geopolitical frontiers, <eob> which set on fire the ancient missionary <eol> tradition of the Church <eob> and produced one of the greatest works <eol> of art in history. <eob>
Now, this development took place <eol> as a great evolution, <eob> moving from the beginning <eol> of a few elite, <eob> and eventually able to speak <eol> to audiences of people <eob> that come from all over the world. <eob>
This evolution took place in three stages, <eob> each one linked <eol> to a historical circumstance. <eob>
The first one was rather limited in scope. <eob>
It reflected the rather parochial perspective. <eob>
The second one took place <eol> after worldviews were dramatically altered <eob> after Columbus's historical voyage; <eob> and the third, <eob> when the Age of Discovery <eol> was well under way <eob> and the Church rose <eol> to the challenge <eob> of going global. <eob>
The original decoration of this church <eol> reflected a smaller world. <eob>
There were busy scenes <eob> that told the stories of the lives <eol> of Jesus and Moses, <eob> reflecting the development <eol> of the Jewish and Christian people. <eob>
The man who commissioned this, <eol> Pope Sixtus IV, <eob> assembled a dream team <eol> of Florentine art, <eob> including men like Sandro Botticelli <eob> and the man who would become <eol> Michelangelo's future painting teacher, <eob> Ghirlandaio. <eob>
These men, they blanketed <eol> the walls with a frieze of pure color, <eob> and in these stories you'll notice <eol> familiar landscapes, <eob> the artists using Roman monuments <eol> or a Tuscan landscape <eob> to render a faraway story, <eol> something much more familiar. <eob>
With the addition of images <eol> of the Pope's friends and family, <eob> this was a perfect decoration <eol> for a small court <eob> limited to the European continent. <eob>
But in 1492, the New World was discovered, <eob> horizons were expanding, <eob> and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm <eol> had to expand as well. <eob>
And it did, <eob> thanks to a creative genius, <eob> a visionary and an awesome story. <eob>
Now, the creative genius <eol> was Michelangelo Buonarroti, <eob> 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate <eol> 12,000 square feet of ceiling, <eob> and the deck was stacked against him -- <eob> he had trained in painting <eol> but had left to pursue sculpture. <eob>
There were angry patrons in Florence <eol> because he had left a stack <eob> of incomplete commissions, <eob> lured to Rome by the prospect <eol> of a great sculptural project, <eob> and that project had fallen through. <eob>
And he had been left with a commission <eol> to paint 12 apostles <eob> against a decorative background <eol> in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, <eob> which would look like every other <eol> ceiling in Italy. <eob>
But genius rose to the challenge. <eob>
In an age when a man dared to sail <eol> across the Atlantic Ocean, <eob> Michelangelo dared <eol> to chart new artistic waters. <eob>
He, too, would tell a story -- <eob> no Apostles -- but a story <eol> of great beginnings, <eob> the story of Genesis. <eob>
Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling. <eob>
How would you be able to read <eol> a busy scene from 62 feet below? <eob>
The painting technique that had been <eol> handed on for 200 years <eob> in Florentine studios was not equipped <eol> for this kind of a narrative. <eob>
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, <eob> and so he played to his strengths. <eob>
Instead of being accustomed <eol> to filling space with busyness, <eob> he took a hammer and chisel <eol> and hacked away at a piece of marble <eob> to reveal the figure within. <eob>
Michelangelo was an essentialist; <eob> he would tell his story <eol> in massive, dynamic bodies. <eob>
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life <eol> Pope Julius II, <eob> a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. <eob>
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, <eob> and he had been steeped in art <eol> for 30 years and he knew its power. <eob>
And history has handed down the moniker <eol> of the Warrior Pope, <eob> but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses <eol> and artillery, <eob> it was art. <eob> He left us the Raphael Rooms, <eol> the Sistine Chapel. <eob> He left St. Peter's Basilica <eob> as well as an extraordinary collection <eol> of Greco-Roman sculptures -- <eob> decidedly un-Christian works <eol> that would become the seedbed <eob> of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. <eob>
Julius was a man <eob> who envisioned a Vatican <eol> that would be eternally relevant <eob> through grandeur and through beauty, <eob> and he was right. <eob>
The encounter between these two giants, <eol> Michelangelo and Julius II, <eob> that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
Michelangelo was so committed <eol> to this project, <eob> that he succeeded in getting the job done <eol> in three and a half years, <eob> using a skeleton crew <eol> and spending most of the time, hours on end, <eob> reaching up above his head <eol> to paint the stories on the ceiling. <eob>
So let's look at this ceiling <eob> and see storytelling gone global. <eob>
No more familiar artistic references <eol> to the world around you. <eob> There's just space and structure and energy; <eob> a monumental painted framework <eol> which opens onto nine panels, <eob> more driven by sculptural form <eol> than painterly color. <eob>
And we stand in the far end <eol> by the entrance, <eob> far from the altar and from the gated enclosure <eol> intended for the clergy <eob> and we peer into the distance, <eol> looking for a beginning. <eob>
And whether in scientific inquiry <eol> or in biblical tradition, <eob> we think in terms of a primal spark. <eob>
Michelangelo gave us <eol> an initial energy <eob> when he gave us the separation <eol> of light and dark, <eob> a churning figure blurry in the distance, <eob> compressed into a tight space. <eob>
The next figure looms larger, <eob> and you see a figure hurtling <eol> from one side to the next. <eob>
He leaves in his wake the sun, <eol> the moon, vegetation. <eob>
Michelangelo didn't focus <eol> on the stuff that was being created, <eob> unlike all the other artists. <eob>
He focused on the act of creation. <eob>
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry <eob> and the creator hovers. <eob> So what's he doing? <eob> Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? <eob>
Or is he looking back over his handiwork, <eol> the universe and his treasures, <eob> just like Michelangelo must have, <eob> looking back over his work in the ceiling <eob> and proclaiming, "It is good." <eob>
So now the scene is set, <eob> and you get to the culmination <eol> of creation, which is man. <eob>
Adam leaps to the eye, <eol> a light figure against a dark background. <eob>
But looking closer, <eob> that leg is pretty languid on the ground, <eob> the arm is heavy on the knee. <eob>
Adam lacks that interior spark <eob> that will impel him to greatness. <eob>
That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, <eob> which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. <eob>
It puts us at the edge of our seats, <eob> because we're one moment <eol> from that contact, <eob> through which that man will discover his purpose, <eob> leap up and take his place <eol> at the pinnacle of creation. <eob>
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. <eob>
Who is in that other arm? <eob>
Eve, first woman. <eob>
No, she's not an afterthought. <eob>
She's part of the plan. <eob>
She's always been in his mind. <eob>
Look at her, so intimate with God <eol> that her hand curls around his arm. <eob>
And for me, an American art historian <eol> from the 21st century, <eob> this was the moment <eol> that the painting spoke to me. <eob>
Because I realized <eol> that this representation of the human drama <eob> was always about men and women -- <eob> so much so, that the dead center, <eol> the heart of the ceiling, <eob> is the creation of woman, <eol> not Adam. <eob>
And the fact is, that when you see them <eol> together in the Garden of Eden, <eob> they fall together <eob> and together their proud posture <eol> turns into folded shame. <eob>
You are at critical juncture <eol> now in the ceiling. <eob>
You are exactly at the point <eol> where you and I can go <eob> no further into the church. <eob>
The gated enclosure <eol> keeps us out of the inner sanctum, <eob> and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. <eob>
The remaining scenes in the ceiling, <eob> they mirror the crowded chaos <eol> of the world around us. <eob>
You have Noah and his Ark <eol> and the flood. <eob> You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice <eol> and a covenant with God. <eob>
Maybe he's the savior. <eob>
Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew <eol> grapes, invented wine, <eob> got drunk and passed out naked <eol> in his barn. <eob>
It is a curious way to design the ceiling, <eob> now starting out with God creating life, <eob> ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. <eob>
And so, compared with Adam, <eob> you might think Michelangelo <eol> is making fun of us. <eob>
But he's about to dispel the gloom <eob> by using those bright colors right <eol> underneath Noah: <eob> emerald, topaz, scarlet <eol> on the prophet Zechariah. <eob>
Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, <eob> and we are turned at this juncture <eol> to a new destination, <eob> with sibyls and prophets <eol> who will lead us on a parade. <eob>
You have the heroes and heroines <eol> who make safe the way, <eob> and we follow the mothers and fathers. <eob>
They are the motors of this great <eol> human engine, driving it forward. <eob>
And now we're at the keystone <eol> of the ceiling, <eob> the culmination of the whole thing, <eob> with a figure that looks like he's about <eol> to fall out of his space <eob> into our space, <eob> encroaching our space. <eob>
This is the most important juncture. <eob> Past meets present. <eob> This figure, Jonah, who spent three days <eol> in the belly of the whale, <eob> for the Christians, is the symbol <eol> of the renewal of humanity <eob> through Jesus' sacrifice, <eob> but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum <eob> from all faiths who visit there every day, <eob> he is the moment the distant past encounters <eol> and meets immediate reality. <eob>
All of this brings us to the yawning <eol> archway of the altar wall, <eob> where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, <eob> painted in 1534 after the world <eol> had changed again. <eob>
The Reformation had splintered <eol> the Church, <eob> the Ottoman Empire had made <eol> Islam a household word <eob> and Magellan had found a route <eol> into the Pacific Ocean. <eob>
How is a 59-year-old artist <eol> who has never been any further than Venice <eob> going to speak to this new world? <eob>
Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, <eob> that universal desire, <eob> common to all of us, <eob> to leave a legacy of excellence. <eob>
Told in terms of the Christian vision <eol> of the Last Judgment, <eob> the end of the world, <eob> Michelangelo gave you <eol> a series of figures <eob> who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. <eob>
They have no more covers, <eol> no more portraits <eob> except for a couple. <eob>
It's a composition only out of bodies, <eob> 391, no two alike, <eob> unique like each and every one of us. <eob>
They start in the lower corner, <eol> breaking away from the ground, <eob> struggling and trying to rise. <eob>
Those who have risen reach <eol> back to help others, <eob> and in one amazing vignette, <eob> you have a black man and a white <eol> man pulled up together <eob> in an incredible vision of human unity <eob> in this new world. <eob>
The lion's share of the space <eol> goes to the winner's circle. <eob>
There you find men and women <eol> completely nude like athletes. <eob>
They are the ones <eol> who have overcome adversity, <eob> and Michelangelo's vision <eol> of people who combat adversity, <eob> overcome obstacles -- <eob> they're just like athletes. <eob>
So you have men <eol> and women flexing and posing <eob> in this extraordinary spotlight. <eob>
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, <eob> first a suffering man on the cross, <eob> now a glorious ruler in Heaven. <eob>
And as Michelangelo proved <eol> in his painting, <eob> hardship, setbacks and obstacles, <eob> they don't limit excellence, <eol> they forge it. <eob>
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing. <eob>
This is the Pope's private chapel, <eob> and the best way you can describe <eol> that is indeed a stew of nudes. <eob>
But Michelangelo was trying to use <eol> only the best artistic language, <eob> the most universal artistic <eol> language he could think of: <eob> that of the human body. <eob>
And so instead of the way of showing virtue <eol> such as fortitude or self-mastery, <eob> he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful <eol> collection of sculptures <eob> in order to show inner strength <eol> as external power. <eob>
Now, one contemporary did write <eob> that the chapel was too beautiful <eol> to not cause controversy. <eob> And so it did. <eob>
Michelangelo soon found <eol> that thanks to the printing press, <eob> complaints about the nudity <eol> spread all over the place, <eob> and soon his masterpiece <eol> of human drama was labeled pornography, <eob> at which point he added <eol> two more portraits, <eob> one of the man who criticized him, <eol> a papal courtier, <eob> and the other one of himself <eol> as a dried up husk, no athlete, <eob> in the hands of a long-suffering martyr. <eob>
The year he died he saw several <eol> of these figures covered over, <eob> a triumph for trivial distractions <eol> over his great exhortation to glory. <eob>
And so now we stand <eob> in the here and now. <eob>
We are caught in that space <eob> between beginnings and endings, <eob> in the great, huge totality of the human experience. <eob>
The Sistine Chapel forces us to look <eol> around as if it were a mirror. <eob>
Who am I in this picture? <eob> Am I one of the crowd? <eob>
Am I the athlete? <eob> And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, <eob> we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: <eob> Who am I, and what role do I play <eol> in this great theater of life? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you. <eob>
Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue <eol> of pornography, <eob> too many nudes and too many daily life scenes <eol> and improper things <eob> in the eyes of the time. <eob>
But actually the story is bigger. <eob>
It's not just touching up <eol> and covering up some of the figures. <eob>
This work of art was almost destroyed <eol> because of that. <eob>
Elizabeth Lev: The effect <eol> of the Last Judgment was enormous. <eob>
The printing press made sure <eol> that everybody saw it. <eob>
And so, this wasn't something <eol> that happened within a couple of weeks. <eob>
It was something that happened <eol> over the space of 20 years <eob> of editorials and complaints, <eob> saying to the Church, <eob> "You can't possibly tell us <eol> how to live our lives. <eob>
Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?" <eob> And so after complaints <eol> and insistence <eob> of trying to get this work destroyed, <eob> it was finally the year <eol> that Michelangelo died <eob> that the Church finally found <eol> a compromise, <eob> a way to save the painting, <eob> and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, <eob> and that happens to be the origin <eol> of fig-leafing. <eob>
That's where it all came about, <eob> and it came about from a church <eol> that was trying to save a work of art, <eob> not indeed deface or destroyed it. <eob>
BG: This, what you just gave us, <eol> is not the classic tour <eob> that people get today <eol> when they go to the Sistine Chapel. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EL: I don't know, is that an ad? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement. <eob>
The experience of art today <eol> is encountering problems. <eob>
Too many people want to see this there, <eob> and the result is five million people <eol> going through that tiny door <eob> and experiencing it in a completely different way <eob> than we just did. <eob>
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice <eol> to be able to pause and look. <eob>
But also realize, even when <eol> you're in those days, <eob> with 28,000 people a day, <eob> even those days when you're in there <eol> with all those other people, <eob> look around you and think <eol> how amazing it is <eob> that some painted <eol> plaster from 500 years ago <eob> can still draw all those people <eol> standing side by side with you, <eob> looking upwards with their jaws dropped. <eob>
It's a great statement about how beauty <eol> truly can speak to us all <eob> through time and through geographic space. <eob>
BG: Liz, grazie. <eob>
BG: <eob> Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005. <eob>
I was working at the ACLU <eol> as the organization's science advisor. <eob> I really, really loved my job, <eob> but I was having one of those days <eob> where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged. <eob>
So I wandered down the hallway <eol> to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. <eob>
Chris had been at the ACLU <eol> for more than 30 years, <eob> so he had deep institutional knowledge <eol> and insights. <eob>
I explained to Chris <eol> that I was feeling a little bit stuck. <eob>
I had been investigating <eol> a number of issues <eob> at the intersection of science <eol> and civil liberties -- super interesting. <eob>
But I wanted the ACLU to engage <eol> these issues in a much bigger way, <eob> in a way that could really make a difference. <eob>
So Chris cut right to the chase, <eol> and he says, <eob> "Well, of all the issues <eol> you've been looking at, what are the top five?" <eob>
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, <eob> and reproductive technologies, <eob> and biobanking, and ... <eob> oh, there's this really cool issue, <eob> functional MRI and using <eol> it for lie detection, and ... <eob> oh, and of course, <eol> there's gene patents." <eob>
"Gene patents?" <eob>
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes." <eob>
"No! <eob> You're telling me that the US government <eob> has been issuing patents <eol> on part of the human body? <eob>
That can't be right." <eob>
I went back to my office <eol> and sent Chris three articles. <eob>
And 20 minutes later, <eol> he came bursting in my office. <eob> "Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, <eob> but he knew almost nothing <eol> about patent law <eob> and certainly nothing about genetics. <eob>
I knew something about genetics, <eol> but I wasn't even a lawyer, <eob> let alone a patent lawyer. <eob>
So clearly we had a lot to learn <eol> before we could file a lawsuit. <eob>
First, we needed to understand <eol> exactly what was patented <eob> when someone patented a gene. <eob>
Gene patents typically contain <eol> dozens of claims, <eob> but the most controversial <eol> of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" -- <eob> namely, a piece of DNA <eol> that has been removed from a cell. <eob>
Gene patent proponents say, <eob> "See? We didn't patent <eol> the gene in your body, <eob> we patented an isolated gene." <eob> And that's true, <eob> but the problem is that any use <eol> of the gene requires that it be isolated. <eob>
And the patents weren't just to a particular gene <eol> that they isolated, <eob> but on every possible version <eol> of that gene. <eob>
So what does that mean? <eob>
That means that you can't give <eol> your gene to your doctor <eob> and ask him or her to look at it, <eob> say, to see if it has any mutations, <eob> without permission of the patent holder. <eob>
It also means that the patent holder <eol> has the right to stop anyone <eob> from using that gene <eol> in research or clinical testing. <eob>
Allowing patent holders, <eob> often private companies, <eob> to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients. <eob>
Consider Abigail, <eob> a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, <eob> a serious heart condition <eol> that, if left untreated, <eob> can result in sudden death. <eob>
The company that obtained a patent on two genes <eol> associated with this condition <eob> developed a test to diagnose <eol> the syndrome. <eob>
But then they went bankrupt <eol> and they never offered it. <eob>
So another lab tried to offer the test, <eob> but the company that held <eol> the patents threatened to sue the lab <eob> for patent infringement. <eob>
So as a result, <eob> for 2 years, no test was available. <eob>
During that time, <eob> Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT. <eob>
Gene patents clearly were a problem <eol> and were harming patients. <eob> But was there a way we could challenge them? <eob>
Turns out that the Supreme Court <eob> has made clear through <eol> a long line of cases, <eob> that certain things are not <eol> patent eligible. <eob>
You can't patent products <eol> of nature -- <eob> the air, the water, minerals, elements <eol> of the periodic table. <eob>
And you can't patent laws of nature -- <eob> the law of gravity, E = mc2. <eob>
These things are just too fundamental <eol> and must remain free to all <eob> and reserved exclusively to none. <eob>
It seemed to us that DNA, <eob> the most fundamental structure of life, <eob> that codes for the production <eol> of all of our proteins, <eob> is both a product of nature <eol> and a law of nature, <eob> regardless of whether <eol> it's in our bodies <eob> or sitting in the bottom of a test tube. <eob>
As we delved into this issue, <eob> we traveled all over the country <eol> to speak with many different experts -- <eob> scientists, medical professionals, <eol> lawyers, patent lawyers. <eob>
Most of them agreed that we were <eol> right as a matter of policy, <eob> and, at least in theory, <eol> as a matter of law. <eob>
All of them thought <eob> our chances of winning <eol> a gene-patent challenge <eob> were about zero. <eob>
Why is that? <eob> Well, the patent office <eol> had been issuing these patents <eob> for more than 20 years. <eob>
There were literally thousands <eol> of patents on human genes. <eob>
The patent bar was deeply entrenched <eol> in the status quo, <eob> the biotech industry <eol> had grown up around this practice, <eob> and legislation to ban gene <eol> patents had been introduced <eob> year after year in Congress, <eob> and had gone absolutely nowhere. <eob>
So the bottom line: <eob> courts just weren't going <eol> to be willing to overturn these patents. <eob>
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type <eol> to shy away from a challenge, <eob> and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," <eob> seemed all the more reason <eol> to take on this fight. <eob>
So we set out to build our case. <eob>
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B <eob> over some really narrow, obscure <eol> technical issue. <eob>
We weren't really interested <eol> in that kind of case, <eob> and we thought this case <eol> was much bigger than that. <eob>
This was about scientific freedom, <eol> medical progress, <eob> the rights of patients. <eob>
So we decided we were going <eol> to develop a case <eob> that was not like your typical <eol> patent case -- <eob> more like a civil rights case. <eob>
We set out to identify <eol> a gene-patent holder <eob> that was vigorously enforcing its patents <eob> and then to organize a broad coalition <eol> of plaintiffs and experts <eob> that could tell the court <eob> about all the ways that these patents <eol> were harming patients and innovation. <eob>
We found the prime candidate <eol> to sue in Myriad Genetics, <eob> a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah. <eob>
Myriad held patents on two genes, <eob> the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes. <eob>
Women with certain mutations <eol> along these genes <eob> are considered to be at a significantly increased risk <eob> of developing breast and ovarian cancer. <eob>
Myriad had used its patents to maintain <eob> a complete monopoly on BRCA testing <eol> in the United States. <eob>
It had forced multiple labs <eol> that were offering BRCA testing to stop. <eob>
It charged a lot of money for its test -- <eob> over 3,000 dollars. <eob>
It had stopped sharing its clinical data <eob> with the international scientific community. <eob>
And perhaps worst of all, <eob> for a period of several years, <eob> Myriad refused to update its test <eol> to include additional mutations <eob> that had been identified <eol> by a team of researchers in France. <eob>
It has been estimated that during that period, <eob> for several years, <eob> as many as 12 percent of women <eol> undergoing testing <eob> received the wrong answer -- <eob> a negative test result that <eol> should have been positive. <eob>
This is Kathleen Maxian. <eob> Kathleen's sister Eileen developed <eol> breast cancer at age 40 <eob> and she was tested by Myriad. <eob>
The test was negative. <eob>
The family was relieved. <eob>
That meant that Eileen's cancer <eol> most likely didn't run in the family, <eob> and that other members of her family <eol> didn't need to be tested. <eob>
But two years later, <eob> Kathleen was diagnosed <eol> with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. <eob>
It turned out that Kathleen's sister <eol> was among the 12 percent <eob> who received a false-negative test result. <eob>
Had Eileen received the proper result, <eob> Kathleen would have then been tested, <eob> and her ovarian cancer <eol> could have been prevented. <eob>
Once we settled on Myriad, <eob> we then had to form a coalition <eol> of plaintiffs and experts <eob> that could illuminate these problems. <eob>
We ended up with 20 highly <eol> committed plaintiffs: <eob> genetic counselors, <eob> geneticists who had received <eol> cease and desist letters, <eob> advocacy organizations, <eob> four major scientific organizations <eol> that collectively represented <eob> more than 150,000 scientists <eol> and medical professionals, <eob> and individual women who either <eol> couldn't afford Myriad's test, <eob> or who wanted to obtain a second opinion <eol> but could not, <eob> as a result of the patents. <eob>
One of the major challenges <eol> we had in preparing the case <eob> was figuring out how best <eol> to communicate the science. <eob>
So in order to argue that <eol> what Myriad did was not an invention, <eob> and that isolated BRCA genes <eol> were products of nature, <eob> we had to explain a couple <eol> of basic concepts, like: <eob> What's a gene? What's DNA? <eob> How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention? <eob>
We spent hours and hours <eol> with our plaintiffs and experts, <eob> trying to come up with ways of explaining <eol> these concepts <eob> simply yet accurately. <eob>
And we ended up relying <eol> heavily on the use of metaphors, <eob> like gold. <eob>
So isolating DNA -- <eob> it's like extracting gold from a mountain <eob> or taking it out of a stream bed. <eob>
You might be able to patent <eol> the process for mining the gold, <eob> but you can't patent the gold itself. <eob>
It might've taken a lot of hard work <eol> and effort <eob> to dig the gold <eol> out of the mountain; <eob> you still can't patent it, <eol> it's still gold. <eob>
And the gold, once it's extracted, <eob> can clearly be used <eol> for all sorts of things <eob> that it couldn't be used for <eol> when it was in the mountain; <eob> you can make jewelry out of it for example -- <eob> still can't patent the gold, it's still gold. <eob>
So now it's 2009, and we're ready <eol> to file our case. <eob>
We filed in federal court <eol> in the Southern District of New York, <eob> and the case was randomly assigned <eol> to Judge Robert Sweet. <eob>
In March 2010, Judge Sweet <eol> issued his opinion -- <eob> 152 pages -- <eob> and a complete victory <eol> for our side. <eob>
In reading the opinion, <eob> we could not get over how eloquently <eol> he described the science in the case. <eob>
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, <eob> but not this good. <eob>
How did he develop such a deep <eol> understanding of this issue <eob> in such a short time? <eob>
We just could not comprehend <eol> how this had happened. <eob>
So it turned out, <eob> Judge Sweet's clerk working <eol> for him at the time, <eob> was not just a lawyer -- <eob> he was a scientist. <eob>
He was not just a scientist -- <eob> he had a PhD in molecular biology. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What an incredible stroke of luck! <eob>
Myriad then appealed <eob> to the US Court of Appeals <eol> for the Federal Circuit. <eob>
And here things got really interesting. <eob>
First, in a pivotal moment of this case, <eob> the US government switched sides. <eob>
So in the district court the government <eol> submitted a brief on Myriad's side. <eob>
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, <eob> the US government files a brief <eol> that states that is has <eob> reconsidered this issue in light <eol> of the district court's opinion, <eob> and has concluded <eol> that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. <eob>
This was a really big deal, <eob> totally unexpected. <eob>
The Court of Appeals <eol> for the Federal Circuit <eob> hears all patent cases, <eob> and it has a reputation <eol> for being very, very pro-patent. <eob>
So even with this remarkable development, <eob> we expected to lose. <eob> And we did. <eob> Sort of. <eob> Ends up split decision, 2 to 1. <eob>
But the two judges who ruled against us, <eob> did so for completely different reasons. <eob>
The first one, Judge Lourie, <eob> made up his own novel, <eol> biological theory -- <eob> totally wrong. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He decided Myriad had created <eol> a new chemical -- <eob> made absolutely no sense. <eob>
Myriad didn't even argue this, <eol> so it came out of the blue. <eob>
The other, Judge Moore, <eob> said she basically agreed with us <eol> that isolated DNA is a product of nature. <eob>
But she's like, "I don't want to shake up <eol> the biotech industry." <eob> The third, Judge Bryson, <eob> agreed with us. <eob>
So now we sought review <eol> by the Supreme Court. <eob>
And when you petition the Supreme Court, <eob> you have to present a question <eol> that you want the Court to answer. <eob>
Usually these questions take <eol> the form of a super-long paragraph, <eob> like a whole page long with lots <eol> and lots of clauses, <eob> "wherein this" <eol> and "therefore that." <eob> We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. <eob>
Four words: <eob> Are human genes patentable? <eob>
Now when Chris first asked me <eol> what I thought of these words, <eob> I said, "Well, I don't know. <eob>
I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'" <eob>
"Nope. <eob> I want the justices to have <eol> the very same reaction that I had <eob> when you brought this issue <eol> to me seven years ago." <eob>
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that. <eob>
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent <eob> of the cases that it receives, <eob> and it agreed to hear ours. <eob>
The day of the oral argument arrives, <eol> and it was really, really exciting — <eob> long line of people outside, <eob> people had been standing in line <eol> since 2: 30 in the morning <eob> to try to get into the courthouse. <eob>
Two breast cancer organizations, <eob> Breast Cancer Action <eol> and FORCE, <eob> had organized a demonstration <eol> on the courthouse steps. <eob>
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, <eob> moments before he was to walk in and argue <eob> the most important case of his career. <eob>
I was clearly more nervous than he was. <eob>
But any remaining panic subsided <eol> as I walked into the courtroom <eob> and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: <eob> our individual women clients <eob> who had shared their deeply personal stories, <eob> the geneticists who had taken huge chunks <eol> of time out of their busy careers <eob> to dedicate themselves <eol> to this fight <eob> and representatives from a diverse array <eob> of medical, patient advocacy, <eob> environmental and religious organizations, <eob> who had submitted friend <eol> of the court briefs in the case. <eob>
Also in the room were three leaders <eol> of the Human Genome Project, <eob> including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, <eob> James Watson, <eob> who had submitted a brief to the court, <eob> where he referred <eol> to gene patenting as "lunacy." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The diversity of the communities <eol> represented in this room <eob> and the contributions each had made <eol> to make this day a reality <eob> spoke volumes to what was at stake. <eob>
The argument itself was riveting. <eob> Chris argued brilliantly. <eob> But for me, <eob> the most thrilling aspect was watching <eol> the Supreme Court justices grapple <eob> with isolated DNA, <eob> through a series of colorful <eol> analogies and feisty exchanges, <eob> very much the same way as our legal team had done <eob> for the past seven years. <eob>
Justice Kagan likened <eol> isolating DNA <eob> to extracting a medicinal plant <eol> from the Amazon. <eob>
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving <eol> a baseball bat from a tree. <eob>
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, <eob> Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA <eol> to be "just nature sitting there." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We felt pretty confident leaving <eol> the courtroom that day, <eob> but I could never have anticipated the outcome: <eob> nine to zero. <eob>
"A naturally occurring DNA <eol> segment is a product of nature, <eob> and not patent-eligible merely <eol> because it has been isolated. <eob>
And furthermore, <eob> Myriad did not create anything." <eob>
Within 24 hours of the decision, <eob> five labs had announced <eob> that they would begin <eol> to offer testing for the BRCA genes. <eob>
Some of them promised to offer the tests <eol> at a lower price than Myriad's. <eob>
Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test <eob> than the one Myriad was offering. <eob>
But of course the decision <eol> goes far beyond Myriad. <eob>
It ends a 25-year practice <eol> of allowing patents on human genes <eob> in the United States. <eob> It clears a significant barrier <eol> to biomedical discovery and innovation. <eob>
And it helps to ensure <eol> that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen <eob> have access to the tests <eol> that they need. <eob>
A few weeks after the court <eol> issued its decision, <eob> I received a small package in the mail. <eob>
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, <eob> a professor at Duke University <eob> and one the very first people Chris <eol> and I went to visit <eob> when we started to consider <eol> whether to bring this case. <eob>
I opened it up to find <eol> a small stuffed animal. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We took a big risk in taking this case. <eob>
Part of what gave us the courage <eol> to take that risk <eob> was knowing that we were doing the right thing. <eob>
The process took nearly eight years <eol> from the start to finish, <eob> with many twists and turns along the way. <eob>
A little luck certainly helped, <eob> but it was the communities <eol> that we bridged, <eob> the alliances that we created, <eob> that made pigs fly. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Code is the next universal language. <eob>
In the seventies, it was punk <eol> music that drove the whole generation. <eob>
In the eighties, it was probably money. <eob>
But for my generation of people, <eob> software is the interface to our imagination <eol> and our world. <eob>
And that means that we need <eob> a radically, radically more diverse <eol> set of people <eob> to build those products, <eob> to not see computers as mechanical <eol> and lonely and boring and magic, <eob> to see them as things <eol> that they can tinker <eob> and turn around and twist, and so forth. <eob>
My personal journey into the world <eol> of programming and technology <eob> started at the tender age of 14. <eob>
I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, <eob> and the older man in question <eol> just happened to be <eob> the then Vice President of the United States, <eol> Mr. Al Gore. <eob>
And I did what every single teenage girl <eol> would want to do. <eob>
I wanted to somehow express <eol> all of this love, <eob> so I built him a website, <eol> it's over here. <eob>
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, <eob> there was no Facebook, <eol> there was no Pinterest. <eob>
So I needed to learn to code <eob> in order to express <eol> all of this longing and loving. <eob>
And that is how programming <eol> started for me. <eob>
It started as a means of self-expression. <eob>
Just like when I was smaller, <eol> I would use crayons and legos. <eob>
And when I was older, I would use <eol> guitar lessons and theater plays. <eob>
But then, there were other things <eol> to get excited about, <eob> like poetry and knitting socks <eob> and conjugating French irregular verbs <eob> and coming up with make-believe worlds <eob> and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. <eob>
And I started to be one of those people <eob> who felt that computers are boring <eol> and technical and lonely. <eob>
Here's what I think today. <eob>
Little girls don't know <eol> that they are not supposed to like computers. <eob> Little girls are amazing. <eob> They are really, really good <eol> at concentrating on things <eob> and being exact and they ask <eol> amazing questions like, <eob> "What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?" <eob> And they don't know that they are not supposed <eol> to like computers. <eob>
It's the parents who do. <eob>
It's us parents who feel <eob> like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline <eob> that only belongs <eol> to the mystery makers. <eob>
That it's almost as far removed <eol> from everyday life <eob> as, say, nuclear physics. <eob>
And they are partly right about that. <eob>
There's a lot of syntax <eol> and controls and data structures <eob> and algorithms and practices, <eob> protocols and paradigms in programming. <eob>
And we as a community, we've made <eol> computers smaller and smaller. <eob>
We've built layers and layers <eol> of abstraction on top of each other <eob> between the man and the machine <eob> to the point that we no longer <eol> have any idea how computers work <eob> or how to talk to them. <eob>
And we do teach our kids <eol> how the human body works, <eob> we teach them how the combustion engine functions <eob> and we even tell them that if you <eol> want to really be an astronaut <eob> you can become one. <eob>
But when the kid comes to us and asks, <eob> "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?" <eob> Or, "How does the computer know <eol> what happens when I press 'play,' <eob> how does it know which video to show?" <eob> Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?" <eob> We adults, we grow oddly silent. <eob> "It's magic," some of us say. <eob> "It's too complicated," the others say. <eob>
Well, it's neither. <eob>
It's not magic and it's not complicated. <eob>
It all just happened really, <eol> really, really fast. <eob>
Computer scientists built these amazing, <eol> beautiful machines, <eob> but they made them very, <eol> very foreign to us, <eob> and also the language we speak <eol> to the computers <eob> so that we don't know how to speak <eol> to the computers anymore <eob> without our fancy user interfaces. <eob>
And that's why no one recognized <eob> that when I was conjugating <eol> French irregular verbs, <eob> I was actually practicing <eol> my pattern recognition skills. <eob>
And when I was excited about knitting, <eob> I actually was following <eol> a sequence of symbolic commands <eob> that included loops inside of them. <eob>
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest <eob> to find an exact language <eol> between English and mathematics <eob> found its home inside of a computer. <eob>
I was a programmer, but no one knew it. <eob>
The kids of today, they tap, <eol> swipe and pinch their way through the world. <eob>
But unless we give them tools <eol> to build with computers, <eob> we are raising only consumers <eol> instead of creators. <eob>
This whole quest led me <eol> to this little girl. <eob>
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. <eob>
She is completely fearless, <eol> imaginative and a little bit bossy. <eob>
And every time <eol> I would run into a problem <eob> in trying to teach myself programming like, <eob> "What is object-oriented design <eol> or what is garbage collection?", <eob> I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl <eol> would explain the problem. <eob>
And I wrote a book about her <eol> and I illustrated it <eob> and the things Ruby taught me go like this. <eob>
Ruby taught me that you're not supposed <eol> to be afraid <eob> of the bugs under your bed. <eob>
And even the biggest of the problems <eob> are a group of tiny problems stuck together. <eob>
And Ruby also introduced me <eol> to her friends, <eob> the colorful side of the Internet culture. <eob>
She has friends like the Snow Leopard, <eob> who is beautiful but doesn't want <eol> to play with the other kids. <eob>
And she has friends like the green robots <eol> that are really friendly but super messy. <eob>
And she has friends like Linux the penguin <eob> who's really ruthlessly efficient, <eol> but somewhat hard to understand. <eob>
And idealistic foxes, and so on. <eob>
In Ruby's world, you learn <eol> technology through play. <eob>
And, for instance, computers are really <eol> good at repeating stuff, <eob> so the way Ruby would teach loops <eol> goes like this. <eob>
This is Ruby's favorite dance <eol> move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp <eob> clap, clap and jump." <eob> And you learn counter loops <eol> by repeating that four times. <eob>
And you learn while loops <eol> by repeating that sequence <eob> while I'm standing on one leg. <eob>
And you learn until loops <eol> by repeating that sequence <eob> until mom gets really mad. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> And most of all, you learn <eol> that there are no ready answers. <eob>
When coming up with the curriculum <eol> for Ruby's world, <eob> I needed to really ask <eol> the kids how they see the world <eob> and what kind of questions they have <eob> and I would organize play testing sessions. <eob>
I would start by showing the kids <eol> these four pictures. <eob>
I would show them a picture of a car, <eob> a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. <eob>
And I would ask, "Which one of these do <eol> you think is a computer?" <eob> And the kids would be <eol> very conservative and go, <eob> "None of these is a computer. <eob>
I know what a computer is: <eob> it's that glowing box <eob> in front of which mom <eol> or dad spends way too much time." <eob> But then we would talk <eob> and we would discover <eol> that actually, a car is a computer, <eob> it has a navigation <eol> system inside of it. <eob>
And a dog -- a dog <eol> might not be a computer, <eob> but it has a collar <eob> and the collar might have <eol> a computer inside of it. <eob>
And grocery stores, they have <eol> so many different kinds of computers, <eob> like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. <eob>
And kids, you know what? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> In Japan, toilets are computers <eob> and there's even hackers who hack them. <eob>
And we go further <eob> and I give them these little stickers <eol> with an on / off button on them. <eob>
And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability <eob> to make anything in this room <eol> into a computer." <eob> And again, the kids go, <eob> "Sounds really hard, <eob> I don't know <eol> the right answer for this." <eob> But I tell them, "Don't worry, <eob> your parents don't know <eol> the right answer, either. <eob>
They've just started to hear about this thing <eob> called The Internet of Things. <eob>
But you kids, <eol> you are going to be the ones <eob> who are really going to live up in a world <eol> where everything is a computer." <eob>
And then I had this little girl who came to me <eob> and took a bicycle lamp <eob> and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, <eob> it would change colors." <eob> And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?" <eob> And she thinks and she thinks, <eob> and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer, <eob> we could go on a biking trip with my father <eob> and we would sleep in a tent <eob> and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector." <eob> And that's the moment I'm looking for, <eob> the moment when the kid realizes <eob> that the world is definitely not ready yet, <eob> that a really awesome way of making the world more ready <eob> is by building technology <eob> and that each one of us can be a part of that change. <eob>
Final story, we also built a computer. <eob>
And we got to know the bossy CPU <eol> and the helpful RAM and ROM <eob> that help it remember things. <eob>
And after we've assembled <eol> our computer together, <eob> we also design an application for it. <eob>
And my favorite story is this little boy, <eob> he's six years old <eob> and his favorite thing in the world <eol> is to be an astronaut. <eob>
And the boy, he has these huge headphones on <eob> and he's completely immersed <eol> in his tiny paper computer <eob> because you see, he's built his own <eob> intergalactic planetary navigation application. <eob>
And his father, the lone astronaut <eol> in the Martian orbit, <eob> is on the other side of the room <eob> and the boy's important mission <eob> is to bring the father <eol> safely back to earth. <eob>
And these kids are going to have <eol> a profoundly different view of the world <eob> and the way we build it with technology. <eob>
Finally, the more approachable, <eol> the more inclusive, <eob> and the more diverse we make <eol> the world of technology, <eob> the more colorful and better <eol> the world will look like. <eob>
So, imagine with me, for a moment, <eob> a world where the stories we tell <eob> about how things get made <eol> don't only include <eob> the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, <eob> but also Kenyan schoolgirls <eol> and Norwegian librarians. <eob>
Imagine a world where the little Ada <eol> Lovelaces of tomorrow, <eob> who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, <eob> they grow up to be very optimistic <eol> and brave about technology. <eob>
They embrace the powers <eol> and the opportunities <eob> and the limitations of the world. <eob>
A world of technology <eol> that is wonderful, whimsical <eob> and a tiny bit weird. <eob>
When I was a girl, <eob> I wanted to be a storyteller. <eob>
I loved make-believe worlds <eob> and my favorite thing to do <eob> was to wake up in the mornings <eol> in Moominvalley. <eob>
In the afternoons, I would roam <eol> around the Tatooines. <eob>
And in the evenings, I would go <eol> to sleep in Narnia. <eob>
And programming turned out to be <eol> the perfect profession for me. <eob>
I still create worlds. <eob>
Instead of stories, I do them with code. <eob>
Programming gives me this amazing power <eob> to build my whole little universe <eob> with its own rules and paradigms and practices. <eob>
Create something out of nothing with <eol> the pure power of logic. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Melati Wijsen: Bali — island of gods. <eob>
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise. <eob>
MW: Or ... <eob> a paradise lost. <eob>
Bali: <eob> island of garbage. <eob>
IW: In Bali, <eob> we generate 680 cubic meters <eol> of plastic garbage a day. <eob>
That's about a 14-story building. <eob>
And when it comes to plastic bags, <eob> less than five percent gets recycled. <eob>
MW: We know that changes the image <eol> you may have of our island. <eob>
It changed ours, too, <eol> when we learned about it, <eob> when we learned that almost <eol> all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains <eob> and then in our rivers <eob> and then in our ocean. <eob>
And those that don't even <eol> make it to the ocean, <eob> they're either burned <eol> or littered. <eob>
IW: So we decided to do <eol> something about it. <eob>
And we've been working <eol> for almost three years now <eob> to try to say no to plastic bags <eol> on our home island. <eob>
And we have had <eol> some significant successes. <eob>
MW: We are sisters, <eob> and we go to the best school on earth: <eob> Green School, Bali. <eob>
Green School is not only different in the way <eol> that it is built out of bamboo, <eob> but also in the way that it teaches. <eob>
We are taught to become leaders of today, <eob> something a normal textbook cannot match. <eob>
IW: One day we had a lesson in class <eob> where we learned about significant people, <eob> like Nelson Mandela, <eob> Lady Diana <eob> and Mahatma Gandhi. <eob>
Walking home that day, <eob> we agreed that we also wanted <eol> to be significant. <eob>
Why should we wait until we were grown up <eob> to be significant? <eob>
We wanted to do something now. <eob>
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, <eob> we brainstormed and thought <eol> of all the issues facing Bali. <eob>
And one thing <eol> that stood out to us the most <eob> was the plastic garbage. <eob>
But that is a huge problem. <eob>
So we looked into what was <eol> a realistic target for us kids: <eob> plastic bags. <eob>
And the idea was born. <eob>
IW: We started researching, <eob> and let's just say, the more we learned, <eob> there was nothing good about <eob> plastic bags. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
We don't even need them. <eob>
MW: We were really inspired <eol> by the efforts to say no to <eob> plastic bags <eob> in many other places, <eob> from Hawaii to Rwanda <eob> and to severals cities <eol> like Oakland and Dublin. <eob>
IW: And so the idea turned into <eol> the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags." <eob> MW: In the years <eol> that we have been campaigning, <eob> we have learned a lot. <eob>
Lesson number one: <eob> you cannot do it all by yourself. <eob>
You need a big team <eol> of like-minded kids, <eob> and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. <eob>
The volunteer team includes children <eol> from all over the island, <eob> from both international <eol> and local schools. <eob>
And together with them, <eob> we started a multi-layered approach, <eob> based on an on- and off-line signature petition, <eob> educational and inspirational presentations at schools <eob> and we raise general awareness <eol> at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups. <eob>
And last but not least, <eob> we distribute alternative bags, <eob> bags like net bags, <eob> recycled newspaper bags <eob> or 100 percent organic material bags, <eob> all made by local initiatives <eol> on the island. <eob>
IW: We run a pilot village, <eob> home of 800 families. <eob>
The village mayor was our first friend <eob> and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped. <eob>
We focused on making the customers aware, <eob> because that's where the change <eol> needs to happen. <eob>
The village is already two-thirds <eol> along the way <eob> of becoming plastic bag free. <eob>
Our first attempts to get <eol> the government of Bali on board failed. <eob>
So we thought, <eob> "Hmm ... a petition <eol> with one million signatures. <eob>
They can't ignore us, right?" <eob>
MW: Right! <eob>
IW: But, who would have guessed <eob> one million signatures is, <eol> like, a thousand times a thousand? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We got stuck -- <eob> till we learned lesson number two: <eob> think outside the box. <eob>
Someone mentioned <eob> that the Bali airport handles 16 million <eol> arrivals and departures a year. <eob>
MW: But how do we get into the airport? <eob>
And here comes lesson number three: <eob> persistence. <eob>
Off we headed to the airport. <eob>
We got past the janitor. <eob>
And then it was his boss's boss, <eob> and then the assistant office manager, <eob> and then the office manager, <eob> and then ... <eob> we got shuffled down <eol> two levels and thought, <eob> well, here comes the janitor again. <eob>
And after several days knocking on doors <eob> and just being kids on a mission, <eob> we finally got to the commercial manager <eol> of Bali airports. <eob>
And we gave him the "Bali of <eob> plastic bags" <eob> speech, and being a very nice man, <eob> he said, [imitating the man's voice] <eol> "I cannot believe what I'm about say, <eob> but I'm going to give authorization <eob> to collect signatures behind customs <eol> and immigrations." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
IW: In our first hour and a half there, <eob> we got almost 1,000 signatures. <eob>
How cool is that? <eob>
Lesson number four: <eob> you need champions at all levels of society, <eob> from students to commercial managers <eol> to famous people. <eob>
And thanks to the attraction <eol> of Green School, <eob> we had access to a steady <eol> stream of celebrities. <eob>
Ban Ki Moon taught us <eob> that Secretary-Generals <eol> of the United Nations <eob> don't sign petitions -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
even if kids ask nicely. <eob>
But he promised to spread the word, <eob> and now we work closely <eol> with the United Nations. <eob>
MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power <eol> of a people's network. <eob>
She started with just one Roots & amp; Shoots group <eob> and now she has 4,000 groups <eol> around the world. <eob>
We are one of them. <eob>
She's a real inspiration. <eob>
If you're a fellow Rotarian, <eob> nice to meet you. <eob>
We're Interactors, <eob> the youngest department of Rotary International. <eob>
IW: But we have also learned <eol> much about patience, <eob>
MW: how to deal with frustrations, <eob>
IW: leadership, <eob>
MW: teamwork, <eob>
IW: friendship, <eob>
MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture <eob>
IW: and we learned about <eol> the importance of commitment. <eob>
MW: It's not always easy. <eob>
Sometimes it does get a little bit hard <eol> to walk your talk. <eob>
IW: But last year, we did exactly that. <eob>
We went to India to give a talk, <eob> and our parents took us to visit <eob> the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. <eob>
We learned about the power <eol> of hunger strikes <eob> he did to reach his goals. <eob>
Yes, by the end of the tour, <eob> when we met our parents again, <eob> we both made a decision and said, <eob> "We're going on a hunger strike!" <eob>
MW: And you can probably imagine <eol> their faces. <eob>
It took a lot of convincing, <eob> and not only to our parents <eob> but to our friends and to our teachers <eol> as well. <eob>
Isabel and I were serious <eol> about doing this. <eob>
So we met with a nutritionist, <eob> and we came up with a compromise <eob> of not eating from sunrise <eol> to sunset every day <eob> until the governor of Bali would agree <eol> to meet with us <eob> to talk about how to stop <eol> plastic bags on Bali. <eob>
IW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called <eol> in Bahasa Indonesia, <eob> started. <eob>
We used social media <eol> to support our goal <eob> and already on day two, <eob> police started to come to our home and school. <eob>
What were these two girls doing? <eob>
We knew we weren't making <eol> the governor look his best <eob> by doing this food strike -- <eob> we could have gone to jail. <eob>
But, hey, it worked. <eob>
Twenty-four hours later, <eob> we were picked up from school <eob> and escorted to the office <eol> of the governor. <eob>
MW: And there he was -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
waiting for us to meet and speak, <eob> being all supportive and thankful <eol> for our willingness <eob> to care for the beauty <eol> and the environment of Bali. <eob>
He signed a promise <eob> to help the people of Bali say no to <eob> plastic bags. <eob>
And we are now friends, <eob> and on a regular basis, <eob> we remind him and his team <eol> of the promises he has made. <eob>
And indeed, <eob> recently he stated and committed <eob> that Bali will be plastic bag <eol> free by 2018. <eob>
IW: Also, at the International Airport <eol> of Bali, one of our supporters <eob> is planning to start a plastic bag-free <eol> policy by 2016. <eob>
MW: Stop handing out free <eob> plastic bags <eob> and bring in your own reusable bag <eob> is our next message to change <eol> that mindset of the public. <eob>
IW: Our short-term campaign, <eob> "One Island / One Voice," <eob> is all about this. <eob>
We check and recognize <eol> the shops and restaurants <eob> that have declared themselves <eol> a plastic bag-free zone, <eob> and we put this sticker at their entrance <eob> and publish their names <eol> on social media <eob> and some important magazines on Bali. <eob>
And conversely, <eob> that highlights those who do not <eol> have the sticker. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
MW: So, why are we actually <eol> telling you all of this? <eob>
Well, partly, it is because we are proud <eob> of the results that, together with our team, <eob> we have been able to reach. <eob>
But also because along the way, <eob> we have learned that kids can do things. <eob>
We can make things happen. <eob>
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old <eob> when we started this. <eob>
We never had a business plan, <eob> nor a fixed strategy, <eob> nor any hidden agendas -- <eob> just the idea in front of us <eob> and a group of friends working with us. <eob>
All we wanted to do was stop <eol> those <eob> plastic bags <eob> from wrapping and suffocating <eol> our beautiful home. <eob>
Kids have a boundless energy <eob> and a motivation to be <eol> the change the world needs. <eob>
IW: So to all the kids <eol> of this beautiful but challenging world: <eob> go for it! <eob> Make that difference. <eob> We're not telling you it's going to be easy. <eob>
We're telling you it's going <eol> to be worth it. <eob>
Us kids may only be 25 percent <eol> of the world's population, <eob> but we are 100 percent of the future. <eob>
MW: We still have a lot of work to do, <eob> but know that we still not stop <eob> until the first question asked <eol> when arriving at the Bali airports will be <eob>
Both: "Welcome to Bali, <eob> do you have nay <eob> plastic bags <eob> to declare?" <eob>
Om shanti shanti shanti om. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
This is Pleurobot. <eob> Pleurobot is a robot <eol> that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species <eob> called Pleurodeles waltl. <eob>
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, <eob> and as you'll see later, it can also swim. <eob>
So you might ask, <eol> why did we design this robot? <eob>
And in fact, this robot has been designed <eol> as a scientific tool for neuroscience. <eob>
Indeed, we designed it together <eol> with neurobiologists <eob> to understand how animals move, <eob> and especially how the spinal cord controls <eol> locomotion. <eob>
But the more I work in biorobotics, <eob> the more I'm really impressed <eol> by animal locomotion. <eob>
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat <eol> running or jumping around, <eob> or even us as humans, <eob> when you go jogging <eol> or play tennis, <eob> we do amazing things. <eob>
And in fact, our nervous system solves <eol> a very, very complex control problem. <eob>
It has to coordinate <eol> more or less 200 muscles perfectly, <eob> because if the coordination <eol> is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion. <eob>
And my goal is to understand <eol> how this works. <eob>
There are four main components <eol> behind animal locomotion. <eob>
The first component is just the body, <eob> and in fact we should never <eol> underestimate <eob> to what extent the biomechanics <eol> already simplify locomotion in animals. <eob>
Then you have the spinal cord, <eob> and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, <eob> multiple reflexes that create <eol> a sensorimotor coordination loop <eob> between neural activity <eol> in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. <eob>
A third component are central <eol> pattern generators. <eob>
These are very interesting circuits <eol> in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals <eob> that can generate, by themselves, <eob> very coordinated rhythmic <eol> patterns of activity <eob> while receiving only very simple input signals. <eob>
And these input signals <eob> coming from descending modulation <eol> from higher parts of the brain, <eob> like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, <eol> the basal ganglia, <eob> will all modulate activity <eol> of the spinal cord <eob> while we do locomotion. <eob>
But what's interesting is to what extent <eol> just a low-level component, <eob> the spinal cord, together with the body, <eob> already solve a big part <eol> of the locomotion problem. <eob>
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut <eol> the head off a chicken, <eob> it can still run for a while, <eob> showing that just the lower part, <eol> spinal cord and body, <eob> already solve a big part of locomotion. <eob>
Now, understanding how this works <eol> is very complex, <eob> because first of all, <eob> recording activity in the spinal cord <eol> is very difficult. <eob>
It's much easier to implant electrodes <eol> in the motor cortex <eob> than in the spinal cord, <eol> because it's protected by the vertebrae. <eob>
Especially in humans, very hard to do. <eob>
A second difficulty is that locomotion <eol> is really due to a very complex <eob> and very dynamic interaction <eol> between these four components. <eob>
So it's very hard to find out <eol> what's the role of each over time. <eob>
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot <eol> and mathematical models <eob> can really help. <eob>
So what's biorobotics? <eob> Biorobotics is a very active <eol> field of research in robotics <eob> where people want <eol> to take inspiration from animals <eob> to make robots to go outdoors, <eob> like service robots or search and rescue robots <eob> or field robots. <eob>
And the big goal here <eol> is to take inspiration from animals <eob> to make robots that can handle <eol> complex terrain -- <eob> stairs, mountains, forests, <eob> places where robots still have difficulties <eob> and where animals can do a much better job. <eob>
The robot can be <eol> a wonderful scientific tool as well. <eob>
There are some very nice projects <eol> where robots are used, <eob> like a scientific tool for neuroscience, <eol> for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> the purpose of Pleurobot. <eob>
So what we do in my lab <eol> is to collaborate with neurobiologists <eob> like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist <eol> in Bordeaux in France, <eob> and we want to make spinal <eol> cord models and validate them on robots. <eob>
And here we want to start simple. <eob>
So it's good to start with simple animals <eob> like lampreys, <eol> which are very primitive fish, <eob> and then gradually go toward more complex <eol> locomotion, <eob> like in salamanders, <eob> but also in cats and in humans, <eob> in mammals. <eob>
And here, a robot <eol> becomes an interesting tool <eob> to validate our models. <eob>
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot <eol> is a kind of dream becoming true. <eob>
Like, more or less 20 years ago <eol> I was already working on a computer <eob> making simulations of lamprey <eol> and salamander locomotion <eob> during my PhD. <eob>
But I always knew that my simulations <eol> were just approximations. <eob>
Like, simulating the physics <eol> in water or with mud or with complex ground, <eob> it's very hard to simulate <eol> that properly on a computer. <eob>
Why not have a real robot <eol> and real physics? <eob>
So among all these animals, one of my favorites <eol> is the salamander. <eob>
You might ask why, and it's because <eol> as an amphibian, <eob> it's a really key animal <eol> from an evolutionary point of view. <eob>
It makes a wonderful link between swimming, <eob> as you find it <eol> in eels or fish, <eob> and quadruped locomotion, as you see <eob> in mammals, <eob> in cats and humans. <eob>
And in fact, the modern salamander <eob> is very close to the first <eol> terrestrial vertebrate, <eob> so it's almost a living fossil, <eob> which gives us access <eol> to our ancestor, <eob> the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods. <eob>
So the salamander swims <eob> by doing what's called <eol> an anguilliform swimming gait, <eob> so they propagate a nice traveling wave <eol> of muscle activity from head to tail. <eob> And if you place <eol> the salamander on the ground, <eob> it switches to what's called <eol> a walking trot gait. <eob>
In this case, you have nice periodic <eol> activation of the limbs <eob> which are very nicely coordinated <eob> with this standing wave <eol> undulation of the body, <eob> and that's exactly the gait <eol> that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. <eob>
Now, one thing which is very surprising <eol> and fascinating in fact <eob> is the fact that all this can be generated <eol> just by the spinal cord and the body. <eob>
So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- <eob> it's not so nice <eol> but you remove the head -- <eob> and if you electrically stimulate <eol> the spinal cord, <eob> at low level of stimulation this <eol> will induce a walking-like gait. <eob>
If you stimulate a bit more, <eol> the gait accelerates. <eob>
And at some point, <eol> there's a threshold, <eob> and automatically, the animal <eol> switches to swimming. <eob> This is amazing. <eob> Just changing the global drive, <eob> as if you are pressing the gas pedal <eob> of descending modulation <eol> to your spinal cord, <eob> makes a complete switch <eol> between two very different gaits. <eob>
And in fact, the same <eol> has been observed in cats. <eob> If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, <eob> you can switch between walk, <eol> trot and gallop. <eob>
Or in birds, you can make <eol> a bird switch between walking, <eob> at a low level of stimulation, <eob> and flapping its wings <eol> at high-level stimulation. <eob>
And this really shows <eol> that the spinal cord <eob> is a very sophisticated locomotion controller. <eob>
So we studied salamander <eol> locomotion in more detail, <eob> and we had in fact access <eol> to a very nice X-ray video machine <eob> from Professor Martin Fischer <eol> in Jena University in Germany. <eob>
And thanks to that, <eol> you really have an amazing machine <eob> to record all the bone motion <eol> in great detail. <eob>
That's what we did. <eob>
So we basically figured out <eol> which bones are important for us <eob> and collected their motion in 3D. <eob>
And what we did is collect <eol> a whole database of motions, <eob> both on ground and in water, <eob> to really collect a whole database <eol> of motor behaviors <eob> that a real animal can do. <eob>
And then our job as roboticists was <eol> to replicate that in our robot. <eob>
So we did a whole optimization <eol> process to find out the right structure, <eob> where to place the motors, <eol> how to connect them together, <eob> to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. <eob>
And this is how Pleurobot came to life. <eob>
So let's look at how close it is <eol> to the real animal. <eob>
So what you see here <eol> is almost a direct comparison <eob> between the walking of the real animal <eol> and the Pleurobot. <eob>
You can see that we have almost <eol> a one-to-one exact replay <eob> of the walking gait. <eob>
If you go backwards and slowly, <eol> you see it even better. <eob>
But even better, we can do swimming. <eob>
So for that we have a dry suit <eol> that we put all over the robot -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and then we can go in water <eol> and start replaying the swimming gaits. <eob>
And here, we were very happy, <eol> because this is difficult to do. <eob>
The physics of interaction are complex. <eob>
Our robot is much bigger <eol> than a small animal, <eob> so we had to do what's called dynamic <eol> scaling of the frequencies <eob> to make sure we had the same interaction <eol> physics. <eob>
But you see at the end, <eol> we have a very close match, <eob> and we were very, very happy with this. <eob>
So let's go to the spinal cord. <eob>
So here what we did with Jean-Mar <eol>ie Cabelguen <eob> is model the spinal cord circuits. <eob>
And what's interesting <eol> is that the salamander <eob> has kept a very primitive circuit, <eob> which is very similar to the one <eol> we find in the lamprey, <eob> this primitive eel-like fish, <eob> and it looks like during evolution, <eob> new neural oscillators <eol> have been added to control the limbs, <eob> to do the leg locomotion. <eob>
And we know where these neural oscillators are <eob> but what we did was to make <eol> a mathematical model <eob> to see how they should be coupled <eob> to allow this transition between <eol> the two very different gaits. <eob>
And we tested that on board of a robot. <eob>
And this is how it looks. <eob>
So what you see here <eol> is a previous version of Pleurobot <eob> that's completely controlled <eol> by our spinal cord model <eob> programmed on board of the robot. <eob>
And the only thing we do <eob> is send to the robot through <eol> a remote control <eob> the two descending signals <eol> it normally should receive <eob> from the upper part of the brain. <eob>
And what's interesting is, <eol> by playing with these signals, <eob> we can completely control speed, <eol> heading and type of gait. <eob>
For instance, <eob> when we stimulate at a low level, <eol> we have the walking gait, <eob> and at some point, <eol> if we stimulate a lot, <eob> very rapidly it switches <eol> to the swimming gait. <eob>
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely <eob> by just stimulating more one side <eol> of the spinal cord than the other. <eob>
And I think it's really beautiful <eob> how nature has distributed control <eob> to really give a lot of responsibility <eol> to the spinal cord <eob> so that the upper part of the brain <eol> doesn't need to worry about every muscle. <eob>
It just has to worry <eol> about this high-level modulation, <eob> and it's really the job of the spinal <eol> cord to coordinate all the muscles. <eob>
So now let's go to cat locomotion <eol> and the importance of biomechanics. <eob>
So this is another project <eob> where we studied <eol> cat biomechanics, <eob> and we wanted to see how much the morphology <eol> helps locomotion. <eob>
And we found three important <eol> criteria in the properties, <eob> basically, of the limbs. <eob>
The first one is that a cat limb <eob> more or less looks like <eol> a pantograph-like structure. <eob>
So a pantograph <eol> is a mechanical structure <eob> which keeps the upper segment <eol> and the lower segments always parallel. <eob>
So a simple geometrical system <eol> that kind of coordinates a bit <eob> the internal movement of the segments. <eob>
A second property of cat limbs <eol> is that they are very lightweight. <eob>
Most of the muscles are in the trunk, <eob> which is a good idea, because then the limbs <eol> have low inertia <eob> and can be moved very rapidly. <eob>
The last final important property <eol> is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, <eob> so to handle impacts and forces. <eob>
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub. <eob>
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage. <eob>
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, <eob> and as you see, it's a cute little robot. <eob>
It looks a bit like a toy, <eob> but it was really used <eol> as a scientific tool <eob> to investigate these properties <eol> of the legs of the cat. <eob>
So you see, it's very compliant, <eol> very lightweight, <eob> and also very elastic, <eob> so you can easily press it down <eol> and it will not break. <eob>
It will just jump, in fact. <eob>
And this very elastic property <eol> is also very important. <eob>
And you also see a bit these properties <eob> of these three segments <eol> of the leg as pantograph. <eob>
Now, what's interesting <eol> is that this quite dynamic gait <eob> is obtained purely in open loop, <eob> meaning no sensors, <eol> no complex feedback loops. <eob>
And that's interesting, because it means <eob> that just the mechanics <eol> already stabilized this quite rapid gait, <eob> and that really good mechanics <eol> already basically simplify locomotion. <eob>
To the extent that we can even <eol> disturb a bit locomotion, <eob> as you will see in the next video, <eob> where we can for instance do some exercise <eol> where we have the robot go down a step, <eob> and the robot will not fall over, <eob> which was a surprise for us. <eob>
This is a small perturbation. <eob>
I was expecting the robot <eol> to immediately fall over, <eob> because there are no sensors, <eol> no fast feedback loop. <eob>
But no, just the mechanics <eol> stabilized the gait, <eob> and the robot doesn't fall over. <eob>
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, <eol> and if you have obstacles, <eob> you need the full control loops <eol> and reflexes and everything. <eob>
But what's important here is that just <eol> for small perturbation, <eob> the mechanics are right. <eob>
And I think this is a very important message <eob> from biomechanics <eol> and robotics to neuroscience, <eob> saying don't underestimate to what extent <eol> the body already helps locomotion. <eob>
Now, how does this relate <eol> to human locomotion? <eob>
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex <eol> than cat and salamander locomotion, <eob> but at the same time, the nervous system <eol> of humans is very similar <eob> to that of other vertebrates. <eob>
And especially the spinal cord <eob> is also the key controller <eol> for locomotion in humans. <eob>
That's why, if there's a lesion <eol> of the spinal cord, <eob> this has dramatic effects. <eob>
The person can become <eol> paraplegic or tetraplegic. <eob>
This is because the brain loses this communication <eob> with the spinal cord. <eob>
Especially, it loses this descending modulation <eob> to initiate and modulate locomotion. <eob>
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics <eob> is to be able to reactivate that communication <eob> using electrical or chemical stimulations. <eob>
And there are several teams <eol> in the world that do exactly that, <eob> especially at EPFL. <eob> My colleagues Grégoire <eol> Courtine and Silvestro Micera, <eob> with whom I collaborate. <eob>
But to do this properly, <eol> it's very important to understand <eob> how the spinal cord works, <eob> how it interacts with the body, <eob> and how the brain communicates <eob> with the spinal cord. <eob>
This is where the robots <eol> and models that I've presented today <eob> will hopefully play a key role <eob> towards these <eol> very important goals. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots <eob> that do things like swim in pollution <eob> and measure the pollution <eol> while they swim. <eob>
But for this one, <eob> you mentioned in your talk, <eol> like a side project, <eob> search and rescue, <eob> and it does have a camera on its nose. <eob>
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. <eol> So the robot — <eob> We have some spin-off projects <eob> where we would like to use the robots to do <eob> search and rescue <eob> inspection, <eob> so this robot is now seeing you. <eob>
And the big dream is to, <eol> if you have a difficult situation <eob> like a collapsed building <eol> or a building that is flooded, <eob> and this is very dangerous <eol> for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, <eob> why not send in a robot <eol> that can crawl around, swim, walk, <eob> with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors <eob> and possibly create a communication link with the survivor. <eob>
BG: Of course, assuming <eol> the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this. <eob>
AI: Yeah, we should probably change <eol> the appearance quite a bit, <eob> because here I guess <eol> a survivor might die of a heart attack <eob> just of being worried <eol> that this would feed on you. <eob>
But by changing the appearance and it <eol> making it more robust, <eob> I'm sure we can make <eol> a good tool out of it. <eob>
BG: <eob> Thank you <eob> very much. Thank you and your team. <eob>
When I was first learning to meditate, <eob> the instruction was to simply <eol> pay attention to my breath, <eob> and when my mind wandered, <eol> to bring it back. <eob>
Sounded simple enough. <eob> Yet I'd sit on these silent <eol> retreats, <eob> sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter. <eob>
I'd take naps every chance <eol> I got because it was really hard work. <eob>
Actually, it was exhausting. <eob>
The instruction was simple enough <eob> but I was missing <eol> something really important. <eob>
So why is it so hard to pay attention? <eob>
Well, studies show <eob> that even when we're really trying <eol> to pay attention to something -- <eob> like maybe this talk -- <eob> at some point, <eob> about half of us will drift <eol> off into a daydream, <eob> or have this urge <eol> to check our Twitter feed. <eob>
So what's going on here? <eob>
It turns out that we're fighting one <eol> of the most evolutionarily-conserved <eob> learning processes currently known in science, <eob> one that's conserved <eob> back to the most basic nervous <eol> systems known to man. <eob>
This reward-based learning process <eob> is called positive and negative reinforcement, <eob> and basically goes like this. <eob> We see some food that looks good, <eob> our brain says, "Calories! <eob>
... Survival! <eob> "We eat the food, we taste it — <eob> it tastes good. <eob>
And especially with sugar, <eob> our bodies send a signal to our brain <eol> that says, <eob> "Remember what you're eating <eol> and where you found it." <eob> We lay down this context-dependent memory <eob> and learn to repeat the process next time. <eob>
See food, <eob> eat food, feel good, <eob> repeat. <eob>
Trigger, behavior, reward. <eob>
Simple, right? <eob> Well, after a while, our creative brains say, <eob> "You know what? <eob>
You can use this for more <eol> than just remembering where food is. <eob>
You know, next time you feel bad, <eob> why don't you try eating something <eol> good so you'll feel better?" <eob> We thank our brains for the great idea, <eob> try this and quickly learn <eob> that if we eat chocolate <eol> or ice cream when we're mad or sad, <eob> we feel better. <eob>
Same process, <eob> just a different trigger. <eob>
Instead of this hunger <eol> signal coming from our stomach, <eob> this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- <eob> triggers that urge to eat. <eob>
Maybe in our teenage years, <eob> we were a nerd at school, <eob> and we see those rebel kids <eol> outside smoking and we think, <eob> "Hey, I want to be cool." <eob> So we start smoking. <eob>
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, <eol> and that was no accident. <eob>
Trigger, behavior, reward. <eob> See cool, <eob> smoke to be cool, <eob> feel good. Repeat. <eob>
And each time we do this, <eob> we learn to repeat the process <eob> and it becomes a habit. <eob>
So later, <eob> feeling stressed out triggers <eol> that urge to smoke a cigarette <eob> or to eat something sweet. <eob>
Now, with these same brain processes, <eob> we've gone from learning <eol> to survive <eob> to literally killing ourselves <eol> with these habits. <eob>
Obesity and smoking <eob> are among the leading preventable <eol> causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. <eob>
So back to my breath. <eob> What if instead of fighting our brains, <eob> or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, <eob> we instead tapped into this natural, <eol> reward-based learning process ... <eob> but added a twist? <eob>
What if instead we just got really curious <eob> about what was happening <eol> in our momentary experience? <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob>
In my lab, <eob> we studied whether mindfulness training <eol> could help people quit smoking. <eob>
Now, just like trying to force myself <eol> to pay attention to my breath, <eob> they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. <eob>
And the majority of them <eol> had tried this before and failed -- <eob> on average, six times. <eob>
Now, with mindfulness training, <eob> we dropped the bit about forcing <eol> and instead focused on being curious. <eob>
In fact, we even told them to smoke. <eob> What? Yeah, we said, <eol> "Go ahead and smoke, <eob> just be really curious <eol> about what it's like when you do." <eob>
And what did they notice? <eob>
Well here's an example <eol> from one of our smokers. <eob>
She said, "Mindful smoking: <eob> smells like stinky cheese <eob> and tastes like chemicals, <eob> YUCK!" <eob> Now, she knew, cognitively <eol> that smoking was bad for her, <eob> that's why she joined our program. <eob>
What she discovered just by being curiously <eol> aware when she smoked <eob> was that smoking tastes like shit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. <eob>
She moved from knowing in her head <eol> that smoking was bad for her <eob> to knowing it in her bones, <eob> and the spell of smoking was broken. <eob>
She started to become disenchanted <eol> with her behavior. <eob>
Now, the prefrontal cortex, <eob> that youngest part of our brain <eol> from an evolutionary perspective, <eob> it understands on an intellectual level <eol> that we shouldn't smoke. <eob> And it tries its hardest <eol> to help us change our behavior, <eob> to help us stop smoking, <eob> to help us stop eating that second, <eol> that third, that fourth cookie. <eob>
We call this cognitive control. <eob>
We're using cognition <eol> to control our behavior. <eob>
Unfortunately, <eob> this is also the first part of our brain <eob> that goes offline <eol> when we get stressed out, <eob> which isn't that helpful. <eob>
Now, we can all relate <eol> to this in our own experience. <eob>
We're much more likely to do things <eol> like yell at our spouse or kids <eob> when we're stressed out or tired, <eob> even though we know <eol> it's not going to be helpful. <eob>
We just can't help ourselves. <eob>
When the prefrontal cortex <eol> goes offline, <eob> we fall back into our old habits, <eob> which is why this disenchantment <eol> is so important. <eob>
Seeing what we get from our habits <eob> helps us understand them <eol> at a deeper level -- <eob> to know it in our bones <eob> so we don't have to force ourselves <eol> to hold back <eob> or restrain ourselves <eol> from behavior. <eob>
We're just less interested <eol> in doing it in the first place. <eob>
And this is what mindfulness is all about: <eob> Seeing really clearly what we get <eol> when we get caught up in our behaviors, <eob> becoming disenchanted on a visceral level <eob> and from this disenchanted stance, <eol> naturally letting go. <eob>
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. <eob> But over time, as we learn <eol> to see more and more clearly <eob> the results of our actions, <eob> we let go of old habits and form new ones. <eob>
The paradox here <eob> is that mindfulness is just about being really interested <eob> in getting close and personal <eob> with what's actually happening <eol> in our bodies and minds <eob> from moment to moment. <eob>
This willingness to turn toward our experience <eob> rather than trying to make <eol> unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. <eob>
And this willingness <eol> to turn toward our experience <eob> is supported by curiosity, <eob> which is naturally rewarding. <eob>
What does curiosity feel like? <eob> It feels good. <eob> And what happens when we get curious? <eob>
We start to notice that cravings <eol> are simply made up of body sensations -- <eob> oh, there's tightness, there's tension, <eob> there's restlessness -- <eob> and that these body sensations <eol> come and go. <eob>
These are bite-size pieces <eol> of experiences <eob> that we can manage <eob> from moment to moment <eob> rather than getting clobbered <eol> by this huge, scary craving <eob> that we choke on. <eob>
In other words, when we get curious, <eob> we step out of our old, <eol> fear-based, reactive habit patterns, <eob> and we step into being. <eob>
We become this inner scientist <eob> where we're eagerly awaiting <eol> that next data point. <eob>
Now, this might sound too simplistic <eol> to affect behavior. <eob> But in one study, we found <eol> that mindfulness training <eob> was twice as good as gold standard <eol> therapy at helping people quit smoking. <eob>
So it actually works. <eob>
And when we studied the brains <eol> of experienced meditators, <eob> we found that parts of a neural network <eol> of self-referential processing <eob> called the default mode network <eob> were at play. <eob>
Now, one current hypothesis <eol> is that a region of this network, <eob> called the posterior cingulate cortex, <eob> is activated not necessarily <eol> by craving itself <eob> but when we get caught up in it, <eol> when we get sucked in, <eob> and it takes us for a ride. <eob>
In contrast, when we let go -- <eob> step out of the process <eob> just by being curiously aware <eol> of what's happening -- <eob> this same brain region quiets down. <eob>
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs <eob> that target these core mechanisms <eob> and, ironically, use the same technology <eol> that's driving us to distraction <eob> to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns <eob> of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors. <eob>
Now, remember that bit <eol> about context-dependent memory? <eob>
We can deliver these tools <eol> to peoples' fingertips <eob> in the contexts that matter most. <eob>
So we can help them <eob> tap into their inherent capacity <eol> to be curiously aware <eob> right when that urge <eol> to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises. <eob>
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, <eob> maybe the next time you feel this urge <eol> to check your email when you're bored, <eob> or you're trying to distract yourself from work, <eob> or maybe to compulsively <eol> respond to that text message when you're driving, <eob> see if you can tap into this natural capacity, <eob> just be curiously aware <eob> of what's happening in your body and mind <eol> in that moment. <eob>
It will just be another chance <eob> to perpetuate one of our endless <eol> and exhaustive habit loops ... <eob> or step out of it. <eob>
Instead of see text message, <eol> compulsively text back, <eob> feel a little bit better — <eob> notice the urge, <eob> get curious, <eob> feel the joy of letting go <eob> and <eob> repeat. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Our ability to create <eol> and sustain economic growth <eob> is the defining challenge <eol> of our time. <eob>
Of course there are other challenges -- <eob> health care, disease burdens <eol> and pandemics, <eob> environmental challenges <eob> and, of course, radicalized terrorism. <eob>
However, <eob> to the extent that we can actually solve <eol> the economic growth challenge, <eob> it will take us a long way <eob> to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> unless and until we solve economic growth <eob> and create sustainable, <eol> long-term economic growth, <eob> we'll be unable to address <eob> the seemingly intractable challenges <eol> that continue to pervade the globe today, <eob> whether it's health care, <eol> education or economic development. <eob>
The fundamental question is this: <eob> How are we going to create economic growth <eob> in advanced and developed economies like <eol> the United States and across Europe <eob> at a time when they continue to struggle <eob> to create economic growth <eol> after the financial crisis? <eob>
They continue to underperform <eob> and to see an erosion <eol> in the three key drivers of economic growth: <eob> capital, labor and productivity. <eob>
In particular, <eob> these developed economies continue to see <eol> debts and deficits, <eob> the decline and erosion of both <eol> the quality and quantity of labor <eob> and they also see productivity stalling. <eob>
In a similar vein, <eob> how are we going to create economic growth <eol> in the emerging markets, <eob> where 90 percent of the world's population lives <eob> and where, on average, <eob> 70 percent of the population <eol> is under the age of 25? <eob>
In these countries, <eob> it is essential that they grow <eol> at a minimum of seven percent a year <eob> in order to put a dent in poverty <eob> and to double per capita incomes <eol> in one generation. <eob>
And yet today, <eob> the largest emerging economies -- <eob> countries with at least 50 million people -- <eob> continue to struggle to reach <eol> that seven percent magic mark. <eob>
Worse than that, <eob> countries like India, Russia, <eol> South Africa, Brazil and even China <eob> are falling below that seven percent number <eob> and, in many cases, actually regressing. <eob>
Economic growth matters. <eob> With economic growth, <eob> countries and societies enter <eol> into a virtuous cycle <eob> of upward mobility, opportunity <eol> and improved living standards. <eob>
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, <eob> not just in the annals <eol> of economic statistics <eob> but also in the meaning of life <eol> and how lives are lived. <eob>
Economic growth matters <eob> powerfully for the individual. <eob>
If growth wanes, <eob> the risk to human progress <eob> and the risk of political <eol> and social instability rises, <eob> and societies become dimmer, <eol> coarser and smaller. <eob>
The context matters. <eob> And countries <eol> in emerging markets <eob> do not need to grow at the same rates <eol> as developed countries. <eob>
Now, I know some of you in this room <eol> find this to be a risky proposition. <eob>
There are some people here <eob> who will turn around and be <eol> quite disillusioned <eob> by what's happened around the world <eob> and basically ascribe <eol> that to economic growth. <eob>
You worry about the overpopulation <eol> of the planet. <eob>
And looking at the UN's recent <eol> statistics and projections <eob> that the world <eol> will have 11 billion people on the planet <eob> before it plateaus in 2100, <eob> you're concerned about what that does <eol> to natural resources -- <eob> arable land, potable water, energy and minerals. <eob>
You are also concerned <eol> about the degradation of the environment. <eob>
And you worry about how man, <eob> embodied in the corporate globalist, <eob> has become greedy and corrupt. <eob>
But I'm here to tell you today <eol> that economic growth <eob> has been the backbone <eol> of changes in living standards <eob> of millions of people around the world. <eob>
And more importantly, <eob> it's not just economic growth <eol> that has been driven by capitalism. <eob>
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, <eob> is that the factors of production, <eob> such as trade and industry, capital and labor, <eob> are left in the hands <eol> of the private sector and not the state. <eob>
It's really essential here that we understand <eob> that fundamentally the critique <eol> is not for economic growth per se <eob> but what has happened to capitalism. <eob>
And to the extent that we need <eol> to create economic growth over the long term, <eob> we're going to have to pursue it <eol> with a better form of economic stance. <eob>
Economic growth needs capitalism, <eob> but it needs it to work properly. <eob>
And as I mentioned a moment ago, <eob> the core of the capitalist system <eol> has been defined by private actors. <eob>
And even this, however, <eol> is a very simplistic dichotomy. <eob> Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. <eob> When in practical experience, <eob> capitalism is much more of a spectrum. <eob>
And we have countries such as China, <eob> which have practiced more state capitalism, <eob> and we have countries like the Unites States <eob> which are more market capitalist. <eob>
Our efforts to critique <eol> the capitalist system, however, <eob> have tended to focus <eol> on countries like China <eob> that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism. <eob>
However, <eob> there is a real reason <eol> and real concern <eob> for us to now focus our attentions <eol> on purer forms of capitalism, <eob> particularly those embodied <eol> by the United States. <eob>
This is really important <eob> because this type of capitalism <eob> has increasingly been afforded <eol> the critique <eob> that it is now fostering corruption <eob> and, worse still, <eob> it's increasing income inequality -- <eob> the idea that the few are benefiting <eol> at the expense of the many. <eob>
The two really critical questions <eol> that we need to address <eob> is how can we fix capitalism <eob> so that it can help create <eol> economic growth <eob> but at the same time <eol> can help to address social ills. <eob>
In order to think about that framing, <eol> we have to ask ourselves, <eob> how does capitalism work today? <eob>
Very simplistically, <eob> capitalism is set on the basis <eol> of an individual utility maximizer -- <eob> a selfish individual who goes after <eol> what he or she wants. <eob>
And only after they've maximized <eol> their utility <eob> do they then decide it's important <eob> to provide support to other social contracts. <eob>
Of course, in this system governments do tax, <eob> and they use part of their revenues <eol> to fund social programs, <eob> recognizing that government's role <eol> is not just regulation <eob> but also to be arbiter of social goods. <eob>
But nevertheless, <eob> this framework -- <eob> this two-stage framework -- <eob> is the basis from which <eol> we must now start <eob> to think about how we can improve <eol> the capitalist model. <eob>
I would argue that there are two sides <eol> to this challenge. <eob>
First of all, <eob> we can draw on the right-wing policies <eob> to see what could be beneficial for us <eob> to think about how we can improve capitalism. <eob>
In particular, <eob> right-leaning policies <eob> have tended to focus <eol> on things like conditional transfers, <eob> where we pay and reward people <eol> for doing the things <eob> that we actually think can help <eol> enhance economic growth. <eob>
For example, <eob> sending children to school, <eob> parents could earn money for that, <eob> or getting their children inoculated <eol> or immunized, <eob> parents could get paid for doing that. <eob>
Now, quite apart from the debate <eob> on whether or not we should be paying people <eob> to do what we think <eol> they should do anyway, <eob> the fact of the matter is that pay for performance <eob> has actually yielded <eol> some positive results <eob> in places like Mexico, <eob> in Brazil <eob> and also in pilot programs <eol> in New York. <eob>
But there are also benefits <eob> and significant changes underway <eol> on left-leaning policies. <eob>
Arguments that government <eol> should expand its role and responsibility <eob> so that it's not so narrowly defined <eob> and that government should be much more <eol> of an arbiter <eob> of the factors of production <eob> have become commonplace <eol> with the success of China. <eob>
But also we've started to have debates <eob> about how the role of the private sector <eob> should move away from just being a profit motive <eob> and really be more engaged <eol> in the delivery of social programs. <eob>
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, <eob> albeit small in scale, <eob> are moving in that right direction. <eob>
Of course, left-leaning policies <eol> have also tended to blur the lines <eob> between government, NGOs <eol> and private sector. <eob>
Two very good examples of this <eol> are the 19th-century United States, <eob> when the infrastructure rollout <eob> was really about public-private partnerships. <eob>
More recently, of course, <eob> the advent of the Internet <eol> has also proven to the world <eob> that public and private <eol> can work together for the betterment of society. <eob>
My fundamental message to you is this: <eob> We cannot continue to try and solve <eol> the world economic growth challenges <eob> by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily <eol> ideological. <eob>
In order to create sustainable, <eol> long-term economic growth <eob> and solve the challenges <eol> and social ills that continue to plague the world today, <eob> we're going to have to be <eol> more broad-minded <eob> about what might work. <eob>
Ultimately, <eob> we have to recognize that ideology <eol> is the enemy of growth. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask <eol> a couple of questions, Dambisa, <eob> because one could react <eol> to your last sentence <eob> by saying growth is also an ideology, <eob> it's possibly the dominant <eol> ideology of our times. <eob>
What do you say to those <eol> who react that way? <eob>
DM: Well, I think that <eol> that's completely legitimate, <eob> and I think that we're already having that discussion. <eob>
There's a lot of work going <eol> on around happiness <eob> and other metrics being used <eol> for measuring people's success <eob> and improvements in living standards. <eob>
And so I think that we should be open <eob> to what could deliver improvements <eol> in people's living standards <eob> and continue to reduce poverty <eol> around the world. <eob>
BG: So you're basically pleading <eol> for rehabilitating growth, <eob> but the only way for that happen <eob> without compromising the capacity of the earth, <eob> to take us on a long journey, <eob> is for economic growth <eob> somehow to decouple <eol> from the underlying use of resources. <eob>
Do you see that happening? <eob>
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic <eol> about human ability and ingenuity. <eob>
I think if we start to constrain ourselves <eob> using the finite, scarce <eol> and depleting resources <eob> that we know today, <eob> we could get quite negative <eob> and quite concerned about the way <eol> the world is. <eob>
However, <eob> we've seen the Club of Rome, <eob> we've seen previous claims <eob> that the world would be running <eol> out of resources, <eob> and it's not to argue that those things <eol> are not valid. <eob>
But I think, with ingenuity <eol> we could see desalination, <eob> I think we could reinvest in energy, <eob> so that we can actually get better outcomes. <eob>
And so in that sense, <eob> I'm much more optimistic <eol> about what humans can do. <eob>
BG: The thing that strikes me <eob> about your proposals for rehabilitating growth <eob> and taking a different direction <eob> is that you're kind of suggesting <eol> to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- <eob> with putting a price tag <eol> on good behavior as incentive <eob> or developing a bigger role <eol> for business in social issues. <eob>
Is that what you're suggesting? <eob>
DM: I'm suggesting we have <eol> to be open-minded. <eob>
I think it is absolutely the case <eob> that traditional models <eol> of economic growth <eob> are not working the way <eol> we would like them to. <eob>
And I think it's no accident <eob> that today the largest economy <eol> in the world, the United States, <eob> has democracy, <eob> liberal democracy, <eol> as it's core political stance <eob> and it has free market capitalism -- <eob> to the extent that it is free -- <eob> free market capitalism as its economic stance. <eob>
The second largest economy is China. <eob>
It has deprioritized democracy <eob> and it has state capitalism, <eol> which is a completely different model. <eob>
These two countries, <eol> completely different political models <eob> and completely different economic models, <eob> and yet they have the same income inequality number <eob> measured as a Gini coefficient. <eob>
I think those are the debates <eol> we should have, <eob> because it's not clear at all <eob> what model we should be adopting, <eob> and I think there needs <eol> to be much more discourse <eob> and much more humility <eol> about what we know and what we don't know. <eob>
BG: One last question. The COP21 <eol> is going on in Paris. <eob>
If you could send a tweet <eob> to all the heads of state <eol> and heads of delegations there, <eob> what would you say? <eob>
DM: Again, I would be very much <eol> about being open-minded. <eob>
As you're aware, <eob> the issues around the environmental concerns <eob> have been on the agenda many times now -- <eob> in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- <eob> and we keep revisiting these issues <eob> partly because there is not <eol> a fundamental agreement, <eob> in fact there's a schism <eob> between what the developed countries believe and want <eob> and what emerging market countries want. <eob>
Emerging market countries need <eol> to continue to create economic growth <eob> so that we don't have political <eol> uncertainty in the those countries. <eob>
Developed countries recognize <eob> that they have a real, important responsibility <eob> not only just to manage their CO2 emissions <eob> and some of the degradation <eol> that they're contributing to the world, <eob> but also as trendsetters <eol> in R & amp; D. <eob> And so they have to come to the table as well. <eob>
But in essence, it cannot be a situation <eob> where we start ascribing policies <eol> to the emerging markets <eob> without developed countries themselves <eob> also taking quite a swipe <eol> at what they're doing <eob> both in demand and supply in developed markets. <eob>
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED. <eob>
DM: <eob> Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As a boy in Lima, <eob> my grandfather told me a legend <eob> of the Spanish conquest of Peru. <eob>
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, <eol> had been captured and killed. <eob>
Pizarro and his conquistadors <eol> had grown rich, <eob> and tales of their conquest <eol> and glory had reached Spain <eob> and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, <eol> hungry for gold and glory. <eob>
They would go into towns <eol> and ask the Inca, <eob> "Where's another civilization we can conquer? <eob>
Where's more gold? <eob> "And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them," <eob> Go to the Amazon. <eob> You'll find all the gold you want there. <eob>
In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- <eol> El Dorado in Spanish -- <eob> made entirely of gold." <eob> The Spanish set off into the jungle, <eob> but the few that return come back <eol> with stories, <eob> stories of powerful shamans, <eob> of warriors with poisoned arrows, <eob> of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, <eob> spiders that ate birds, snakes <eol> that swallowed men whole <eob> and a river that boiled. <eob>
All this became a childhood memory. <eob> And years passed. <eob> I'm working on my PhD at SMU, <eob> trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, <eob> when I remember this legend, <eob> and I began asking that question. <eob> Could the boiling river exist? <eob>
I asked colleagues from universities, <eob> the government, <eob> oil, gas and mining companies, <eob> and the answer was a unanimous no. <eob>
And this makes sense. <eob>
You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, <eob> but they're generally associated <eol> with volcanoes. <eob>
You need a powerful heat source <eob> to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. <eob>
And as you can see from the red dots <eol> here, which are volcanoes, <eob> we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, <eob> nor in most of Peru. <eob>
So it follows: We should not expect <eol> to see a boiling river. <eob>
Telling this same story <eol> at a family dinner, <eob> my aunt tells me, <eob> "But no, Andrés, I've been there. <eob>
I've swum in that river. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Then my uncle jumps in. <eob> "No, Andrés, she's not kidding. <eob>
You see, you can only swim <eol> in it after a very heavy rain, <eob> and it's protected by <eol> a powerful shaman. <eob>
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?" <eob>
You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, <eob> I found myself hiking into the jungle, <eol> guided by my aunt, <eob> over 700 kilometers away from the nearest <eol> volcanic center, <eob> and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself <eob> to behold the legendary "warm stream <eol> of the Amazon." <eob>
But then ... <eob> I heard something, <eob> a low surge <eob> that got louder and louder <eob> as we came closer. <eob>
It sounded like ocean waves <eol> constantly crashing, <eob> and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, <eol> coming up through the trees. <eob>
And then, I saw this. <eob>
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, <eob> and the average temperatures in the river <eob> were 86 degrees C. <eob> This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling <eob> but definitely close enough. <eob>
The river flowed hot and fast. <eob>
I followed it upriver and was led by, <eol> actually, the shaman's apprentice <eob> to the most sacred site on the river. <eob>
And this is what's bizarre -- <eob> It starts off as a cold stream. <eob>
And here, at this site, <eob> is the home of the Yacumama, <eob> mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit <eob> who births hot and cold water. <eob>
And here we find a hot spring, <eob> mixing with cold stream water <eol> underneath her protective motherly jaws <eob> and thus bringing their legends to life. <eob>
The next morning, I woke up and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I asked for tea. <eob> I was handed a mug, a tea bag <eob> and, well, pointed towards the river. <eob>
To my surprise, the water was clean <eol> and had a pleasant taste, <eob> which is a little weird <eol> for geothermal systems. <eob>
What was amazing <eob> is that the locals had always known about this place, <eob> and that I was by no means <eol> the first outsider to see it. <eob>
It was just part of their everyday life. <eob>
They drink its water. <eob>
They take in its vapor. <eob>
They cook with it, <eob> clean with it, <eob> even make their medicines with it. <eob>
I met the shaman, <eob> and he seemed like an extension <eol> of the river and his jungle. <eob>
He asked for my intentions <eob> and listened carefully. <eob>
Then, to my tremendous relief -- <eob> I was freaking out, <eol> to be honest with you -- <eob> a smile began to snake across his face, <eol> and he just laughed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I had received the shaman's blessing <eol> to study the river, <eob> on the condition that after I take the water samples <eob> and analyze them in my lab, <eob> wherever I was in the world, <eob> that I pour the waters <eol> back into the ground <eob> so that, as the shaman said, <eob> the waters could find their way back home. <eob>
I've been back every year <eol> since that first visit in 2011, <eob> and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, <eob> demanding and at times dangerous. <eob>
One story was even featured <eol> in National Geographic Magazine. <eob>
I was trapped on a small rock about the size <eol> of a sheet of paper <eob> in sandals and board shorts, <eob> in between an 80 degree C river <eob> and a hot spring that, well, <eol> looked like this, close to boiling. <eob>
And on top of that, it was Amazon <eol> rain forest. <eob>
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing. <eob>
The temperature differential made <eol> it all white. <eob>
It was a whiteout. <eob> Intense. <eob>
Now, after years of work, <eob> I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. <eob> And I'd like to share, today, <eol> with all of you here, on the TED stage, <eob> for the first time, some <eol> of these discoveries. <eob>
Well, first off, it's not a legend. <eob> Surprise! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When I first started the research, <eob> the satellite imagery was too <eol> low-resolution to be meaningful. <eob>
There were just no good maps. <eob>
Thanks to the support <eol> of the Google Earth team, <eob> I now have this. <eob>
Not only that, the indigenous name <eol> of the river, Shanay-timpishka, <eob> "boiled with the heat of the sun," <eob> indicating that I'm not the first to wonder <eol> why the river boils, <eob> and showing that humanity has always sought <eol> to explain <eob> the world around us. <eob>
So why does the river boil? <eob>
(Bubbling sounds) <eob>
It actually took me three years <eol> to get that footage. <eob>
Fault-fed hot springs. <eob> As we have hot blood <eol> running through our veins and arteries, <eob> so, too, the earth has hot water <eol> running through its cracks and faults. <eob>
Where these arteries <eol> come to the surface, these earth arteries, <eob> we'll get geothermal manifestations: <eob> fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, <eol> the boiling river. <eob>
What's truly incredible, though, <eol> is the scale of this place. <eob>
Next time you cross the road, <eol> think about this. <eob>
The river flows wider than a two-lane road <eob> along most of its path. <eob>
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers. <eob> Truly impressive. <eob> There are thermal pools larger <eol> than this TED stage, <eob> and that waterfall that you see there <eob> is six meters tall -- <eob> and all with near-boiling water. <eob>
We mapped the temperatures <eol> along the river, <eob> and this was by far the most demanding <eol> part of the fieldwork. <eob>
And the results were just awesome. <eob>
Sorry -- the geoscientist <eol> in me coming out. <eob>
And it showed this amazing trend. <eob>
You see, the river starts off cold. <eob>
It then heats up, cools <eol> back down, heats up, cools back down, <eob> heats up again, and then has this <eol> beautiful decay curve <eob> until it smashes into this cold river. <eob>
Now, I understand not all of you <eol> are geothermal scientists, <eob> so to put it in more everyday terms: <eob> Everyone loves coffee. <eob> Yes? Good. <eob> Your regular cup of coffee, <eol> 54 degrees C, <eob> an extra-hot one, well, 60. <eob>
So, put in coffee shop terms, <eob> the boiling river plots like this. <eob>
There you have your hot coffee. <eob>
Here you have your extra-hot coffee, <eob> and you can see that <eol> there's a bit point there <eob> where the river is still hotter <eol> than even the extra-hot coffee. <eob>
And these are average water temperatures. <eob>
We took these in the dry season <eol> to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures. <eob>
But there's a magic number here <eol> that's not being shown, <eob> and that number is 47 degrees C, <eob> because that's where things start to hurt, <eob> and I know this from very personal experience. <eob>
Above that temperature, <eol> you don't want to get in that water. <eob>
You need to be careful. <eob>
It can be deadly. <eob>
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, <eob> and what's shocking to me, <eol> is the process is pretty much the same. <eob>
So they fall in and the first thing <eol> to go are the eyes. <eob>
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. <eob>
They turn this milky-white color. <eob>
The stream is carrying them. <eob>
They're trying to swim out, <eol> but their meat is cooking on the bone <eob> because it's so hot. <eob>
So they're losing power, losing power, <eob> until finally they get to a point where <eol> hot water goes into their mouths <eob> and they cook from the inside out. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A bit sadistic, aren't we? <eob> Jeez. <eob> Leave them marinating for a little longer. <eob>
What's, again, amazing <eol> are these temperatures. <eob>
They're similar to things <eol> that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world <eob> and even super-volcanoes <eol> like Yellowstone. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> the data is showing <eol> that the boiling river exists <eob> independent of volcanism. <eob>
It's neither magmatic <eol> or volcanic in origin, <eob> and again, <eob> over 700 kilometers away from the nearest <eol> volcanic center. <eob>
How can a boiling river exist like this? <eob>
I've asked geothermal experts <eol> and volcanologists for years, <eob> and I'm still unable to find <eol> another non-volcanic geothermal system <eob> of this magnitude. <eob> It's unique. <eob> It's special on a global scale. <eob> So, still -- how does it work? <eob> Where do we get this heat? <eob>
There's still more research to be done <eob> to better constrain the problem <eol> and better understand the system, <eob> but from what the data is telling us now, <eob> it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system. <eob>
Basically, it works like this: <eob> So, the deeper you go into the earth, <eol> the hotter it gets. <eob>
We refer to this <eol> as the geothermal gradient. <eob>
The waters could be coming <eol> from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, <eob> then seeping down deep into the earth <eob> and coming out to form the boiling river <eob> after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, <eob> all due to this unique geologic setting. <eob>
Now, we found that in and around the river -- <eob> this is working with colleagues <eob> from National Geographic, <eol> Dr. Spencer Wells, <eob> and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis -- <eob> we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms <eob> living in and around the river, <eol> and have found new lifeforms, <eob> unique species living in the boiling river. <eob>
But again, despite all of these studies, <eol> all of these discoveries and the legends, <eob> a question remains: <eob> What is the significance of the boiling river? <eob>
What is the significance <eol> of this stationary cloud <eob> that always hovers over this <eol> patch of jungle? <eob>
And what is the significance <eob> of a detail in a childhood legend? <eob>
To the shaman and his community, <eol> it's a sacred site. <eob>
To me, as a geoscientist, <eob> it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. <eob>
But to the illegal loggers <eol> and cattle farmers, <eob> it's just another resource to exploit. <eob>
And to the Peruvian government, <eol> it's just another stretch <eob> of unprotected land ready for development. <eob>
My goal is to ensure <eol> that whoever controls this land <eob> understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. <eob>
Because that's the question, <eob> one of significance. <eob>
And the thing there is, <eob> we define significance. <eob> It's us. We have that power. <eob>
We are the ones who draw that line <eob> between the sacred and the trivial. <eob>
And in this age, <eob> where everything seems mapped, <eol> measured and studied, <eob> in this age of information, <eob> I remind you all that discoveries <eol> are not just made <eob> in the black void of the unknown <eob> but in the white noise <eol> of overwhelming data. <eob>
There remains so much to explore. <eob>
We live in an incredible world. <eob> So go out. <eob> Be curious. <eob> Because we do live in a world <eob> where shamans still sing <eol> to the spirits of the jungle, <eob> where rivers do boil <eob> and where legends do come to life. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You may never have heard <eol> of Kenema, Sierra Leone <eob> or Arua, Nigeria. <eob>
But I know them as two of the most <eol> extraordinary places on earth. <eob>
In hospitals there, there's a community <eol> of nurses, physicians and scientists <eob> that have been quietly battling <eob> one of the deadliest threats <eol> to humanity for years: <eob> Lassa virus. <eob>
Lassa virus <eob> is a lot like Ebola. <eob>
It can cause a severe fever <eol> and can often be fatal. <eob>
But these individuals, <eol> they risk their lives every day <eob> to protect the individuals <eol> in their communities, <eob> and by doing so, protect us all. <eob>
But one of the most extraordinary things <eol> I learned about them <eob> on one of my first visits <eol> out there many years ago <eob> was that they start each morning -- <eob> these challenging, extraordinary days <eol> on the front lines -- by singing. <eob>
They gather together, <eol> and they show their joy. <eob>
They show their spirit. <eob>
And over the years, <eob> from year after year as I've visited them <eol> and they've visited me, <eob> I get to gather with them and I sing <eob> and we write and we love it, <eob> because it reminds us that we're not <eol> just there to pursue science together; <eob> we're bonded through a shared humanity. <eob>
And that of course, as you can imagine, <eol> becomes extremely important, <eob> even essential, as things begin to change. <eob>
And that changed a great deal <eol> in March of 2014, <eob> when the Ebola outbreak <eol> was declared in Guinea. <eob>
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, <eob> near the border <eol> of Sierra Leone and Liberia. <eob>
And it was frightening, <eol> frightening for us all. <eob>
We had actually suspected for some time <eob> that Lassa and Ebola were more <eol> widespread than thought, <eob> and we thought it could <eol> one day come to Kenema. <eob>
And so members of my team <eol> immediately went out <eob> and joined Dr. Humarr Khan <eol> and his team there, <eob> and we set up diagnostics to be able <eol> to have sensitive molecular tests <eob> to pick up Ebola if it came <eol> across the border <eob> and into Sierra Leone. <eob>
We'd already set up this kind <eol> of capacity for <eob> Lassa virus, <eob> we knew how to do it, <eob> the team is outstanding. <eob>
We just had to give them <eol> the tools and place to survey for Ebola. <eob>
And unfortunately, that day came. <eob>
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked <eol> into the maternity ward at the hospital, <eob> and the team ran <eol> those important molecular tests <eob> and they identified the first <eol> confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. <eob>
This was an exceptional <eol> work that was done. <eob>
They were able to diagnose <eol> the case immediately, <eob> to safely treat the patient <eob> and to begin to do contact tracing <eol> to follow what was going on. <eob>
It could've stopped something. <eob>
But by the time that day came, <eob> the outbreak had already <eol> been breeding for months. <eob>
With hundreds of cases, it had already <eol> eclipsed all previous outbreaks. <eob>
And it came into Sierra Leone <eol> not as that singular case, <eob> but as a tidal wave. <eob>
We had to work <eol> with the international community, <eob> with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, <eol> to begin to deal with the cases, <eob> as the next week brought 31, <eob> then 92, then 147 cases -- <eol> all coming to Kenema, <eob> one of the only places in Sierra Leone <eol> that could deal with this. <eob>
And we worked around the clock <eol> trying to do everything we could, <eob> trying to help the individuals, <eol> trying to get attention, <eob> but we also did one other simple thing. <eob>
From that specimen that we take <eol> from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, <eob> we can discard it, obviously. <eob>
The other thing we can do is, actually, <eol> put in a chemical and deactivate it, <eob> so just place it into a box <eol> and ship it across the ocean, <eob> and that's what we did. <eob>
We sent it to Boston, where my team works. <eob>
And we also worked around the clock <eol> doing shift work, day after day, <eob> and we quickly generated 99 genomes <eol> of the Ebola virus. <eob>
This is the blueprint -- the genome <eol> of a virus is the blueprint. <eob>
We all have one. <eob>
It says everything that makes up us, <eob> and it tells us so much information. <eob>
The results of this kind of work <eol> are simple and they're powerful. <eob>
We could actually take <eol> these 99 different viruses, <eob> look at them and compare them, <eob> and we could see, actually, <eol> compared to three genomes <eob> that had been previously <eol> published from Guinea, <eob> we could show that the outbreak <eol> emerged in Guinea months before, <eob> once into the human population, <eob> and from there had been transmitting <eol> from human to human. <eob>
Now, that's incredibly important <eob> when you're trying to figure out <eol> how to intervene, <eob> but the important thing <eol> is contact tracing. <eob>
We also could see that as the virus <eol> was moving between humans, <eob> it was mutating. <eob>
And each of those mutations <eol> are so important, <eob> because the diagnostics, the vaccines, <eob> the therapies that we're using, <eob> are all based on that genome <eol> sequence, fundamentally -- <eob> that's what drives it. <eob>
And so global health experts <eol> would need to respond, <eob> would have to develop, <eob> to recalibrate everything <eol> that they were doing. <eob>
But the way that science works, <eol> the position I was in at that point <eob> is, I had the data, <eob> and I could have worked <eol> in a silo for many, many months, <eob> analyzed the data carefully, slowly, <eob> submitted the paper for publication, <eol> gone through a few back-and-forths, <eob> and then finally when the paper came out, <eol> might release that data. <eob>
That's the way the status quo works. <eob>
Well, that was not going to work <eol> at this point, right? <eob>
We had friends on the front lines <eob> and to us it was just obvious <eol> that what we needed is help, <eob> lots of help. <eob>
So the first thing we did is, <eob> as soon as the sequences <eol> came off the machines, <eob> we published it to the web. <eob>
We just released it to the whole world <eol> and said, "Help us." <eob> And help came. <eob>
Before we knew it, <eob> we were being contacted <eol> from people all over, <eob> surprised to see the data <eol> out there and released. <eob>
Some of the greatest <eol> viral trackers in the world <eob> were suddenly part of our community. <eob>
We were working together <eol> in this virtual way, <eob> sharing, regular calls, communications, <eob> trying to follow the virus <eol> minute by minute, <eob> to see ways that we could stop it. <eob>
And there are so many ways <eol> that we can form communities like that. <eob>
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak <eol> started to expand globally, <eob> was reaching out to learn, <eol> to participate, to engage. <eob>
Everybody wants to play a part. <eob>
The amount of human capacity <eol> out there is just amazing, <eob> and the Internet connects us all. <eob>
And could you imagine that instead <eol> of being frightened of each other, <eob> that we all just said, "Let's do this. <eob> Let's work together, <eol> and let's make this happen." <eob>
But the problem is that the data <eol> that all of us are using, <eob> Googling on the web, is just too limited <eol> to do what we need to do. <eob>
And so many opportunities <eol> get missed when that happens. <eob>
So in the early part <eol> of the epidemic from Kenema, <eob> we'd had 106 clinical records <eol> from patients, <eob> and we once again made that <eol> publicly available to the world. <eob>
And in our own lab, we could show <eol> that you could take those 106 records, <eob> we could train computers to predict <eol> the prognosis for Ebola patients <eob> to near 100 percent accuracy. <eob>
And we made an app <eol> that could release that, <eob> to make that available <eol> to health-care workers in the field. <eob>
But 106 is just not enough <eol> to make it powerful, <eob> to validate it. <eob>
So we were waiting for more data <eol> to release that. <eob> and the data has still not come. <eob>
We are still waiting, tweaking away, <eob> in silos rather than working together. <eob>
And this just -- we can't accept that. <eob> Right? You, all of you, <eol> cannot accept that. <eob>
It's our lives on the line. <eob>
And in fact, actually, <eob> many lives were lost, <eol> many health-care workers, <eob> including beloved colleagues of mine, <eob> five colleagues: <eol> Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, <eob> Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma <eol> and Mohamed Fullah. <eob>
These are just five <eol> of many health-care workers <eob> at Kenema and beyond <eob> that died while the world waited <eol> and while we all worked, <eob> quietly and separately. <eob>
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, <eob> it's fueled by mistrust <eol> and distraction and division. <eob>
When we build barriers amongst ourselves <eol> and we fight amongst ourselves, <eob> the virus thrives. <eob>
But unlike all threats to humanity, <eob> Ebola is one where <eol> we're actually all the same. <eob>
We're all in this fight together. <eob>
Ebola on one person's doorstep <eol> could soon be on ours. <eob>
And so in this place <eol> with the same vulnerabilities, <eob> the same strengths, <eol> the same fears, the same hopes, <eob> I hope that we work together with joy. <eob>
A graduate student of mine <eol> was reading a book about Sierra Leone, <eob> and she discovered that the word "Kenema," <eob> the hospital that we work at and the city <eol> where we work in Sierra Leone, <eob> is named after the Mende word <eol> for "clear like a river, translucent <eob> and open to the public gaze." <eob> That was really profound for us, <eob> because without knowing it, <eol> we'd always felt <eob> that in order to honor the individuals <eol> in Kenema where we worked, <eob> we had to work openly, we had to share <eol> and we had to work together. <eob>
And we have to do that. <eob>
We all have to demand that <eol> of ourselves and others -- <eob> to be open to each other <eol> when an outbreak happens, <eob> to fight in this fight together. <eob>
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, <eob> it will not be the last, <eob> and there are many other microbes out <eol> there that are lying in wait, <eob> like <eob> Lassa virus <eob> and others. <eob>
And the next time this happens, <eob> it could happen in a city of millions, <eol> it could start there. <eob>
It could be something <eol> that's transmitted through the air. <eob>
It could even be <eol> disseminated intentionally. <eob>
And I know that that is frightening, <eol> I understand that, <eob> but I know also, <eol> and this experience shows us, <eob> that we have the technology <eol> and we have the capacity <eob> to win this thing, <eob> to win this and have <eol> the upper hand over viruses. <eob>
But we can only do it if we do it together <eob> and we do it with joy. <eob>
So for Dr. Khan <eob> and for all of those who sacrificed <eol> their lives on the front lines <eob> in this fight with us always, <eob> let us be in this fight with them always. <eob>
And let us not let the world be defined <eob> by the destruction wrought by one virus, <eob> but illuminated by billions <eol> of hearts and minds <eob> working in unity. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hello. <eob> My name is Matthew Williams, <eob> and I am a champion. <eob>
I have won medals <eol> in three different sports <eob> and national games in Canada, <eob> competed at the international level <eol> in basketball <eob> and was proud to represent Canada <eob> on the world stage. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I train five days a week for basketball <eol> and speed skating, <eob> work with top quality coaches <eob> and mental performance consultants <eob> to be at my best in my sport. <eob>
By the way, all that is through <eol> Special Olympics. <eob>
Does that change the way you think of me <eob> and my accomplishments? <eob>
The world does not see all people <eol> like me as champions. <eob>
Not long ago, people like me <eol> were shunned and hidden away. <eob>
There has been lots of change <eol> since Special Olympics began in 1968, <eob> but in too many cases, <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> are invisible to the wider population. <eob>
People use the r-word <eol> in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter. <eob>
That's the word "retard" or "retarded" <eob> used in a derogatory manner. <eob>
They're not thinking about how much <eol> it hurts me and my friends. <eob>
I don't want you to think I'm here <eol> because I'm a charity case. <eob>
I am here because there is still <eol> a big problem with the way <eob> many people see individuals <eol> with intellectual disabilities, <eob> or, too often, <eob> how they don't see them at all. <eob>
Did you know the World Games happened <eol> this year? <eob>
I was one of over 6,500 athletes <eol> with intellectual disabilities <eob> from 165 countries who competed in LA. <eob>
There was over 62,000 spectators <eol> watching opening ceremonies, <eob> and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. <eob>
Did you even know that happened? <eob>
What do you think of when you see <eol> someone like me? <eob>
I am here today to challenge you <eob> to look at us as equals. <eob>
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity <eol> of athletes <eob> with intellectual disabilities <eob> and the perceptions of everyone watching. <eob>
For those of you who aren't familiar, <eob> Special Olympics is for athletes <eob> with intellectual disabilities. <eob>
Special Olympics is separate <eol> from the Paralympics and Olympics. <eob>
We offer high-quality, year <eol> round sports programs <eob> for <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> that changes lives and perceptions. <eob>
This movement has changed my life <eob> and those of so many others. <eob>
And it has changed the way <eob> the world sees <eob> people with intellectual disabilities. <eob>
I was born with epilepsy <eol> and an intellectual disability. <eob>
Growing up, I played hockey <eol> until I was 12 years old. <eob>
The older I got, the more I felt <eob> it was harder to keep up <eol> with everyone else, <eob> and I was angry and frustrated. <eob>
For a while, I did not play any sports, <eob> didn't have many friends <eob> and felt left out and sad. <eob>
There was a time when <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> were hidden away from society. <eob>
No one thought they could participate in sports, <eob> let alone be a valued member of society. <eob>
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, <eob> a scientist at the University of Toronto, <eob> was studying the effects of regular exercise <eob> on the fitness levels of children <eob> with intellectual disabilities. <eob>
Using rigorous scientific research, <eob> Dr. Hayden <eol> and other researchers <eob> came to the conclusion <eob> that it was simply the lack of opportunity <eol> to participate <eob> that caused their fitness <eol> levels to suffer. <eob>
Lots of people doubted that <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> could benefit from fitness programs <eob> and sports competition opportunities. <eob>
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden <eol> and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, <eob> the founder of Special Olympics, <eob> persevered, <eob> and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right <eob> four and a half million times over. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Before I joined Special Olympics, <eob> I was nervous <eob> because I was young, shy, not confident <eob> and <eob> didn't have many friends. <eob>
When I got there, though, <eol> everyone was very encouraging, <eob> supportive, and let me be myself <eob> without being judged. <eob>
Now, I am a basketball player <eol> and speed skater <eob> who has competed at provin <eol>cial, national games, <eob> and this year made it all the way <eol> to the World Summer Games in LA, <eob> where I was part of the first <eol> ever Canadian basketball team <eob> to compete at World Games. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am one of more than four and a half <eol> million athletes around the globe, <eob> and I've heard so many similar stories. <eob>
Being Special Olympics athletes <eob> restores our pride and dignity. <eob>
Special Olympics also addresses <eol> critical health needs. <eob>
Studies have shown that, on average, <eob> men <eob> with intellectual disabilities <eob> die 13 years younger than men without, <eob> and women with intellectual disabilities <eob> die 20 years younger than women without. <eob>
Special Olympics keeps us healthy <eob> by getting us active <eob> and participating in sport. <eob>
Also, our coaches teach us <eol> about nutrition and health. <eob>
Special Olympics also provides free health screening <eob> for athletes who have difficulty <eol> communicating with their doctor <eob> or accessing health care. <eob>
At the 2015 World Summer Games, <eob> my Team Canada teammates <eol> and I played the Nigerian basketball team. <eob>
The day before our game, <eob> the Nigerian basketball team went <eol> to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, <eob> where seven of 10 members <eob> were given hearing aids for free <eob> and got to hear clearly for the first time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The change in them was amazing. <eob>
They were more excited, happy and confident, <eob> because their coach could vocally <eol> communicate with them. <eob>
And they were emotional <eob> because they could hear <eol> the sounds of the basketball, <eob> the sounds of the whistle <eob> and the cheering fans in the stands -- <eob> sounds that we take for granted. <eob>
Special Olympics is transforming more <eol> than just the athlete in their sport. <eob>
Special Olympics is transforming <eol> their lives off the field. <eob>
This year, research findings showed <eob> that nearly half of the adults <eol> in the US <eob> don't know a single person <eol> with an intellectual disability, <eob> and the 44 percent of Americans <eob> who don't have personal contact <eob> with intellectual disabilities <eob> are significantly less accepting <eol> and positive. <eob>
Then there's the r-word, <eob> proving that <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> are still invisible <eob> to far too many people. <eob>
People use it as a casual term <eol> or an insult. <eob>
It was tweeted more <eol> than nine million times last year, <eob> and it is deeply hurtful <eob> to me and my four and a half million fellow <eol> athletes around the planet. <eob>
People don't think it's insulting, <eob> but it is. <eob>
As my fellow athlete <eol> and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote <eob> in an open letter <eol> to a political pundit <eob> who used the r-word <eol> as an insult, <eob> "Come join us someday <eol> at Special Olympics. <eob>
See if you walk away <eol> with your heart unchanged." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, <eob> people lined up for hours <eob> to get into the final night <eol> of powerlifting competition. <eob>
So it was standing room only <eol> when my teammate Jackie Barrett, <eob> the Newfoundland Moose, <eob> deadlifted 655 pounds <eob> and lifted 611 pounds in the squat -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
setting huge new records for Special Olympics. <eob>
Jackie is a record holder <eol> among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- <eob> not just Special Olympics, <eol> all powerlifters. <eob>
Jackie was a huge star in LA, <eob> and ESPN live-tweeted <eol> his record-breaking lifts <eob> and were wowed by his performance. <eob>
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals <eob> with intellectual disabilities <eob> could do anything like that. <eob>
This year, 60,000 spectators <eol> filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum <eob> to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games <eob> and cheer athletes <eol> from 165 countries <eob> around the world. <eob>
Far from being hidden away, <eob> we were cheered and celebrated. <eob>
Special Olympics teaches athletes <eob> to be confident and proud of themselves. <eob>
Special Olympics teaches the world <eob> that <eob> people with intellectual disabilities <eob> deserve respect and inclusion. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, I have dreams and achievements <eol> in my sport, <eob> great coaches, <eob> respect and dignity, <eob> better health, <eob> and I am pursuing a career <eol> as a personal trainer. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am no longer hidden, bullied <eob> and I am here doing a TED Talk. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The world is a different place <eol> because of Special Olympics, <eob> but there is still farther to go. <eob>
So the next time you see someone <eol> with an intellectual disability, <eob> I hope you will see their ability. <eob>
The next time someone <eol> uses the r-word near you, <eob> I hope you will tell them <eol> how much it hurts. <eob>
I hope you will think about getting <eol> involved with Special Olympics. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I would like to leave you <eol> with one final thought. <eob>
Nelson Mandela said, <eob> "Sports has the power <eol> to change the world." <eob> Special Olympics is changing the world <eob> by transforming four and a half million athletes <eob> and giving us a place to be confident, <eob> meet friends, <eob> not be judged <eob> and get to feel like and be champions. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I come from the tallest people <eol> on the planet -- <eob> the Dutch. <eob>
It hasn't always been this way. <eob>
In fact, all across the globe, <eol> people have been gaining height. <eob>
In the last 150 years, <eob> in developed countries, <eob> on average, we have gotten <eol> 10 centimeters taller. <eob>
And scientists have a lot of theories <eol> about why this is, <eob> but almost all of them <eol> involve nutrition, <eob> namely the increase of dairy and meat. <eob>
In the last 50 years, <eob> global meat consumption <eol> has more than quadrupled, <eob> from 71 million tons to 310 million tons. <eob>
Something similar has been <eol> going on with milk and eggs. <eob>
In every society where incomes <eol> have risen, so has protein consumption. <eob>
And we know that globally, <eol> we are getting richer. <eob>
And as the middle class is on the rise, <eol> so is our global population, <eob> from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, <eob> which means that by 2050, <eob> we are going to need <eol> at least 70 percent more protein <eob> than what is available <eol> to humankind today. <eob>
And the latest prediction <eol> of the UN puts that population number, <eob> by the end of this century, at 11 billion, <eob> which means that we are going to need <eol> a lot more protein. <eob>
This challenge is staggering -- <eob> so much so, that recently, <eob> a team at Anglia Ruskin <eol> Global Sustainability Institute suggested <eob> that if we don't change our global policies <eob> and food production systems, <eob> our societies might actually collapse <eol> in the next 30 years. <eob>
Currently, our ocean serves <eol> as the main source of animal protein. <eob>
Over 2.6 billion people depend <eol> on it every single day. <eob>
At the same time, <eob> our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger <eob> than what our oceans <eol> can sustainably support, <eob> meaning that humans take far more fish <eol> from the ocean <eob> than the oceans can naturally replace. <eob>
WWF recently published a report <eol> showing that just in the last 40 years, <eob> our global marine life <eol> has been slashed in half. <eob>
And another recent report suggests <eol> that of our largest predatory species, <eob> such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, <eob> over 90 percent has disappeared <eol> since the 1950s. <eob>
And there are a lot of great, <eol> sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet <eob> working towards better practices <eol> and better-managed fisheries. <eob>
But ultimately, <eob> all of these initiatives are working <eol> towards keeping current catch constant. <eob>
It's unlikely, <eob> even with the best-managed fisheries, <eob> that we are going to be able <eol> to take much more from the ocean <eob> than we do today. <eob>
We have to stop plundering <eol> our oceans the way we have. <eob>
We need to alleviate the pressure on it. <eob>
And we are at a point <eob> where if we push much harder for more produce, <eob> we might face total collapse. <eob>
Our current systems are not going to feed <eol> a growing global population. <eob>
So how do we fix this? <eob> What's the world going to look <eol> like in just 35 short years <eob> when there's 2.7 billion more of us <eol> sharing the same resources? <eob>
We could all become vegan. <eob>
Sounds like a great idea, <eob> but it's not realistic <eob> and it's impossibly hard <eol> to mandate globally. <eob>
People are eating animal protein <eol> whether we like it or not. <eob>
And suppose we fail to change our ways <eob> and continue on the current path, <eob> failing to meet demands. <eob>
The World Health Organization recently reported <eob> that 800 million people are suffering <eol> from malnutrition and food shortage, <eob> which is due to that same growing, global population <eob> and the declining access to resources <eol> like water, energy and land. <eob>
It takes very little imagination <eob> to picture a world of global unrest, riots <eol> and further malnutrition. <eob>
People are hungry, <eob> and we are running dangerously <eol> low on natural resources. <eob>
For so, so many reasons, <eob> we need to change our global <eol> food production systems. <eob>
We must do better <eob> and there is a solution. <eob>
And that solution lies in aquaculture -- <eob> the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, <eol> shellfish and crustaceans. <eob>
As the great ocean hero Jacques <eol> Cousteau once said, <eob> "We must start using the ocean <eol> as farmers instead of hunters. <eob>
That's what civilization is all about -- <eol> farming instead of hunting." <eob> Fish is the last food that we hunt. <eob>
And why is it that we keep hearing <eol> phrases like, <eob> "Life's too short <eol> for farmed fish," <eob> or, "Wild-caught, of course!" <eob> over fish that we know virtually nothing about? <eob>
We don't know what it ate <eol> during its lifetime, <eob> and we don't know what pollution <eol> it encounters. <eob>
And if it was a large predatory species, <eob> it might have gone through <eol> the coast of Fukushima yesterday. <eob>
We don't know. <eob>
Very few people realize <eob> the traceability in fisheries <eol> never goes beyond the hunter <eob> that caught the wild animal. <eob>
But let's back up for a second <eob> and talk about why fish <eol> is the best food choice. <eob>
It's healthy, <eob> it prevents heart disease, <eob> it provides key amino acids <eob> and key fatty acids <eol> like Omega-3s, <eob> which is very different <eol> from almost any other type of meat. <eob>
And aside from being healthy, <eob> it's also a lot more exciting and diverse. <eob>
Think about it -- most animal farming <eol> is pretty monotonous. <eob>
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, <eol> pig's pig, <eob> and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- <eol> pretty much sums it up. <eob>
And then there's 500 species <eol> of fish being farmed currently. <eob> not that Western supermarkets <eol> reflect that on their shelves, <eob> but that's beside that point. <eob>
And you can farm fish <eol> in a very healthy manner <eob> that's good for us, good for the planet <eol> and good for the fish. <eob>
I know I sound fish-obsessed -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let me explain: <eob> My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved <eob> in aquaculture a couple of years ago. <eob>
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, <eob> who won the TED Prize in 2009. <eob>
We actually met on Mission Blue <eol> I in the Galapagos. <eob>
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; <eob> me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, <eob> love to dive, passion for the oceans. <eob>
Mission Blue truly changed our lives. <eob>
We fell in love, <eob> got married <eob> and we came away really inspired, <eob> thinking we really want to do <eol> something about ocean conservation -- <eob> something that was meant to last, <eob> that could make a real difference <eob> and something that we could do together. <eob>
Little did we expect that <eol> that would lead us to fish farming. <eob>
But a few months after we got off the boat, <eob> we got to a meeting at Conservation International, <eob> where the Director General <eol> of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, <eob> asking a room full of environmentalists <eol> to stop turning from it, <eob> realize what was going on <eob> and to really get involved <eob> because aquaculture has the potential <eob> to be just what our oceans and populations need. <eob>
We were stunned when we heard the stats <eob> that we didn't know more about this industry already <eob> and excited about the chance <eol> to help get it right. <eob>
And to talk about stats -- <eob> right now, the amount <eol> of fish consumed globally, <eob> wild catch and farmed combined, <eob> is twice the tonnage of the total amount <eol> of beef <eob> produced on planet earth last year. <eob>
Every single fishing vessel combined, <eob> small and large, across the globe, <eob> together produce about 65 million tons <eol> of wild-caught seafood <eob> for human consumption. <eob>
Aquaculture this year, <eob> for the first time in history, <eob> actually produces more than what <eol> we catch from the wild. <eob>
But now this: <eob> Demand is going to go up. <eob>
In the next 35 years, <eob> we are going to need an additional <eol> 85 million tons to meet demand, <eob> which is one-and-a-half <eol> times as much, almost, <eob> as what we catch globally <eol> out of our oceans. <eob> An enormous number. <eob>
It's safe to assume that that's not <eol> going to come from the ocean. <eob>
It needs to come from farming. <eob>
And talk about farming -- <eob> for farming you need resources. <eob>
As a human needs to eat <eol> to grow and stay alive, <eob> so does an animal. <eob>
A cow needs to eat eight <eol> to nine pounds of feed <eob> and drink almost 8,000 liters of water <eob> to create just one pound of meat. <eob>
Experts agree <eol> that it's impossible <eob> to farm cows for every inhabitant <eol> on this planet. <eob>
We just don't have enough feed or water. <eob>
And we can't keep cutting <eol> down rain forests for it. <eob>
And fresh water -- planet earth <eol> has a very limited supply. <eob>
We need something more efficient <eob> to keep humankind alive on this planet. <eob>
And now let's compare <eol> that with fish farming. <eob>
You can farm one pound of fish <eol> with just one pound of feed, <eob> and depending on species, even less. <eob>
And why is that? <eob>
Well, that's because fish, <eol> first of all, float. <eob>
They don't need to stand around all day <eol> resisting gravity like we do. <eob>
And most fish are cold-blooded -- <eob> they don't need to heat themselves. <eob> Fish chills. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it needs very little water, <eob> which is counterintuitive, <eob> but as we say, <eob> it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. <eob>
Fish are the most resource-efficient <eol> animal protein available to humankind, <eob> aside from insects. <eob>
for human consumption. <eob> How much we've learned since. <eob> For example, on top of that 65 million tons <eol> that's annually caught <eob> there's an additional <eol> 30 million tons caught for animal feed, <eob> mostly sardines and anchovies <eol> for the aquaculture industry <eob> that's turned into fish meal and fish oil. <eob>
This is madness. <eob> Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, <eol> are badly managed. <eob>
Some of the worst issues of our time <eol> are connected to it. <eob>
It's destroying our oceans. <eob>
The worst slavery issues imaginable <eol> are connected to it. <eob>
Recently, an article <eol> came out of Stanford <eob> saying that if 50 percent <eol> of the world's aquaculture industry <eob> would stop using fish meal, <eob> our oceans would be saved. <eob> Now think about that for a minute. <eob>
Now, we know that the oceans <eol> have far more problems — <eob> they have pollution, there's acidification, <eob> coral reef destruction and so on. <eob> But it underlines <eol> the impact of our fisheries, <eob> and it underlines <eol> how interconnected everything is. <eob>
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, <eob> climate change, food security and so on. <eob>
In the search for alternatives, <eob> the industry, on a massive scale, <eob> has reverted to plant-based alternatives <eob> like soy, industrial chicken waste, <eob> blood meal from slaughterhouses <eob> and so on. <eob>
And we understand <eol> where these choices come from, <eob> but this is not the right approach. <eob>
It's not sustainable, <eob> it's not healthy. <eob>
Have you ever seen a chicken <eol> at the bottom of the ocean? <eob> Of course not. <eob> If you feed salmon soy <eol> with nothing else, <eob> it literally explodes. <eob>
Salmon is a carnivore, <eob> it has no way to digest soy. <eob>
Now, fish farming is by far <eob> the best animal farming <eol> available to humankind. <eob>
But it's had a really bad reputation. <eob>
There's been excessive use <eol> of chemicals, <eob> there's been virus and disease <eol> transfered to wild populations, <eob> ecosystem destruction and pollution, <eob> escaped fish breeding with wild populations, <eob> altering the overall genetic pool, <eob> and then of course, as just mentioned, <eob> the unsustainable feed ingredients. <eob>
How blessed were the days <eob> when we could just enjoy food <eol> that was on our plate, <eob> whatever it was. <eob>
Once you know, you know. <eob> You can't go back. <eob>
It's not fun. <eob>
We really need a transparent food system <eol> that we can trust, <eob> that produces healthy food. <eob>
But the good news is <eob> that decades <eol> of development and research <eob> have led to a lot <eol> of new technologies and knowledge <eob> that allow us to do a lot better. <eob>
We can now farm fish <eol> without any of these issues. <eob>
I think of agriculture <eol> before the green revolution -- <eob> we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. <eob>
New technologies means <eob> that we can now produce <eol> a feed that's perfectly natural, <eob> with a minimal footprint <eob> that consists <eol> of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae. <eob>
Healthy for the people, <eob> healthy for the fish, <eob> healthy for the planet. <eob>
Microbes, for example, <eob> can be a perfect alternative <eol> for high-grade fish meal -- <eob> at scale. <eob>
Insects are the -- <eob> well, first of all, <eol> the perfect recycling <eob> because they're grown <eol> on food waste; <eob> but second, <eob> think of fly-fishing, <eob> and you know how logical it <eol> actually is to use it as fish feed. <eob>
You don't need large <eol> tracts of land for it <eob> and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. <eob>
And microbes and insects <eol> are actually net water producers. <eob>
This revolution is starting as we speak, <eob> it just needs scale. <eob>
We can now farm far more species <eol> than ever before <eob> in controlled, natural conditions, <eol> creating happy fish. <eob>
I imagine, for example, <eob> a closed system <eol> that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, <eob> where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish <eob> with little or no effluent, <eob> almost no energy and almost no water <eob> and a natural feed <eob> with a minimal footprint. <eob>
Or a system where you grow up <eol> to 10 species next to each other -- <eob> off of each other, <eob> mimicking nature. <eob>
You need very little feed, <eob> very little footprint. <eob>
I think of seaweed growing off <eol> the effluent of fish, for example. <eob>
There's great technologies <eol> popping up all over the globe. <eob>
From alternatives to battle disease <eob> so we don't need antibiotics <eol> and chemicals anymore, <eob> to automated feeders <eol> that feel when the fish are hungry, <eob> so we can save on feed <eol> and create less pollution. <eob>
Software systems that gather <eol> data across farms, <eob> so we can improve farm practices. <eob>
There's really cool stuff <eol> happening all over the globe. <eob>
And make no mistake -- <eol> all of these things are possible <eob> at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer <eol> spends today. <eob>
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse <eol> for anyone to not do the right thing. <eob>
So somebody needs to connect the dots <eob> and give these developments <eol> a big kick in the butt. <eob>
And that's what we've been working <eol> on the last couple of years, <eob> and that's what we need to be working on together -- <eob> rethinking everything from the ground up, <eob> with a holistic view across the value chain, <eob> connecting all these things across the globe, <eob> alongside great entrepreneurs <eob> that are willing to share a collective vision. <eob>
Now is the time to create <eol> change in this industry <eob> and to push it into a sustainable direction. <eob>
This industry is still young, <eob> much of its growth is still ahead. <eob>
It's a big task, <eol> but not as far-fetched as you might think. <eob> It's possible. <eob>
So we need to take pressure off the ocean. <eob>
We want to eat good and healthy. <eob>
And if we eat an animal, <eol> it needs to be one <eob> that had a happy and healthy life. <eob>
We need to have a meal that we can trust, <eob> live long lives. <eob>
And this is not just for people <eol> in San Francisco or Northern Europe -- <eob> this is for all of us. <eob>
Even in the poorest countries, <eob> it's not just about money. <eob>
People prefer something fresh and healthy <eol> that they can trust <eob> over something that comes from far away <eol> that they know nothing about. <eob>
We're all the same. <eob>
The day will come <eob> where people will realize -- no, demand -- <eol> farmed fish on their plate <eob> that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- <eob> and refuse anything less. <eob>
You can help speed this up. <eob>
Ask questions when you order seafood. <eob>
Where does my fish come from? <eob>
Who raised it, <eob> and what did it eat? <eob>
Information about where your fish <eol> comes from and how it was produced <eob> needs to be much more readily available. <eob>
And consumers need to put pressure <eol> on the aquaculture industry <eob> to do the right thing. <eob>
So every time you order, <eob> ask for detail <eob> and show that you really care <eol> about what you eat <eob> and what's been given to you. <eob>
And eventually, they will listen. <eob>
And all of us will benefit. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
15 years ago, I volunteered to participate <eol> in a research study <eob> that involved a genetic test. <eob>
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, <eob> I was handed a questionnaire. <eob>
One of the very first questions <eol> asked me to check a box for my race: <eob> White, black, Asian, <eol> or Native American. <eob>
I wasn't quite sure <eol> how to answer the question. <eob>
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity <eob> of research participants' social backgrounds? <eob>
In that case, I would answer <eol> with my social identity, <eob> and check the box for "black." <eob> But what if the researchers <eol> were interested in investigating <eob> some association between ancestry <eol> and the risk for certain genetic traits? <eob>
In that case, wouldn't they want to know <eol> something about my ancestry, <eob> which is just as much European <eol> as African? <eob>
And how could they make <eol> scientific findings about my genes <eob> if I put down my social identity <eol> as a black woman? <eob>
After all, I consider myself <eol> a black woman with a white father <eob> rather than a white woman with a black mother <eob> entirely for social reasons. <eob>
Which racial identity I check <eob> has nothing to do with my genes. <eob>
Well, despite the obvious importance of this question <eob> to the study's scientific validity, <eob> I was told, "Don't worry about it, <eob> just put down however you identify yourself." <eob> So I check "black," <eob> but I had no confidence <eol> in the results of a study <eob> that treated a critical variable <eol> so unscientifically. <eob>
That personal experience with the use <eol> of race in genetic testing <eob> got me thinking: <eob> Where else in medicine is race <eol> used to make false biological predictions? <eob>
Well, I found out that race runs deeply <eol> throughout all of medical practice. <eob>
It shapes physicians' diagnoses, <eob> measurements, treatments, <eob> prescriptions, <eob> even the very definition of diseases. <eob>
And the more I found out, <eol> the more disturbed I became. <eob>
Sociologists like me have long explained <eob> that race is a social construction. <eob>
When we identify people as black, white, <eol> Asian, Native American, Latina, <eob> we're referring to social groupings <eob> with made up demarcations <eol> that have changed over time <eob> and vary around the world. <eob>
As a legal scholar, <eol> I've also studied <eob> how lawmakers, not biologists, <eob> have invented the legal definitions <eol> of races. <eob>
And it's not just the view <eol> of social scientists. <eob>
You remember when the map <eol> of the human genome <eob> was unveiled at a White House <eol> ceremony in June 2000? <eob>
President Bill Clinton famously declared, <eob> "I believe one of the great truths <eob> to emerge from this triumphant expedition <eob> inside the human genome <eob> is that in genetic terms, <eob> human beings, regardless of race, <eob> are more than 99.9 percent <eol> the same." <eob> And he might have added <eob> that that less than one percent <eol> of genetic difference <eob> doesn't fall into racial boxes. <eob>
Francis Collins, who led <eol> the Human Genome Project <eob> and now heads NIH, <eob> echoed President Clinton. <eob> "I am happy that today, <eob> the only race we're talking <eol> about is the human race." <eob>
Doctors are supposed <eol> to practice evidence-based medicine, <eob> and they're increasingly called <eol> to join the genomic revolution. <eob>
But their habit of treating patients <eol> by race lags far behind. <eob>
Take the estimate <eob> of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. <eob>
Doctors routinely interpret GFR, <eob> this important indicator <eol> of kidney function, by race. <eob>
As you can see in this lab test, <eob> the exact same creatinine level, <eob> the concentration in the blood of the patient, <eob> automatically produces a different GFR estimate <eob> depending on whether or not <eol> the patient is African-American. <eob> Why? <eob>
I've been told it's based on an assumption <eob> that African-Americans <eol> have more muscle mass <eob> than people of other races. <eob>
But what sense does it make <eob> for a doctor to automatically assume <eob> I have more muscle mass <eol> than that female bodybuilder? <eob>
Wouldn't it be far more accurate <eol> and evidence-based <eob> to determine the muscle mass <eol> of individual patients <eob> just by looking at them? <eob>
Well, doctors tell me <eol> they're using race as a shortcut. <eob>
It's a crude but convenient proxy <eob> for more important factors, <eol> like muscle mass, <eob> enzyme level, genetic traits <eob> they just don't have time <eol> to look for. <eob>
But race is a bad proxy. <eob>
In many cases, race adds no relevant <eol> information at all. <eob>
It's just a distraction. <eob>
But race also tends <eol> to overwhelm the clinical measures. <eob>
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, <eob> family illnesses, <eob> their history, their own illnesses <eol> they might have -- <eob> all more evidence-based <eol> than the patient's race. <eob>
Race can't substitute <eol> for these important clinical measures <eob> without sacrificing patient well-being. <eob>
Doctors also tell me race <eol> is just one of many factors <eob> they take into account, <eob> but there are numerous medical tests, <eob> like the GFR, <eob> that use race categorically <eob> to treat black, white, <eol> Asian patients differently <eob> just because of their race. <eob>
Race medicine also leaves patients <eol> of color especially vulnerable <eob> to harmful biases <eol> and stereotypes. <eob>
Black and Latino patients <eol> are twice as likely <eob> to receive no pain <eol> medication as whites <eob> for the same painful long bone fractures <eob> because of stereotypes <eob> that black and brown people feel <eol> less pain, <eob> exaggerate their pain, <eob> and are predisposed to drug addiction. <eob>
The Food and Drug Administration <eol> has even approved a race-specific medicine. <eob> It's a pill called BiDil <eob> to treat heart failure <eol> in self-identified African-American patients. <eob>
A cardiologist developed this drug <eol> without regard to race or genetics, <eob> but it became convenient <eob> for commercial reasons <eob> to market the drug to black patients. <eob>
The FDA then allowed <eob> the company, the drug company, <eob> to test the efficacy <eol> in a clinical trial <eob> that only included African-American subjects. <eob>
It speculated <eob> that race stood in as a proxy <eol> for some unknown genetic factor <eob> that affects heart disease <eob> or response to drugs. <eob>
But think about the dangerous <eol> message it sent, <eob> that black people's bodies <eol> are so substandard, <eob> a drug tested in them <eob> is not guaranteed <eol> to work in other patients. <eob>
In the end, the drug company's marketing <eol> scheme failed. <eob>
For one thing, black patients <eol> were understandably wary <eob> of using a drug just for black people. <eob>
One elderly black woman stood up <eol> in a community meeting and shouted, <eob> "Give me what the white people <eol> are taking!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, <eob> wait until you learn <eob> that many doctors in the United States <eob> still use an updated version <eob> of a diagnostic tool <eob> that was developed by a physician <eol> during the slavery era, <eob> a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked <eob> to justifications for slavery. <eob>
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated <eob> from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. <eob>
He practiced in the Deep South <eol> before the Civil War, <eob> and he was a well-known expert on what was <eol> then called "Negro medicine." <eob> He promoted the racial concept of disease, <eob> that people of different races suffer <eol> from different diseases <eob> and experience common diseases differently. <eob>
Cartwright argued in the 1850s <eob> that slavery was beneficial <eol> for black people <eob> for medical reasons. <eob>
He claimed that because black people <eol> have lower lung capacity than whites, <eob> forced labor was good for them. <eob>
He wrote in a medical journal, <eob> "It is the red vital blood <eol> sent to the brain <eob> that liberates their minds <eol> when under the white man's control, <eob> and it is the want of sufficiency <eol> of red vital blood <eob> that chains their minds to ignorance <eol> and barbarism when in freedom." <eob> To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect <eob> a medical device <eol> for measuring breathing called the spirometer <eob> to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs. <eob>
Today, doctors still uphold <eol> Cartwright's claim <eob> the black people as a race <eob> have lower lung capacity <eol> than white people. <eob>
Some even use a modern day spirometer <eob> that actually has a button <eol> labeled "race" <eob> so the machine adjusts the measurement <eob> for each patient according <eol> to his or her race. <eob>
It's a well-known function called <eol> "correcting for race." <eob>
The problem with race medicine <eol> extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. <eob>
Its focus on innate racial differences <eol> in disease <eob> diverts attention and resources <eob> from the social determinants <eob> that cause appalling racial gaps in health: <eob> lack of access to high-quality <eol> medical care; <eob> food deserts in poor neighborhoods; <eob> exposure to environmental toxins; <eob> high rates of incarceration; <eob> and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination. <eob>
You see, race is not a biological category <eob> that naturally produces these <eol> health disparities <eob> because of genetic difference. <eob>
Race is a social category <eob> that has staggering <eol> biological consequences, <eob> but because of the impact <eol> of social inequality on people's health. <eob>
Yet race medicine pretends the answer <eol> to these gaps in health <eob> can be found in a race-specific pill. <eob>
It's much easier and more lucrative <eob> to market a technological fix <eob> for these gaps in health <eob> than to deal with <eol> the structural inequities that produce them. <eob>
The reason I'm so passionate <eol> about ending race medicine <eob> isn't just because it's bad medicine. <eob>
I'm also on this mission <eob> because the way doctors practice medicine <eob> continues to promote a false <eol> and toxic view of humanity. <eob>
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs <eol> in medicine we've been learning about, <eob> there's a failure of imagination <eob> when it comes to race. <eob>
Would you imagine with me, just a moment: <eob> What would happen <eol> if doctors stopped treating patients by race? <eob>
Suppose they rejected <eob> an 18th-century classification system <eob> and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge <eob> of human genetic diversity and unity, <eob> that human beings cannot be categorized <eol> into biological races? <eob>
What if, instead of using race <eol> as a crude proxy <eob> for some more important factor, <eob> doctors actually investigated and addressed <eol> that more important factor? <eob>
What if doctors joined the forefront <eob> of a movement to end <eol> the structural inequities <eob> caused by racism, <eob> not by genetic difference? <eob>
Race medicine is bad medicine, <eob> it's poor science <eob> and it's a false interpretation <eol> of humanity. <eob>
It is more urgent than ever <eob> to finally abandon this backward legacy <eob> and to affirm our common humanity <eob> by ending the social inequalities <eol> that truly divide us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> Thank you. Thanks. <eob>
So I'm a neurosurgeon. <eob> And like most of my colleagues, <eob> I have to deal, every day, <eol> with human tragedies. <eob>
I realize how your life can change <eol> from one second to the other <eob> after a major stroke <eol> or after a car accident. <eob>
And what is very frustrating <eol> for us neurosurgeons <eob> is to realize that unlike <eol> other organs of the body, <eob> the brain has very little <eol> ability for self-repair. <eob>
And after a major injury <eol> of your central nervous system, <eob> the patients often remain <eol> with a severe handicap. <eob>
And that's probably <eol> the reason why I've chosen <eob> to be a functional neurosurgeon. <eob>
What is a functional neurosurgeon? <eob>
It's a doctor who is trying to improve <eol> a neurological function <eob> through different surgical strategies. <eob>
You've certainly heard <eol> of one of the famous ones <eob> called deep brain stimulation, <eob> where you implant an electrode <eol> in the depths of the brain <eob> in order to modulate a circuit <eol> of neurons <eob> to improve a neurological function. <eob>
It's really an amazing technology <eob> in that it has improved <eol> the destiny of patients <eob> with Parkinson's disease, <eob> with severe tremor, with severe pain. <eob>
However, neuromodulation <eol> does not mean neuro-repair. <eob>
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons <eob> is to repair the brain. <eob>
I think <eob> that we are approaching this dream. <eob>
And I would like to show you <eob> that we are very close to this. <eob>
And that with a little bit of help, <eob> the brain is able to help itself. <eob>
So the story started 15 years ago. <eob>
At that time, I was a chief resident <eob> working days and nights <eol> in the emergency room. <eob>
I often had to take care <eol> of patients with head trauma. <eob>
You have to imagine that when a patient <eol> comes in with a severe head trauma, <eob> his brain is swelling <eob> and he's increasing <eol> his intracranial pressure. <eob> And in order to save his life, <eob> you have to decrease <eol> this intracranial pressure. <eob>
And to do that, <eob> you sometimes have to remove <eol> a piece of swollen brain. <eob>
So instead of throwing away <eol> these pieces of swollen brain, <eob> we decided with Jean-François Brunet, <eob> who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, <eob> to study them. <eob>
What do I mean by that? <eob>
We wanted to grow cells <eol> from these pieces of tissue. <eob>
It's not an easy task. <eob>
Growing cells from a piece of tissue <eob> is a bit the same as growing <eol> very small children <eob> out from their family. <eob>
So you need to find the right nutrients, <eob> the warmth, the humidity <eob> and all the nice environments <eol> to make them thrive. <eob>
So that's exactly what we had <eol> to do with these cells. <eob>
And after many attempts, <eob> Jean-François did it. <eob>
And that's what he saw <eol> under his microscope. <eob>
And that was, for us, a major surprise. <eob> Why? <eob> Because this looks exactly the same <eol> as a stem cell culture, <eob> with large green cells <eol> surrounding small, immature cells. <eob>
And you may remember from biology class <eob> that stem cells are immature cells, <eob> able to turn into any type <eol> of cell of the body. <eob>
The adult brain has stem cells, <eol> but they're very rare <eob> and they're located <eol> in deep and small niches <eob> in the depths of the brain. <eob>
So it was surprising to get <eol> this kind of stem cell culture <eob> from the superficial part <eol> of swollen brain we had <eob> in the operating theater. <eob>
And there was another <eol> intriguing observation: <eob> Regular stem cells <eol> are very active cells -- <eob> cells that divide, divide, <eol> divide very quickly. <eob>
And they never die, <eol> they're immortal cells. <eob>
But these cells behave differently. <eob>
They divide slowly, <eob> and after a few weeks of culture, <eob> they even died. <eob>
So we were in front of a strange <eol> new cell population <eob> that looked like stem cells <eol> but behaved differently. <eob>
And it took us a long time <eol> to understand where they came from. <eob>
They come from these cells. <eob>
These blue and red cells are called <eol> doublecortin-positive cells. <eob>
All of you have them in your brain. <eob>
They represent four percent <eol> of your cortical brain cells. <eob>
They have a very important role <eol> during the development stage. <eob>
When you were fetuses, <eob> they helped your brain to fold itself. <eob>
But why do they stay in your head? <eob>
This, we don't know. <eob>
We think that they may <eol> participate in brain repair <eob> because we find them <eol> in higher concentration <eob> close to brain lesions. <eob>
But it's not so sure. <eob>
But there is one clear thing -- <eob> that from these cells, <eob> we got our stem cell culture. <eob>
And we were in front <eol> of a potential new source of cells <eob> to repair the brain. <eob>
And we had to prove this. <eob>
So to prove it, <eob> we decided to design <eol> an experimental paradigm. <eob>
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain <eob> in a non-eloquent area of the brain, <eob> and then to culture the cells <eob> exactly the way <eob> Jean-François did it <eob> in his lab. <eob>
And then label them, to put color in them <eob> in order to be able <eol> to track them in the brain. <eob>
And the last step was to re-implant them <eob> in the same individual. <eob>
We call these <eob> autologous grafts -- autografts. <eob>
So the first question we had, <eob> "What will happen if we re-implant <eol> these cells in a normal brain, <eob> and what will happen <eol> if we re-implant the same cells <eob> in a lesioned brain?" <eob> Thanks to the help <eol> of professor Eric Rouiller, <eob> we worked with monkeys. <eob>
So in the first-case scenario, <eob> we re-implanted the cells <eol> in the normal brain <eob> and what we saw is that they completely <eol> disappeared after a few weeks, <eob> as if they were taken from the brain, <eob> they go back home, <eob> the space is already busy, <eob> they are not needed there, <eol> so they disappear. <eob>
In the second-case scenario, <eob> we performed the lesion, <eob> we re-implanted exactly the same cells, <eob> and in this case, the cells remained -- <eob> and they became mature neurons. <eob>
And that's the image of what <eol> we could observe under the microscope. <eob>
Those are the cells <eol> that were re-implanted. <eob>
And the proof they carry, <eob> these little spots, those <eol> are the cells that we've labeled <eob> in vitro, when they were in culture. <eob>
But we could not stop here, of course. <eob>
Do these cells also help a monkey <eol> to recover after a lesion? <eob>
So for that, we trained monkeys <eol> to perform a manual dexterity task. <eob>
They had to retrieve <eol> food pellets from a tray. <eob>
They were very good at it. <eob>
And when they had reached <eol> a plateau of performance, <eob> we did a lesion in the motor cortex <eol> corresponding to the hand motion. <eob>
So the monkeys were plegic, <eob> they could not move their hand anymore. <eob>
And exactly the same as humans would do, <eob> they spontaneously recovered <eol> to a certain extent, <eob> exactly the same as after a stroke. <eob>
Patients are completely plegic, <eob> and then they try to recover <eol> due to a brain plasticity mechanism, <eob> they recover to a certain extent, <eob> exactly the same for the monkey. <eob>
So when we were sure that the monkey <eol> had reached his plateau <eob> of spontaneous recovery, <eob> we implanted his own cells. <eob>
So on the left side, you see the monkey <eol> that has spontaneously recovered. <eob>
He's at about 40 to 50 percent <eol> of his previous performance <eob> before the lesion. <eob>
He's not so accurate, not so quick. <eob>
And look now when we re-implant the cells: <eob> Two months after re-implantation, <eol> the same individual. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It was also very exciting results <eol> for us, I tell you. <eob>
Since that time, we've understood <eol> much more about these cells. <eob>
We know that we can cryopreserve them, <eob> we can use them later on. <eob>
We know that we can apply them <eol> in other neuropathological models, <eob> like Parkinson's disease, for example. <eob>
But our dream is still <eol> to implant them in humans. <eob>
And I really hope that I'll be able <eol> to show you soon <eob> that the human brain is giving us <eol> the tools to repair itself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, <eob> and I'm sure that right now, there are <eol> several dozen people in the audience, <eob> possibly even a majority, <eob> who are thinking, "I know <eol> somebody who can use this." <eob> I do, in any case. <eob>
And of course the question is, <eob> what are the biggest obstacles <eob> before you can go <eol> into human clinical trials? <eob>
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest <eol> obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) <eob> So, from these exciting results, <eol> you need to fill out <eob> about two kilograms of papers and forms <eob> to be able to go through these <eol> kind of trials. <eob>
BG: Which is understandable, <eol> the brain is delicate, etc. <eob>
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time <eob> and a lot of patience and almost <eol> a professional team to do it, you know? <eob>
BG: If you project yourself -- <eob> having done the research <eob> and having tried to get <eol> permission to start the trials, <eob> if you project yourself out in time, <eob> how many years before <eol> somebody gets into a hospital <eob> and this therapy is available? <eob>
JB: So, it's very difficult to say. <eob>
It depends, first, <eol> on the approval of the trial. <eob>
Will the regulation allow us <eol> to do it soon? <eob>
And then, you have to perform <eol> this kind of study <eob> in a small group of patients. <eob>
So it takes, already, a long time <eol> to select the patients, <eob> do the treatment <eob> and evaluate if it's useful <eol> to do this kind of treatment. <eob>
And then you have to deploy <eol> this to a multicentric trial. <eob>
You have to really prove <eol> first that it's useful <eob> before offering this treatment <eol> up for everybody. <eob>
BG: And safe, of course. <eob>
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming <eol> to TED and sharing this. <eob> BG: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
On January 26, 2013, <eob> a band of al-Qaeda militants entered <eol> the ancient city of Timbuktu <eob> on the southern edge <eol> of the Sahara Desert. <eob>
There, they set fire to a medieval library <eol> of 30,000 manuscripts <eob> written in Arabic and several African languages <eob> and ranging in subject from astronomy <eol> to geography, history to medicine, <eob> including one book which records <eob> perhaps the first treatment <eol> for male erectile dysfunction. <eob>
Unknown in the West, <eob> this was the collected wisdom <eol> of an entire continent, <eob> the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought <eol> not to have a voice at all. <eob>
The mayor of Bamako, <eol> who witnessed the event, <eob> called the burning of the manuscripts <eob> "a crime against world cultural heritage." <eob> And he was right -- <eob> or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact <eol> that he was also lying. <eob>
In fact, just before, <eob> African scholars had collected <eol> a random assortment of old books <eob> and left them out for the terrorists to burn. <eob>
Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, <eob> the capital of Mali, <eob> moldering in the high humidity. <eob>
What was rescued by ruse <eob> is now once again in jeopardy, <eob> this time by climate. <eob>
But Africa, and the far-flung <eol> corners of the world, <eob> are not the only places, or even the main places <eob> in which manuscripts <eol> that could change the history of world culture <eob> are in jeopardy. <eob>
Several years ago, I conducted <eol> a survey of European research libraries <eob> and discovered that, at the barest minimum, <eob> there are 60,000 manuscripts <eob> pre-1500 <eob> that are illegible <eol> because of water damage, <eob> fading, mold and chemical reagents. <eob>
The real number is likely double that, <eob> and that doesn't even count <eob> Renaissance manuscripts <eol> and modern manuscripts <eob> and cultural heritage objects such as maps. <eob>
What if there were a technology <eob> that could recover these lost <eol> and unknown works? <eob>
Imagine worldwide how a trove <eol> of hundreds of thousands <eob> of previously unknown texts <eob> could radically transform <eol> our knowledge of the past. <eob>
Imagine what unknown classics we would discover <eob> which would rewrite <eol> the canons of literature, history, <eob> philosophy, music -- <eob> or, more provocatively, <eol> that could rewrite our cultural identities, <eob> building new bridges <eol> between people and culture. <eob>
These are the questions that transformed me <eob> from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, <eob> into a textual scientist. <eob>
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is. <eob>
For me, it conjures <eol> up images of passivity, <eob> of someone sitting idly in an armchair <eob> waiting for knowledge <eol> to come to him <eob> in a neat little parcel. <eob>
How much better to be <eol> a participant in the past, <eob> an adventurer in an undiscovered country, <eob> searching for the hidden text. <eob>
As an academic, I was a mere reader. <eob>
I read and taught the same classics <eob> that people had been reading <eol> and teaching for hundreds of years -- <eob> Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch -- <eob> and with every scholarly article that I published <eob> I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing <eol> slivers of insight. <eob>
What I wanted to be <eob> was an archaeologist of the past, <eob> a discoverer of literature, <eob> an Indiana Jones without the whip -- <eob> or, actually, with the whip. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And I wanted it not just for myself <eol> but I wanted it for my students as well. <eob>
And so six years ago, <eol> I changed the direction of my career. <eob>
At the time, I was working <eol> on "The Chess of Love," <eob> the last important long poem <eol> of the European Middle Ages <eob> never to have been edited. <eob>
And it wasn't edited because <eol> it existed in only one manuscript <eob> which was so badly damaged <eol> during the firebombing of Dresden <eob> in World War II <eob> that generations of scholars <eol> had pronounced it lost. <eob>
For five years, I had been working <eol> with an ultraviolet lamp <eob> trying to recover traces of the writing <eob> and I'd gone about <eol> as far as technology at the time <eob> could actually take me. <eob>
And so I did what many people do. <eob> I went online, <eob> and there I learned about <eob> how multispectral imaging <eol> had been used to recover two lost treatises <eob> of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes <eob> from a 13th-century palimpsest. <eob>
A palimpsest is a manuscript <eol> which has been erased and overwritten. <eob>
And so, out of the blue, <eob> I decided to write <eol> to the lead imaging scientist <eob> on the Archimedes palimpsest project, <eob> Professor Roger Easton, <eob> with a plan and a plea. <eob>
And to my surprise, <eol> he actually wrote back. <eob>
With his help, I was able to win <eol> a grant from the US government <eob> to build a transportable, <eol> multispectral imaging lab, <eob> And with this lab, I transformed <eol> what was a charred and faded mess <eob> into a new medieval classic. <eob>
So how does multispectral <eol> imaging actually work? <eob>
Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging <eob> is something that anyone <eol> who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles <eob> will immediately appreciate: <eob> that what we can see <eol> in the visible spectrum of light <eob> is only a tiny fraction <eol> of what's actually there. <eob>
The same is true with invisible writing. <eob>
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light <eob> between the ultraviolet <eol> and the infrared, <eob> and these are shown down <eol> onto the manuscript from above <eob> from banks of LEDs, <eob> and another multispectral light source <eob> which comes up through the individual <eol> leaves of the manuscript. <eob>
Up to 35 images per sequence <eol> per leaf are imaged this way <eob> using a high-powered digital camera <eol> equipped with a lens <eob> which is made out of quartz. <eob>
There are about five <eol> of these in the world. <eob>
And once we capture these images, <eob> we feed them <eol> through statistical algorithms <eob> to further enhance and clarify them, <eob> using software which was originally <eol> designed for satellite images <eob> and used by people <eol> like geospatial scientists <eob> and the CIA. <eob>
The results can be spectacular. <eob>
You may already have heard <eol> of what's been done <eob> for the Dead Sea Scrolls, <eob> which are slowly gelatinizing. <eob>
Using infrared, we've been able to read <eol> even the darkest corners <eob> of the Dead Sea Scrolls. <eob>
You may not be aware, however, <eob> of other Biblical texts that <eob> are in jeopardy. <eob>
Here, for example, is a leaf <eol> from a manuscript <eob> that we imaged, <eob> which is perhaps the most valuable <eol> Christian Bible in the world. <eob>
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest <eol> translation of the Gospels into Latin, <eob> and it dates from the first half <eol> of the fourth century. <eob>
This is the closest we can come <eob> to the Bible at the time <eol> of the foundation of Christendom <eob> under Emperor Constantine, <eob> and at the time also of the Council <eol> of Nicaea, <eob> when the basic creed of Christianity <eol> was being agreed upon. <eob>
This manuscript, unfortunately, <eol> has been very badly damaged, <eob> and it's damaged because for centuries <eob> it had been used and handled <eob> in swearing in ceremonies <eol> in the church. <eob>
In fact, that purple splotch that you see <eol> in the upper left hand corner <eob> is Aspergillus, which is a fungus <eob> which originates in the unwashed hands <eob> of a person with tuberculosis. <eob>
Our imaging has enabled me <eol> to make the first transcription <eob> of this manuscript <eol> in 250 years. <eob>
Having a lab that can travel <eol> to collections where it's needed, however, <eob> is only part of the solution. <eob>
The technology is expensive and very rare, <eob> and the imaging and image processing <eol> skills are esoteric. <eob>
That means that mounting recoveries <eob> is beyond the reach of most researchers <eol> and all but the wealthiest institutions. <eob>
That's why I founded <eol> the Lazarus Project, <eob> a not-for-profit initiative <eob> to bring multispectral imaging <eol> to individual researchers <eob> and smaller institutions <eol> at little or no cost whatsoever. <eob>
Over the past five years, <eob> our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students <eob> has travelled to seven different countries <eob> and have recovered some of the world's <eol> most valuable damaged manuscripts, <eob> included the Vercelli Book, <eol> which is the oldest book of English, <eob> the Black Book of Carmarthen, <eol> the oldest book of Welsh, <eob> and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels <eob> located in what is now the former <eol> Soviet Georgia. <eob>
So, spectral imaging <eol> can recover lost texts. <eob>
More subtly, though, it can recover <eol> a second story behind every object, <eob> the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, <eob> and, sometimes, what the author was thinking <eol> at the time he wrote. <eob>
Take, for example, a draft <eol> of the Declaration of Independence <eob> written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, <eob> which some colleagues of mine <eol> imaged a few years ago <eob> at the Library of Congress. <eob>
Curators had noticed <eol> that one word throughout <eob> had been scratched out <eol> and overwritten. <eob>
The word overwritten was "citizens." <eob> Perhaps you can guess <eol> what the word underneath was. <eob> "Subjects." <eob> There, ladies and gentlemen, <eol> is American democracy <eob> evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson. <eob>
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, <eob> which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. <eob>
This was the map <eol> that Columbus likely consulted <eob> before he traveled to the New World <eob> and which gave him his idea <eol> of what Asia looked like <eob> and where Japan was located. <eob>
The problem with this map <eol> is that its inks and pigments <eob> had so degraded over time <eob> that this large, nearly seven-foot map, <eob> made the world look like a giant desert. <eob>
Until now, we had very little idea, <eol> detailed idea, that is, <eob> of what Columbus knew of the world <eob> and how world cultures were represented. <eob>
The main legend of the map <eol> was entirely illegible under normal light. <eob>
Ultraviolet did very little for it. <eob>
Multispectral gave us everything. <eob>
In Asia, we learned <eol> of monsters with ears so long <eob> that they could cover <eol> the creature's entire body. <eob>
In Africa, about a snake <eol> who could cause the ground to smoke. <eob>
Like starlight, which can convey images <eob> of the way the Universe <eol> looked in the distant past, <eob> so multispectral light can take us back <eol> to the first stuttering moments <eob> of an object's creation. <eob>
Through this lens, we witness <eol> the mistakes, the changes of mind, <eob> the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts, <eob> the imperfections <eol> of the human imagination <eob> that allow these hallowed objects <eol> and their authors <eob> to become more real, <eob> that make history closer to us. <eob>
What about the future? <eob> There's so much of the past, <eob> and so few people with the skills <eol> to rescue it <eob> before these objects disappear forever. <eob>
That's why I have begun <eol> to teach this new hybrid discipline <eob> that I call "textual science." <eob> Textual science is a marriage <eob> of the traditional skills <eol> of a literary scholar -- <eob> the ability to read old languages <eol> and old handwriting, <eob> the knowledge of how texts are made <eob> in order to be able to place <eol> and date them -- <eob> with new techniques like imaging science, <eob> the chemistry of inks and pigments, <eob> computer-aided optical character recognition. <eob>
Last year, a student in my class, <eob> a freshman, <eob> with a background in Latin and Greek, <eob> was image-processing a palimpsest <eob> that we had photographed <eol> at a famous library in Rome. <eob>
As he worked, tiny Greek writing began <eol> to appear from behind the text. <eob>
Everyone gathered around, <eob> and he read a line from a lost work <eob> of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. <eob>
This was the first time <eol> in well over a thousand years <eob> that those words had been pronounced aloud. <eob>
In that moment, he became a scholar. <eob>
Ladies and gentlemen, <eol> that is the future of the past. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I believe big institutions <eob> have unique potential <eol> to create change, <eob> and I believe that we as individuals <eob> have unique power <eob> to influence the direction <eol> that those institutions take. <eob>
Now, these beliefs did not <eol> come naturally to me, <eob> because trusting big institutions, <eob> not really part of my family legacy. <eob>
My mother escaped North Korea <eob> when she was 10 years old. <eob>
To do so, she had to elude <eol> every big institution in her life: <eob> repressive governments, occupying armies <eob> and even armed border patrols. <eob>
Later, when she decided she wanted <eol> to emigrate to the United States, <eob> she had to defy an entire culture <eob> that said the girls would never be <eol> the best and brightest. <eob>
Only because her name <eol> happens to sound like a boy's <eob> was she able to finagle her way <eol> into the government immigration exam <eob> to come to the United States. <eob>
Because of her bravery and passion, <eob> I've had all the opportunities <eol> that she never did, <eob> and that has made my story <eol> so different. <eob>
Instead of running away from big institutions, <eob> I've actually run toward them. <eob>
I've had the chance over the course <eol> of my career <eob> to work for The Wall Street Journal, <eob> the White House <eob> and now one of the largest financial <eol> institutions in the world, <eob> where I lead sustainable investing. <eob>
Now, these institutions are like tankers, <eob> and working inside of them, <eob> I've come to appreciate <eol> what large wakes they can leave, <eob> and I've become convinced <eob> that the institution <eol> of the global capital markets, <eob> the nearly 290 trillion dollars <eol> of stocks and bonds in the world, <eob> that that may be one of our most powerful forces <eob> for positive social change at our disposal, <eob> if we ask it to be. <eob>
Now, I know some of you are thinking, <eob> global capital markets, <eol> positive social change, <eob> not usually in the same sentence <eol> or even the same paragraph. <eob>
I think many people <eol> think of the capital markets <eob> kind of like an ocean. <eob>
It's a vast, impersonal, <eol> uncaring force of nature <eob> that is not affected <eol> by our wishes or desires. <eob>
So the best that our little savings accounts <eob> or retirement accounts can do <eob> is to try to catch some waves <eol> in the good cycles <eob> and hope that we don't get inundated <eol> in the turbulent ones, <eob> but certainly our decisions on how <eol> to steer our little retirement accounts <eob> don't affect the tides, <eob> don't change the shape <eol> or size or direction of the waves. <eob>
But why is that? <eob> Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital <eob> actually belongs to individuals like us, <eob> and most of the rest of the capital markets <eob> is controlled by the institutions <eol> that get their power and authority <eob> and their capital from us, <eob> as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders <eol> or citizens. <eob>
So if we are the ultimate owners <eol> of the capital markets, <eob> why aren't we able to make our voices heard? <eob>
Why can't we make some waves? <eob>
So let me ask you a different question: <eob> did any of you buy fair trade coffee <eob> the last time you were <eol> at a supermarket or at Starbucks? <eob> OK. Do any of you go <eol> to the restaurant <eob> and order the sustainably farmed trout <eob> instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass <eob> that you really wish you could have? <eob>
Do any of you drive hybrid cars <eol> or even electric cars? <eob>
So why do we do these things? <eob> Right? One electric car <eol> doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion <eob> combustion engine vehicles. <eob>
One fish is just one fish in the sea. <eob>
And one cup of coffee <eob> doesn't amount to a hill <eol> of beans in this crazy world. <eob>
But we do these things <eol> because we believe they matter, <eob> that our actions add up, <eob> that our choices might influence others <eob> and collectively, what an impact <eol> we can have. <eob>
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug <eol> that I bought a couple of years ago. <eob>
It's a reusable mug. <eob>
It has all these things printed on it. <eob>
Look at some of the things <eol> that are on it, that it says. <eob>
"This one cup can be used <eol> again and again." <eob>
"This one cup may inspire <eol> others to use one too." <eob>
"This one cup helps save the planet." <eob> I had no idea this plastic cup <eol> was so powerful. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So why do we think that our choice <eob> of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee <eob> in a reusable mug matters, <eob> but what we do with 4,000 dollars <eol> in our investment account <eob> for our IRA doesn't? <eob>
Why can't we tell the supermarket <eol> and the capital markets <eob> that we care, <eob> that we care about fair labor standards, <eob> that we care about sustainable <eol> production methods <eob> and about healthy communities? <eob>
Why aren't we voting with <eol> our investment dollars, <eob> but we would vote with our lattes? <eob>
So I think it has something <eol> to do with the myths, <eob> the fables that we all carry around <eol> in our collective consciousness. <eob>
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale <eol> about the magic porridge pot? <eob>
If you said to the pot, "Boil, <eol> little pot, boil," <eob> it would fill up with sweet porridge. <eob>
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop," <eob> it would stop. <eob>
But if you got the words wrong, <eol> it wouldn't listen, <eob> and things could go terribly awry. <eob>
So I think when it comes to markets, <eob> we have a little bit of a similar <eol> fable in our heads. <eob>
We believe that the markets <eol> is this magic pot <eob> that obeys only one command: <eob> make more money. <eob>
Only those words said exactly that way <eob> will make the pot fill up with gold. <eob>
Add in some extra words <eol> like "protect the environment," <eob> the spell might not work. <eob>
Put in the wrong words <eol> like "promote social justice," <eob> and you might see <eol> your gold coins shrink <eob> or even vanish entirely, <eol> according to this fable. <eob>
So we asked people, <eol> what do you really think? <eob>
And we actually went out and polled <eol> a thousand individual investors, <eob> and we found something fascinating. <eob>
Overwhelmingly, <eob> people wanted to add <eol> those extra words into the formula. <eob>
71 percent of people said yes, <eob> they were interested <eol> in sustainable investing, <eob> which we define as taking <eol> the best in class investment process <eob> that you already have traditionally <eob> and adding in the extra information <eol> you get <eob> when you think about the environment <eol> and society and good governance. <eob> 71 percent wanted that. <eob>
72 percent said that they believe <eol> that companies who did that <eob> would actually do better financially. <eob>
So people really do believe <eol> that you can do well by doing good. <eob>
But here was the weird thing: <eob> 54 percent of the people <eob> still said if they put their money <eol> in those kinds of stocks, <eob> they thought that they would make less money. <eob>
So is it true? <eob> Do you get less sweet porridge <eol> if you invest in shade-grown coffee <eob> instead of drinking it? <eob>
Well, you know, the investors <eol> in companies like Burt's Bees <eob> or Ben & amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so. <eob> Right? Both of those started out <eol> as small, socially conscious companies <eob> that ended up becoming so popular <eol> with consumers <eob> that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them <eob> for hundreds of millions of dollars <eob> each. <eob>
But here's the important thing. <eob> Those corporations realized <eob> that if they wanted to protect <eol> the value of their investments, <eob> they had to preserve <eol> that socially conscious mission. <eob>
If they didn't keep adding <eol> in those extra words <eob> of environmentally friendly <eol> and socially conscious, <eob> those brands wouldn't <eob> make more money. <eob>
But maybe this is just the exception <eol> the proves the rule, right? <eob>
The serious companies <eol> that fund our economy <eob> and that fund our retirements <eol> and that really make the world go round, <eob> they need to stick to making more money. <eob>
So, Harvard Business School <eol> actually researched this, <eob> and they found something fascinating. <eob>
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago <eob> in a portfolio of companies <eob> that focused narrowly on making more money <eob> quarter by quarter, <eob> that one dollar <eob> would have grown to 14 <eol> dollars and 46 cents. <eob>
That's not bad until you consider <eob> that if instead you'd invested <eol> that same dollar <eob> in a portfolio of companies <eob> that focused on growing their business <eob> and on the most important <eol> environmental and social issues, <eob> that one dollar <eob> would have grown <eob> to 28 dollars and 36 cents. <eob> almost twice as much sweet porridge. <eob>
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make <eol> that outperformance <eob> by giving away money to seem <eol> like a nice corporate citizen. <eob>
They did it by focusing on the things <eol> that matter to their business, <eob> like wasting less energy and water <eob> in their manufacturing processes; <eob> like making sure the CEO contracts <eol> had the CEOs incentivized <eob> for the long-term results of the company <eol> and the communities they served, <eob> not just quarterly results; <eob> or building a first class culture <eob> that would have higher employee loyalty, <eob> retention and productivity. <eob>
Now, Harvard's not alone. <eob>
Oxford also did a research study <eol> where they examined 120 different studies <eob> looking at the effect of sustainability <eol> and economic results, <eob> and they found time and time and time again <eob> that the companies that cared <eol> about these kinds of important things <eob> actually had better operational efficiency, <eob> lower cost of capital <eob> and better performance in their stock price. <eob>
And then there's Al Gore. <eob>
So 20 years ago, when I worked <eol> for Al Gore in <eob> the White House, <eob> he was one of the early pioneers pleading <eol> with businesses and governments <eob> to pay attention to the challenges <eol> of climate change. <eob>
Post-White House, he opened <eol> an investment firm called Generation, <eob> where he baked environmental <eol> sustainability and other things <eob> right into the core investment process. <eob>
And at the time there was a good bit <eol> of skepticism about his views. <eob> Ten years later, his track <eol> record is one more proof point <eob> that sustainable investing done <eol> right can be sound investing. <eob>
Far from making less sweet porridge <eob> because he added sustainability <eol> into the mix, <eob> he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark. <eob>
Now, sustainable investing, <eob> the good news is it doesn't require <eol> a magic spell <eob> and it doesn't require some investment secret, <eob> and it's not just for the elite. <eob>
It is not just about private equity <eol> for billionaires. <eob>
It's not just groovy-sounding investments <eol> like clean technology <eob> or microfinance in emerging markets <eob> or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. <eob>
It's about stocks and bonds <eol> and Fortune 500 companies. <eob>
It's about mutual funds. <eob>
It's about all the things <eob> we already see in the market today. <eob>
So here's why I'm convinced <eob> that we collectively have the power <eob> to make sustainable investing <eol> the new normal. <eob>
First, the proof points are coming <eol> out all the time <eob> that sustainable investing done right, <eob> preserving all the same good <eol> principles of investing, <eob> the traditional sphere, can pay. <eob> It makes sense. <eob>
Secondly, <eob> the biggest obstacle standing in our way <eob> may actually just be in our heads. <eob>
We just need to let go of that myth <eob> that if you add your values <eol> into your investment thinking, <eob> that you get less sweet porridge. <eob>
And once you get rid of the fable, <eob> you can actually start appreciating those facts <eol> we've been talking about. <eob>
And third, the future is already here. <eob>
Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market <eob> and it's the fastest-growing <eol> segment of the investment industry. <eob> In the United States, <eol> it has grown enormously, as you can see. <eob>
It now represents one out of every six dollars <eob> under professional management <eol> in the United States. <eob>
So what are we waiting for? <eob> For me, it goes back to the inspiration <eol> that I received from my mother. <eob>
She knew that she wanted a life <eob> where she would have the freedom <eol> to make her own choices <eob> and to have her voice heard <eol> and write her own story. <eob>
She was passionate about that goal <eob> and she was clear that she would let <eol> no army, no obstacle, <eob> no big institution <eol> stand in her way. <eob>
She made it to the States, <eob> and she became a teacher, <eob> an award-winning author <eob> and a mother, <eob> and ended up sending her daughters <eol> to Harvard. <eob>
And these days, you can tell <eol> that she is amply comfortable <eob> holding court in the most powerful <eol> institutions in the world. <eob>
It seems almost too prophetic <eob> that her name in Korean means <eob> "passionate clarity." <eob>
Passionate clarity: <eob> that's what I think we need <eol> to drive change. <eob>
Passion about the change <eol> we want to see in the world, <eob> and clarity that we are able <eol> to help chart the course. <eob>
We have more opportunity <eol> today than ever before <eob> to make choices. <eob>
We have more power than ever before <eol> to make our voices heard. <eob>
So change your perspective. <eob> Vote with your small change. <eob>
Invest in the change <eol> you want to see in the world. <eob>
Change the fables <eob> and change the markets. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Food crisis. <eob> It's in the news every day. <eob>
But what is it? <eob>
Some places in the world <eol> it's too little food, <eob> maybe too much. <eob>
Other places, GMO is saving the world. <eob>
Maybe GMO is the problem? <eob>
Too much agricultural runoff creating <eol> bad oceans, toxic oceans, <eob> attenuation of nutrition. <eob>
They go on and on. <eob>
And I find the current <eol> climate of this discussion <eob> incredibly disempowering. <eob>
So how do we bring that to something <eol> that we understand? <eob>
How is this apple food crisis? <eob>
You've all eaten an apple <eol> in the last week, I'm sure. <eob>
How old do you think <eol> it was from when it was picked? <eob> Two weeks? <eob> Two months? <eob> Eleven months -- <eob> the average age of an apple <eol> in a grocery store in the United States. <eob>
And I don't expect it to be much <eol> different in Europe <eob> or anywhere else in the world. <eob>
We pick them, <eob> we put them in cold storage, <eob> we gas the cold storage -- <eob> there's actually documented proof <eob> of workers trying to go <eol> into these environments <eob> to retrieve an apple, <eob> and dying, <eob> because the atmosphere <eob> that they slow down the process of the apple <eol> with is also toxic to humans. <eob>
How is it that none of you knew this? <eob>
Why didn't I know this? <eob>
Ninety percent of the quality <eol> of that apple -- <eob> all of the antioxidants -- <eol> are gone by the time we get it. <eob>
It's basically a little ball of sugar. <eob>
How did we get so information poor <eob> and how can we do better? <eob>
I think what's missing is a platform. <eob>
I know platforms -- I know computers, <eob> they put me on the Internet <eol> when I was young. <eob>
I did very weird things -- <eob>
on this platform. <eob> But I met people, and I could express myself. <eob>
How do you express yourself in food? <eob>
If we had a platform, <eob> we might feel empowered <eol> to question: What if? <eob>
For me, I questioned: <eob> What if climate was democratic? <eob>
So, this is a map of climate in the world. <eob>
The most productive areas in green, <eol> the least productive in red. <eob>
They shift and they change, <eob> and Californian farmers <eol> now become Mexican farmers. <eob>
China picks up land in Brazil <eol> to grow better food, <eob> and we're a slave to climate. <eob>
What if each country <eol> had its own productive climate? <eob>
What would that change about how we live? <eob>
What would that change <eol> about quality of life and nutrition? <eob>
The last generation's problem was, <eol> we need more food <eob> and we need it cheap. <eob>
Welcome to your global farm. <eob>
We built a huge analog farm. <eob>
All these traces -- <eob> these are cars, planes, <eol> trains and automobiles. <eob>
It's a miracle <eol> that we feed seven billion people <eob> with just a few of us involved <eol> in the production of food. <eob>
What if... <eob> we built a digital farm? <eob>
A digital world farm. <eob>
What if you could take this apple, <eob> digitize it somehow, <eob> send it through particles in the air <eob> and reconstitute it on the other side? <eob> What if? <eob>
Going through some of these quotes, <eob> you know, they inspire me to do what I do. <eob>
First one: <eob>
["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land <eol> and no future."] <eob>
That's what I landed to the day <eol> that I went to Minamisanriku, <eob> one stop south of Fukushima, <eob> after the disaster. <eob>
The kids have headed <eol> to Sendai and Tokyo, <eob> the land is contaminated, <eob> they already import 70 percent <eol> of their own food. <eob>
But it's not unique to Japan. <eob>
Two percent of the American population <eol> is involved in farming. <eob>
What good answer comes from two percent <eol> of any population? <eob>
As we go around the world, <eob> 50 percent of the African population <eol> is under 18. <eob>
Eighty percent don't want <eol> to be farmers. <eob> Farming is hard. <eob> The life of a small-shareholder <eol> farmer is miserable. <eob>
They go into the city. <eob>
In India: <eob> farmers' families not being able <eol> to have basic access to utilities, <eob> more farmer suicides this year <eol> and the previous 10 before that. <eob>
It's uncomfortable to talk about. <eob>
Where are they going? <eob> Into the city. <eob> No young people, and everyone's headed in. <eob>
So how do we build this platform <eol> that inspires the youth? <eob>
Welcome to the new tractor. <eob>
This is my combine. <eob>
A number of years ago now, <eob> I went to Bed Bath <eol> and Beyond and Home Depot <eob> and I started hacking. <eob>
And I built silly things <eob> and I made plants dance <eob> and I attached them to my computer <eob> and I killed them all -- <eob> a lot. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I eventually got them to survive. <eob>
And I created one of the most <eol> intimate relationships <eob> I've ever had in my life, <eob> because I was learning <eol> the language of plants. <eob>
I wanted to make it bigger. <eob>
They said, "Knock yourself out, kid! <eob>
Here's an old electronics room <eol> that nobody wants. <eob>
What can you do?" <eob>
With my team, we built a farm <eol> inside of the media lab, <eob> a place historically known not <eol> for anything about biology <eob> but everything about digital life. <eob>
Inside of these 60 square feet, <eob> we produced enough food to feed <eol> about 300 people once a month -- <eob> not a lot of food. <eob>
And there's <eob> a lot <eob> of interesting technology in there. <eob>
But the most interesting thing? <eob>
Beautiful, white roots, <eob> deep, green colors <eob> and a monthly harvest. <eob>
Is this a new cafeteria? <eob>
Is this a new retail experience? <eob>
Is this a new grocery store? <eob>
I can tell you one thing for sure: <eob> this is the first time <eob> anybody in the media lab ripped <eol> the roots off of anything. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We get our salad in bags; <eob> there's nothing wrong with that. <eob>
But what happens <eob> when you have an image-based processing expert, <eob> a data scientist, <eob> a roboticist, <eob> ripping roots off and thinking, <eob> "Huh. <eob>
I know something about — <eob> I could make this happen, <eol> I want to try. <eob> " <eob>
In that process we would bring <eol> the plants out <eob> and we would take some back to the lab, <eob> because if you grew it, <eol> you don't throw it away; <eob> it's kind of precious to you. <eob>
I have this weird tongue now, <eob> because I'm afraid to let anybody <eol> eat anything until I've eaten it first, <eob> because I want it to be good. <eob>
So I eat lettuce every day <eob> and I can tell the pH <eol> of a lettuce within .1. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, <eol> you can't eat it today." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet. <eob>
It was hyper sweet <eol> because the plant had been stressed <eob> and it created a chemical reaction <eol> in the plant to protect itself: <eob> "I'm not going to die!" <eob> And the plants not-going-to-die, <eol> taste sweet to me. <eob>
Technologists falling backwards <eol> into plant physiology. <eob>
So we thought other people <eol> needed to be able to try this. <eob>
We want to see what people can create, <eob> so we conceived of a lab <eol> that could be shipped anywhere. <eob>
And then we built it. <eob>
So on the facade <eol> of the media lab is my lab, <eob> that has about 30 points <eol> of sensing per plant. <eob>
If you know about the genome <eol> or genetics, <eob> this is the phenome, right? <eob> The phenomena. <eob> When you say, "I like the strawberries <eol> from Mexico," <eob> you really like the strawberries <eol> from the climate <eob> that produced the expression <eol> that you like. <eob>
So if you're coding climate -- <eob> this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- <eol> you're coding <eob> the expression of that plant, <eol> the nutrition of that plant, <eob> the size of that plant, <eol> the shape, the color, the texture. <eob>
We need data, <eob> so we put a bunch of sensors in there <eob> to tell us what's going on. <eob>
If you think of your houseplants, <eob> and you look at your houseplant <eob> and you're super sad, because you're like, <eob> "Why are you dying? <eob>
Won't you talk to me? " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Farmers develop the most beautiful <eol> fortune-telling eyes <eob> by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s. <eob>
They can tell you when you see <eol> that plant dying <eob> that it's a nitrogen deficiency, <eol> a calcium deficiency <eob> or it needs more humidity. <eob>
Those beautiful eyes are not <eol> being passed down. <eob>
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer. <eob>
We trend those data points over time. <eob>
We correlate those data <eol> points to individual plants. <eob>
These are all the broccoli in my lab <eol> that day, by IP address. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We have IP-addressable broccoli. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So if that's not weird enough, <eob> you can click one and you get <eol> a plant profile. <eob>
And what this tells you <eol> is downloadable progress on that plant, <eob> but not like you'd think, <eob> it's not just when it's ready. <eob>
When does it achieve <eol> the nutrition that I need? <eob>
When does it achieve <eol> the taste that I desire? <eob>
Is it getting too much water? <eob>
Is it getting too much sun? <eob> Alerts. <eob> It can talk to me, it's conversant, <eob> we have a language. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I think of that as the first user <eol> on the plant Facebook, right? <eob>
That's a plant profile <eob> and that plant will start making friends. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I mean it -- it will make friends <eol> with other plants <eob> that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, <eob> less potassium. <eob>
We're going to learn about a complexity <eob> that we can only guess at now. <eob>
And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, <eol> they might friend us back, <eob> it depends on how we act. <eob>
So this is my lab now. <eob> It's a little bit more systematized, <eob> my background is designing data centers <eol> in hospitals of all things, <eob> so I know a little bit about creating <eol> a controlled environment. <eob>
And so -- <eob> inside of this environment, <eob> we're experimenting with all kinds of things. <eob>
This process, aeroponics, was developed <eol> by NASA for Mir Space Station <eob> for reducing the amount of water <eol> they send into space. <eob>
What it really does is give the plant <eol> exactly what it wants: <eob> water, minerals and oxygen. <eob>
Roots are not that complicated, <eob> so when you give them that, <eol> you get this amazing expression. <eob>
It's like the plant has two hearts. <eob>
And because it has two hearts, <eob> it grows four or five times faster. <eob>
It's a perfect world. <eob>
We've gone a long way into technology <eol> and seed for an adverse world <eob> and we're going to continue <eol> to do that, <eob> but we're going to have <eol> a new tool, too, <eob> which is perfect world. <eob>
So we've grown all kinds of things. <eob>
These tomatoes hadn't been <eol> in commercial production for 150 years. <eob>
Do you know that we have <eol> rare and ancient seed banks? <eob> Banks of seed. <eob> It's amazing. <eob> They have germplasm alive and things <eol> that you've never eaten. <eob>
I am the only person in this room <eol> that's eaten that kind of tomato. <eob>
Problem is it was a sauce tomato <eol> and we don't know how to cook, <eob> so we ate a sauce tomato, <eol> which is not that great. <eob>
But we've done things with protein -- <eol> we've grown all kinds of things. <eob>
We've grown humans -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well maybe you could, but we didn't. <eob>
But what we realized is, <eob> the tool was too big, <eol> it was too expensive. <eob>
I was starting to put them around the world <eob> and they were about 100,000 dollars. <eob>
Finding somebody with 100 grand in their <eol> back pocket isn't easy, <eob> so we wanted to make a small one. <eob>
This project was actually <eol> one of my student's -- <eob> mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille. <eob>
So Camille and I and my team, <eob> we iterated all summer, <eob> how to make it cheaper, <eol> how to make it work better, <eob> how to make it so other people can make it. <eob>
Then we dropped them off in schools, <eol> seventh through eleventh grade. <eob>
And if you want to be humbled, <eol> try to teach a kid something. <eob>
So I went into this school and I said, <eob> "Set it to 65 percent humidity." <eob>
The seventh grader said, <eol> "What's humidity?" <eob>
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air." <eob>
He said, "There's no water in air, <eol> you're an idiot." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me. <eob> Actually -- don't trust me, right? <eob>
Set it to 100. <eob> He sets it to 100 and what happens? <eob>
It starts to condense, <eol> make a fog and eventually drip. <eob>
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain. <eob> Why didn't you just tell me that?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We've created an interface <eol> for this that's much like a game. <eob>
They have a 3D environment, <eob> they can log into it anywhere in the world <eob> on their smartphone, on their tablet. <eob>
They have different parts of the bots -- <eol> the physical, the sensors. <eob>
They select recipes that have been <eol> created by other kids <eob> anywhere in the world. <eob>
They select and activate that recipe, <eol> they plant a seedling. <eob>
While it's growing, they make changes. <eob> They're like, "Why does a plant <eol> need CO2 anyway? <eob>
Isn't CO2 bad? <eob>
It kills people." <eob> Crank up CO2, plant dies. <eob>
Or crank down CO2, plant does very well. <eob>
Harvest plant, <eob> and you've created a new digital recipe. <eob>
It's an iterative design and development <eob> and exploration process. <eob>
They can download, then, <eob> all of the data about that new plant <eol> that they developed <eob> or the new digital recipe <eol> and what did it do -- <eob> was it better or was it worse? <eob>
Imagine these as little cores of processing. <eob>
We're going to learn so much. <eob>
Here's one of the food computers, <eol> as we call them, <eob> in a school in three weeks' time. <eob>
This is three weeks of growth. <eob>
But more importantly, <eob> it was the first time that this kid <eol> ever thought he could be a farmer -- <eob> or that he would want to be a farmer. <eob>
So, we've open-sourced all of this. <eob>
It's all online; go home, try <eol> to build your first food computer. <eob>
It's going to be difficult -- <eol> I'm just telling you. <eob>
We're in the beginning, <eol> but it's all there. <eob>
It's very important to me <eol> that this is easily accessible. <eob>
We're going to keep making it more so. <eob>
These are farmers, <eob> electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, <eob> environmental engineer, computer scientist, <eob> plant scientist, economist, <eol> urban planners. <eob> On one platform, doing what they're good at. <eob>
But we got a little too big. <eob>
This is my new facility <eol> that I'm just starting. <eob>
This warehouse could be anywhere. <eob>
That's why I chose it. <eob>
And inside of this warehouse <eob> we're going to build something <eol> kind of like this. <eob> These exist right now. <eob>
One grows greens, <eob> one grows Ebola vaccine. <eob> Pretty amazing that plants <eol> and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner <eob> is one of the reasons <eol> we're getting ahead of Ebola. <eob>
The plants are producing the protein <eol> that's Ebola resistant. <eob>
So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, <eob> all they way down to lettuce. <eob>
But these two things look nothing alike, <eob> and that's where I am with my field. <eob> Everything is different. <eob> We're in that weird <eol> "We're alright" stage <eob> and it's like, "Here's my black box --" <eob> "No, buy mine." <eob> "No, no, no -- I've got intellectual property <eol> that's totally valuable. <eob>
Don't buy his, buy mine." <eob>
And the reality is, <eol> we're just at the beginning, <eob> in a time when society is shifting, too. <eob>
When we ask for more, cheaper food, <eob> we're now asking for better, <eol> environmentally friendly food. <eob>
And when you have McDonald's advertising <eol> what's in the Chicken McNugget, <eob> the most mysterious food it <eol>em of all time -- <eob> they are now basing their marketing <eol> plan on that -- <eob> everything is changing. <eob>
So into the world now. <eob> Personal food computers, <eob> food servers <eob> and food data centers <eob> run on the open phenome. <eob>
Think open genome, but we're going <eol> to put little climate recipes, <eob> like Wikipedia, <eob> that you can pull down, <eol> actuate and grow. <eob>
What does this look like in a world? <eob>
You remember the world <eol> connected by strings? <eob>
We start having beacons. <eob>
We start sending information about food, <eob> rather than sending food. <eob>
This is not just my fantasy, <eob> this is where we're already deploying. <eob>
Food computers, <eob> food servers, <eob> soon-to-be food data centers, <eob> connecting people together to share information. <eob>
The future of food is not about fighting <eol> over what's wrong with this. <eob>
We know what's wrong with this. <eob>
The future of food is about net <eol>working the next one billion farmers <eob> and empowering them with a platform <eob> to ask and answer the question, <eob> "What if?" <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There are a few things <eol> that all of us need. <eob>
We all need air to breathe. <eob> We need clean water to drink. <eob> We need food to eat. <eob>
We need shelter and love. <eob> You know. Love is great, too. <eob>
And we all need a safe place to pee. <eob>
(Laughter) Yeah? <eob>
As a trans person <eol> who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, <eob> if I could change the world tomorrow <eob> to make it easier for me to navigate, <eob> the very first thing I would do <eob> is blink and create single stall, <eol> gender-neutral bathrooms <eob> in all public places. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Trans people and trans issues, <eob> they've been getting a lot of mainstream <eol> media attention lately. <eob>
And this is a great and necessary thing, <eob> but most of that attention <eol> has been focused <eob> on a very few individuals, <eob> most of whom are kinda rich <eob> and pretty famous, <eob> and probably don't have to worry <eol> that much anymore about where they're going to pee <eob> in between classes at their community college, <eob> or where they're going to get changed <eol> into their gym strip <eob> at their public high school. <eob>
Fame and money insulates these television <eol> star trans people <eob> from most of the everyday challenges <eob> that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis. <eob>
Public bathrooms. <eob> They've been a problem for me <eol> since as far back as I can remember, <eob> first when I was just a little baby tomboy <eob> and then later as a masculine-appearing, <eol> predominantly estrogen-based organism. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, today as a trans person, <eol> public bathrooms and change rooms <eob> are where I am most likely to be questioned <eol> or harassed. <eob>
I've often been verbally attacked <eol> behind their doors. <eob>
I've been hauled out by security guards <eol> with my pants still halfway pulled up. <eob>
I've been stared at, screamed <eol> at, whispered about, <eob> and one time I got smacked in the face <eol> by a little old lady's purse <eob> that from the looks of the shiner <eol> I took home that day <eob> I am pretty certain contained <eol> at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change <eob> and a large hard candy collection. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I know what some of you are thinking, <eob> and you're mostly right. <eob>
I can and do just use the men's room <eol> most of the time these days. <eob>
But that doesn't solve my change <eol> room dilemmas, does it? <eob>
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room <eol> because I'm not a man. <eob>
I'm a trans person. <eob>
And now we've got <eol> these fearmongering politicians <eob> that keep trying to pass <eol> these bathroom bills. <eob>
Have you heard about these? <eob>
They try to legislate to try <eol> and force people like myself <eob> to use the bathroom <eol> that they deem most appropriate <eob> according to the gender <eol> I was assigned at birth. <eob>
And if these politicians ever get their way, <eob> in Arizona or California <eol> or Florida <eob> or just last week in Houston, Texas, <eob> or Ottawa, <eob> well then, using the men's room <eol> will not be a legal option for me either. <eob>
And every time one of these politicians <eol> brings one of these bills to the table, <eob> I can't help but wonder, you know, <eob> just who will and exactly <eol> how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right? <eob> Panty checks? <eob> Really. <eob> Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms <eol> at public pools? <eob>
There's no legal <eol> or ethical or plausible way <eob> to enforce laws like these anyway. <eob>
They exist only to foster fear <eob> and promote transphobia. <eob>
They don't make anyone safer. <eob>
But they do for sure make the world <eol> more dangerous for some of us. <eob>
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer. <eob>
They drop out of school, <eol> or they opt out of life altogether. <eob>
Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth <eob> face additional challenges <eol> when accessing pools and gyms, <eob> but also universities, <eob> hospitals, libraries. <eob>
Don't even get me started on <eol> how they treat us in airports. <eob>
If we don't move now <eob> to make sure that these places <eob> are truly open and accessible to everyone, <eob> then we just need to get honest <eob> and quit calling them public places. <eob>
We need to just admit <eob> that they are really only open for people <eob> who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, <eob> which I do not. <eob> I never have. <eob> And this starts very early. <eob>
I know a little girl. <eob>
She's the daughter of a friend of mine. <eob>
She's a self-identified tomboy. <eob>
I'm talking about cowboy boots <eob> and Caterpillar yellow <eol> toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards. <eob>
One time I asked her <eol> what her favorite color was. <eob>
She told me, "Camouflage." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So that awesome little kid, <eob> she came home from school last October <eob> from her half day of preschool <eob> with soggy pants on because the other kids <eol> at school were harassing her <eob> when she tried to use the girls' bathroom. <eob>
And the teacher had already instructed her <eol> to stay out of the boys' bathroom. <eob>
And she had drank two glasses <eol> of that red juice <eob> at the Halloween party, <eob> and I mean, who can resist <eol> that red juice, right? <eob>
It's so good. <eob>
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer. <eob>
Her and her classmates <eol> were four years old. <eob>
They already felt empowered enough <eob> to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms. <eob>
She was four years old. <eob>
She had already been taught the brutal lesson <eob> that there was no bathroom <eol> door at preschool <eob> with a sign on it <eol> that welcomed people like her. <eob>
She'd already learned <eol> that bathrooms were going to be a problem, <eob> and that problem started with her <eob> and was hers alone. <eob>
So my friend asked me <eol> to talk to her little daughter, <eob> and I did. <eob>
I wanted to tell her <eob> that me and her mom <eol> were going to march on down <eob> and talk to that school, <eol> and the problem was going to go away, <eob> but I knew that wasn't true. <eob>
I wanted to tell her <eob> that it was all going to get better <eol> when she got older, <eob> but I couldn't. <eob>
So I asked her to tell me <eol> the story of what had happened, <eob> asked her to tell me how it made her feel. <eob> "Mad and sad," <eob> she told me. <eob>
So I told her <eob> that she wasn't alone <eob> and that it wasn't right <eol> what had happened to her, <eob> and then she asked me if I had ever <eol> peed in my pants before. <eob>
I said yes, I had, <eob> but not for a really long time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which of course was a lie, <eob> because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, <eob> and sometimes you just, I don't know, <eol> you pee a little bit <eob> when you cough or sneeze, <eob> when you're running upstairs, <eol> or you're stretching. <eob> Don't lie. <eob> It happens. Right? <eob> She doesn't need to know <eol> that, I figure. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I told her, when you get older, your bladder <eol> is going to grow bigger, too. <eob>
When you get old like me, <eob> you're going to be able <eol> to hold your pee for way longer, <eob> I promised her. <eob>
"Until you can get home?" <eob> she asked me. <eob>
I said, "Yes, <eob> until you can get home." <eob> She seemed to take some comfort in that. <eob>
So let's just build some single <eol> stall, gender-neutral bathrooms <eob> with a little bench for getting changed <eol> into your gym clothes. <eob>
We can't change the world overnight <eob> for our children, <eob> but we can give them a safe <eol> and private place <eob> to escape that world, <eob> if only for just a minute. <eob>
This we can do. <eob> So let's just do it. <eob>
And if you are one of those people <eol> who is sitting out there right now <eob> already coming up with a list <eol> of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, <eob> or it's too expensive, <eob> or telling yourself that giving <eol> a trans person a safe place to pee <eob> or get changed in <eob> supports a lifestyle choice <eol> that you feel offends your morality, <eob> or your masculinity, <eob> or your religious beliefs, <eob> then let me just appeal <eob> to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, <eob> does care about the rest of the population. <eob>
If you can't bring yourself <eol> to care enough about people like me, <eob> then what about women and girls <eob> with body image issues? <eob>
What about anyone <eol> with body image stuff going on? <eob>
What about that boy at school who is a foot <eol> shorter than his classmates, <eob> whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey? <eob> Oh, grade eight, <eob> what a cruel master you can be. <eob> Right? <eob> What about people <eol> with anxiety issues? <eob>
What about people with disabilities <eol> or who need assistance in there? <eob>
What about folks with bodies who, <eol> for whatever reason, <eob> don't fit into the mainstream idea <eol> of what a body should look like? <eob>
How many of us still feel shy <eob> or afraid to disrobe <eol> in front of our peers, <eob> and how many of us allow that fear <eob> to keep us from something <eol> as important <eob> as physical exercise? <eob>
Would all those people not benefit <eob> from these single stall facilities? <eob>
We can't change transphobic minds overnight, <eob> but we can give everybody <eob> a place to get changed in <eob> so that we can all get to work <eob> making the world safer <eob> for all of us. <eob>
Thank you for listening. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean. <eob>
It was this wild place <eol> full of color and life, <eob> home to these alien-looking, <eol> fantastical creatures. <eob>
I pictured big sharks <eol> ruling the food chain <eob> and saw graceful sea turtles <eol> dancing across coral reefs. <eob>
As a marine biologist turned photographer, <eob> I've spent most of my career <eol> looking for places <eob> as magical as those I used to dream <eol> about when I was little. <eob>
As you can see, <eob> I began exploring bodies of water <eol> at a fairly young age. <eob>
But the first time I truly went underwater, <eob> I was about 10 years old. <eob>
And I can still vividly remember <eol> furiously finning <eob> to reach this old, encrusted cannon <eol> on a shallow coral reef. <eob>
And when I finally managed <eol> to grab hold of it, <eob> I looked up, and I was instantly <eol> surrounded by fish <eob> in all colors of the rainbow. <eob>
That was the day I fell <eol> in love with the ocean. <eob>
Thomas Peschak <eob>
Conservation Photographer <eob>
In my 40 years on this planet, <eob> I've had the great privilege to explore <eob> some of its most incredible seascapes <eob> for National Geographic Magazine <eob> and the Save Our Seas Foundation. <eob>
I've photographed everything <eol> from really, really big sharks <eob> to dainty ones that fit <eol> in the palm of your hand. <eob>
I've smelled the fishy, <eol> fishy breath of humpback whales <eob> feeding just feet away from me <eob> in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest. <eob>
And I've been privy to the mating rituals <eol> of green sea turtles <eob> in the Mozambique Channel. <eob>
Everyone on this planet <eol> affects and is affected by the ocean. <eob>
And the pristine seas I used to dream <eol> of as a child <eob> are becoming harder and harder to find. <eob>
They are becoming more compressed <eob> and more threatened. <eob>
As we humans continue to maintain our role <eob> as the leading predator on earth, <eob> I've witnessed and photographed <eol> many of these ripple effects firsthand. <eob>
For a long time, I thought <eol> I had to shock my audience <eob> out of their indifference <eol> with disturbing images. <eob>
And while this approach has merits, <eob> I have come full circle. <eob>
I believe that the best way <eol> for me to effect change <eob> is to sell love. <eob>
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts <eob> and as a photographer, <eob> I have the rare opportunity <eob> to reveal animals and entire ecosystems <eob> that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface. <eob>
You can't love something <eol> and become a champion for it <eob> if you don't know it exists. <eob>
Uncovering this -- that is the power <eol> of conservation photography. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, <eob> but there are a handful of seascapes <eob> that have touched me incredibly deeply. <eob>
The first time I experienced <eol> that kind of high <eob> was about 10 years ago, <eob> off South Africa's rugged, wild coast. <eob>
And every June and July, <eob> enormous shoals of sardines <eol> travel northwards <eob> in a mass migration <eol> we call the Sardine Run. <eob>
And boy, do those fish <eol> have good reason to run. <eob> In hot pursuit are hoards <eol> of hungry and agile predators. <eob>
Common dolphins hunt together <eob> and they can separate some of the sardines <eol> from the main shoal <eob> and they create bait balls. <eob>
They drive and trap the fish <eol> upward against the ocean surface <eob> and then they rush in to dine <eob> on this pulsating and movable feast. <eob>
Close behind are sharks. <eob>
Now, most people believe <eob> that sharks and dolphins <eol> are these mortal enemies, <eob> but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist. <eob>
In fact, dolphins actually <eol> help sharks feed more effectively. <eob>
Without dolphins, the bait balls <eol> are more dispersed <eob> and sharks often end up <eol> with what I call a sardine donut, <eob> or a mouth full of water. <eob>
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments <eol> with sharks on the sardine run, <eob> I know they don't see me as prey. <eob>
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped <eol> just like any other guest <eob> at this rowdy, rowdy banquet. <eob>
From the shores of Africa <eol> we travel east, <eob> across the vastness <eol> that is the Indian Ocean <eob> to the Maldives, an archipelago <eol> of coral islands. <eob>
And during the stormy southwest monsoon, <eob> manta rays from all <eol> across the archipelago <eob> travel to a tiny speck <eol> in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. <eob>
Armies of crustaceans, <eob> most no bigger than the size <eol> of your pupils, <eob> are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet. <eob>
When plankton concentrations <eol> become patchy, <eob> manta rays feed alone <eob> and they somersault themselves <eol> backwards again and again, <eob> very much like a puppy chasing its own tail. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
However, when plankton densities increase, <eob> the mantas line up head-to-tail to form <eol> these long feeding chains, <eob> and any tasty morsel <eol> that escapes the first or second manta in line <eob> is surely to be gobbled up <eol> by the next or the one after. <eob>
As plankton levels peak in the bay, <eob> the mantas swim <eol> closer and closer together <eob> in a unique behavior <eol> we call cyclone feeding. <eob>
And as they swirl <eol> in tight formation, <eob> this multi-step column <eol> of mantas <eob> creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton <eob> right into the mantas' cavernous mouths. <eob>
The experience of diving amongst such <eol> masses of hundreds of rays <eob> is truly unforgettable. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
When I first photographed Hanifaru, <eob> the site enjoyed no protection <eob> and was threatened by development. <eob>
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, <eob> my images eventually helped Hanifaru <eob> become a marine-protected area. <eob>
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, <eob> they once hunted <eol> these manta rays <eob> to make traditional drums from their skins. <eob>
Today, they are the most ardent <eol> conservation champions <eob> and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy <eob> in excess of 8 million dollars <eol> every single year. <eob>
I have always wanted <eol> to travel back in time <eob> to an era where maps <eol> were mostly blank <eob> or they read, "There be dragons." <eob> And today, the closest I've come <eol> is visiting remote atolls <eob> in the western Indian Ocean. <eob>
Far, far away from shipping lanes <eol> and fishing fleets, <eob> diving into these waters is a poignant reminder <eob> of what our oceans once looked like. <eob>
Very few people have heard <eol> of Bassas da India, <eob> a tiny speck of coral <eob> in the Mozambique Channel. <eob>
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier <eob> and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground <eob> for Galapagos sharks. <eob>
These sharks are anything <eol> but shy, even during the day. <eob>
I had a bit of a hunch <eol> that they'd be even bolder <eob> and more abundant at night. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
Never before have I encountered <eob> so many sharks on a single coral outcrop. <eob>
Capturing and sharing moments like this -- <eob> that reminds me why I chose my path. <eob>
Earlier this year, I was on assignment <eob> for National Geographic Magazine <eob> in Baja California. <eob>
And about halfway down the peninsula <eol> on the Pacific side <eob> lies San Ignacio Lagoon, <eob> a critical calving ground <eol> for gray whales. <eob>
For 100 years, this coast <eol> was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, <eob> where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, <eob> leaving only a few hundred survivors. <eob>
Today the descendents of these same whales <eob> nudge their youngsters to the surface <eob> to play and even interact with us. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
This species truly has made <eol> a remarkable comeback. <eob>
Now, on the other side of the peninsula <eol> lies Cabo Pulmo, <eob> a sleepy fishing village. <eob>
Decades of overfishing <eol> had brought them close to collapse. <eob>
In 1995, local fisherman <eol> convinced the authorities <eob> to proclaim their waters <eol> a marine reserve. <eob>
But what happened next <eol> was nothing short of miraculous. <eob>
In 2005, after only a single <eol> decade of protection, <eob> scientists measured the largest recovery <eol> of fish ever recorded. <eob>
But don't take my word for it -- <eol> come with me. <eob>
On a single breath, <eol> swim with me in deep, <eob> into one of the largest <eol> and densest schools of fish <eob> I have ever encountered. <eob>
We all have the ability <eol> to be creators of hope. <eob>
And through my photography, <eob> I want to pass on the message <eol> that it is not too late for our oceans. <eob>
And particularly, I want to focus <eol> on nature's resilience <eob> in the face of 7.3 billion people. <eob>
My hope is that in the future, <eob> I will have to search much, much harder <eob> to make photographs like this, <eob> while creating images that showcase <eob> our respectful coexistence <eol> with the ocean. <eob> Those will hopefully become <eol> an everyday occurrence for me. <eob>
To thrive and survive in my profession, <eob> you really have to be a hopeless optimist. <eob>
And I always operate on the assumption <eob> that the next great picture <eol> that will effect change <eob> is right around the corner, <eob> behind the next coral head, <eob> inside the next lagoon <eob> or possibly, in the one after it. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
All right, I want to see a show of hands: <eob> how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook <eob> because they said something offensive <eol> about politics or religion, <eob> childcare, food? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And how many of you know <eol> at least one person that you avoid <eob> because you just don't want to talk to them? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, it used to be that in order <eol> to have a polite conversation, <eob> we just had to follow the advice <eol> of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": <eob> Stick to the weather and your health. <eob>
But these days, with climate change <eol> and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
are not safe either. <eob> So this world that we live in, <eob> this world in which every conversation <eob> has the potential <eol> to devolve into an argument, <eob> where our politicians can't speak <eol> to one another <eob> and where even the most trivial of issues <eob> have someone fighting both passionately <eol> for it and against it, it's not normal. <eob>
Pew Research did a study <eol> of 10,000 American adults, <eob> and they found that at this moment, <eol> we are more polarized, <eob> we are more divided, <eob> than we ever have been in history. <eob>
We're less likely to compromise, <eob> which means we're not <eol> listening to each other. <eob>
And we make decisions about where to live, <eob> who to marry and even who our friends <eol> are going to be, <eob> based on what we already believe. <eob>
Again, that means we're not listening <eol> to each other. <eob>
A conversation requires a balance <eol> between talking and listening, <eob> and somewhere along the way, <eol> we lost that balance. <eob>
Now, part of that is due to technology. <eob>
The smartphones that you all <eol> either have in your hands <eob> or close enough that you <eol> could grab them really quickly. <eob>
According to Pew Research, <eob> about a third of American teenagers <eol> send more than a hundred texts a day. <eob>
And many of them, almost most of them, <eol> are more likely to text their friends <eob> than they are to talk <eol> to them face to face. <eob>
There's this great piece in The Atlantic. <eob> It was written by a high school <eol> teacher named Paul Barnwell. <eob>
And he gave his kids <eol> a communication project. <eob>
He wanted to teach them how to speak <eol> on a specific subject without using notes. <eob>
And he said this: "I came to realize..." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"I came to realize <eol> that conversational competence <eob> might be the single most overlooked <eol> skill we fail to teach. <eob>
Kids spend hours each day engaging <eol> with ideas and each other through screens, <eob> but rarely do they have an opportunity <eob> to hone their interpersonal <eol> communications skills. <eob>
It might sound like a funny question, <eol> but we have to ask ourselves: <eob> Is there any 21st-century skill <eob> more important than being able to sustain coherent, <eol> confident conversation?" <eob>
Now, I make my living talking to people: <eob> Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, <eob> billionaires, kindergarten teachers, <eob> heads of state, plumbers. <eob>
I talk to people that I like. <eol> I talk to people that I don't like. <eob>
I talk to some people that I disagree <eol> with deeply on a personal level. <eob>
But I still have <eol> a great conversation with them. <eob>
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes <eol> or so teaching you how to talk <eob> and how to listen. <eob>
Many of you have already heard <eol> a lot of advice on this, <eob> things like look the person in the eye, <eob> think of interesting topics <eol> to discuss in advance, <eob> look, nod and smile to show <eol> that you're paying attention, <eob> repeat back what you just heard <eol> or summarize it. <eob> So I want you to forget all of that. <eob> It is crap. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is no reason to learn <eol> how to show you're paying attention <eob> if you are in fact paying attention. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I actually use the exact <eol> same skills as a professional interviewer <eob> that I do in regular life. <eob>
So, I'm going to teach you <eol> how to interview people, <eob> and that's actually going to help you learn <eol> how to be better conversationalists. <eob>
Learn to have a conversation <eob> without wasting your time, <eol> without getting bored, <eob> and, please God, <eol> without offending anybody. <eob>
We've all had really great conversations. <eob>
We've had them before. <eob>
We know what it's like. <eob>
The kind of conversation where you walk <eol> away feeling engaged and inspired, <eob> or where you feel like <eol> you've made a real connection <eob> or you've been perfectly understood. <eob>
There is no reason <eob> why most of your interactions <eol> can't be like that. <eob>
So I have 10 basic rules. <eob>
I'm going to walk <eol> you through all of them, <eob> but honestly, if you just choose <eol> one of them and master it, <eob> you'll already enjoy better conversations. <eob>
Number one: Don't multitask. <eob>
And I don't mean just set down <eol> your cell phone <eob> or your tablet or your car keys <eol> or whatever is in your hand. <eob> I mean, be present. <eob> Be in that moment. <eob>
Don't think about your argument <eol> you had with your boss. <eob> Don't think about what you're going <eol> to have for dinner. <eob>
If you want to get out <eol> of the conversation, <eob> get out of the conversation, <eob> but don't be half in it <eol> and half out of it. <eob>
Number two: Don't pontificate. <eob>
If you want to state your opinion <eob> without any opportunity for response <eol> or argument or pushback or growth, <eob> write a blog. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, there's a really good reason <eol> why I don't allow pundits on my show: <eob> Because they're really boring. <eob>
If they're conservative, they're going <eol> to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. <eob>
If they're liberal, <eol> they're going to hate <eob> big banks and oil corporations <eol> and Dick Cheney. <eob> Totally predictable. <eob> And you don't want to be like that. <eob>
You need to enter every conversation <eol> assuming that you have something to learn. <eob>
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said <eob> that true listening requires <eol> a setting aside of oneself. <eob>
And sometimes that means <eol> setting aside your personal opinion. <eob>
He said that sensing this acceptance, <eob> the speaker will become <eol> less and less vulnerable <eob> and more and more likely to open up <eol> the inner recesses <eob> of his or her mind to the listener. <eob>
Again, assume that you have <eol> something to learn. <eob>
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet <eol> knows something that you don't." <eob> I put it this way: <eob> Everybody is an expert in something. <eob>
Number three: Use open-ended questions. <eob>
In this case, take a cue from journalists. <eob>
Start your questions with who, what, <eol> when, where, why or how. <eob>
If you put in a complicated question, <eol> you're going to get a simple answer out. <eob>
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" <eob> you're going to respond <eol> to the most powerful word in that sentence, <eob> which is "terrified," and the answer <eol> is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." <eob> "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." <eob> Let them describe it. <eob>
They're the ones that know. <eob>
Try asking them things <eol> like, "What was that like?" <eob> "How did that feel?" <eob> Because then they might have to stop <eol> for a moment and think about it, <eob> and you're going to get <eol> a much more interesting response. <eob>
Number four: Go with the flow. <eob>
That means thoughts will come into your mind <eob> and you need to let them go <eol> out of your mind. <eob>
We've heard interviews often <eob> in which a guest is talking for several minutes <eob> and then the host comes back in and asks a question <eob> which seems like it comes out of nowhere, <eol> or it's already been answered. <eob>
That means the host probably <eol> stopped listening two minutes ago <eob> because he thought of this really clever question, <eob> and he was just bound <eol> and determined to say that. <eob>
And we do the exact same thing. <eob>
We're sitting there <eol> having a conversation with someone, <eob> and then we remember that time <eol> that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And we stop listening. <eob> Stories and ideas <eol> are going to come to you. <eob>
You need to let them come and let them go. <eob>
Number five: If you don't know, <eol> say that you don't know. <eob>
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, <eob> are much more aware <eol> that they're going on the record, <eob> and so they're more careful <eol> about what they claim to be an expert in <eob> and what they claim to know for sure. <eob> Do that. Err on the side of caution. <eob>
Talk should not be cheap. <eob>
Number six: Don't equate <eol> your experience with theirs. <eob>
If they're talking about having lost <eol> a family member, <eob> don't start talking about the time <eol> you lost a family member. <eob>
If they're talking about the trouble <eol> they're having at work, <eob> don't tell them about how much you hate your job. <eob>
It's not the same. It is never the same. <eob>
All experiences are individual. <eob>
And, more importantly, <eol> it is not about you. <eob>
You don't need to take that moment <eol> to prove how amazing you are <eob> or how much you've suffered. <eob>
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking <eol> once what his IQ was, and he said, <eob> "I have no idea. <eob>
People who brag about their <eol> IQs are losers. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Conversations are not <eol> a promotional opportunity. <eob>
Number seven: <eob> Try not to repeat yourself. <eob>
It's condescending, <eol> and it's really boring, <eob> and we tend to do it a lot. <eob>
Especially in work conversations <eol> or in conversations with our kids, <eob> we have a point to make, <eob> so we just keep rephrasing it <eol> over and over. <eob>
Don't do that. <eob>
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. <eob>
Frankly, people don't care <eob> about the years, the names, <eob> the dates, all those details <eob> that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. <eob> They don't care. <eob>
What they care about is you. <eob> They care about what you're like, <eob> what you have in common. <eob> So forget the details. Leave them out. <eob>
Number nine: <eob> This is not the last one, <eol> but it is the most important one. <eob> Listen. <eob> I cannot tell you how many <eol> really important people have said <eob> that listening is perhaps the most, <eol> the number one most important skill <eob> that you could develop. <eob>
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, <eob> "If your mouth is open, <eol> you're not learning." <eob> And Calvin Coolidge said, <eol> "No man ever listened his way out of a job." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Why do we not listen to each other? <eob>
Number one, we'd rather talk. <eob>
When I'm talking, I'm in control. <eob>
I don't have to hear anything <eol> I'm not interested in. <eob>
I'm the center of attention. <eob>
I can bolster my own identity. <eob>
But there's another reason: <eob> We get distracted. <eob>
The average person talks <eol> at about 225 word per minute, <eob> but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. <eob>
So our minds are filling <eol> in those other 275 words. <eob>
And look, I know, it takes effort <eol> and energy <eob> to actually pay attention to someone, <eob> but if you can't do that, <eol> you're not in a conversation. <eob> You're just two people shouting <eol> out barely related sentences <eob> in the same place. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You have to listen to one another. <eob>
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. <eob> He said, "Most of us don't listen <eol> with the intent to understand. <eob>
We listen with the intent to reply." <eob>
One more rule, number 10, <eol> and it's this one: Be brief. <eob>
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; <eol> short enough to retain interest, <eob> but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister] <eob>
(Applause) <eob> All of this boils down to the same basic concept, <eol> and it is this one: <eob> Be interested in other people. <eob>
You know, I grew up <eol> with a very famous grandfather, <eob> and there was kind of a ritual in my home. <eob>
People would come over <eol> to talk to my grandparents, <eob> and after they would leave, <eob> my mother would come over <eol> to us, <eob> and she'd say, "Do you know who that was? <eob>
She was the runner-up to Miss America. <eob>
He was the mayor of Sacramento. <eob>
She won a Pulitzer Prize. <eob>
He's a Russian ballet dancer. <eob> "And I kind of grew up assuming <eob> everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. <eob>
And honestly, I think <eol> it's what makes me a better host. <eob>
I keep my mouth shut as often <eol> as I possibly can, <eob> I keep my mind open, <eob> and I'm always prepared to be amazed, <eob> and I'm never disappointed. <eob>
You do the same thing. <eob> Go out, talk to people, <eob> listen to people, <eob> and, most importantly, <eol> be prepared to be amazed. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So you go to the doctor <eol> and get some tests. <eob>
The doctor determines <eol> that you have high cholesterol <eob> and you would benefit from medication <eol> to treat it. <eob>
So you get a pillbox. <eob>
You have some confidence, <eob> your physician has some confidence <eol> that this is going to work. <eob>
The company that invented <eol> it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA. <eob>
They studied it very carefully, <eol> skeptically, they approved it. <eob>
They have a rough idea <eol> of how it works, <eob> they have a rough idea <eol> of what the side effects are. <eob> It should be OK. <eob> You have a little more of a conversation <eol> with your physician <eob> and the physician is a little worried <eol> because you've been blue, <eob> haven't felt like yourself, <eob> you haven't been able to enjoy things in life <eol> quite as much as you usually do. <eob>
Your physician says, "You know, <eol> I think you have some depression. <eob>
I'm going to have to give you <eol> another pill." <eob>
So now we're talking <eol> about two medications. <eob>
This pill also -- millions of people <eol> have taken it, <eob> the company did studies, the FDA <eol> looked at it -- all good. <eob>
Think things should go OK. <eob> Think things should go OK. <eob>
Well, wait a minute. <eob> How much have we studied <eol> these two together? <eob>
Well, it's very hard to do that. <eob>
In fact, it's not traditionally done. <eob>
We totally depend on what we call <eol> "post-marketing surveillance," <eob> after the drugs hit the market. <eob>
How can we figure out if bad <eol> things are happening <eob> between two medications? <eob> Three? Five? Seven? <eob> Ask your favorite person <eol> who has several diagnoses <eob> how many medications <eol> they're on. <eob>
Why do I care about this problem? <eob> I care about it deeply. <eob>
I'm an informatics and data <eol> science guy and really, in my opinion, <eob> the only hope -- only hope -- to understand <eol> these interactions <eob> is to leverage lots of different sources of data <eob> in order to figure out when drugs <eol> can be used together safely <eob> and when it's not so safe. <eob>
So let me tell you a data science story. <eob>
And it begins with my student Nick. <eob>
Let's call him "Nick," <eol> because that's his name. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nick was a young student. <eob> I said, "You know, Nick, <eol> we have to understand how drugs work <eob> and how they work together <eol> and how they work separately, <eob> and we don't have a great understanding. <eob> But the FDA has made available <eol> an amazing database. <eob> It's a database of adverse events. <eob>
They literally put on the web -- <eob> publicly available, <eol> you could all download it right now -- <eob> hundreds of thousands <eol> of adverse event reports <eob> from patients, doctors, <eol> companies, pharmacists. <eob>
And these reports are pretty simple: <eob> it has all the diseases <eol> that the patient has, <eob> all the drugs that they're on, <eob> and all the adverse events, <eol> or side effects, that they experience. <eob>
It is not all of the adverse events <eol> that are occurring in America today, <eob> but it's hundreds and hundreds <eol> of thousands of drugs. <eob>
So I said to Nick, <eob> "Let's think about glucose. <eob>
Glucose is very important, and we know <eol> it's involved with diabetes. <eob>
Let's see if we can understand <eol> glucose response. <eob> I sent Nick off. Nick came back. <eob>
"Russ," he said, <eob> "I've created a classifier <eol> that can look at the side effects of a drug <eob> based on looking at this database, <eob> and can tell you whether that drug <eol> is likely to change glucose or not." <eob>
He did it. It was very simple, in a way. <eob>
He took all the drugs <eol> that were known to change glucose <eob> and a bunch of drugs <eol> that don't change glucose, <eob> and said, "What's the difference <eol> in their side effects? <eob> Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?" <eob> All those things conspired <eol> to give him a really good predictor. <eob> He said, "Russ, I can predict <eol> with 93 percent accuracy <eob> when a drug will change glucose." <eob>
I said, "Nick, that's great." <eob> He's a young student, <eol> you have to build his confidence. <eob> "But Nick, there's a problem. <eob>
It's that every physician in the world <eol> knows all the drugs that change glucose, <eob> because it's core to our practice. <eob>
So it's great, good job, <eol> but not really that interesting, <eob> definitely not publishable." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He said, "I know, Russ. <eob>
I thought you might say that. <eol> "Nick is smart." <eob> I thought you might say that, <eol> so I did one other experiment. <eob>
I looked at people in this database <eol> who were on two drugs, <eob> and I looked for signals <eol> similar, glucose-changing signals, <eob> for people taking two drugs, <eob> where each drug alone <eol> did not change glucose, <eob> but together I saw a strong signal." <eob>
And I said, "Oh! You're clever. <eol> Good idea. Show me the list." <eob> And there's a bunch of drugs, <eol> not very exciting. <eob>
But what caught my eye was, <eol> on the list there were two drugs: <eob> paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; <eob> and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication. <eob>
And I said, "Huh. There are millions <eol> of Americans on those two drugs." <eob> In fact, we learned later, <eob> 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million <eol> on pravastatin, <eob> and a million, we estimated, on both. <eob>
So that's a million people <eob> who might be having some problems <eol> with their glucose <eob> if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo <eol> that he did in the FDA database <eob> actually holds up. <eob> But I said, "It's still not publishable, <eob> because I love what you did <eol> with the mumbo jumbo, <eob> with the machine learning, <eob> but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have." <eob> So we have to do something else. <eob>
Let's go into the Stanford <eol> electronic medical record. <eob>
We have a copy of it <eol> that's OK for research, <eob> we removed identifying information. <eob> And I said, "Let's see <eol> if people on these two drugs <eob> have problems with their glucose." <eob>
Now there are thousands and thousands of people <eob> in the Stanford medical records <eol> that take paroxetine and pravastatin. <eob>
But we needed special patients. <eob> We needed patients who were <eol> on one of them and had a glucose measurement, <eob> then got the second one and had another <eol> glucose measurement, <eob> all within a reasonable period of time -- <eol> something like two months. <eob>
And when we did that, <eol> we found 10 patients. <eob>
However, eight out of the 10 <eol> had a bump in their glucose <eob> when they got the second P -- <eol> we call this P and P -- <eob> when they got the second P. <eob> Either one could be first, <eol> the second one comes up, <eob> glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter. <eob>
Just as a reminder, <eob> you walk around normally, <eol> if you're not diabetic, <eob> with a glucose of around 90. <eob> And if it gets up to 120, 125, <eob> your doctor begins to think <eol> about a potential diagnosis of diabetes. <eob> So a 20 bump -- pretty significant. <eob>
I said, "Nick, this is very cool. <eob>
But, I'm sorry, we still <eol> don't have a paper, <eob> because this is 10 patients <eol> and -- give me a break -- <eob> it's not enough patients." <eob>
So we said, what can we do? <eob> And we said, let's call our friends <eol> at Harvard and Vanderbilt, <eob> who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, <eob> who also have electronic medical records <eol> similar to ours. <eob>
Let's see if they can find similar patients <eob> with the one P, the other P, <eol> the glucose measurements <eob> in that range that we need. <eob>
God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week <eol> found 40 such patients, <eob> same trend. <eob>
Harvard found 100 patients, <eob> same trend. <eob>
So at the end, we had 150 patients <eol> from three diverse medical centers <eob> that were telling us that patients <eol> getting these two drugs <eob> were having their glucose bump <eol> somewhat significantly. <eob>
More interestingly, <eol> we had left out diabetics, <eob> because diabetics already have <eol> messed up glucose. <eob>
When we looked at the glucose <eol> of diabetics, <eob> it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. <eob>
This was a big deal, and we said, <eol> "We've got to publish this." <eob> We submitted the paper. <eob>
It was all data evidence, <eob> data from the FDA, data from Stanford, <eob> data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard. <eob>
We had not done a single real experiment. <eob>
But we were nervous. <eob> So Nick, while the paper was in review, <eol> went to the lab. <eob>
We found somebody <eol> who knew about lab stuff. <eob>
I don't do that. <eob>
I take care of patients, <eol> but I don't do pipettes. <eob>
They taught us how to feed mice drugs. <eob>
We took mice and we gave them <eol> one P, paroxetine. <eob> We gave some other mice pravastatin. <eob>
And we gave a third group of mice <eol> both of them. <eob> And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter <eob> in the mice. <eob>
So the paper was accepted based <eol> on the informatics evidence alone, <eob> but we added a little note at the end, <eob> saying, oh by the way, <eol> if you give these to mice, it goes up. <eob>
That was great, and the story <eol> could have ended there. <eob>
But I still have six and a half minutes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we were sitting around <eol> thinking about all of this, <eob> and I don't remember <eol> who thought of it, but somebody said, <eob> "I wonder if patients <eol> who are taking these two drugs <eob> are noticing side effects <eol> of hyperglycemia. <eob>
They could and they should. <eob>
How would we ever determine that?" <eob> We said, well, what do you do? <eob>
You go to Google <eob> and type in the two drugs <eol> you're taking or the one drug you're taking, <eob> and you type in "side effects." <eob> What are you experiencing? <eob>
So we said OK, <eob> let's ask Google if they will share <eol> their search logs with us, <eob> so that we can look at the search logs <eob> and see if patients are doing <eol> these kinds of searches. <eob>
Google, I am sorry to say, <eol> denied our request. <eob>
So I was bummed. <eob>
I was at a dinner with a colleague <eol> who works at Microsoft Research <eob> and I said, "We wanted to do this study, <eob> Google said no, it's kind of a bummer." <eob> He said, "Well, we have <eol> the Bing searches." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> That's great. <eob> Now I felt like I was -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I felt like I was talking to Nick again. <eob>
He works for one of the largest <eol> companies in the world, <eob> and I'm already trying <eol> to make him feel better. <eob>
But he said, "No, Russ -- <eol> you might not understand. <eob>
We not only have Bing searches, <eob> but if you use Internet Explorer <eol> to do searches at Google, <eob> Yahoo, Bing, any... <eob> Then, for 18 months, <eol> we keep that data for research purposes only. <eob> "I said," Now you're talking! <eob> "This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft. <eob>
So we did a study <eob> where we defined 50 words <eol> that a regular person might type in <eob> if they're having hyperglycemia, <eob> like "fatigue," "loss <eol> of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" -- <eob> forgive me, but that's one of the things <eol> you might type in. <eob>
So we had 50 phrases <eol> that we called the "diabetes words." <eob> And we did first a baseline. <eob>
And it turns out <eol> that about .5 to one percent <eob> of all searches on the Internet <eol> involve one of those words. <eob>
So that's our baseline rate. <eob>
If people type in "paroxetine" <eol> or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- <eob> and one of those words, <eob> the rate goes up to about two percent <eol> of diabetes-type words, <eob> if you already know that <eol> there's that "paroxetine" word. <eob>
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up <eol> to about three percent from the baseline. <eob>
If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" <eol> are present in the query, <eob> it goes up to 10 percent, <eob> a huge three- to four-fold increase <eob> in those searches with the two drugs <eol> that we were interested in, <eob> and diabetes-type words <eol> or hyperglycemia-type words. <eob>
We published this, <eob> and it got some attention. <eob>
The reason it deserves attention <eob> is that patients are telling us <eol> their side effects indirectly <eob> through their searches. <eob>
We brought this to the attention <eol> of the FDA. <eob> They were interested. <eob> They have set up social <eol> media surveillance programs <eob> to collaborate with Microsoft, <eob> which had a nice infrastructure <eol> for doing this, and others, <eob> to look at Twitter feeds, <eob> to look at Facebook feeds, <eob> to look at search logs, <eob> to try to see early signs that drugs, <eol> either individually or together, <eob> are causing problems. <eob> What do I take from this? <eob>
Why tell this story? <eob> Well, first of all, <eob> we have now the promise of big data <eol> and medium-sized data <eob> to help us understand drug interactions <eob> and really, fundamentally, drug actions. <eob> How do drugs work? <eob> This will create and has created <eol> a new ecosystem <eob> for understanding how drugs work <eol> and to optimize their use. <eob>
Nick went on; he's a professor <eol> at Columbia now. <eob>
He did this in his PhD <eol> for hundreds of pairs of drugs. <eob>
He found several very important interactions, <eob> and so we replicated this <eob> and we showed that this is a way <eol> that really works <eob> for finding drug-drug interactions. <eob>
However, there's a couple of things. <eob>
We don't just use pairs <eol> of drugs at a time. <eob>
As I said before, there are patients <eol> on three, five, seven, nine drugs. <eob>
Have they been studied with respect <eol> to their nine-way interaction? <eob>
Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, <eob> but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, <eob> being taken by the same patient, <eob> perhaps interacting with each other <eob> in ways that either makes them <eol> more effective or less effective <eob> or causes side effects that are unexpected? <eob>
We really have no idea. <eob>
It's a blue sky, <eol> open field for us to use data <eob> to try to understand <eol> the interaction of drugs. <eob>
Two more lessons: <eob> I want you to think about the power <eol> that we were able to generate <eob> with the data from people <eol> who had volunteered their adverse reactions <eob> through their pharmacists, through themselves, <eol> through their doctors, <eob> the people <eob> who allowed <eol> the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, <eob> to be used for research. <eob>
People are worried about data. <eob>
They're worried about their privacy <eol> and security -- they should be. <eob>
We need secure systems. <eob>
But we can't have a system <eol> that closes that data off, <eob> because it is too rich of a source <eob> of inspiration, innovation and discovery <eob> for new things in medicine. <eob>
And the final thing I want to say is, <eob> in this case we found two drugs <eol> and it was a little bit of a sad story. <eob>
The two drugs actually <eol> caused problems. <eob> They increased glucose. <eob> They could throw somebody into diabetes <eob> who would otherwise not be in diabetes, <eob> and so you would want to use the two drugs <eol> very carefully together, <eob> perhaps not together, <eob> make different choices when you're prescribing. <eob>
But there was another possibility. <eob>
We could have found two drugs <eol> or three drugs <eob> that were interacting <eol> in a beneficial way. <eob>
We could have found new effects of drugs <eob> that neither of them has alone, <eob> but together, instead of causing a side effect, <eob> they could be a new and novel treatment <eob> for diseases that don't have treatments <eob> or where the treatments are not effective. <eob>
If we think about drug treatment today, <eob> all the major breakthroughs -- <eob> for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes -- <eob> it's always a cocktail of drugs. <eob>
And so the upside here, <eob> and the subject for a different <eol> TED Talk on a different day, <eob> is how can we use the same data sources <eob> to find good effects of drugs in combination <eob> that will provide us new treatments, <eob> new insights into how drugs work <eob> and enable us to take care <eol> of our patients even better? <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm a textile artist <eob> most widely known for starting <eol> the yarn bombing movement. <eob>
Yarn bombing is when you take <eol> knitted or crocheted material <eob> out into the urban environment, <eol> graffiti-style -- <eob> or, more specifically, <eob> without permission and unsanctioned. <eob>
But when I started this over 10 years ago, <eob> I didn't have a word for it, <eob> I didn't have any <eol> ambitious notions about it, <eob> I had no visions of grandeur. <eob>
All I wanted to see was something <eol> warm and fuzzy and human-like <eob> on the cold, steel, gray facade <eol> that I looked at everyday. <eob>
So I wrapped the door handle. <eob>
I call this the Alpha Piece. <eob>
Little did I know that this tiny piece <eol> would change the course of my life. <eob>
So clearly the reaction was interesting. <eob>
It intrigued me and I thought, <eol> "What else could I do?" <eob> Could I do something in the public domain <eol> that would get the same reaction? <eob>
So I wrapped the stop sign pole <eol> near my house. <eob>
The reaction was wild. <eob>
People would park their cars <eob> and get out of their cars and stare at it, <eob> and scratch their heads and stare at it, <eob> and take pictures of it <eol> and take pictures next to it, <eob> and all of that was really exciting to me <eob> and I wanted to do every stop sign pole <eol> in the neighborhood. <eob>
And the more that I did, <eol> the stronger the reaction. <eob>
So at this point I'm smitten. <eob> I'm hooked. <eob> This was all seductive. <eob> I found my new passion <eob> and the urban environment <eol> was my playground. <eob>
So this is some of my early work. <eob>
I was very curious about this idea <eol> of enhancing the ordinary, <eob> the mundane, even the ugly, <eob> and not taking away its identity <eol> or its functionality <eob> but just giving it a well-tailored <eol> suit out of knitting. <eob>
And this was fun for me. <eob>
It was really fun <eol> to take inanimate objects <eob> and have them come to life. <eob>
So... <eob> I think we all see the humor in this, <eob> but — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was at a point where <eol> I wanted to take it seriously. <eob>
I wanted to analyze it. <eob> I wanted to know why I was letting <eol> this take over my life, <eob> why I was passionate about it, <eob> why were other people <eol> reacting so strongly to it. <eob>
And I realized something. <eob>
We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, <eob> but we still crave and desire something <eol> that's relatable. <eob>
I think we've all become desensitized <eob> by our overdeveloped <eol> cities that we live in, <eob> and billboards and advertisements, <eob> and giant parking lots, <eob> and we don't even complain <eol> about that stuff anymore. <eob>
So when you stumble upon <eob> a stop sign pole <eol> that's wrapped in knitting <eob> and it seems so out of place <eob> and then gradually -- weirdly -- <eob> you find a connection to it, <eob> that is the moment. <eob>
That is the moment I love <eob> and <eob> that is the moment <eob> I love to share with others. <eob>
So at this point, my curiosity grew. <eob>
It went from the fire hydrants <eol> and the stop sign poles <eob> to what else can I do with this material. <eob>
Can I do something big <eol> and large-scale and insurmountable? <eob>
So that's when the bus happened. <eob>
This was a real game changer for me. <eob>
I'll always have a soft spot <eol> in my heart for this one. <eob>
At this point, people <eol> were recognizing my work <eob> but there wasn't much out there <eob> that was wrapped in knitting <eol> that was large-scale, <eob> and this definitely was the first <eol> city bus to be wrapped in knitting. <eob>
So at this point, I'm experiencing, <eob> or I'm witnessing something interesting. <eob>
I may have started yarn bombing <eol> but I certainly don't own it anymore. <eob>
It had reached global status. <eob> People from all over the world <eol> were doing this. <eob>
And I know this because I would travel <eol> to certain parts of the world <eob> that I'd never been to, <eob> and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole <eol> and I knew I didn't wrap it. <eob>
So as I pursued <eol> my own goals with my art -- <eob> this is a lot of my recent work -- <eob> so was yarn bombing. <eob> Yarn bombing was also growing. <eob> And that experience showed me <eol> the hidden power of this craft <eob> and showed me <eob> that there was this common language <eol> I had with the rest of the world. <eob>
It was through this granny hobby -- <eob> this unassuming hobby -- <eob> that I found commonality with people <eob> that I never thought <eol> I'd have a connection with. <eob>
So as I tell my story today, <eob> I'd also like to convey to you <eob> that hidden power can be found <eol> in the most unassuming places, <eob> and we all possess skills <eol> that are just waiting to be discovered. <eob>
If you think about our hands, <eol> these tools that are connected to us, <eob> and what they're capable of doing -- <eob> building houses and furniture, <eob> and painting giant murals -- <eob> and most of the time <eol> we hold a controller or a cell phone. <eob>
And I'm totally guilty of this as well. <eob>
But if you think about it, <eob> what would happen <eol> if you put those things down? <eob> What would you make? <eol> What would you create with your own hands? <eob>
A lot of people think <eol> that I am a master knitter <eob> but I actually couldn't knit <eol> a sweater to save my life. <eob>
But I did something <eol> interesting with knitting <eob> that had never been done before. <eob>
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist <eob> in the sense that I wasn't <eol> formally trained to do this -- <eob> I'm a math major actually. <eob>
So I didn't think <eol> this was in the cards for me, <eob> but I also know that I didn't <eol> stumble upon this. <eob>
And when this happened to me, <eol> I held on tight, <eob> I fought for it and I'm proud to say <eol> that I am a working artist today. <eob>
So as we ponder the future, <eob> know that your future might not <eol> be so seamless. <eob>
And one day, you might <eol> be as bored as I was <eob> and knit a door handle <eol> to change your world forever. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So a while ago, <eol> I tried an experiment. <eob> For one year, I would say yes <eol> to all the things that scared me. <eob>
Anything that made me nervous, <eol> took me out of my comfort zone, <eob> I forced myself to say yes to. <eob>
Did I want to speak in public? <eob>
No, but yes. <eob>
Did I want to be on live TV? <eob>
No, but yes. <eob>
Did I want to try acting? <eob>
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes. <eob>
And a crazy thing happened: <eob> the very act of doing the thing <eol> that scared me <eob> undid the fear, <eob> made it not scary. <eob>
My fear of public speaking, <eol> my social anxiety, poof, gone. <eob>
It's amazing, the power of one word. <eob> "Yes" changed my life. <eob> "Yes" changed me. <eob>
But there was one particular yes <eob> that affected my life <eol> in the most profound way, <eob> in a way I never imagined, <eob> and it started with a question <eol> from my toddler. <eob>
I have these three amazing daughters, <eol> Harper, Beckett and Emerson, <eob> and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey." <eob> as though she's a Southern waitress. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk <eol> for my sippy cup." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The Southern waitress asked me <eol> to play with her one evening <eob> when I was on my way somewhere, <eol> and I said, "Yes." <eob> And that yes was the beginning <eol> of a new way of life for my family. <eob>
I made a vow that from now on, <eob> every time one of my children <eol> asks me to play, <eob> no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, <eob> I say yes, every single time. <eob> Almost. I'm not perfect at it, <eol> but I try hard to practice it. <eob>
And it's had a magical effect on me, <eob> on my children, on our family. <eob>
But it's also had a stunning side effect, <eob> and it wasn't until recently <eol> that I fully understood it, <eob> that I understood that saying yes <eol> to playing with my children <eob> likely saved my career. <eob>
See, I have what most people <eol> would call a dream job. <eob> I'm a writer. I imagine. <eol> I make stuff up for a living. <eob> Dream job. <eob> No. <eob> I'm a titan. <eob> Dream job. <eob> I create television. I executive produce television. <eob>
I make television, a great deal <eol> of television. <eob>
In one way or another, this TV season, <eob> I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours <eol> of programming to the world. <eob>
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV — <eob>
Three shows in production at a time, <eol> sometimes four. <eob>
Each show creates hundreds of jobs <eol> that didn't exist before. <eob>
The budget for one episode <eol> of network television <eob> can be anywhere from three <eol> to six million dollars. <eob>
Let's just say five. <eob>
A new episode made every nine <eol> days times four shows, <eob> so every nine <eob> days that's 20 million dollars <eol> worth of television, <eob> four television programs, 70 hours of TV, <eob> three shows in production <eol> at a time, sometimes four, <eob> 16 episodes going on at all times: <eob> 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," <eob> 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," <eob> 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV, <eob> that's 350 million dollars for a season. <eob>
In America, my television shows <eob> are back to back to back <eol> on Thursday night. <eob>
Around the world, my shows air <eol> in 256 territories in 67 languages <eob> for an audience <eol> of 30 million people. <eob>
My brain is global, <eob> and 45 hours of that 70 hours <eol> of TV are shows I personally created <eob> and not just produced, so <eol> on top of everything else, <eob> I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, <eob> to gather my fans around the campfire <eob> and tell my stories. <eob>
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, <eob> three shows in production <eol> at a time, sometimes four, <eob> 350 million dollars, campfires <eol> burning all over the world. <eob>
You know who else is doing that? <eob> Nobody, so like I said, <eob> I'm a titan. <eob> Dream job. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you. <eob>
I tell you this because I know what you think <eol> of when you hear the word "writer." <eob> I tell you this so that all of you out <eol> there who work so hard, <eob> whether you run a company <eol> or a country or a classroom <eob> or a store or a home, <eob> take me seriously <eol> when I talk about working, <eob> so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, <eob> so you'll hear me when I say <eob> that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming. <eob>
It's all job, all work, all reality, <eol> all blood, all sweat, no tears. <eob>
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it. <eob>
When I'm hard at work, <eol> when I'm deep in it, <eob> there is no other feeling. <eob>
For me, my work is at all times <eol> building a nation out of thin air. <eob>
It is manning the troops. <eob>
It is painting a canvas. <eob>
It is hitting every high note. <eob>
It is running a marathon. <eob>
It is being Beyoncé. <eob>
And it is all of those things <eol> at the same time. <eob> I love working. <eob> It is creative and mechanical <eol> and exhausting and exhilarating <eob> and hilarious and disturbing <eol> and clinical and maternal <eob> and cruel and judicious, <eob> and what makes it all so good is the hum. <eob>
There is some kind of shift inside me <eol> when the work gets good. <eob>
A hum begins in my brain, <eob> and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds <eol> like the open road, <eob> and I could drive it forever. <eob>
And a lot of people, <eol> when I try to explain the hum, <eob> they assume that I'm talking <eol> about the writing, <eob> that my writing brings me joy. <eob>
And don't get me wrong, it does. <eob>
But the hum -- <eob> it wasn't until I started making television <eob> that I started working, working and making <eob> and building and creating and collaborating, <eob> that I discovered <eol> this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum. <eob>
The hum is more than writing. <eob>
The hum is action and activity. <eob>
The hum is a drug. <eob>
The hum is music. The hum <eol> is light and air. <eob>
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear. <eob>
And when you have a hum like that, <eob> you can't help but strive for greatness. <eob>
That feeling, <eob> you can't help but strive for greatness <eob> at any cost. <eob>
That's called the hum. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic. <eob>
Maybe it's called genius. <eob>
Maybe it's called ego. <eob>
Maybe it's just fear of failure. <eob>
I don't know. <eob>
I just know that I'm not <eol> built for failure, <eob> and I just know that I love the hum. <eob>
I just know that I want to tell you <eol> I'm a titan, <eob> and I know that I don't want to question it. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> the more successful I become, <eob> the more shows, the more episodes, <eol> the more barriers broken, <eob> the more work there is to do, <eob> the more balls in the air, <eob> the more eyes on me, <eol> the more history stares, <eob> the more expectations there are. <eob>
The more I work to be successful, <eob> the more I need to work. <eob>
And what did I say about work? <eob> I love working, right? <eob> The nation I'm building, the marathon <eol> I'm running, <eob> the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, <eob> the hum, the hum. <eob>
I like that hum. <eob>
I love that hum. <eob>
I need that hum. <eob>
I am that hum. <eob>
Am I nothing but that hum? <eob>
And then the hum stopped. <eob>
Overworked, overused, <eob> overdone, burned out. <eob> The hum stopped. <eob>
Now, my three daughters <eol> are used to the truth <eob> that their mother is a single <eol> working titan. <eob>
Harper tells people, <eob> "My mom won't be there, <eol> but you can text my nanny." <eob> And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting <eol> to go to ShondaLand." <eob> They're children of a titan. <eob>
They're baby titans. <eob>
They were 12, 3, and 1 <eol> when the hum stopped. <eob>
The hum of the engine died. <eob>
I stopped loving work. <eob>
I couldn't restart the engine. <eob> The hum would not come back. <eob>
My hum was broken. <eob>
I was doing the same things <eol> I always did, all the same titan work, <eob> 15-hour days, working <eol> straight through the weekends, <eob> no regrets, never surrender, <eol> a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, <eob> full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever. <eob>
But there was no hum. <eob>
Inside me was silence. <eob>
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, <eob> three shows in production <eol> at a time, sometimes four. <eob>
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, <eob> three shows in production at a time... <eob> I was the perfect titan. <eob>
I was a titan you could take <eol> home to your mother. <eob>
All the colors were the same, <eol> and I was no longer having any fun. <eob>
And it was my life. <eob>
It was all I did. <eob>
I was the hum, and the hum was me. <eob>
So what do you do when the thing you do, <eob> the work you love, starts <eol> to taste like dust? <eob>
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, <eob> "Cry me a river, <eol> stupid writer titan lady." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But you know, you do, <eob> if you make, if you work, <eol> if you love what you do, <eob> being a teacher, being a banker, <eol> being a mother, being a painter, <eob> being Bill Gates, <eob> if you simply love another person <eol> and that gives you the hum, <eob> if you know the hum, <eob> if you know what the hum feels like, <eol> if you have been to the hum, <eob> when the hum stops, who are you? <eob> What are you? <eob> What am I? <eob> Am I still a titan? <eob>
If the song of my heart ceases <eol> to play, can I survive in the silence? <eob>
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question. <eob>
I'm on my way out the door, <eol> I'm late, and she says, <eob> "Momma, wanna play?" <eob> And I'm just about to say no, <eol> when I realize two things. <eob>
One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, <eob> and two, my Southern waitress <eol> didn't call me "honey." <eob> She's not calling everyone <eol> "honey" anymore. <eob>
When did that happen? <eob>
I'm missing it, being a titan <eol> and mourning my hum, <eob> and here she is changing <eol> right before my eyes. <eob>
And so she says, <eob> "Momma, wanna play?" <eob> And I say, "Yes." <eob> There's nothing special about it. <eob>
We play, and we're joined by her sisters, <eob> and there's a lot of laughing, <eob> and I give a dramatic <eol> reading from the book Everybody Poops. <eob>
Nothing out of the ordinary. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And yet, it is extraordinary, <eob> because in my pain and my panic, <eob> in the homelessness of my humlessness, <eob> I have nothing to do but pay attention. <eob> I focus. <eob> I am still. <eob> The nation I'm building, the marathon <eol> I'm running, <eob> the troops, the canvas, the high note <eol> does not exist. <eob>
All that exists are sticky fingers <eob> and gooey kisses <eol> and tiny voices and crayons <eob> and that song about letting go <eob> of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs <eol> to let go of. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
It's all peace and simplicity. <eob>
The air is so rare in this place <eol> for me that I can barely breathe. <eob>
I can barely believe I'm breathing. <eob>
Play is the opposite of work. <eob>
And I am happy. <eob>
Something in me loosens. <eob>
A door in my brain swings open, <eob> and a rush of energy comes. <eob>
And it's not instantaneous, <eol> but it happens, it does happen. <eob> I feel it. <eob> A hum creeps back. <eob>
Not at full volume, barely there, <eob> it's quiet, and I have to stay <eol> very still to hear it, but it is there. <eob>
Not the hum, but a hum. <eob>
And now I feel like I know <eol> a very magical secret. <eob>
Well, let's not get carried away. <eob>
It's just love. <eob>
That's all it is. <eob> No magic. No secret. It's just love. <eob>
It's just something we forgot. <eob>
The hum, the work hum, <eol> the hum of the titan, <eob> that's just a replacement. <eob>
If I have to ask you who I am, <eob> if I have to tell you who I am, <eob> if I describe myself in terms of shows <eob> and hours of television <eol> and how globally badass my brain is, <eob> I have forgotten <eol> what the real hum is. <eob>
The hum is not power and the hum <eol> is not work-specific. <eob>
The hum is joy-specific. <eob>
The real hum is love-specific. <eob>
The hum is the electricity <eol> that comes from being excited by life. <eob>
The real hum is confidence and peace. <eob>
The real hum ignores the stare of history, <eob> and the balls in the air, and the expectation, <eol> and the pressure. <eob>
The real hum is singular and original. <eob>
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, <eob> but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, <eob> because which one of the gods <eol> was telling me I was the titan? <eob>
It's just love. <eob> We could all use a little more love, <eob> a lot more love. <eob>
Any time my child asks me to play, <eob> I will say yes. <eob>
I make it a firm rule <eol> for one reason, <eob> to give myself permission, <eob> to free me from all of my workaholic guilt. <eob>
It's a law, so I don't have a choice, <eob> and I don't have a choice, <eob> not if I want to feel the hum. <eob>
I wish it were that easy, <eob> but I'm not good at playing. <eob>
I don't like it. <eob>
I'm not interested in doing it the way <eol> I'm interested in doing work. <eob>
The truth is incredibly humbling <eol> and humiliating to face. <eob>
I don't like playing. <eob>
I work all the time <eol> because I like working. <eob>
I like working more <eol> than I like being at home. <eob>
Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, <eob> because what kind of person <eol> likes working more than being at home? <eob>
Well, me. <eob> I mean, let's be honest, <eol> I call myself a titan. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I've got issues. <eob>
And one of those issues isn't <eol> that I am too relaxed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We run around the yard, <eol> up and back and up and back. <eob>
We have 30-second dance parties. <eob>
We sing show tunes. <eob>
We play with balls. <eob>
I blow bubbles and they pop them. <eob>
And I feel stiff <eol> and delirious and confused most of the time. <eob>
I itch for my cell phone always. <eob>
But it is OK. <eob>
My tiny humans show me how to live <eol> and the hum of the universe fills me up. <eob>
I play and I play <eol> until I begin to wonder <eob> why we ever stop playing <eol> in the first place. <eob>
You can do it too, <eob> say yes every time your child <eol> asks you to play. <eob>
Are you thinking that maybe <eol> I'm an idiot in diamond shoes? <eob>
You're right, but you can still do this. <eob> You have time. <eob> You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Your child does not think <eol> you're that interesting. <eob>
You only need 15 minutes. <eob>
My two- and four-year-old <eol> only ever want to play with me <eob> for about 15 minutes or so <eob> before they think to themselves <eol> they want to do something else. <eob>
It's an amazing 15 minutes, <eol> but it's 15 minutes. <eob>
If I'm not a ladybug <eol> or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And my 13-year-old, <eob> if I can get a 13-year-old <eol> to talk to me for 15 minutes <eob> I'm Parent of the Year. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
15 minutes is all you need. <eob>
I can totally pull off 15 minutes <eol> of uninterrupted time on my worst day. <eob>
Uninterrupted is the key. <eob>
No <eob> cell phone, no laundry, <eol> no anything. <eob>
You have a busy life. <eob>
You have to get dinner on the table. <eob>
You have to force them to bathe. <eob>
But you can do 15 minutes. <eob>
My kids are my happy place, <eol> they're my world, <eob> but it doesn't have to be your kids, <eob> the fuel that feeds your hum, <eob> the place where life feels more good <eol> than not good. <eob>
It's not about playing with your kids, <eob> it's about joy. <eob> It's about playing in general. <eob> Give yourself the 15 minutes. <eob>
Find what makes you feel good. <eob>
Just figure it out and play in that arena. <eob>
I'm not perfect at it. <eob>
In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, <eob> seeing friends, reading books, <eol> staring into space. <eob> "Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand <eol> for indulging myself <eob> in ways I'd given up <eob> on right around the time <eol> I got my first TV show, <eob> right around the time <eol> I became a titan-in-training, <eob> right around the time <eob> I started competing <eol> with myself for ways unknown. <eob> 15 minutes? What could be wrong <eol> with giving myself my full attention <eob> for 15 minutes? <eob> Turns out, nothing. <eob> The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, <eob> as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away. <eob>
Work doesn't work without play. <eob>
It takes a little time, <eol> but after a few months, <eob> one day the floodgates open <eob> and there's a rush, and I find myself <eol> standing in my office <eob> filled with an unfamiliar melody, <eol> full on groove inside me, <eob> and around me, and it sends me <eol> spinning with ideas, <eob> and the humming road is open, <eol> and I can drive it and drive it, <eob> and I love working again. <eob>
But now, I like that hum, <eol> but I don't love that hum. <eob>
I don't need that hum. <eob>
I am not that hum. <eob>
That hum is not me, <eob> not anymore. <eob>
I am bubbles and sticky fingers <eol> and dinners with friends. <eob>
I am that hum. <eob> Life's hum. <eob> Love's hum. <eob> Work's hum is still a piece of me, <eol> it is just no longer all of me, <eob> and I am so grateful. <eob>
And I don't give a crap about being a titan, <eob> because I have never once seen <eol> a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover. <eob>
I said yes to less work and more play, <eol> and somehow I still run my world. <eob>
My brain is still global. <eob>
My campfires still burn. <eob>
The more I play, the happier I am, <eol> and the happier my kids are. <eob>
The more I play, the more <eol> I feel like a good mother. <eob>
The more I play, <eol> the freer my mind becomes. <eob>
The more I play, the better I work. <eob>
The more I play, the more <eol> I feel the hum, <eob> the nation I'm building, <eol> the marathon I'm running, <eob> the troops, the canvas, <eol> the high note, the hum, <eob> the hum, <eob> the other hum, the real hum, <eob> life's hum. <eob>
The more I feel that hum, <eob> the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, <eob> awkward, brand new, <eob> alive non-titan feels like me. <eob>
The more I feel that hum, <eob> the more I know who I am. <eob>
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine. <eob>
That part of the job, <eol> that's living the dream. <eob>
That's the dream of the job. <eob>
Because a dream job should <eol> be a little bit dreamy. <eob>
I said yes to less work and more play. <eob>
Titans need not apply. <eob> Wanna play? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
1.3 billion years ago, <eob> in a distant, distant galaxy, <eob> two black holes locked into a spiral, <eob> falling inexorably towards each other <eob> and collided, <eob> converting three Suns' worth of stuff <eob> into pure energy in a tenth of a second. <eob>
For that brief moment in time, <eob> the glow was brighter than all the stars <eob> in all the galaxies <eob> in all of the known Universe. <eob>
It was a very <eob> big <eob> bang. <eob>
But they didn't release <eol> their energy in light. <eob> I mean, you know, <eol> they're black holes. <eob>
All that energy was pumped <eol> into the fabric of space and time itself, <eob> making the Universe explode <eol> in gravitational waves. <eob>
Let me give you a sense <eol> of the timescale at work here. <eob>
1.3 billion years ago, <eob> Earth had just managed to evolve <eol> multicellular life. <eob>
Since then, Earth has made and evolved <eob> corals, fish, plants, <eol> dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet. <eob>
And about 25 years ago, <eob> a particularly audacious set of people -- <eob> Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever <eol> at Caltech -- <eob> decided that it would be really neat <eob> to build a giant laser detector <eob> with which to search <eol> for the gravitational waves <eob> from things like colliding black holes. <eob>
Now, most people thought they were nuts. <eob>
But enough people realized <eol> that they were brilliant nuts <eob> that the US National Science Foundation <eol> decided to fund their crazy idea. <eob>
So after decades of development, <eob> construction and imagination <eob> and a breathtaking amount of hard work, <eob> they built their detector, called LIGO: <eob> The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. <eob>
For the last several years, <eob> LIGO's been undergoing <eol> a huge expansion in its accuracy, <eob> a tremendous improvement in its detection ability. <eob>
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result. <eob>
In early September of 2015, <eob> LIGO turned on <eol> for a final test run <eob> while they sorted out <eol> a few lingering details. <eob>
And on September 14 of 2015, <eob> just days after the detector <eol> had gone live, <eob> the gravitational waves <eol> from those colliding black holes <eob> passed through the Earth. <eob> And they passed through you and me. <eob> And they passed through the detector. <eob>
(Audio) Scott Hughes: <eol> There's two moments in my life <eob> more emotionally intense than that. <eob> One is the birth of my daughter. <eob> The other is when I had to say goodbye <eol> to my father when he was terminally ill. <eob>
You know, it was the payoff <eol> of my career, basically. <eob>
Everything I'd been working on -- <eol> it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs) <eob>
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend <eol> and collaborator, Scott Hughes, <eob> a theoretical physicist at MIT, <eob> who has been studying gravitational waves <eol> from black holes <eob> and the signals <eol> that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, <eob> for the past 23 years. <eob>
So let me take a moment to tell you <eol> what I mean by a gravitational wave. <eob>
A gravitational wave is a ripple <eob> in the shape of space and time. <eob>
As the wave passes by, <eob> it stretches space and everything in it <eob> in one direction, <eob> and compresses it in the other. <eob>
This has led to countless instructors <eol> of general relativity <eob> doing a really silly dance <eol> to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity. <eob> "It stretches and expands, <eol> it stretches and expands." <eob>
So the trouble with gravitational waves <eob> is that they're very weak; <eol> they're preposterously weak. <eob>
For example, the waves that hit us <eol> on September 14 -- <eob> and yes, every single one <eol> of you stretched and compressed <eob> under the action of that wave -- <eob> when the waves hit, <eol> they stretched the average person <eob> by one part in 10 to the 21. <eob>
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, <eob> and a one. <eob>
That's why everyone thought <eol> the LIGO people were nuts. <eob>
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- <eol> and that's already crazy -- <eob> they would have to measure <eol> the length of those detectors <eob> to less than one thousandth <eol> of the radius of the nucleus <eob> of an atom. <eob>
And that's preposterous. <eob>
So towards the end <eol> of his classic text on gravity, <eob> LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne <eob> described the hunt <eol> for gravitational waves as follows: <eob> He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted <eob> in constructing such detectors <eob> are enormous. <eob>
But physicists are ingenious, <eob> and with the support <eol> of a broad lay public, <eob> all obstacles will surely <eol> be overcome." <eob> Thorne published that in 1973, <eob> 42 years before he succeeded. <eob>
Now, coming back to LIGO, <eob> Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear <eob> more than it does like an eye. <eob>
I want to explain what that means. <eob>
Visible light has a wavelength, a size, <eob> that's much smaller <eol> than the things around you, <eob> the features <eol> on people's faces, <eob> the size of your cell phone. <eob> And that's really useful, <eob> because it lets you make an image <eol> or a map of the things around you, <eob> by looking at the light coming <eol> from different spots <eob> in the scene about you. <eob>
Sound is different. <eob> Audible sound has a wavelength <eol> that can be up to 50 feet long. <eob> And that makes it really difficult -- <eob> in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- <eol> to make an image <eob> of something you really care about. <eob>
Your child's face. <eob>
Instead, we use sound to listen <eol> for features like pitch <eob> and tone and rhythm <eol> and volume <eob> to infer a story behind the sounds. <eob>
That's Alice talking. <eob>
That's Bob interrupting. <eob> Silly Bob. <eob>
So, the same is true <eol> of gravitational waves. <eob>
We can't use them to make simple images <eol> of things out in the Universe. <eob>
But by listening to changes <eob> in the amplitude <eol> and frequency of those waves, <eob> we can hear the story <eol> that those waves are telling. <eob>
And at least for LIGO, <eob> the frequencies that it can hear <eol> are in the audio band. <eob>
So if we convert the wave patterns <eol> into pressure waves and air, into sound, <eob> we can literally hear <eol> the Universe speaking to us. <eob>
For example, listening to gravity, <eol> just in this way, <eob> can tell us a lot about the collision <eol> of two black holes, <eob> something my colleague Scott has spent <eol> an awful lot of time thinking about. <eob>
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes <eol> are non-spinning, <eob> you get a very simple chirp: whoop! <eob>
If the two bodies are spinning <eol> very rapidly, I have that same chirp, <eob> but with a modulation on top of it, <eob> so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir! <eob>
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted <eol> on this waveform. <eob>
AA: So on September 14, 2015, <eob> a date that's definitely <eol> going to live in my memory, <eob> LIGO heard this: <eob>
[Whirring sound] <eob>
So if you know how to listen, <eol> that is the sound of -- <eob>
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, <eol> each of about 30 solar masses, <eob> that were whirling around at a rate <eob> comparable to what goes on <eol> in your blender. <eob>
AA: It's worth pausing here <eol> to think about what that means. <eob>
Two black holes, the densest thing <eol> in the Universe, <eob> one with a mass of 29 Suns <eob> and one with a mass of 36 Suns, <eob> whirling around <eol> each other 100 times per second <eob> before they collide. <eob> Just imagine the power of that. <eob> It's fantastic. <eob> And we know it because we heard it. <eob>
That's the lasting importance of LIGO. <eob>
It's an entirely new way <eol> to observe the Universe <eob> that we've never had before. <eob>
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe <eob> and hear the invisible. <eob>
And there's a lot out there <eol> that we can't see -- <eob> in practice or even in principle. <eob>
So supernova, for example: <eob> I would love to know why very massive <eol> stars explode in supernovae. <eob>
They're very useful; <eob> we've learned a lot about <eol> the Universe from them. <eob>
The problem is, all the interesting <eol> physics happens in the core, <eob> and the core is hidden behind thousands <eol> of kilometers <eob> of iron and carbon and silicon. <eob>
We'll never see through it, <eol> it's opaque to light. <eob>
Gravitational waves go through iron <eol> as if it were glass -- <eob> totally transparent. <eob>
The Big Bang: I would love to be able <eol> to explore <eob> the first few moments of the Universe, <eob> but we'll never see them, <eob> because the Big Bang itself <eol> is obscured by its own afterglow. <eob>
With gravitational waves, <eob> we should be able to see <eol> all the way back to the beginning. <eob>
Perhaps most importantly, <eob> I'm positive that there are things out there <eob> that we've never seen <eob> that we may never be able to see <eob> and that we haven't even imagined -- <eob> things that we'll only discover <eol> by listening. <eob>
And in fact, even in <eol> that very first event, <eob> LIGO found things <eol> that we didn't expect. <eob>
Here's my colleague and one of the key <eol> members of the LIGO collaboration, <eob> Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, <eol> addressing exactly that: <eob>
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars <eol> which produce the black holes <eob> that we observed here <eob> are the dinosaurs <eol> of the Universe. <eob>
They're these massive things <eol> that are old, from prehistoric times, <eob> and the black holes are kind <eol> of like the dinosaur bones <eob> with which we do this archeology. <eob>
So it lets us really <eol> get a whole nother angle <eob> on what's out there in the Universe <eob> and how the stars came to be, <eol> and in the end, of course, <eob> how we came to be out <eol> of this whole mess. <eob>
AA: Our challenge now <eob> is to be as audacious as possible. <eob>
Thanks to LIGO, we know <eol> how to build exquisite detectors <eob> that can listen to the Universe, <eob> to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos. <eob>
Our job is to dream up <eol> and build new observatories -- <eob> a whole new generation <eol> of observatories -- <eob> on the ground, in space. <eob>
I mean, what could be more glorious <eol> than listening to the Big Bang itself? <eob>
Our job now is to dream big. <eob> Dream with us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What started as a platform <eol> for hobbyists <eob> is poised to become <eol> a multibillion-dollar industry. <eob>
Inspection, environmental monitoring, <eol> photography and film and journalism: <eob> these are some of the potential <eol> applications for commercial drones, <eob> and their enablers are the capabilities <eol> being developed <eob> at research facilities around the world. <eob>
For example, before aerial package delivery <eob> entered our social consciousness, <eob> an autonomous fleet of flying machines <eol> built a six-meter-tall tower <eob> composed of 1,500 bricks <eob> in front of a live audience <eol> at the FRAC Centre in France, <eob> and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes. <eob>
By tethering flying machines, <eob> they can achieve high speeds <eol> and accelerations in very tight spaces. <eob>
They can also autonomously build <eol> tensile structures. <eob>
Skills learned include how to carry loads, <eob> how to cope with disturbances, <eob> and in general, how to interact <eol> with the physical world. <eob>
Today we want to show you some new projects <eol> that we've been working on. <eob>
Their aim is to push the boundary <eol> of what can be achieved <eob> with autonomous flight. <eob>
Now, for a system to function autonomously, <eob> it must collectively know <eol> the location of its mobile objects in space. <eob>
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, <eob> we often use external cameras <eol> to locate objects, <eob> which then allows us <eol> to focus our efforts <eob> on the rapid development <eol> of highly dynamic tasks. <eob>
For the demos you will see today, however, <eob> we will use new localization <eol> technology developed by Verity Studios, <eob> a spin-off from our lab. <eob>
There are no external cameras. <eob>
Each flying machine uses onboard <eol> sensors to determine its location in space <eob> and onboard computation to determine <eol> what its actions should be. <eob>
The only external commands <eol> are high-level ones <eob> such as "take off" and "land." <eob>
This is a so-called tail-sitter. <eob>
It's an aircraft that tries <eol> to have its cake and eat it. <eob>
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, <eol> it is efficient in forward flight, <eob> much more so than helicopters <eol> and variations thereof. <eob>
Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, <eob> it is capable of hovering, <eob> which has huge advantages <eol> for takeoff, landing <eob> and general versatility. <eob>
There is no free lunch, unfortunately. <eob>
One of the limitations <eol> with tail-sitters <eob> is that they're susceptible to disturbances <eol> such as wind gusts. <eob>
We're developing new control <eol> architectures and algorithms <eob> that address this limitation. <eob>
The idea is for the aircraft to recover <eob> no matter what state it finds itself in, <eob> and through practice, improve its performance over time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
OK. <eob>
When doing research, <eob> we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions <eob> that try to get at the heart of a matter. <eob>
For example, one such question would be, <eob> what is the minimum number <eol> of moving parts needed for controlled flight? <eob>
Now, there are practical reasons <eob> why you may want to know <eol> the answer to such a question. <eob> Helicopters, for example, <eob> are affectionately known <eol> as machines with a thousand moving parts <eob> all conspiring to do you bodily harm. <eob>
It turns out that decades ago, <eob> skilled pilots were able <eol> to fly remote-controlled aircraft <eob> that had only two moving parts: <eob> a propeller and a tail rudder. <eob>
We recently discovered <eol> that it could be done with just one. <eob>
This is the monospinner, <eob> the world's mechanically simplest <eol> controllable flying machine, <eob> invented just a few months ago. <eob>
It has only one moving part, a propeller. <eob>
It has no flaps, no hinges, <eol> no ailerons, <eob> no other actuators, <eol> no other control surfaces, <eob> just a simple propeller. <eob>
Even though it's mechanically simple, <eob> there's a lot going on <eol> in its little electronic brain <eob> to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move <eol> anywhere it wants in space. <eob>
Even so, it doesn't yet have <eob> the sophisticated algorithms <eol> of the tail-sitter, <eob> which means that in order <eol> to get it to fly, <eob> I have to throw it just right. <eob>
And because the probability of me <eol> throwing it just right is very low, <eob> given everybody watching me, <eob> what we're going to do instead <eob> is show you a video <eol> that we shot last night. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
If the monospinner <eol> is an exercise in frugality, <eob> this machine here, the omnicopter, <eol> with its eight propellers, <eob> is an exercise in excess. <eob>
What can you do with all this surplus? <eob>
The thing to notice <eol> is that it is highly symmetric. <eob>
As a result, it is ambivalent <eol> to orientation. <eob>
This gives it an extraordinary capability. <eob>
It can move anywhere it wants in space <eob> irrespective of where it is facing <eob> and even of how it is rotating. <eob>
It has its own complexities, <eob> mainly having to do <eol> with the interacting flows <eob> from its eight propellers. <eob>
Some of this can be modeled, <eol> while the rest can be learned on the fly. <eob>
Let's take a look. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
If flying machines are going <eol> to enter part of our daily lives, <eob> they will need to become extremely <eol> safe and reliable. <eob>
This machine over here <eob> is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines. <eob>
This one wants to spin clockwise. <eob>
This other one wants <eol> to spin counterclockwise. <eob>
When you put them together, <eob> they behave like one high-performance <eol> quadrocopter. <eob>
If anything goes wrong, however -- <eob> a motor fails, a propeller fails, <eol> electronics, even a battery pack -- <eob> the machine can still fly, albeit <eol> in a degraded fashion. <eob>
We're going to demonstrate this <eol> to you now by disabling one of its halves. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This last demonstration <eob> is an exploration of synthetic swarms. <eob>
The large number of autonomous, <eol> coordinated entities <eob> offers a new palette <eol> for aesthetic expression. <eob>
We've taken commercially <eol> available micro quadcopters, <eob> each weighing less than a slice <eol> of bread, by the way, <eob> and outfitted them <eol> with our localization technology <eob> and custom algorithms. <eob>
Because each unit knows <eol> where it is in space <eob> and is self-controlled, <eob> there is really no limit to their number. <eob>
Hopefully, these demonstrations <eol> will motivate you to dream up <eob> new revolutionary roles <eol> for flying machines. <eob>
That ultrasafe one over there for example <eob> has aspirations to become <eol> a flying lampshade on Broadway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The reality is that it <eol> is difficult to predict <eob> the impact of nascent technology. <eob>
And for folks like us, the real reward <eol> is the journey and the act of creation. <eob>
It's a continual reminder <eob> of how wonderful and magical the universe <eol> we live in is, <eob> that it allows creative, clever creatures <eob> to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. <eob>
The fact that this technology <eob> has such huge commercial <eol> and economic potential <eob> is just icing on the cake. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was excited to be a part <eol> of the "Dream" theme, <eob> and then I found out I'm leading off <eol> the "Nightmare?" section of it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And certainly there are things about the climate <eol> crisis that qualify. <eob>
And I have some bad news, <eob> but I have a lot more good news. <eob>
I'm going to propose three questions <eob> and the answer to the first one <eob> necessarily involves a little bad news. <eob>
But -- hang on, because the answers <eol> to the second and third questions <eob> really are very positive. <eob>
So the first question is, <eol> "Do we really have to change?" <eob> And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things <eob> changed the environmental movement, <eob> really launched <eol> the modern environmental movement. <eob>
18 months after this Earthrise picture <eol> was first seen on earth, <eob> the first Earth Day was organized. <eob>
And we learned a lot about ourselves <eob> looking back at our planet from space. <eob>
And one of the things that we learned <eob> confirmed what the scientists <eol> have long told us. <eob>
One of the most essential facts <eob> about the climate crisis <eol> has to do with the sky. <eob>
As this picture illustrates, <eob> the sky is not the vast <eol> and limitless expanse <eob> that appears when we look up from the ground. <eob>
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere <eob> surrounding the planet. <eob>
That right now is the open sewer <eol> for our industrial civilization <eob> as it's currently organized. <eob>
We are spewing 110 million tons <eob> of heat-trapping global warming <eol> pollution into it every 24 hours, <eob> free of charge, go ahead. <eob>
And there are many sources <eol> of the greenhouse gases, <eob> I'm certainly not going to go <eol> through them all. <eob>
I'm going to focus on the main one, <eob> but agriculture is involved, diet <eol> is involved, population is involved. <eob>
Management of forests, transportation, <eob> the oceans, the melting of the permafrost. <eob>
But I'm going to focus <eol> on the heart of the problem, <eob> which is the fact that we still rely <eol> on dirty, carbon-based fuels <eob> for 85 percent of all the energy <eol> that our world burns every year. <eob>
And you can see from this image <eol> that after World War II, <eob> the emission rates started really accelerating. <eob>
And the accumulated amount of man-made, <eol> global warming pollution <eob> that is up in the atmosphere now <eob> traps as much extra heat energy <eol> as would be released <eob> by 400,000 Hiroshima-class <eol> atomic bombs exploding <eob> every 24 hours, 365 days a year. <eob>
Fact-checked over and over again, <eob> conservative, it's the truth. <eob>
Now it's a big planet, but -- <eob>
(Explosion sound) <eob>
that is a lot of energy, <eob> particularly when you multiply <eol> it 400,000 times per day. <eob>
And all that extra heat energy <eob> is heating up the atmosphere, <eol> the whole earth system. <eob>
Let's look at the atmosphere. <eob>
This is a depiction <eob> of what we used to think of as the normal <eol> distribution of temperatures. <eob>
The white represents normal temperature days; <eob> 1951-1980 <eol> are arbitrarily chosen. <eob>
The blue are cooler than average days, <eob> the red are warmer than average days. <eob>
But the entire curve <eol> has moved to the right in the 1980s. <eob>
And you'll see in the lower <eol> right-hand corner <eob> the appearance of statistically significant numbers <eob> of extremely hot days. <eob>
In the 90s, the curve shifted further. <eob>
And in the last 10 years, <eol> you see the extremely hot days <eob> are now more numerous <eol> than the cooler than average days. <eob>
In fact, they are 150 times more common <eol> on the surface of the earth <eob> than they were just 30 years ago. <eob>
So we're having record-breaking <eol> temperatures. <eob>
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years <eol> ever measured with instruments <eob> have been in this young century. <eob>
The hottest of all was last year. <eob>
Last month was the 371st month in a row <eob> warmer than the 20th-century average. <eob>
And for the first time, <eol> not only the warmest January, <eob> but for the first time, it was more <eol> than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer <eob> than the average. <eob>
These higher temperatures <eol> are having an effect on animals, <eob> plants, people, ecosystems. <eob>
But on a global basis, 93 percent <eol> of all the extra heat energy <eob> is trapped in the oceans. <eob>
And the scientists can measure the heat buildup <eob> much more precisely now <eob> at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, <eob> the first few hundred meters. <eob>
And this, too, is accelerating. <eob>
It goes back more than a century. <eob>
And more than half of the increase <eol> has been in the last 19 years. <eob> This has consequences. <eob>
The first order of consequence: <eob> the ocean-based storms get stronger. <eob>
Super Typhoon Haiyan went <eol> over areas of the Pacific <eob> five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal <eob> before it slammed into Tacloban, <eob> as the most destructive storm <eol> ever to make landfall. <eob>
Pope Francis, who has made such a difference <eol> to this whole issue, <eob> visited Tacloban right after that. <eob>
Superstorm Sandy went <eol> over areas of the Atlantic <eob> nine degrees warmer than normal <eob> before slamming into New York <eol> and New Jersey. <eob>
The second order of consequences <eol> are affecting all of us right now. <eob>
The warmer oceans are evaporating <eol> much more water vapor into the skies. <eob>
Average humidity worldwide <eol> has gone up four percent. <eob>
And it creates these atmospheric rivers. <eob>
The Brazilian scientists call them <eol> "flying rivers." <eob> And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land <eob> where storm conditions trigger <eol> these massive record-breaking downpours. <eob>
This is from Montana. <eob>
Take a look at this storm last August. <eob>
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona. <eob> It literally splashes off the city. <eob>
These downpours are really unusual. <eob>
Last July in Houston, Texas, <eob> it rained for two days, <eol> 162 billion gallons. <eob>
That represents more than two days <eol> of the full flow of Niagara Falls <eob> in the middle of the city, <eob> which was, of course, paralyzed. <eob>
These record downpours <eol> are creating historic floods and mudslides. <eob>
This one is from Chile last year. <eob>
And you'll see that warehouse going by. <eob>
There are oil tankers cars going by. <eob>
This is from Spain last September, <eob> you could call this the running <eol> of the cars and trucks, I guess. <eob>
Every night on the TV news now <eol> is like a nature hike <eob> through the Book of Revelation. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I mean, really. <eob>
The insurance industry <eol> has certainly noticed, <eob> the losses have been mounting up. <eob>
They're not under any illusions <eol> about what's happening. <eob>
And the causality requires <eol> a moment of discussion. <eob>
We're used to thinking of linear <eol> cause and linear effect -- <eob> one cause, one effect. <eob>
This is systemic causation. <eob>
As the great Kevin Trenberth says, <eob> "All storms are different now. <eob>
There's so much extra energy <eol> in the atmosphere, <eob> there's so much extra water vapor. <eob>
Every storm is different now." <eob> So, the same extra heat pulls <eol> the soil moisture out of the ground <eob> and causes these deeper, longer, <eol> more pervasive droughts <eob> and many of them are underway right now. <eob>
It dries out the vegetation <eob> and causes more fires in the western part <eol> of North America. <eob>
There's certainly been evidence <eol> of that, a lot of them. <eob>
More lightning, <eob> as the heat energy builds up, <eol> there's a considerable amount <eob> of additional lightning also. <eob>
These climate-related disasters <eol> also have geopolitical consequences <eob> and create instability. <eob>
The climate-related historic drought <eol> that started in Syria in 2006 <eob> destroyed 60 percent <eol> of the farms in Syria, <eob> killed 80 percent <eol> of the livestock, <eob> and drove 1.5 million climate refugees <eol> into the cities of Syria, <eob> where they collided with another <eol> 1.5 million refugees <eob> from the Iraq War. <eob>
And along with other factors, <eol> that opened the gates of Hell <eob> that people are trying to close now. <eob>
The US Defense Department <eol> has long warned <eob> of consequences from the climate crisis, <eob> including refugees, food and water shortages <eob> and pandemic disease. <eob>
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases <eol> from the tropics spread <eob> to the higher latitudes; <eob> the transportation revolution <eol> has had a lot to do with this. <eob>
But the changing conditions change <eol> the latitudes and the areas <eob> where these microbial diseases <eol> can become endemic <eob> and change <eob> the range of the vectors, <eol> like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. <eob>
The Zika epidemic now -- <eob> we're better positioned <eol> in North America <eob> because it's still a little too cool <eol> and we have a better public health system. <eob>
But when women in some regions of South <eol> and Central America <eob> are advised not to get pregnant <eol> for two years -- <eob> that's something new, <eol> that ought to get our attention. <eob>
The Lancet, one of the two greatest <eol> medical journals in the world, <eob> last summer labeled this <eol> a medical emergency now. <eob>
And there are many factors because of it. <eob>
This is also connected <eol> to the extinction crisis. <eob>
We're in danger of losing 50 percent <eol> of all the living species on earth <eob> by the end of this century. <eob>
And already, land-based plants and animals <eob> are now moving towards the poles <eob> at an average rate of 15 feet per day. <eob>
Speaking of the North Pole, <eob> last December 29, the same storm <eol> that caused historic flooding <eob> in the American Midwest, <eob> raised temperatures at the North Pole <eob> 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, <eob> causing the thawing of the North Pole <eob> in the middle of the long, <eol> dark, winter, polar night. <eob>
And when the land-based ice <eol> of the Arctic melts, <eob> it raises sea level. <eob>
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph <eol> from Svalbard illustrates this. <eob>
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland <eob> and particularly, Antarctica. <eob>
The 10 largest risk cities <eol> for sea-level rise by population <eob> are mostly in South <eol> and Southeast Asia. <eob>
When you measure it by assets <eol> at risk, number one is Miami: <eob> three and a half trillion dollars at risk. <eob>
Number three: New York and Newark. <eob>
I was in Miami last <eol> fall during the supermoon, <eob> one of the highest <eol> high-tide days. <eob>
And there were fish from the ocean <eol> swimming in some of the streets <eob> of Miami Beach <eol> and Fort Lauderdale <eob> and Del Rey. <eob>
And this happens regularly <eol> during the highest-tide tides now. <eob>
Not with rain -- they call it <eol> "sunny-day flooding." <eob> It comes up through the storm sewers. <eob>
And the Mayor of Miami speaks <eol> for many when he says <eob> it is long past time this <eol> can be viewed through a partisan lens. <eob>
This is a crisis <eol> that's getting worse day by day. <eob>
We have to move beyond partisanship. <eob>
And I want to take a moment <eol> to honor these House Republicans -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
who had the courage last fall <eob> to step out and take <eol> a political risk, <eob> by telling the truth about the climate crisis. <eob>
So the cost of the climate crisis <eol> is mounting up, <eob> there are many of these aspects <eol> I haven't even mentioned. <eob>
It's an enormous burden. <eob>
I'll mention just one more, <eob> because the World Economic Forum <eol> last month in Davos, <eob> after their annual survey <eol> of 750 economists, <eob> said the climate crisis <eol> is now the number one risk <eob> to the global economy. <eob>
So you get central bankers <eob> like Mark Carney, the head <eol> of the UK Central Bank, <eob> saying the vast majority of the carbon <eol> reserves are unburnable. <eob> Subprime carbon. <eob> I'm not going to remind you <eol> what happened with subprime mortgages, <eob> but it's the same thing. <eob>
If you look at all of the carbon fuels <eol> that were burned <eob> since the beginning of the industrial revolution, <eob> this is the quantity burned <eol> in the last 16 years. <eob>
Here are all the ones <eol> that are proven and left on the books, <eob> 28 trillion dollars. <eob>
The International Energy Agency says only this <eol> amount can be burned. <eob>
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- <eob> unburnable. <eob>
Risk <eob> to the global economy. <eob>
That's why divestment movement <eol> makes practical sense <eob> and is not just a moral imperative. <eob>
So the answer to the first question, <eol> "Must we change?" <eob> is yes, we have to change. <eob>
Second question, "Can we change?" <eob> This is the exciting news! <eob>
The best projections <eol> in the world 16 years ago <eob> were that by 2010, <eol> the world would be able to install <eob> 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. <eob>
We beat that mark by 14 <eol> and a half times over. <eob>
We see an exponential curve <eol> for wind installations now. <eob>
We see the cost coming down dramatically. <eob>
Some countries -- take Germany, <eol> an industrial powerhouse <eob> with a climate not that different <eol> from Vancouver's, by the way -- <eob> one day last December, <eob> got 81 percent of all its energy <eol> from renewable resources, <eob> mainly solar and wind. <eob>
A lot of countries are getting <eol> more than half on an average basis. <eob>
More good news: <eob> energy storage, from batteries particularly, <eob> is now beginning to take off <eob> because the cost has been coming down <eol> very dramatically <eob> to solve the intermittency problem. <eob>
With solar, the news <eol> is even more exciting! <eob>
The best projections 14 years ago <eol> were that we would install <eob> one gigawatt per year by 2010. <eob>
When 2010 came around, we beat <eol> that mark by 17 times over. <eob>
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. <eob>
This year, we're on track <eol> to beat it 68 times over. <eob>
We're going to win this. <eob> We are going to prevail. <eob>
The exponential curve <eol> on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. <eob>
When I came to this stage 10 years ago, <eob> this is where it was. <eob>
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough <eob> in the emergence <eol> of these exponential curves. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And the cost has come down <eol> 10 percent per year <eob> for 30 years. <eob>
And it's continuing to come down. <eob>
Now, the business community <eol> has certainly noticed this, <eob> because it's crossing <eol> the grid parity point. <eob>
Cheaper solar penetration rates <eol> are beginning to rise. <eob>
Grid parity is understood <eol> as that line, that threshold, <eob> below which renewable electricity <eol> is cheaper than electricity <eob> from burning fossil fuels. <eob>
That threshold is a little bit <eol> like the difference <eob> between 32 degrees Fahrenheit <eol> and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, <eob> or zero and one Celsius. <eob>
It's a difference of more than one degree, <eob> it's the difference between ice and water. <eob>
And it's the difference between markets <eol> that are frozen up, <eob> and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities <eol> for investment. <eob>
This is the biggest new business opportunity <eob> in the history of the world, <eob> and two-thirds of it is in the private sector. <eob>
We are seeing an explosion <eol> of new investment. <eob>
Starting in 2010, investments globally <eol> in renewable electricity generation <eob> surpassed fossils. <eob>
The gap has been growing ever since. <eob>
The projections for the future <eol> are even more dramatic, <eob> even though fossil energy is now still subsidized <eob> at a rate 40 times larger than renewables. <eob>
And by the way, if you add <eol> the projections for nuclear on here, <eob> particularly if you assume <eol> that the work many are doing <eob> to try to break through to safer <eol> and more acceptable, <eob> more affordable forms <eol> of nuclear, <eob> this could change even more dramatically. <eob>
So is there any precedent <eol> for such a rapid adoption <eob> of a new technology? <eob>
Well, there are many, but let's look <eol> at cell phones. <eob>
In 1980, AT & amp; T, then Ma Bell, <eob> commissioned McKinsey <eol> to do a global market survey <eob> of those clunky new mobile phones <eol> that appeared then. <eob> "How many can we sell by the year 2000?" <eol> they asked. <eob>
McKinsey came back and said, <eol> "900,000." <eob> And sure enough, <eol> when the year 2000 arrived, <eob> they did sell 900,000 -- <eol> in the first three days. <eob>
And for the balance of the year, <eol> they sold 120 times more. <eob>
And now there are more cell connections <eol> than there are people in the world. <eob>
So, why were they not only wrong, <eol> but way wrong? <eob>
I've asked that question myself, "Why?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I think the answer is in three parts. <eob>
First, the cost came down much faster <eol> than anybody expected, <eob> even as the quality went up. <eob>
And low-income countries, places <eol> that did not have a landline grid -- <eob> they leap-frogged <eol> to the new technology. <eob>
The big expansion has been <eol> in the developing counties. <eob>
So what about the electricity grids <eol> in the developing world? <eob>
Well, not so hot. <eob>
And in many areas, they don't exist. <eob>
There are more people <eol> without any electricity at all in India <eob> than the entire population <eol> of the United States of America. <eob>
So now we're getting this: <eob> solar panels on grass huts <eob> and new business models <eol> that make it affordable. <eob>
Muhammad Yunus financed this one <eol> in Bangladesh with micro-credit. <eob>
This is a village market. <eob>
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: <eob> two systems per minute <eol> on average, night and day. <eob>
And we have all we need: <eob> enough energy from the Sun <eol> comes to the earth <eob> every hour to supply the full world's energy <eol> needs for an entire year. <eob>
It's actually a little bit <eol> less than an hour. <eob>
So the answer to the second question, <eol> "Can we change?" <eob> is clearly "Yes." <eob> And it's an ever-firmer "yes." <eob>
Last question, "Will we change?" <eob> Paris really was a breakthrough, <eob> some of the provisions are binding <eob> and the regular reviews will matter a lot. <eob>
But nations aren't waiting, <eol> they're going ahead. <eob>
China has already announced <eol> that starting next year, <eob> they're adopting a nationwide <eol> cap and trade system. <eob>
They will likely link up <eol> with the European Union. <eob>
The United States has already been changing. <eob>
All of these coal plants were proposed <eob> in the next 10 years and canceled. <eob> All of these existing coal plants <eol> were retired. <eob>
All of these coal plants <eol> have had their retirement announced. <eob>
All of them -- canceled. <eob> We are moving forward. <eob> Last year -- if you look at all of the investment <eob> in new electricity generation in the United States, <eob> almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, <eob> mostly wind and solar. <eob>
We are solving this crisis. <eob>
The only question is: <eol> how long will it take to get there? <eob>
So, it matters that a lot <eol> of people are organizing <eob> to insist on this change. <eob>
Almost 400,000 people <eol> marched in New York City <eob> before the UN special session on this. <eob>
Many thousands, tens of thousands, <eob> marched in cities around the world. <eob>
And so, I am extremely optimistic. <eob>
As I said before, <eol> we are going to win this. <eob>
I'll finish with this story. <eob>
When I was 13 years old, <eob> I heard that proposal <eol> by President Kennedy <eob> to land a person on the Moon <eol> and bring him back safely <eob> in 10 years. <eob>
And I heard adults of that day and time say, <eob> "That's reckless, <eol> expensive, may well fail." <eob> But eight years and two months later, <eob> in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, <eob> there was great cheer that went up <eol> in NASA's mission control in Houston. <eob>
Here's a little-known fact about that: <eob> the average age of the systems engineers, <eob> the controllers in the room <eol> that day, was 26, <eob> which means, among other things, <eob> their age, when they heard <eol> that challenge, was 18. <eob>
We now have a moral challenge <eob> that is in the tradition <eol> of others that we have faced. <eob>
One of the greatest poets <eol> of the last century in the US, <eob> Wallace Stevens, <eob> wrote a line that has stayed with me: <eob> "After the final 'no,' there comes <eol> a 'yes,' <eob> and on that 'yes', the future world depends." <eob> When the abolitionists started their movement, <eob> they met with no after no after no. <eob>
And then came a yes. <eob>
The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement <eob> met endless no's, <eol> until finally, there was a yes. <eob>
The Civil Rights Movement, <eol> the movement against apartheid, <eob> and more recently, the movement <eol> for gay and lesbian rights <eob> here in the United States and elsewhere. <eob>
After the final "no" comes a "yes." <eob>
When any great moral challenge <eol> is ultimately resolved <eob> into a binary choice <eol> between what is right and what is wrong, <eob> the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings. <eob>
Ninety-nine percent of us, <eol> that is where we are now <eob> and it is why we're going to win this. <eob>
We have everything we need. <eob>
Some still doubt that we have <eol> the will to act, <eob> but I say the will to act <eol> is itself a renewable resource. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible <eol> combination of skills. <eob>
You've got this scientist mind <eol> that can understand <eob> the full range of issues, <eob> and the ability to turn it <eol> into the most vivid language. <eob>
No one else can do that, <eol> that's why you led this thing. <eob>
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, <eol> it was amazing to see it now. <eob>
Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris. <eob> But honestly, I have <eol> a lot of really good friends <eob> in the scientific community <eol> who are incredibly patient <eob> and who will sit there and explain <eol> this stuff to me <eob> over and over and over again <eob> until I can get it into simple enough language <eob> that I can understand it. <eob>
And that's the key <eol> to trying to communicate. <eob>
CA: So, your talk. <eob>
First part: terrifying, <eob> second part: incredibly hopeful. <eob>
How do we know that all those graphs, <eol> all that progress, is enough <eob> to solve what you showed in the first part? <eob>
AG: I think that the crossing -- <eob> you know, I've only been in <eol> the business world for 15 years. <eob>
But one of the things I've learned <eol> is that apparently it matters <eob> if a new product or service <eol> is more expensive <eob> than the incumbent, or cheaper than. <eob>
Turns out, it makes a difference <eol> if it's cheaper than. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And when it crosses that line, <eob> then a lot of things really change. <eob>
We are regularly surprised <eol> by these developments. <eob>
The late Rudi Dornbusch, <eol> the great economist said, <eob> "Things take longer to happen <eol> then you think they will, <eob> and then they happen much faster <eol> than you thought they could." <eob> I really think that's where we are. <eob>
Some people are using the phrase <eol> "The Solar Singularity" now, <eob> meaning when it gets below <eol> the grid parity, <eob> unsubsidized in most places, <eob> then it's the default choice. <eob>
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, <eol> the jitney thing, <eob> there is an effort to use <eol> regulations to slow this down. <eob>
And I just don't think it's going to work. <eob>
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, <eob> who's the Chairman of the Atlanta <eol> Tea Party. <eob>
They enlisted her in this effort <eol> to put a tax <eob> on solar panels and regulations. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And she had just put solar panels on her roof <eob> and she didn't understand the request. <eob>
And so she went and formed <eol> an alliance with the Sierra Club <eob> and they formed a new organization <eol> called the Green Tea Party. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And they defeated the proposal. <eob>
So, finally, the answer to your question is, <eob> this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché, <eob> but 10 years ago -- <eol> and Christiana referred to this -- <eob> there are people in this audience <eol> who played an incredibly significant role <eob> in generating those exponential curves. <eob>
And it didn't work out <eol> economically for some of them, <eob> but it kick-started <eol> this global revolution. <eob>
And what people in this audience do now <eob> with the knowledge that we <eol> are going to win this. <eob>
But it matters a lot how fast we win it. <eob>
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful. <eob>
If this turns out to be the year, <eob> that the partisan thing changes, <eob> as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, <eob> but you bring along people <eol> from the other side together, <eob> backed by science, backed <eol> by these kinds of investment opportunities, <eob> backed by reason that you win the day -- <eob> boy, that's really exciting. <eob>
Thank you so much. <eob>
AG: <eob> Thank you so much <eob> for bringing me back to TED. <eob> Thank you! <eob>
What do you think when you look at me? <eob>
A woman of faith? An expert? <eob> Maybe even a sister. <eob>
Or oppressed, <eob> brainwashed, <eob> a terrorist. <eob>
Or just an airport security line delay. <eob> That one's actually true. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If some of your perceptions were negative, <eol> I don't really blame you. <eob>
That's just how the media <eol> has been portraying <eob> people who look like me. <eob>
One study found <eob> that 80 percent of news coverage <eol> about Islam and Muslims is negative. <eob>
And studies show that Americans say <eol> that most don't know a Muslim. <eob>
I guess people don't talk <eol> to their Uber drivers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, for those of you <eol> who have never met a Muslim, <eob> it's great to meet you. <eob>
Let me tell you who I am. <eob>
I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- <eob> double espresso, cream on the side. <eob> I'm an introvert. <eob> I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. <eob> And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. <eob>
But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, <eol> I wasn't born this way. <eob>
It was a choice. <eob>
When I was 17, I decided to come out. <eob>
No, not as a gay person <eol> like some of my friends, <eob> but as a Muslim, <eob> and decided to start wearing the hijab, <eol> my head covering. <eob>
My feminist friends were aghast: <eob> "Why are you oppressing yourself?" <eob> The funny thing was, <eob> it was actually at that time <eol> a feminist declaration of independence <eob> from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, <eob> to conform to a perfect <eol> and unattainable standard of beauty. <eob>
I didn't just passively accept <eol> the faith of my parents. <eob>
I wrestled with the Quran. <eob>
I read and reflected <eol> and questioned and doubted <eob> and, ultimately, believed. <eob>
My relationship with God -- it was not love <eol> at first sight. <eob>
It was a trust and a slow surrender <eob> that deepened with every <eol> reading of the Quran. <eob>
Its rhythmic beauty <eol> sometimes moves me to tears. <eob>
I see myself in it. <eob>
I feel that God knows me. <eob>
Have you ever felt like someone <eol> sees you, completely understands you <eob> and yet loves you anyway? <eob>
That's how it feels. <eob>
And so later, I got married, <eob> and like all good Egyptians, <eob> started my career as an engineer. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I later had a child, after getting married, <eob> and I was living essentially <eol> the Egyptian-American dream. <eob>
And then that terrible morning <eol> of September, 2001. <eob>
I think a lot of you probably remember <eol> exactly where you were that morning. <eob>
I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, <eob> and I look up on the screen <eol> and see the words "Breaking News." <eob> There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, <eob> people jumping out of buildings. <eob> What was this? <eob> An accident? <eob> A malfunction? <eob> My shock quickly turned to outrage. <eob>
Who would do this? <eob> And I switch the channel and I hear, <eob>
"... Muslim terrorist ...," <eob> "... in the name of Islam ...," <eob> "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," <eob> "... jihad ...," <eob> "... we should bomb Mecca." <eob> Oh my God. <eob>
Not only had my country been attacked, <eob> but in a flash, <eob> somebody else's actions had turned me <eol> from a citizen <eob> to a suspect. <eob>
That same day, we had to drive <eol> across Middle America <eob> to move to a new city <eol> to start grad school. <eob>
And I remember sitting in the passenger seat <eob> as we drove in silence, <eob> crouched as low as I could go in my seat, <eob> for the first time in my life, afraid <eol> for anyone to know I was a Muslim. <eob>
We moved into our apartment <eol> that night in a new town <eob> in what felt like a completely <eol> different world. <eob>
And then I was hearing <eol> and seeing and reading <eob> warnings from national Muslim organizations <eob> saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," <eob> "Stay in well-lit areas," <eol> "Don't congregate." <eob>
I stayed inside all week. <eob>
And then it was Friday <eol> that same week, <eob> the day that Muslims congregate <eol> for worship. <eob>
And again the warnings were, <eol> "Don't go that first Friday, <eob> it could be a target." <eob> And I was watching the news, <eol> wall-to-wall coverage. <eob>
Emotions were so raw, understandably, <eob> and I was also hearing <eol> about attacks on Muslims, <eob> or people who were perceived <eol> to be Muslim, being pulled out <eob> and beaten in the street. <eob>
Mosques were actually firebombed. <eob>
And I thought, we should just stay home. <eob>
And yet, something didn't feel right. <eob>
Because those people <eol> who attacked our country <eob> attacked our country. <eob>
I get it that people were angry <eol> at the terrorists. <eob> Guess what? So was I. <eob> And so to have to explain yourself <eol> all the time isn't easy. <eob>
I don't mind questions. I love questions. <eob> It's the accusations that are tough. <eob>
Today we hear people actually saying things like, <eob> "There's a problem in this country, <eol> and it's called Muslims. <eob>
When are we going to get rid of them?" <eob> So, some people want to ban Muslims <eol> and close down mosques. <eob>
They talk about my community <eol> kind of like we're a tumor <eob> in the body of America. <eob>
And the only question is, <eol> are we malignant or benign? <eob>
You know, a malignant tumor <eol> you extract altogether, <eob> and a benign tumor you <eol> just keep under surveillance. <eob>
The choices don't make sense, <eol> because it's the wrong question. <eob>
Muslims, like all other Americans, <eol> aren't a tumor <eob> in the body of America, <eob> we're a vital organ. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Muslims are inventors and teachers, <eob> first responders and Olympic athletes. <eob>
Now, is closing down mosques <eol> going to make America safer? <eob>
It might free up some parking spots, <eob> but it will not end terrorism. <eob> Going to a mosque regularly <eol> is actually linked <eob> to having more tolerant views <eol> of people of other faiths <eob> and greater civic engagement. <eob>
And as one police chief <eol> in the Washington, DC area <eob> recently told me, <eob> people don't actually get <eol> radicalized at mosques. <eob> They get radicalized in their basement <eol> or bedroom, in front of a computer. <eob>
And what you find <eol> about the radicalization process <eob> is it starts online, <eob> but the first thing that happens <eob> is the person gets cut off <eol> from their community, <eob> from even their family, <eob> so that the extremist group can brainwash them <eob> into believing that they, the terrorists, <eol> are the true Muslims, <eob> and everyone else who abhors <eol> their behavior and ideology <eob> are sellouts or apostates. <eob>
So if we want to prevent radicalization, <eob> we have to keep people <eol> going to the mosque. <eob>
Now, some will still argue Islam <eol> is a violent religion. <eob>
After all, a group like ISIS <eol> bases its brutality on the Quran. <eob>
Now, as a Muslim, <eol> as a mother, as a human being, <eob> I think we need to do everything <eol> we can to stop a group like ISIS. <eob>
But we would be giving in to their narrative <eob> if we cast them as representatives <eol> of a faith of 1.6 billion people. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
ISIS has as much to do with Islam <eob> as the Ku Klux Klan <eol> has to do with Christianity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Both groups claim to base <eol> their ideology on their holy book. <eob>
But when you look at them, <eol> they're not motivated <eob> by what they read <eol> in their holy book. <eob>
It's their brutality that makes them <eol> read these things into the scripture. <eob>
Recently, a prominent imam told me <eol> a story that really took me aback. <eob>
He said that a girl came to him <eob> because she was thinking <eol> of going to join ISIS. <eob>
And I was really surprised and asked him, <eob> had she been in contact <eol> with a radical religious leader? <eob> And he said the problem <eol> was quite the opposite, <eob> that every cleric that she had talked to had <eol> shut her down <eob> and said that her rage, <eol> her sense of injustice in the world, <eob> was just going to get her in trouble. <eob>
And so with nowhere to channel <eol> and make sense of this anger, <eob> she was a prime target <eol> to be exploited <eob> by extremists promising her a solution. <eob>
What this imam did was to connect her back <eol> to God and to her community. <eob>
He didn't shame her for her rage -- <eol> instead, he gave her constructive ways <eob> to make real change in the world. <eob>
What she learned at that mosque prevented her <eol> from going to join ISIS. <eob>
I've told you a little bit <eob> about how Islamophobia <eol> affects me and my family. <eob>
But how does it impact ordinary Americans? <eob>
How does it impact everyone else? <eob>
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day <eol> affect the health of our democracy, <eob> the health of our free thought? <eob>
Well, one study -- actually, <eol> several studies in neuroscience -- <eob> show that when we're afraid, <eol> at least three things happen. <eob>
We become more accepting <eol> of authoritarianism, <eob> conformity and prejudice. <eob>
One study showed that when subjects <eol> were exposed to news stories <eob> that were negative about Muslims, <eob> they became more accepting <eol> of military attacks on Muslim countries <eob> and policies that curtail <eol> the rights of American Muslims. <eob>
Now, this isn't just academic. <eob>
When you look at <eol> when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked <eob> between 2001 and 2013, <eob> it happened three times, <eob> but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. <eob>
It was in the run up to the Iraq War <eol> and during two election cycles. <eob>
So Islamophobia isn't just the natural <eol> response to Muslim terrorism <eob> as I would have expected. <eob>
It can actually be a tool <eol> of public manipulation, <eob> eroding the very foundation <eol> of a free society, <eob> which is rational and well-informed citizens. <eob>
Muslims are like canaries <eol> in the coal mine. <eob>
We might be the first to feel it, <eob> but the toxic air of fear <eol> is harming us all. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And assigning collective guilt <eob> isn't just about having <eol> to explain yourself all the time. <eob>
Deah and his wife Yusor <eol> were a young married couple <eob> living in Chapel <eol> Hill, North Carolina, <eob> where they both went to school. <eob>
Deah was an athlete. <eob>
He was in dental school, <eol> talented, promising ... <eob> And his sister would tell me <eol> that he was the sweetest, <eob> most generous human being she knew. <eob>
She was visiting him there <eol> and he showed her his resume, <eob> and she was amazed. <eob>
She said, "When did my baby brother <eol> become such an accomplished young man?" <eob> Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit <eol> to her brother and his new wife, <eob> their neighbor, <eob> Craig Stephen Hicks, <eob> murdered them, <eob> as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting <eol> for the afternoon, <eob> in their apartment, <eob> execution style, <eob> after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page. <eob>
He shot Deah eight times. <eob>
So bigotry isn't just immoral, <eol> it can even be lethal. <eob>
So, back to my story. <eob> What happened after 9 / 11? <eob>
Did we go to the mosque or did <eol> we play it safe and stay home? <eob>
Well, we talked it over, <eob> and it might seem <eol> like a small decision, but to us, <eob> it was about what kind of America <eol> we wanted to leave for our kids: <eob> one that would control us by fear <eob> or one where we were practicing <eol> our religion freely. <eob>
So we decided to go to the mosque. <eob>
And we put my son in his car seat, <eob> buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque. <eob>
I took him out, I took off my shoes, <eol> I walked into the prayer hall <eob> and what I saw made me stop. <eob>
The place was completely full. <eob>
And then the imam made <eol> an announcement, <eob> thanking and welcoming our guests, <eob> because half the congregation <eob> were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, <eob> people of faith and no faith, <eob> who had come not to attack us, <eol> but to stand in solidarity with us. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I just break down at this time. <eob>
These people were there <eol> because they chose courage and compassion <eob> over panic and prejudice. <eob>
What will you choose? <eob> What will you choose at this time <eol> of fear and bigotry? <eob>
Will you play it safe? <eob>
Or will you join those who say <eob> we are better than that? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem <eol> to have struck a chord. <eob>
But I wonder, <eob> what would you say <eol> to those who might argue <eob> that you're giving a TED Talk, <eob> you're clearly a deep thinker, <eob> you work at a fancy think tank, <eob> you're an exception, <eol> you're not the rule. <eob>
What would you say to those people? <eob>
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, <eol> don't let this stage distract you, <eob> I'm completely ordinary. <eob>
I'm not an exception. <eob>
My story is not unusual. <eob>
I am as ordinary as they come. <eob>
When you look at Muslims around the world -- <eob> and I've done this, <eol> I've done the largest study ever done <eob> on Muslims around the world -- <eob> people want ordinary things. <eob> They want prosperity for their family, <eob> they want jobs <eob> and they want to live in peace. <eob>
So I am not in any way an exception. <eob>
When you meet people who seem <eol> like an exception to the rule, <eob> oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, <eob> not that they're an exception to it. <eob>
HW: <eob> Thank you <eob> so much. Dalia Mogahed. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- <eob> I want to talk about the future <eol> of human-driven transportation; <eob> about how we can cut <eol> congestion, pollution and parking <eob> by getting more people into fewer cars; <eob> and how we can do it with the technology <eol> that's in our pockets. <eob>
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ... <eob> not self-driving cars. <eob>
But to get started we've got <eol> to go back over 100 years. <eob>
Because it turns out there <eol> was an Uber way before Uber. <eob>
And if it had survived, <eob> the future of transportation <eol> would probably already be here. <eob>
So let me introduce you to the jitney. <eob>
In 1914 it was created <eol> or invented by a guy named LP Draper. <eob>
He was a car salesman from LA, <eol> and he had an idea. <eob>
Well, he was cruising <eol> around downtown Los Angeles, <eob> my hometown, <eob> and he saw trolleys <eob> with long lines of people trying <eol> to get to where they wanted to go. <eob>
He said, well, why don't I just put <eol> a sign on my car <eob> that takes people wherever <eol> they want to go for a jitney -- <eob> that was slang for a nickel. <eob>
And so people jumped on board, <eob> and not just in Los Angeles <eol> but across the country. <eob>
And within one year, <eob> by 1915, <eob> there were 50,000 rides <eol> per day in Seattle, <eob> 45,000 rides per day in Kansas <eob> and 150,000 rides per day <eol> in Los Angeles. <eob>
To give you some perspective, <eob> Uber in Los Angeles <eob> is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ... <eob> 100 years later. <eob>
And so these are the trolley guys, <eob> the existing transportation <eol> monopoly at the time. <eob>
They were clearly not happy <eol> about the jitney juggernaut. <eob>
And so they got to work <eob> and they went to cities <eol> across the country <eob> and got regulations put in place <eol> to slow down the growth of the jitney. <eob>
And there were all kinds of regulations. <eob>
There were licenses -- often <eol> they were pricey. <eob>
In some cities, <eob> if you were a jitney driver, <eob> you were required to be in the jitney <eol> for 16 hours a day. <eob>
In other cities, <eob> they required two jitney drivers <eol> for one jitney. <eob>
But there was a really interesting regulation <eob> which was they had to put <eol> a backseat light -- <eob> install it in every Jitney -- <eob> to stop a new pernicious innovation <eol> which they called spooning. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
All right. So what happened? <eob> Well, within a year <eol> this thing had taken off. <eob>
But the jitney, by 1919, <eol> was regulated completely out of existence. <eob>
That's unfortunate ... <eob> because, well, when you can't share a car, <eol> then you have to own one. <eob>
And car ownership skyrocketed <eob> and it's no wonder that by 2007, <eob> there was a car for every man, <eol> woman and child in the United States. <eob>
And that phenomenon had gone global. <eob>
In China by 2011, <eob> there were more car sales happening <eol> in China than in the US. <eob>
Now, all this private ownership <eol> of course had a public cost. <eob>
In the US, we spend <eol> 7 billion hours a year, <eob> wasted, sitting in traffic. <eob>
160 billion dollars in lost productivity, <eob> of course also sitting in traffic, <eob> and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint <eob> is spewed out in the air by those cars <eol> that we're sitting in. <eob>
Now, that's only four percent <eol> of our problem though. <eob>
Because if you have to own a car <eob> then that means 96 percent of the time <eol> your car is sitting idle. <eob>
And so, up to 30 percent <eol> of our land and our space <eob> is used storing these hunks of steel. <eob>
We even have skyscrapers built for cars. <eob>
That's the world we live in today. <eob>
Now, cities have been dealing <eol> with this problem for decades. <eob>
It's called mass transit. <eob>
And even in a city like New York City, <eob> one of the most densely populated in the world <eob> and one of the most sophisticated <eol> mass transit systems in the world, <eob> there are still 2.5 million cars <eol> that go over those bridges every day. <eob> Why is that? <eob> Well, it's because mass transit <eol> hasn't yet figured out <eob> how to get to everybody's doorstep. <eob>
And so back in San Francisco, <eol> where I live, <eob> the situation's much worse, <eob> in fact, much worse around the world. <eob>
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- <eob> well, we just wanted to push a button <eol> and get a ride. <eob>
We didn't have any grand ambitions. <eob>
But it just turned out <eob> that lots of people wanted <eol> to push a button and get a ride, <eob> and ultimately what we started to see <eol> was a lot of duplicate rides. <eob>
We saw a lot of people <eob> pushing the same button at the same time <eob> going essentially to the same place. <eob>
And so we started thinking about, <eob> well, how do we make those two trips <eol> and turn them into one. <eob>
Because if we did, <eol> that ride would be a lot cheaper — <eob> up to 50 percent cheaper — <eob> and of course for the city <eob> you've got a lot more people <eol> and a lot fewer cars. <eob>
And so the big question for us was: <eob> would it work? <eob>
Could you have a cheaper ride <eob> cheap enough that people <eol> would be willing to share it? <eob>
And the answer, fortunately, <eol> is a resounding yes. <eob>
In San Francisco, <eob> before uberPOOL, we had -- <eob> well, everybody would take <eol> their car wherever the heck they wanted. <eob>
And the bright colors is where <eol> we have the most cars. <eob>
And once we introduced uberPOOL, <eob> well, you see <eol> there's not as many bright colors. <eob>
More people getting around the city <eol> in fewer cars, <eob> taking cars off the road. <eob>
It looks like uberPOOL is working. <eob>
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles <eob> eight months ago. <eob>
And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles <eol> off the roads <eob> and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons <eol> of CO2 out of the air. <eob>
But the part that I'm really -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But my favorite statistic -- <eob> remember, I'm from LA, <eob> I spent years of my life <eob> sitting behind the wheel, <eol> going, "How do we fix this?" -- <eob> my favorite part is that eight months later, <eob> we have added 100,000 new people <eol> that are carpooling every week. <eob>
Now, in China everything is supersized, <eob> and so we're doing 15 million <eol> uberPOOL trips per month, <eob> that's 500,000 per day. <eob>
And of course we're seeing <eol> that exponential growth happen. <eob>
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too. <eob> And when I talk to my team, <eol> we don't talk about, <eob> "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling <eol> every week and we're done." <eob> How do we get that to a million? <eob> And in China, well, that could be <eol> several million. <eob>
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution <eol> for urban carpooling. <eob>
But what about the suburbs? <eob>
This is the street <eol> where I grew up in Los Angeles, <eob> it's actually a suburb <eol> called Northridge, California, <eob> and, well -- <eob> look, those mailboxes, <eol> they kind of just go on forever. <eob>
And every morning at about the same time, <eob> cars roll of out their driveway, <eob> most of them, one person in the car, <eob> and they go to work, they go <eol> to their place of work. <eob>
So the question for us is: <eob> well, how do we turn <eob> all of these commuter cars -- <eob> and literally there's tens <eol> of millions of them -- <eob> how do we turn all these commuter cars <eol> into shared cars? <eob>
Well, we have something for this <eol> that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE. <eob>
You get up in the morning, <eol> get ready for work, get your coffee, <eob> go to your car <eob> and you light up the Uber app, <eob> and all of a sudden, <eob> you become an Uber driver. <eob>
And we'll match you up <eol> with one of your neighbors <eob> on your way to work <eob> and it's a really great thing. <eob>
There's just one hitch ... <eob> it's called regulation. <eob>
So 54 cents a mile, what is that? <eob>
Well, that is what the US government <eob> has determined that the cost <eol> of owning a car is per mile. <eob>
You can pick up anybody <eol> in the United States <eob> and take them wherever they want <eol> to go at a moment's notice, <eob> for 54 cents a mile or less. <eob>
But if you charge 60 cents a mile, <eol> you're a criminal. <eob>
But what if for 60 cents a mile <eob> we could get half a million <eol> more people carpooling in Los Angeles? <eob>
And what if at 60 cents a mile <eob> we could get 50 million people <eol> carpooling in the United States? <eob>
If we could, <eob> it's obviously something we should do. <eob>
And so it goes back <eol> to the lesson of the jitney. <eob>
If <eob> by 1915 <eob> this thing was taking off, <eob> imagine without the regulations that happened, <eob> if that thing could just keep going. <eob>
How would our cities be different today? <eob>
Would we have parks in the place <eol> of parking lots? <eob>
Well, we lost that chance. <eob>
But technology has given us <eol> another opportunity. <eob>
Now, I'm as excited as anybody <eol> else about self-driving cars <eob> but do we have to really wait <eol> five, 10 or even 20 years <eob> to make our new cities a reality? <eob>
With the technology <eol> in our pockets today, <eob> and a little smart regulation, <eob> we can turn every car <eol> into a shared car, <eob> and we can reclaim our cities starting today. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you. <eob>
Travis Kalanick: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built <eol> is absolutely astounding. <eob>
You only just talked about a small part <eol> of it here -- <eob> a powerful part -- <eob> the idea of turning cars <eol> into public transport like that, <eob> it's cool. <eob>
But I've got a couple other questions <eob> because I know they're out there <eol> on people's minds. <eob>
So first of all, last week I think it was, <eob> I switched on my phone <eol> and tried to book an Uber <eob> and I couldn't find the app. <eob>
You had this very radical, <eol> very bold, brave redesign. <eob>
TK: Sure. <eob>
CA: How did it go? <eob>
Did you notice other people not <eol> finding the app that day? <eob>
Are you going to win people <eol> over for this redesign? <eob>
TK: Well, first I should <eol> probably just say, <eob> well, what we were trying to accomplish. <eob>
And I think if you know <eol> a little bit about our history, <eob> it makes a lot more sense. <eob>
Which is, when we first got started, <eob> it was just black cars. <eob>
It was literally you push a button <eol> and get an S-Class. <eob> And so what we did <eob> was almost what I would call <eol> an immature version of a luxury brand <eob> that looked like a badge <eol> on a luxury car. <eob>
And as we've gone worldwide <eob> and gone from S-Classes <eol> to auto rickshaws in India, <eob> it became something <eol> that was important for us <eob> to be more accessible, <eob> to be more hyperlocal, <eob> to be about the cities <eol> we were in <eob> and that's what you see <eol> with the patterns and colors. <eob>
And to be more iconic, <eob> because a U doesn't mean <eol> anything in Sanskrit, <eob> and a U doesn't mean <eol> anything in Mandarin. <eob>
And so that was a little bit <eol> what it was about. <eob>
Now, when you first roll out <eol> something like that, <eob> I mean, your hands are sweating, <eob> you've got -- <eob> you know, you're a little worried. <eob>
What we saw is a lot of people -- <eob> actually, at the beginning, we saw <eol> a lot more people opening the app <eob> because they were curious <eol> what they would find when they opened it. <eob>
And our numbers were slightly up <eol> from what we expected. <eob>
CA: OK, that's cool. <eob>
Now, so you, yourself, <eol> are something of an enigma, I would say. <eob>
Your supporters and investors, <eol> who have been with you the whole way, <eob> believe that the only chance <eob> of sort of taking on the powerful, <eol> entrenched interests <eob> of taxi industry and so forth, <eob> is to have someone <eol> who is a fierce, relentless competitor, <eob> which you've certainly proved to be. <eob>
Some people feel <eol> you've almost taken that culture too far, <eob> and you know -- like a year or two ago <eob> there was a huge controversy <eol> where a lot of women got upset. <eob>
How did it feel like inside the company <eol> during that period? <eob>
Did you notice a loss of business? <eob>
Did you learn anything from that? <eob>
TK: Well, look, I think -- <eob> I've been an entrepreneur <eol> since I've been in high school <eob> and you have -- <eob> In various different ways <eol> an entrepreneur will see hard times <eob> and for us, <eob> it was about a year and a half ago, <eob> and for us it was hard times, too. <eob>
Now, inside, we felt like -- <eob> I guess at the end of the day <eob> we felt like we were good people doing good work, <eob> but on the outside <eol> that wasn't evident. <eob>
And so there was a lot <eol> that we had to do <eob> to sort of -- <eob> We'd gone from a very small company -- <eob> I mean if you go <eol> literally two and a half years ago, <eob> our company was 400 people, <eob> and today it's 6,500. <eob>
And so when you go through that growth, <eob> you have to sort of cement <eol> your cultural values <eob> and talk about them all of the time. <eob>
And make sure that people <eol> are constantly checking <eob> to say, "Are we good people doing good work?" <eob> And if you check those boxes, <eob> the next part of that is making <eol> sure you're telling your story. <eob>
And I think we learned <eol> a lot of lessons <eob> but I think at the end of it <eol> we came out stronger. <eob>
But it was certainly a difficult period. <eob>
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn, <eob> you're facing people who occasionally <eol> give you a hard time. <eob>
Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere <eob> are mad as hell now because you changed the fees <eob> and they can barely -- they claim -- <eol> barely afford the deal anymore. <eob>
How -- <eob> You know, you said that you started <eol> this originally -- <eob> just the coolness of pressing <eol> a button and summoning a ride. <eob>
This thing's taken off, <eob> you're affecting the whole <eol> global economy, basically, at this point. <eob>
You're being forced to be, <eol> whether you want it or not, <eob> a kind of global visionary <eol> who's changing the world. <eob> I mean -- who are you? <eob> Do you want that? <eob> Are you ready to go with that <eol> and be what that takes? <eob>
TK: Well, there's a few things <eol> packed in that question, so -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
First is on the pricing side -- <eob> I mean, keep in mind, right? <eob>
UberX, when we first started, <eob> was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper <eol> than our black car product. <eob>
It's now <eob> in many cities, half the price of a taxi. <eob>
And we have all the data to show <eob> that the divers are making more per hour <eol> than they would as taxi drivers. <eob>
What happens is when the price goes down, <eob> people are more likely to take Uber <eob> at different times of the day <eol> than they otherwise would have, <eob> and they're more likely to use it in places <eol> they wouldn't have before. <eob>
And what that means for a driver <eol> is wherever he or she drops somebody off, <eob> they're much more likely <eol> to get a pickup and get back in. <eob>
And so what that means is more trips per hour, <eob> more minutes of the hour <eol> where they're productive <eob> and actually, earnings come up. <eob>
And we have cities where we've done <eol> literally five or six price cuts <eob> and have seen those price cuts <eol> go up over time. <eob>
So even in New York -- <eob> We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" -- <eob> compare the earnings <eob> September after September after September. <eob>
Same month every year. <eob>
And we see the earnings going up over time <eob> as the price comes down. <eob>
And there's a perfect price point -- <eol> you can't go down forever. <eob>
And in those places <eol> where we bring the price down <eob> but we don't see <eol> those earnings pop, <eob> we bring the prices back up. <eob>
So that addresses that first part. <eob>
And then the enigma and all of this -- <eob> I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am <eob> is one that gets really excited <eol> about solving hard problems. <eob>
And the way I like to describe it <eol> is it's kind of like a math professor. <eob> You know? If a math professor doesn't have <eol> hard problems to solve, <eob> that's a really sad math professor. <eob>
And so at Uber we like the hard problems <eob> and we like getting excited <eol> about those and solving them. <eob>
But we don't want just any math problem, <eob> we want the hardest ones <eol> that we can possibly find, <eob> and we want the one that if you solve it, <eob> there's a little bit of a wow factor. <eob>
CA: In a couple years' time -- <eob> say five years' time, <eol> I don't know when -- <eob> you roll out your incredible <eol> self-driving cars, <eob> at probably a lower cost than you currently <eol> pay for an Uber ride. <eob>
What do you say to your army <eol> of a million drivers plus at that time? <eob>
TK: Explain that again -- at which time? <eob>
CA: At the time when self-driving cars <eol> are coming -- <eob>
TK: Sure, <eob> sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that. <eob>
CA: What do you say to a driver? <eob>
TK: Well, look, I think the first part <eol> is it's going to take — <eob> it's likely going to take a lot longer <eob> than I think some of the hype or media might expect. <eob> That's part one. <eob>
Part two is it's going to also take -- <eob> there's going to be a long transition. <eob>
These cars will work in certain places <eol> and not in others. <eob>
For us it's an interesting <eol> challenge, right? <eob>
Because, well -- <eob> Google's been investing in this since 2007, <eob> Tesla's going to be doing it, <eol> Apple's going to be doing it, <eob> the manufacturers are going to be doing it. <eob>
This is a world that's going <eol> to exist, and for good reason. <eob>
A million people die a year in cars. <eob>
And we already looked at the billions <eol> or even trillions of hours worldwide <eob> that people are spending sitting <eol> in them, driving frustrated, anxious. <eob>
And think about the quality <eol> of life that improves <eob> when you give people their time back <eob> and it's not so anxiety-ridden. <eob>
So I think there's a lot of good. <eob>
And so the way we think about it <eol> is that it's a challenge, <eob> but one for optimistic leadership, <eob> Where instead of resisting -- <eob> resisting technology, <eob> maybe like the taxi industry, <eol> or the trolley industry -- <eob> we have to embrace it or be a part of the future. <eob>
But how do we optimistically <eol> lead through it? <eob>
Are there ways to partner with cities? <eob>
Are there ways to have education <eol> systems, vocational training, etc., <eob> for that transition period. <eob>
It will take a lot longer <eol> than I think we all expect, <eob> especially that transition period. <eob>
But it is a world that's going to exist, <eob> and it is going to be a better world. <eob>
CA: Travis, what you're building <eol> is absolutely incredible <eob> and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED <eol> and sharing so openly. <eob>
Thank you <eob> so much. TK: Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I moved to Harare in 1985, <eob> social justice was <eol> at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. <eob>
The new government emerged <eol> from a long war of independence <eob> and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: <eob> health care services, primary education <eob> became essentially free. <eob>
A massive expansion of rural health centers <eob> placed roughly 80 percent <eol> of the population <eob> less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, <eob> a truly remarkable accomplishment. <eob>
In 1980, the year of independence, <eob> 25 percent of Zimbabwean children <eol> were fully immunized. <eob>
By 1990, a mere decade later, <eob> this proportion stood at 80 percent. <eob>
I felt tremendously privileged to be part <eol> of this transformation, <eob> a revolution. <eob>
The excitement, the camaraderie, <eol> was palpable. <eob>
Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- <eob> scientists, doctors, activists -- <eob> I felt connected not only <eol> to an African independence movement, <eob> but to a global progressive <eol> public health movement. <eob>
But there were daunting challenges. <eob>
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case <eol> in 1985, the year I arrived. <eob>
I had taken care of a few patients <eol> with AIDS in the early 1980s, <eob> when I did my medical training <eol> at Harlem Hospital, but -- <eob> we had no idea what lay <eol> in store for Africa. <eob>
Infection rate stood at about two percent <eol> in my early days there. <eob>
These would soar <eob> to one out of every four adults <eob> by the time I left Harare 17 years later. <eob>
By the mid-1990s, <eob> I'd told hundreds of people <eol> in the prime of life <eob> that they were HIV-positive. <eob>
I saw colleagues and friends die, <eob> my students, hospital patients, die. <eob>
In response, my colleagues <eol> and I set up a clinic. <eob>
We did condom demonstrations. <eob>
We launched school education <eol> and workplace interventions. <eob> We did research. We counseled the partners <eol> of infected men <eob> about how to protect themselves. <eob>
We worked hard, and at the time, <eol> I believed that I was doing my best. <eob>
I was providing excellent treatment, <eob> such as it was. <eob>
But I was not talking <eol> about structural change. <eob>
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan <eol> has spoken candidly <eob> about his personal failure <eob> leading to the Rwandan genocide. <eob>
In 1994, he was head <eol> of the UN peacekeeping department. <eob>
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, <eob> he reflected, "I believed <eol> at the time I was doing my best, <eob> but I realized after the genocide <eob> that there was more I could and should have done <eob> to sound the alarm and rally support." <eob>
The AIDS epidemic caught <eol> the health community unprepared, <eob> and today, when the World Health <eol> Organization estimates <eob> that 39 million people <eol> have lost their lives to this disease, <eob> I'm not alone in feeling <eol> remorse and regret <eob> at not having done more earlier. <eob>
But while living in Zimbabwe, <eob> I didn't see my role as an advocacy <eol> or a political one. <eob>
I was there for my technical skills, <eob> both my clinical and my research <eol> epidemiology skills. <eob>
And in my mind, my job <eol> was to take care of patients <eob> and to do research to better understand <eol> the population patterns of transmission, <eob> and I hoped that we'd slow <eol> the spread of the virus. <eob>
I was aware that socially marginalized <eol> populations were at disproportionate risk <eob> of getting and dying of AIDS. <eob>
And on the sugar plantations, <eob> which really more closely resembled <eol> feudal fiefdoms <eob> than any modern enterprise, <eob> 60 percent of pregnant women <eob> tested HIV-positive. <eob>
I worked to show how getting infected <eol> was not a moral failure <eob> but instead related to a culture <eol> of male superiority, <eob> to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. <eob>
Whites were largely unscathed. <eob>
As health professionals, <eob> our tools were pitifully weak: <eob> imploring people to change <eol> their individual behaviors, <eob> use condoms, reduce number of partners. <eob>
Infection rates climbed, <eob> and when treatment became available <eol> in the West, <eob> treatment that remains our most potent weapon <eob> against this virus, <eob> it was unaffordable <eol> to the public sector across Africa. <eob>
I didn't speak out <eob> about the unequal access <eol> to these life-saving drugs <eob> or about the underlying economic <eol> and political systems <eob> that were driving infection rates <eob> in such huge swaths of the population. <eob>
I rationalized my silence <eob> by reminding myself <eol> that I was a guest in the country, <eob> that sounding the alarm <eol> could even get me kicked out, <eob> keep me from doing good work, <eob> taking care of my patients, <eob> doing much-needed research. <eob>
So <eob> I didn't speak out <eob> about the government's early stance on AIDS. <eob>
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough. <eob>
Many doctors, health professionals, <eob> may think I did nothing wrong. <eob>
Our pact with our patients, <eob> the Hippocratic Oath <eol> and its variants, <eob> is about the sanctity <eol> of the patient-doctor relationship. <eob>
And I did everything I could <eob> for each and every patient of mine. <eob>
But I knew <eob> that epidemics emerge <eol> along the fissures of our society, <eob> reflecting not only biology, <eob> but more importantly patterns of marginal <eol>ization, exclusion, <eob> discrimination related to race, <eol> gender, sexuality, class and more. <eob> It was true of AIDS. <eob>
It was true just recently of Ebola. <eob>
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, <eob> who worked on AIDS in Haiti, <eob> call this structural violence: <eob> structural because inequities are embedded <eob> in the political and economic organization <eol> of our social world, <eob> often in ways that are invisible <eol> to those with privilege and power; <eob> and violence because its impact -- <eob> premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent. <eob>
We do little for our patients <eob> if we fail to recognize <eob> these social injustices. <eob>
Sounding the alarm is the first step <eol> towards doing public health right, <eob> and it's how we may rally support <eob> to break through and create real change together. <eob>
So these days, I'm not staying quiet. <eob>
I'm speaking up about a lot of things, <eob> even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, <eob> even when it makes me uncomfortable. <eob>
And a lot of this <eol> is about racial disparities <eob> and institutionalized racism, <eob> things that we're not supposed <eol> to have in this country anymore, <eob> certainly not in the practice <eol> of medicine <eob> or public health. <eob>
But we have them, <eob> and we pay for them in lives cut short. <eob>
That's why sounding the alarm <eob> about the impact of racism <eol> on health in the United States, <eob> the ongoing institutional <eol> and interpersonal violence <eob> that people of color face, <eob> compounded by our tragic legacy <eob> of 250 years of slavery, <eob> 90 years of Jim Crow <eob> and 60 years of imperfect equality, <eob> sounding the alarm about this <eob> is central to doing my job right <eob> as New York City's Health Commissioner. <eob>
In New York City, premature mortality -- <eol> that's death before the age of 65 -- <eob> is 50 percent higher for black men <eol> than white ones. <eob>
A black woman in 2012 <eob> faced more than 10 times the risk <eol> of dying related to childbirth <eob> as a white woman. <eob>
And though we've made enormous strides <eob> in reducing infant mortality rates, <eob> a black baby still faces <eob> nearly three times the risk <eol> of death in its first year of life <eob> as compared to a white baby. <eob>
New York City's not exceptional. <eob>
These statistics are paralleled <eob> by statistics found <eol> across the United States. <eob>
A recent New York Times analysis <eob> reported that there are 1.5 million <eol> missing black men across the country. <eob>
They noted that more than one <eob> out of every six black men <eob> who today should be between the ages <eol> of 25 and 54 years <eob> have disappeared from daily life, <eob> lost either to prison <eol> or premature death. <eob>
There is great injustice <eob> in the daily and disproportionate <eol> violence faced by young black men, <eob> the focus of recent protests <eol> under the banner #BlackLivesMatter. <eob>
But we have to remember <eob> that enduring and disparate rates <eob> and the occurrence and outcome <eol> of common medical conditions -- <eob> heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- <eob> diseases that may kill slowly <eol> and quietly <eob> and take even more black lives prematurely. <eob>
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, <eob> I felt frustrated and angry <eob> that the medical community <eob> has been reluctant to even use <eol> the word "racism" <eob> in our research and our work. <eob>
You've probably felt something <eol> every time I've said it. <eob>
Our medical students held die-ins <eol> in their white coats, <eob> but the medical community <eol> has largely stood by passively <eob> as ongoing discrimination continues to affect <eob> the disease profile and mortality. <eob>
And I worry <eob> that the trend towards personalized <eol> and precision medicine, <eob> looking for biological or genetic <eol> targets to better tailor treatment, <eob> may inadvertently cause us <eol> to lose sight of the big picture, <eob> that it is the daily context, <eob> where a person lives, grows, <eob> works, loves, <eob> that most importantly determines <eol> population health, <eob> and for too many of us, poor health. <eob>
As health professionals <eob> in our daily work, <eob> whether in the clinic or doing research, <eob> we are witness to great injustice: <eob> the homeless person <eol> who is unable to follow medical advice <eob> because he has more pressing priorities; <eob> the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide <eob> because our society is just so harsh; <eob> the single mother who has been made <eol> to feel that she is responsible <eob> for the poor health of her child. <eob>
Our role as health professionals <eob> is not just to treat our patients <eob> but to sound the alarm <eob> and advocate for change. <eob>
Rightfully or not, <eob> our societal position <eol> gives our voices great credibility, <eob> and we shouldn't waste that. <eob>
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, <eob> and I've promised myself <eob> that <eob> as New York City's Health Commissioner, <eob> I will use every opportunity I have <eob> to sound the alarm and rally support <eob> for health equity. <eob>
I will speak out against racism, <eob> and I hope you will join me, <eob> and I will join you when you <eol> speak out against sexism <eob> or any other form of inequality. <eob>
It's time for us to rise up <eob> and collectively speak up <eob> about structural inequality. <eob>
We don't have to have all the answers <eob> to call for change. <eob>
We just need courage. <eob>
The health of our patients, <eob> the health of us all, depends on it. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to tell you the story <eob> about the time I almost got kidnapped <eob> in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata. <eob>
It's the day after graduating <eol> from design school <eob> and I'm having a yard sale. <eob>
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda <eob> and he starts looking through my stuff. <eob>
And he buys a piece of art that I made. <eob>
And it turns out <eol> he's alone in town for the night, <eob> driving cross-country on a road trip <eob> before he goes into the Peace Corps. <eob>
So I invite him out for a beer <eob> and he tells me all about his passion <eob> for making a difference in the world. <eob>
Now it's starting to get late, <eob> and I'm getting pretty tired. <eob>
As I motion for the tab, <eob> I make the mistake of asking him, <eob> "So where are you staying tonight?" <eob> And he makes it worse by saying, <eob> "Actually, I don't have a place." <eob> And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!" <eob> What do you do? <eob>
We've all been there, right? <eob>
Do I offer to host this guy? <eob>
But, I just met him -- I mean, <eob> he says he's going <eol> to the Peace Corps, <eob> but I don't really know if he's going <eol> to the Peace Corps <eob> and I don't want to end up kidnapped <eol> in the trunk of a Miata. <eob>
That's a small trunk! <eob>
So then I hear myself saying, <eob> "Hey, I have an airbed you <eol> can stay on in my living room." <eob> And the voice in my head goes, <eob> "Wait, what?" <eob>
That night, I'm laying in bed, <eob> I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, <eob> "Oh my god, what have I done? <eob>
There's a complete stranger sleeping <eol> in my living room. <eob>
What if he's psychotic?" <eob> My anxiety grows so much, <eob> I leap out of bed, <eob> I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, <eob> and I lock the bedroom door. <eob>
It turns out he was not psychotic. <eob>
We've kept in touch ever since. <eob>
And the piece of art he bought <eol> at the yard sale <eob> is hanging in his classroom; <eol> he's a teacher now. <eob>
This was my first hosting experience, <eob> and it completely changed my perspective. <eob>
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me <eol> to label as strangers <eob> were actually friends waiting to be discovered. <eob>
The idea of hosting people on airbeds <eol> gradually became natural to me <eob> and when I moved to San Francisco, <eob> I brought the airbed with me. <eob>
So now it's two years later. <eob> I'm unemployed, <eol> I'm almost broke, <eob> my roommate moves out, <eol> and then the rent goes up. <eob>
And then I learn <eol> there's a design conference coming to town, <eob> and all the hotels are sold out. <eob>
And I've always believed <eol> that turning fear into fun <eob> is the gift of creativity. <eob>
So here's what I pitch my best friend <eol> and my new roommate Brian Chesky: <eob> "Brian, thought of a way <eol> to make a few bucks -- <eob> turning our place <eol> into 'designers bed and breakfast,' <eob> offering young designers <eol> who come to town a place to crash, <eob> complete with wireless Internet, <eol> a small desk space, <eob> sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning. <eob> Ha!" <eob>
We built a basic website <eol> and Airbed and Breakfast was born. <eob>
Three lucky guests got to stay <eob> on a 20-dollar airbed <eol> on the hardwood floor. <eob>
But they loved it, and so did we. <eob>
I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets <eol> we made <eob> tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. <eob>
We took them on adventures <eol> around the city, <eob> and when we said goodbye <eol> to the last guest, <eob> the door latch clicked, <eob> Brian and I just stared at each other. <eob>
Did we just discover it was possible <eol> to make friends <eob> while also making rent? <eob> The wheels had started to turn. <eob>
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, <eob> joined as engineering co-founder. <eob>
And we buckled down to see <eob> if we could turn this into a business. <eob>
Here's what we pitched investors: <eob> "We want to build a website <eob> where people publicly post <eol> pictures of their most intimate spaces, <eob> their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- <eob> the kinds of rooms you usually keep <eol> closed when people come over. <eob>
And then, over the Internet, <eob> they're going to invite complete strangers <eol> to come sleep in their homes. <eob>
It's going to be huge!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We sat back, and we waited for <eol> the rocket ship to blast off. <eob> It did not. <eob> No one in their right minds <eol> would invest in a service <eob> that allows strangers <eol> to sleep in people's homes. <eob> Why? <eob> Because we've all been taught <eol> as kids, strangers equal danger. <eob>
Now, when you're faced with a problem, <eol> you fall back on what you know, <eob> and all we really knew was design. <eob>
In art school, you learn <eol> that design is much more <eob> than the look and feel of something -- <eol> it's the whole experience. <eob>
We learned to do that for objects, <eob> but here, we were aiming <eol> to build Olympic trust <eob> between people who had never met. <eob>
Could design make that happen? <eob>
Is it possible to design for trust? <eob>
I want to give you a sense <eol> of the flavor of trust <eob> that we were aiming to achieve. <eob>
I've got a 30-second experiment <eob> that will push you past your comfort zone. <eob> If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up. <eob>
OK, I need you to take out your phones. <eob> Now that you have your phone out, <eob> I'd like you to unlock your phone. <eob>
Now hand your unlocked phone <eol> to the person on your left. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That tiny sense of panic <eol> you're feeling right now -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
is exactly how hosts feel <eol> the first time they open their home. <eob>
Because the only thing <eol> more personal than your phone <eob> is your home. <eob>
People don't just see your messages, <eob> they see your bedroom, <eob> your kitchen, your toilet. <eob>
Now, how does it feel <eol> holding someone's unlocked phone? <eob>
Most of us feel really responsible. <eob>
That's how most guests feel <eol> when they stay in a home. <eob>
And it's because of this <eol> that our company can even exist. <eob>
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Would you tell Twitter <eol> he's running for President? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
OK, you can hand your phones back now. <eob>
So now that you've experienced <eol> the kind of trust challenge <eob> we were facing, <eob> I'd love to share a few discoveries <eol> we've made along the way. <eob>
What if we changed one small thing <eob> about the design of that experiment? <eob>
What if your neighbor had introduced <eol> themselves first, with their name, <eob> where they're from, the name <eol> of their kids or their dog? <eob>
Imagine that they had 150 reviews <eol> of people saying, <eob> "They're great at holding unlocked phones!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now how would you feel <eol> about handing your phone over? <eob>
It turns out, <eob> a well-designed reputation <eol> system is key for building trust. <eob>
And we didn't actually get it <eol> right the first time. <eob>
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews. <eob>
Eventually, we learned to wait <eol> until both guests and hosts <eob> left the review before we reveal them. <eob>
Now, here's a discovery <eol> we made just last week. <eob>
We did a joint study with Stanford, <eob> where we looked at people's willing <eol>ness to trust someone <eob> based on how similar they are in <eol> age, location and geography. <eob>
The research showed, not surprisingly, <eob> we prefer people who are like us. <eob>
The more different somebody is, <eob> the less we trust them. <eob>
Now, that's a natural social bias. <eob>
But what's interesting is what happens <eob> when you add reputation into the mix, <eob> in this case, with reviews. <eob>
Now, if you've got less <eol> than three reviews, <eob> nothing changes. <eob>
But if you've got more than 10, <eob> everything changes. <eob>
High reputation beats high similarity. <eob>
The right design can actually <eol> help us overcome <eob> one of our most deeply rooted biases. <eob>
Now we also learned that building <eol> the right amount of trust <eob> takes the right amount of disclosure. <eob>
This is what happens when a guest <eol> first messages a host. <eob>
If you share too little, like, "Yo," <eob> acceptance rates go down. <eob>
And if you share too much, like, <eob> "I'm having issues with my mother," <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
acceptance rates also go down. <eob>
But there's a zone that's just right, <eob> like, "Love the artwork in your place. <eob>
Coming for vacation <eol> with my family. <eob> "So how do we design <eol> for just the right amount of disclosure? <eob>
We use the size of the box <eol> to suggest the right length, <eob> and we guide them with prompts <eol> to encourage sharing. <eob>
We bet our whole company <eob> on the hope that, <eob> with the right design, <eob> people would be willing <eol> to overcome the stranger-danger bias. <eob>
What we didn't realize <eob> is just how many people <eob> were ready and waiting <eol> to put the bias aside. <eob>
This is a graph that shows <eol> our rate of adoption. <eob>
There's three things happening here. <eob>
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck. <eob>
The second is the efforts of our team. <eob>
And third is the existence <eol> of a previously unsatisfied need. <eob>
Now, things have been going pretty well. <eob>
Obviously, there are times <eol> when things don't work out. <eob>
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties <eob> and trashed homes. <eob>
Hosts have left guests <eol> stranded in the rain. <eob>
In the early days, <eol> I was customer service, <eob> and those calls came right <eol> to my cell phone. <eob>
I was at the front lines <eol> of trust breaking. <eob>
And there's nothing worse <eol> than those calls, <eob> it hurts to even think about them. <eob>
And the disappointment in the sound <eol> of someone's voice <eob> was and, I would say, still is <eob> our single greatest motivator <eol> to keep improving. <eob>
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights <eol> we've ever hosted, <eob> less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. <eob>
Turns out, people <eol> are justified in their trust. <eob>
And when trust works out right, <eob> it can be absolutely magical. <eob>
We had a guest stay with a host <eol> in Uruguay, <eob> and he suffered a heart attack. <eob>
The host rushed him to the hospital. <eob>
They donated their own blood <eol> for his operation. <eob>
Let me read you his review. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers <eob> prone to myocardial infarctions. <eob>
The area is beautiful and has direct access <eol> to the best hospitals. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Javier and Alejandra instantly become <eol> guardian angels <eob> who will save your life <eol> without even knowing you. <eob>
They will rush you to the hospital <eol> in their own car while you're dying <eob> and stay in the waiting room while the doctors <eol> give you a bypass. <eob>
They don't want you to feel lonely, <eol> they bring you books to read. <eob>
And they let you stay at their house <eol> extra nights without charging you. <eob> Highly recommended!" <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Of course, not every stay is like that. <eob> But this connection <eol> beyond the transaction <eob> is exactly what the sharing economy <eol> is aiming for. <eob>
Now, when I heard that term, <eob> I have to admit, it tripped me up. <eob>
How do sharing and transactions <eol> go together? <eob>
So let's be clear; it is about commerce. <eob>
But if you just called it <eol> the rental economy, <eob> it would be incomplete. <eob>
The sharing economy is commerce <eol> with the promise of human connection. <eob>
People share a part of themselves, <eob> and that changes everything. <eob>
You know how most travel today is, like, <eob> I think of it like fast food -- <eob> it's efficient and consistent, <eob> at the cost of local and authentic. <eob>
What if travel <eol> were like a magnificent buffet <eob> of local experiences? <eob>
What if anywhere you visited, <eob> there was a central marketplace <eol> of locals <eob> offering to get you thoroughly drunk <eob> on a pub crawl in neighborhoods <eol> you didn't even know existed. <eob>
Or learning to cook from the chef <eol> of a five-star restaurant? <eob>
Today, homes are designed around the idea <eol> of privacy and separation. <eob>
What if homes were designed <eol> to be shared from the ground up? <eob>
What would that look like? <eob>
What if cities embraced a culture <eol> of sharing? <eob>
I see a future of shared cities <eol> that bring us community and connection <eob> instead of isolation and separation. <eob>
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, <eob> they've actually even started this. <eob>
They've repurposed hundreds <eol> of government parking spots <eob> to be shared by residents. <eob>
They're connecting students <eol> who need a place to live <eob> with empty-nesters <eol> who have extra rooms. <eob> And they've started an incubator <eol> to help fund the next generation <eob> of sharing economy start-ups. <eob>
Tonight, just on our service, <eob> 785,000 people <eob> in 191 countries <eob> will either stay in a stranger's home <eob> or welcome one into theirs. <eob>
Clearly, it's not as crazy <eol> as we were taught. <eob>
We didn't invent anything new. <eob>
Hospitality has been around forever. <eob>
There's been many other websites like ours. <eob>
So, why did ours eventually take off? <eob>
Luck and timing aside, <eob> I've learned that you can <eol> take the components of trust, <eob> and you can design for that. <eob>
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted <eob> stranger-danger bias. <eob>
And that's amazing to me. <eob> It blows my mind. <eob>
I think about this every time <eol> I see a red Miata go by. <eob>
Now, we know design won't solve <eol> all the world's problems. <eob>
But if it can help out with this one, <eob> if it can make a dent in this, <eob> it makes me wonder, what else <eol> can we design for next? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So a few years ago, <eob> I did something really brave, <eob> or some would say really stupid. <eob>
I ran for Congress. <eob>
For years, I had existed <eol> safely behind the scenes in politics <eob> as a fundraiser, as an organizer, <eob> but in my heart, I always <eol> wanted to run. <eob>
The sitting congresswoman <eol> had been in my district since 1992. <eob>
She had never lost a race, <eob> and no one had really even run <eol> against her in a Democratic primary. <eob>
But in my mind, this was my way <eob> to make a difference, <eob> to disrupt the status quo. <eob>
The polls, however, told <eol> a very different story. <eob>
My pollsters told me <eol> that I was crazy to run, <eob> that there was no way that I could win. <eob>
But I ran anyway, <eob> and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race. <eob>
I swore I was going to win. <eob>
I had the endorsement <eol> from the New York Daily News, <eob> the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures <eol> of me on election day, <eob> and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country. <eob>
I raised money from everyone I knew, <eob> including Indian aunties <eob> that were just so happy <eol> an Indian girl was running. <eob>
But on election day, <eol> the polls were right, <eob> and I only got 19 percent of the vote, <eob> and the same papers <eol> that said I was a rising political star <eob> now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars <eob> on 6,321 votes. <eob>
Don't do the math. <eob> It was humiliating. <eob> Now, before you get the wrong idea, <eob> this is not a talk <eol> about the importance of failure. <eob>
Nor is it about leaning in. <eob>
I tell you the story of how <eob> I ran for Congress <eob> because I was 33 years old <eob> and it was the first time in my entire life <eob> that I had done something <eol> that was truly brave, <eob> where I didn't worry <eol> about being perfect. <eob>
And I'm not alone: <eob> so many women I talk to tell me <eob> that they gravitate towards careers and professions <eob> that they know they're going to be great in, <eob> that they know they're going to be perfect in, <eob> and it's no wonder why. <eob>
Most girls are taught <eol> to avoid risk and failure. <eob>
We're taught to smile pretty, <eob> play it safe, get all A's. <eob>
Boys, on the other hand, <eob> are taught to play rough, <eol> swing high, <eob> crawl to the top of the monkey bars <eol> and then just jump off headfirst. <eob>
And by the time they're adults, <eob> whether they're negotiating <eol> a raise or even asking someone out on a date, <eob> they're habituated <eol> to take risk after risk. <eob>
They're rewarded for it. <eob>
It's often said in Silicon Valley, <eob> no one even takes you seriously <eol> unless you've had two failed start-ups. <eob>
In other words, <eob> we're raising our girls to be perfect, <eob> and we're raising our boys to be brave. <eob>
Some people worry <eol> about our federal deficit, <eob> but I, I worry <eol> about our bravery deficit. <eob>
Our economy, our society, <eol> we're just losing out <eob> because we're not raising <eol> our girls to be brave. <eob>
The bravery deficit is why women <eol> are underrepresented in STEM, <eob> in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, <eob> and pretty much everywhere you look. <eob>
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck <eob> looked at how bright fifth graders <eol> handled an assignment <eob> that was too difficult for them. <eob>
She found that bright girls <eol> were quick to give up. <eob>
The higher the IQ, the more likely <eol> they were to give up. <eob>
Bright boys, on the other hand, <eob> found the difficult material <eol> to be a challenge. <eob>
They found it energizing. <eob>
They were more likely to redouble <eol> their efforts. <eob> What's going on? <eob> Well, at the fifth grade level, <eob> girls routinely outperform boys <eol> in every subject, <eob> including math and science, <eob> so it's not a question <eol> of ability. <eob>
The difference is in how boys <eol> and girls approach a challenge. <eob>
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. <eob>
An HP report found that men <eol> will apply for a job <eob> if they meet only 60 percent <eol> of the qualifications, <eob> but women, women <eol> will apply <eob> only if they meet 100 percent <eol> of the qualifications. <eob> 100 percent. <eob> This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, <eob> women need a little more confidence. <eob>
But I think it's evidence <eob> that women have been socialized <eol> to aspire to perfection, <eob> and they're overly cautious. <eob> (Applause) <eob> And even when we're ambitious, <eob> even when we're leaning in, <eob> that socialization of perfection <eob> has caused us to take less risks in our careers. <eob>
And so those 600,000 jobs <eol> that are open right now <eob> in computing and tech, <eob> women are being left behind, <eob> and it means our economy is being left behind <eob> on all the innovation and problems <eol> women would solve <eob> if they were socialized <eol> to be brave <eob> instead of socialized to be perfect. <eob> (Applause) <eob> So in 2012, I started a company <eol> to teach girls to code, <eob> and what I found is that by teaching them to code <eob> I had socialized them to be brave. <eob>
Coding, it's an endless process <eol> of trial and error, <eob> of trying to get the right command <eol> in the right place, <eob> with sometimes just a semicolon <eob> making the difference <eol> between success and failure. <eob>
Code breaks and then it falls apart, <eob> and it often takes many, many tries <eob> until that magical moment <eob> when what you're trying to build comes to life. <eob> It requires perseverance. <eob> It requires imperfection. <eob>
We immediately see in our program <eob> our girls' fear of not getting it right, <eob> of not being perfect. <eob>
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me <eol> the same story. <eob>
During the first week, when the girls <eol> are learning how to code, <eob> a student will call her <eol> over and she'll say, <eob> "I don't know what code to write." <eob> The teacher will look at her screen, <eob> and she'll see a blank text editor. <eob>
If she didn't know any better, <eol> she'd think that her student <eob> spent the past 20 minutes <eol> just staring at the screen. <eob>
But if she presses undo a few times, <eob> she'll see that her student <eol> wrote code and then deleted it. <eob>
She tried, she came close, <eob> but she didn't get it exactly right. <eob>
Instead of showing the progress that she made, <eob> she'd rather show nothing at all. <eob> Perfection or bust. <eob>
It turns out that our girls <eol> are really good at coding, <eob> but it's not enough <eol> just to teach them to code. <eob>
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University <eol> of Columbia <eob> and teaches intro to Java <eob> tells me about his office hours <eol> with computer science students. <eob>
When the guys are struggling with an assignment, <eob> they'll come in and they'll say, <eob> "Professor, there's something <eol> wrong with my code." <eob> The girls will come in and say, <eob> "Professor, there's something wrong with me." <eob> We have to begin to undo the socialization <eol> of perfection, <eob> but we've got to combine it <eol> with building a sisterhood <eob> that lets girls know that they are not alone. <eob>
Because trying harder <eol> is not going to fix a broken system. <eob>
I can't tell you how many women tell me, <eob> "I'm afraid to raise my hand, <eob> I'm afraid to ask a question, <eob> because I don't want to be the only one <eob> who doesn't understand, <eob> the only one who is struggling. <eob> When we teach girls to be brave <eob> and we have a supportive network cheering them on, <eob> they will build incredible things, <eob> and I see this every day. <eob>
Take, for instance, <eol> two of our high school students <eob> who built a game <eol> called Tampon Run -- <eob> yes, Tampon Run -- <eob> to fight against the menstruation taboo <eob> and sexism in gaming. <eob>
Or the Syrian refugee <eob> who dared show her love <eol> for her new country <eob> by building an app to help Americans <eol> get to the polls. <eob>
Or a 16-year-old girl <eol> who built an algorithm <eob> to help detect whether a cancer <eol> is benign or malignant <eob> in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life <eob> because he has cancer. <eob>
These are just three examples of thousands, <eob> thousands of girls who have been <eol> socialized to be imperfect, <eob> who have learned to keep trying, <eol> who have learned perseverance. <eob>
And whether they become coders <eob> or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, <eob> they will not defer their dreams. <eob>
And those dreams have never been <eol> more important for our country. <eob>
For the American economy, <eol> for any economy to grow, <eob> to truly innovate, <eob> we cannot leave behind half <eol> our population. <eob>
We have to socialize our girls <eol> to be comfortable with imperfection, <eob> and we've got to do it now. <eob>
We cannot wait for them <eol> to learn how to be brave like I did <eob> when I was 33 years old. <eob>
We have to teach them <eol> to be brave in schools <eob> and early in their careers, <eob> when it has the most potential <eol> to impact their lives <eob> and the lives of others, <eob> and we have to show them <eol> that they will be loved and accepted <eob> not for being perfect <eob> but for being courageous. <eob>
And so I need each of you to tell <eol> every young woman you know -- <eob> your sister, your niece, <eol> your employee, your colleague -- <eob> to be comfortable with imperfection, <eob> because when we teach girls <eol> to be imperfect, <eob> and we help them leverage it, <eob> we will build a movement of young women <eol> who are brave <eob> and who will build a better world <eol> for themselves <eob> and for each and every one of us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. <eob>
It's such a powerful vision you have. <eob>
You have a vision. <eob>
Tell me how it's going. <eob>
How many girls are involved <eol> now in your program? <eob>
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. <eol> So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states. <eob> And that number is really powerful, <eob> because last year we only graduated 7, <eol>500 women in computer science. <eob>
Like, the problem is so bad <eob> that we can make that type <eol> of change quickly. <eob>
CA: And you're working with some of the companies <eol> in this room even, <eob> who are welcoming graduates <eol> from your program? <eob>
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, <eob> from Twitter to Facebook <eob> to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft <eol> to Pixar to Disney, <eob> I mean, every single company out there. <eob>
And if you're not signed up, <eol> I'm going to find you, <eob> because we need every single tech company <eob> to embed a Girls <eol> Who Code classroom in their office. <eob>
CA: And you have some stories <eol> back from some of those companies <eob> that when you mix in more gender balance <eob> in the engineering teams, <eol> good things happen. <eob>
RS: Great things happen. <eob>
I mean, I think that it's crazy <eol> to me to think about the fact <eob> that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases <eol> are made by women. <eob>
Women use social media at a rate <eol> of 600 percent more than men. <eob>
We own the Internet, <eob> and we should be building <eol> the companies of tomorrow. <eob>
And I think when companies <eol> have diverse teams, <eob> and they have incredible women <eol> that are part of their engineering teams, <eob> they build awesome things, and we see it every day. <eob>
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. <eob>
You're doing incredibly important work. <eob>
This whole community is cheering you on. <eob>
More power to you. <eob> Thank you. <eob> RS: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
There are times when I feel <eol> really quite ashamed <eob> to be a European. <eob>
In the last year, <eob> more than a million people arrived <eol> in Europe in need of our help, <eob> and our response, frankly, <eol> has been pathetic. <eob>
There are just so many contradictions. <eob>
We mourn the tragic death <eob> of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, <eob> and yet, since then, more than 200 children <eob> have subsequently drowned <eol> in the Mediterranean. <eob>
We have international treaties <eob> that recognize that refugees <eol> are a shared responsibility, <eob> and yet we accept <eol> that tiny Lebanon <eob> hosts more Syrians than the whole <eol> of Europe combined. <eob>
We lament the existence <eol> of human smugglers, <eob> and yet we make that <eol> the only viable route <eob> to seek asylum in Europe. <eob>
We have labor shortages, <eob> and yet we exclude people who fit <eol> our economic and demographic needs <eob> from coming to Europe. <eob>
We proclaim our liberal values <eol> in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, <eob> and yet -- <eob> we have repressive policies <eob> that detain child asylum seekers, <eob> that separate children from their families, <eob> and that seize property from refugees. <eob>
What are we doing? <eob> How has the situation come to this, <eob> that we've adopted such an inhumane <eol> response to a humanitarian crisis? <eob>
I don't believe it's because <eol> people don't care, <eob> or at least I don't want to believe it's <eol> because people don't care. <eob>
I believe it's because our politicians <eol> lack a vision, <eob> a vision for how to adapt <eol> an international refugee system <eob> created over 50 years ago <eob> for a changing and globalized world. <eob>
And so what I want to do <eol> is take a step back <eob> and ask two really fundamental questions, <eob> the two questions we all need to ask. <eob>
First, why is the current <eol> system not working? <eob>
And second, what can we do to fix it? <eob>
So the modern refugee regime <eob> was created in the aftermath <eol> of the Second World War by these guys. <eob>
Its basic aim is to ensure <eob> that when a state fails, or worse, <eol> turns against its own people, <eob> people have somewhere to go, <eob> to live in safety and dignity <eol> until they can go home. <eob>
It was created precisely for situations <eol> like the situation we see in Syria today. <eob>
Through an international convention signed <eol> by 147 governments, <eob> the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, <eob> and an international organization, UNHCR, <eob> states committed to reciprocally <eol> admit people onto their territory <eob> who flee conflict and persecution. <eob>
But today, that system is failing. <eob>
In theory, refugees have a right <eol> to seek asylum. <eob>
In practice, our immigration policies <eol> block the path to safety. <eob>
In theory, refugees have a right <eol> to a pathway to integration, <eob> or return to the country <eol> they've come from. <eob>
But in practice, they get stuck <eol> in almost indefinite limbo. <eob>
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility. <eob>
In practice, geography means that countries <eol> proximate the conflict <eob> take the overwhelming majority <eol> of the world's refugees. <eob>
The system isn't broken <eol> because the rules are wrong. <eob> It's that we're not applying them adequately <eol> to a changing world, <eob> and that's what we need <eol> to reconsider. <eob>
So I want to explain to you a little bit <eol> about how the current system works. <eob>
How does the refugee regime actually work? <eob>
But not from a top-down institutional perspective, <eob> rather from the perspective <eol> of a refugee. <eob>
So imagine a Syrian woman. <eob> Let's call her Amira. <eob> And Amira to me represents many of the people <eol> I've met in the region. <eob>
Amira, like around 25 percent <eol> of the world's refugees, <eob> is a woman with children, <eob> and she can't go home <eol> because she comes from this city <eob> that you see before you, Homs, <eob> a once beautiful and historic city <eob> now under rubble. <eob>
And so Amira can't go back there. <eob>
But Amira also has no hope <eol> of resettlement to a third country, <eob> because that's a lottery ticket <eob> only available to less than one percent <eol> of the world's refugees. <eob>
So Amira and her family <eob> face an almost impossible choice. <eob>
They have three basic options. <eob>
The first option is that Amira <eol> can take her family to a camp. <eob>
In the camp, she might get assistance, <eob> but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family. <eob>
Camps are in bleak, arid locations, <eob> often in the desert. <eob>
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, <eob> you can hear the shells <eol> across the border in Syria at nighttime. <eob>
There's restricted economic activity. <eob>
Education is often of poor quality. <eob>
And around the world, <eob> some 80 percent of refugees <eol> who are in camps <eob> have to stay for at least five years. <eob>
It's a miserable existence, <eob> and that's probably why, in reality, <eob> only nine percent of Syrians <eol> choose that option. <eob>
Alternatively, Amira can head <eol> to an urban area <eob> in a neighboring country, <eol> like Amman or Beirut. <eob>
That's an option that about 75 percent <eol> of Syrian refugees have taken. <eob>
But there, there's great <eol> difficulty as well. <eob>
Refugees in such urban areas <eol> don't usually have the right to work. <eob>
They don't usually <eol> get significant access to assistance. <eob>
And so when Amira and her family <eol> have used up their basic savings, <eob> they're left with very little <eol> and likely to face urban destitution. <eob>
So there's a third alternative, <eob> and it's one that increasing numbers <eol> of Syrians are taking. <eob>
Amira can seek some hope for her family <eob> by risking their lives <eol> on a dangerous and perilous journey <eob> to another country, <eob> and it's that which we're seeing <eol> in Europe today. <eob>
Around the world, we present refugees <eol> with an almost impossible choice <eob> between three options: <eob> encampment, urban destitution <eol> and dangerous journeys. <eob>
For refugees, that choice <eol> is the global refugee regime today. <eob>
But I think it's a false choice. <eob>
I think we can reconsider that choice. <eob>
The reason why we limit those options <eob> is because we think <eob> that those are the only options <eol> that are available to refugees, <eob> and they're not. <eob>
Politicians frame the issue <eol> as a zero-sum issue, <eob> that if we benefit refugees, <eol> we're imposing costs on citizens. <eob>
We tend to have a collective assumption <eob> that refugees are an inevitable <eol> cost or burden to society. <eob>
But they don't have to. <eol> They can contribute. <eob>
So what I want to argue <eob> is there are ways in which <eol> we can expand that choice set <eob> and still benefit everyone else: <eob> the host states and communities, <eob> our societies and refugees themselves. <eob>
And I want to suggest four ways <eob> we can transform the paradigm <eol> of how we think about refugees. <eob>
All four ways have one thing in common: <eob> they're all ways in which <eol> we take the opportunities of globalization, <eob> mobility and markets, <eob> and update the way we think <eol> about the refugee issue. <eob>
The first one I want to think about <eob> is the idea of enabling environments, <eob> and it starts from a very basic recognition <eob> that refugees <eol> are human beings like everyone else, <eob> but they're just in extraordinary circumstances. <eob>
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, <eob> we've embarked on a research project <eol> in Uganda <eob> looking at the economic lives <eol> of refugees. <eob>
We chose Uganda not because it's representative <eol> of all host countries. <eob> It's not. It's exceptional. <eob> Unlike most host countries <eol> around the world, <eob> what Uganda has done <eob> is give refugees economic opportunity. <eob>
It gives them the right to work. <eol> It gives them freedom of movement. <eob>
And the results of that are extraordinary <eob> both for refugees and the host community. <eob>
In the capital city, Kampala, <eob> we found that 21 percent <eol> of refugees own a business that employs other people, <eob> and 40 percent of those employees <eob> are nationals of the host country. <eob>
In other words, refugees are making jobs <eob> for citizens of the host country. <eob>
Even in the camps, <eol> we found extraordinary examples <eob> of vibrant, flourishing <eol> and entrepreneurial businesses. <eob>
For example, in a settlement <eol> called Nakivale, <eob> we found examples of Congolese refugees <eob> running digital music exchange businesses. <eob>
We found a Rwandan who runs <eol> a business that's available <eob> to allow the youth to play <eol> computer games <eob> on recycled games consoles <eol> and recycled televisions. <eob>
Against the odds of extreme constraint, <eob> refugees are innovating, <eob> and the gentleman you see <eol> before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay. <eob>
Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement <eol> with very little, <eob> but he wanted to be a filmmaker. <eob>
So with friends and colleagues, <eol> he started a community radio station, <eob> he rented a video camera, <eob> and he's now making films. <eob>
He made two documentary films <eob> with and for our team, <eob> and he's making a successful business <eol> out of very little. <eob>
It's those kinds of examples <eob> that should guide our response <eol> to refugees. <eob>
Rather than seeing refugees <eob> as inevitably dependent <eol> upon humanitarian assistance, <eob> we need to provide them with opportunities <eol> for human flourishing. <eob>
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food <eob> are all important in the emergency phase, <eob> but we need to also look beyond that. <eob>
We need to provide opportunities <eol> to connectivity, electricity, <eob> education, the right to work, <eob> access to capital and banking. <eob>
All the ways in which we take for granted <eob> that we are plugged <eol> in to the global economy <eob> can and should apply to refugees. <eob>
The second idea I want <eol> to discuss is economic zones. <eob>
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world <eob> takes the approach Uganda <eol> has taken. <eob>
Most host countries don't open up <eol> their economies to refugees <eob> in the same way. <eob>
But there are still pragmatic alternative <eol> options that we can use. <eob>
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, <eob> the development economist Paul Collier, <eob> and we brainstormed an idea while we were there <eob> with the international community and the government, <eob> an idea to bring jobs to Syrians <eob> while supporting Jordan's national development strategy. <eob>
The idea is for an economic zone, <eob> one in which we could potentially integrate <eol> the employment of refugees <eob> alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals. <eob>
And just 15 minutes away <eol> from the Zaatari refugee camp, <eob> home to 83,000 refugees, <eob> is an existing economic zone <eob> called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area. <eob>
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars <eob> connecting it to the electricity grid, <eol> connecting it to the road network, <eob> but it lacked two things: <eob> access to labor and inward investment. <eob> So what if refugees <eol> were able to work there <eob> rather than being stuck in camps, <eob> able to support their families and develop skills <eol> through vocational training <eob> before they go back to Syria? <eob>
We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, <eob> whose development strategy <eol> requires it to make the leap <eob> as a middle income country to manufacturing. <eob>
It could benefit refugees, <eol> but it could also contribute <eob> to the postconflict <eol> reconstruction of Syria <eob> by recognizing that we need <eol> to incubate refugees <eob> as the best source of eventually <eol> rebuilding Syria. <eob>
We published the idea <eol> in the journal Foreign Affairs. <eob>
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea. <eob>
It was announced at the London <eol> Syria Conference two weeks ago, <eob> and a pilot will begin in the summer. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The third idea that I want to put to you <eob> is preference matching between states and refugees <eob> to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes <eol> you see here in the selfie <eob> featuring Angela Merkel <eol> and a Syrian refugee. <eob>
What we rarely do is ask refugees <eol> what they want, where they want to go, <eob> but I'd argue we can do that <eob> and still make everyone better off. <eob>
The economist Alvin Roth has developed <eol> the idea of matching markets, <eob> ways in which the preference ranking of the parties <eol> shapes an eventual match. <eob>
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym <eob> have explored ways in which <eol> that idea could be applied to refugees, <eob> to ask refugees to rank <eol> their preferred destinations, <eob> but also allow states to rank <eol> the types of refugees they want <eob> on skills criteria or language criteria <eob> and allow those to match. <eob>
Now, of course you'd need <eol> to build in quotas <eob> on things like diversity and vulnerability, <eob> but it's a way of increasing <eol> the possibilities of matching. <eob>
The matching idea has been successfully used <eob> to match, for instance, students <eol> with university places, <eob> to match kidney donors with patients, <eob> and it underlies the kind of algorithms <eol> that exist on dating websites. <eob>
So why not apply <eol> that to give refugees greater choice? <eob>
It could also be used <eol> at the national level, <eob> where one of the great challenges we face <eob> is to persuade local communities <eol> to accept refugees. <eob>
And at the moment, in my country, for instance, <eob> we often send engineers <eol> to rural areas and farmers to the cities, <eob> which makes no sense at all. <eob>
So matching markets offer a potential way <eol> to bring those preferences together <eob> and listen to the needs <eol> and demands of the populations that host <eob> and the refugees themselves. <eob>
The fourth idea I want to put <eol> to you is of humanitarian visas. <eob>
Much of the tragedy and chaos <eol> we've seen in Europe <eob> was entirely avoidable. <eob>
It stems from a fundamental contradiction <eol> in Europe's asylum policy, <eob> which is the following: <eob> that in order <eob> to seek asylum in Europe, <eob> you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking <eol> on those dangerous journeys <eob> that I described. <eob>
But why should those journeys <eol> be necessary in an era of the budget airline <eob> and modern consular capabilities? <eob>
They're completely unnecessary journeys, <eob> and last year, they led <eol> to the deaths of over 3,000 people <eob> on Europe's borders and within European territory. <eob>
If refugees were simply allowed <eob> to travel directly <eol> and seek asylum in Europe, <eob> we would avoid that, <eob> and there's a way of doing that <eob> through something called a humanitarian visa, <eob> that allows people to collect <eol> a visa at an embassy <eob> or a consulate in a neighboring country <eob> and then simply pay their own way <eob> through a ferry or a flight to Europe. <eob>
It costs around a thousand euros <eob> to take a smuggler <eol> from Turkey to the Greek islands. <eob>
It costs 200 euros to take <eol> a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt. <eob>
If we allowed refugees to do that, <eol> it would have major advantages. <eob>
It would save lives, <eob> it would undercut the entire market <eol> for smugglers, <eob> and it would remove the chaos <eol> we see from Europe's front line <eob> in areas like the Greek islands. <eob>
It's politics that prevents us doing <eol> that rather than a rational solution. <eob>
And this is an idea that has been applied. <eob>
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach <eob> where over 2,000 Syrians have been able <eol> to get humanitarian visas, <eob> enter Brazil, and claim refugee status <eol> on arrival in Brazil. <eob>
And in that scheme, every Syrian <eol> who has gone through it <eob> has received refugee status <eol> and been recognized as a genuine refugee. <eob>
There is a historical precedent <eol> for it as well. <eob>
Between 1922 and 1942, <eob> these Nansen passports <eol> were used as travel documents <eob> to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens <eob> to travel across Europe <eob> and claim refugee status <eol> elsewhere in Europe. <eob>
And the Nansen International Refugee Office <eob> received the Nobel Peace Prize <eob> in recognition of this being a viable strategy. <eob>
So all four of these ideas <eol> that I've presented you <eob> are ways in which <eol> we can expand Amira's choice set. <eob>
They're ways in which <eol> we can have greater choice for refugees <eob> beyond those basic, impossible three options <eob> I explained to you <eob> and still leave others better off. <eob>
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, <eob> a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees <eob> but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden. <eob>
There's nothing inevitable <eol> about refugees being a cost. <eob>
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, <eob> but they're human beings <eol> with skills, talents, aspirations, <eob> with the ability to make contributions -- <eol> if we let them. <eob>
In the new world, <eob> migration is not going to go away. <eob>
What we've seen in Europe will be <eol> with us for many years. <eob>
People will continue to travel, <eob> they'll continue to be displaced, <eob> and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- <eob> not based on the old logics <eol> of humanitarian assistance, <eob> not based on logics of charity, <eob> but building on the opportunities <eob> offered by globalization, markets and mobility. <eob>
I'd urge you all to wake up <eol> and urge our politicians <eob> to wake up to this challenge. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
There we were, <eob> souls and bodies packed <eol> into a Texas church <eob> on the last night of our lives. <eob>
Packed into a room just like this, <eob> but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, <eob> with an organ to my left <eol> and a choir at my back <eob> and a baptism pool built <eol> into the wall behind them. <eob>
A room like this, nonetheless. <eob>
With the same great feelings of suspense, <eob> the same deep hopes for salvation, <eob> the same sweat in the palms <eob> and the same people in the back <eol> not paying attention. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This was December 31, 1999, <eob> the night of the Second Coming of Christ, <eob> and the end of the world as I knew it. <eob>
I had turned 12 that year <eob> and had reached the age of accountability. <eob>
And once I stopped complaining <eob> about how unfair it was <eol> that Jesus would return <eob> as soon as I had to be accountable <eol> for all that I had done, <eob> I figured I had better get my house <eol> in order very quickly. <eob>
So I went to church as often as I could. <eob>
I listened for silence as anxiously <eol> as one might listen for noise, <eob> trying to be sure <eol> that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me <eob> and decided to come back early. <eob>
And just in case he did, <eob> I built a backup plan, <eob> by reading the "Left Behind" books <eol> that were all the rage at the time. <eob>
And I found in their pages <eob> that if I was not taken <eol> in the rapture at midnight, <eob> I had another shot. <eob>
All I had to do was avoid <eol> taking the mark of the beast, <eob> fight off demons, plagues <eol> and the Antichrist himself. <eob> It would be hard -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but I knew I could do it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But planning time was over now. <eob> It was 11: 50pm. <eob> We had 10 minutes left, <eob> and my pastor called us out <eol> of the pews and down to the altar <eob> because he wanted to be praying <eol> when midnight struck. <eob>
So every faction of the congregation <eob> took its place. <eob>
The choir stayed in the choir stand, <eob> the deacons and their wives -- <eob> or the Baptist Bourgeoisie <eol> as I like to call them -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
took first position in front of the altar. <eob>
You see, in America, <eob> even the Second Coming <eol> of Christ has a VIP section. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie <eob> were the elderly -- <eob> these men and women whose young backs <eol> had been bent under hot suns <eob> in the cotton fields <eol> of East Texas, <eob> and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, <eob> just like the clay of East Texas, <eob> and whose hopes and dreams <eol> for what life might become <eob> outside of East Texas <eob> had sometimes been bent and broken <eob> even further than their backs. <eob>
Yes, these men and women <eol> were the stars of the show for me. <eob>
They had waited their whole lives <eol> for this moment, <eob> just as their medieval predecessors <eol> had longed for the end of the world, <eob> and just as my grandmother waited <eol> for the Oprah Winfrey Show <eob> to come on Channel 8 every day <eol> at 4 o'clock. <eob>
And as she made her way to the altar, <eob> I snuck right in behind her, <eob> because I knew for sure <eob> that my grandmother was going to heaven. <eob>
And I thought that if I held <eol> on to her hand during this prayer, <eob> I might go right on with her. <eob>
So I held on <eob> and I closed my eyes <eob> to listen, <eob> to wait. <eob>
And the prayers got louder. <eob>
And the shouts of response <eol> to the call of the prayer <eob> went up higher even still. <eob>
And the organ rolled on in <eol> to add the dirge. <eob>
And the heat came on to add to the sweat. <eob>
And my hand gripped firmer, <eob> so I wouldn't be <eol> the one left in the field. <eob>
My eyes clenched tighter <eob> so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated <eol> from the chaff. <eob>
And then a voice rang out above us: <eob> "Amen." <eob>
It was over. <eob> I looked at the clock. <eob>
It was after midnight. <eob>
I looked at the elder believers <eob> whose savior had not come, <eob> who were too proud to show <eol> any signs of disappointment, <eob> who had believed too much and for too long <eob> to start doubting now. <eob>
But I was upset on their behalf. <eob>
They had been duped, <eob> hoodwinked, bamboozled, <eob> and I had gone right along with them. <eob>
I had prayed their prayers, <eob> I had yielded not <eol> to temptation as best I could. <eob>
I had dipped my head not once, but twice <eob> in that snot-inducing baptism pool. <eob> I had believed. <eob> Now what? <eob>
I got home just in time <eol> to turn on the television <eob> and watch Peter Jennings announce <eol> the new millennium <eob> as it rolled in around the world. <eob>
It struck me that it would have <eol> been strange anyway, <eob> for Jesus to come back again and again <eob> based on the different time zones. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this made me feel <eol> even more ridiculous -- <eob> hurt, really. <eob>
But there on that night, <eol> I did not stop believing. <eob>
I just believed a new thing: <eob> that it was possible not to believe. <eob>
It was possible the answers <eol> I had were wrong, <eob> that the questions themselves were wrong. <eob>
And now, where there was once <eol> a mountain of certitude, <eob> there was, running right down <eol> to its foundation, <eob> a spring of doubt, <eob> a spring that promised rivers. <eob>
I can trace the whole drama of my life <eob> back to that night in that church <eob> when my savior did not come for me; <eob> when the thing I believed most certainly <eob> turned out to be, if not a lie, <eob> then not quite the truth. <eob>
And even though most of you prepared <eol> for Y2K in a very different way, <eob> I'm convinced that you are here <eob> because some part of you has done the same thing <eol> that I have done <eob> since the dawn of this new century, <eob> since my mother left <eol> and my father stayed away <eob> and my Lord refused to come. <eob>
And I held out my hand, <eob> reaching for something to believe in. <eob>
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, <eob> with the faith that my journey <eol> from Oak Cliff, Texas <eob> was a chance to leave <eol> behind all the challenges I had known, <eob> the broken dreams and broken bodies <eol> I had seen. <eob>
But when I found myself back home <eol> one winter break, <eob> with my face planted in the floor, <eob> my hands tied behind my back <eob> and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, <eob> I knew that even the best education <eol> couldn't save me. <eob>
I held on when I showed up <eol> at Lehman Brothers <eob> as an intern in 2008. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So hopeful -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
that I called home to inform my family <eob> that we'd never be poor again. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But as I witnessed this temple of finance <eob> come crashing down before my eyes, <eob> I knew that even the best job <eol> couldn't save me. <eob>
I held on when I showed up <eol> in Washington DC as a young staffer, <eob> who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, <eob> saying, "It's been <eol> a long time coming, <eob> but in this election, change <eol> has come to America." <eob> But as the Congress ground to a halt <eob> and the country ripped <eol> at the seams <eob> and hope and change began <eol> to feel like a cruel joke, <eob> I knew that even the political second coming <eob> could not save me. <eob>
I had knelt faithfully <eol> at the altar of the American Dream, <eob> praying to the gods of my time <eob> of success, <eob> and money, <eob> and power. <eob>
But over and over again, <eob> midnight struck, and I opened my eyes <eob> to see that all of these gods were dead. <eob>
And from that graveyard, <eob> I began the search once more, <eob> not because I was brave, <eob> but because I knew that I <eol> would either believe <eob> or I would die. <eob>
So I took a pilgrimage to yet <eol> another mecca, <eob> Harvard Business School -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
this time, knowing that I could not <eol> simply accept the salvation <eob> that it claimed to offer. <eob>
No, I knew there'd be more work to do. <eob>
The work began in the dark corner <eol> of a crowded party, <eob> in the late night of an early, <eol> miserable Cambridge winter, <eob> when three friends <eol> and I asked a question <eob> that young folks searching <eol> for something real have asked <eob> for a very long time: <eob> "What if we took a road trip?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We didn't know where'd we go <eol> or how we'd get there, <eob> but we knew we had to do it. <eob>
Because all our lives we yearned, <eol> as Jack Kerouac wrote, <eob> to "sneak out into the night <eol> and disappear somewhere," <eob> and go find out what everybody was doing <eob> all over the country. <eob>
So even though <eol> there were other voices who said <eob> that the risk was too great <eol> and the proof too thin, <eob> we went on anyhow. <eob>
We went on 8,000 miles <eol> across America in the summer of 2013, <eob> through the cow pastures <eol> of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, <eob> through the swamps of New Orleans, <eob> where we found and worked <eol> with men and women <eob> who were building small businesses <eob> that made purpose their bottom line. <eob>
And having been trained <eol> at the West Point of capitalism, <eob> this struck us as a revolutionary idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this idea spread, <eob> growing into a nonprofit <eol> called MBAs Across America, <eob> a movement that landed me <eol> here on this stage today. <eob>
It spread because we found <eol> a great hunger in our generation <eob> for purpose, for meaning. <eob> It spread because we found <eol> countless entrepreneurs <eob> in the nooks and crannies of America <eob> who were creating jobs <eol> and changing lives <eob> and who needed a little help. <eob>
But if I'm being honest, it also spread <eob> because I fought to spread it. <eob>
There was no length <eol> to which I would not go <eob> to preach this gospel, <eob> to get more people to believe <eob> that we could bind the wounds <eol> of a broken country, <eob> one social business at a time. <eob>
But it was this journey of evangelism <eob> that led me to the rather different gospel <eob> that I've come to share with you today. <eob>
It began one evening almost a year ago <eob> at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, <eob> at a gala for alumni <eol> of Harvard Business School. <eob>
Under a full-size replica <eol> of a whale, <eob> I sat with the titans of our time <eob> as they celebrated their peers <eol> and their good deeds. <eob>
There was pride in a room <eob> where net worth and assets <eol> under management <eob> surpassed half a trillion dollars. <eob>
We looked over all that we had made, <eob> and it was good. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But it just so happened, <eob> two days later, <eob> I had to travel up the road <eol> to Harlem, <eob> where I found myself sitting in an urban farm <eob> that had once been a vacant lot, <eob> listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids <eob> that showed up there every day. <eob>
All of them lived below the poverty line. <eob>
Many of them carried all of their belongings <eol> in a backpack <eob> to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter. <eob>
Some of them came to Tony's program, <eob> called Harlem Grown, <eob> to get the only meal they had each day. <eob>
Tony told me that he started Harlem <eol> Grown with money from his pension, <eob> after 20 years as a cab driver. <eob>
He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, <eob> because despite success, the program <eol> struggled for resources. <eob>
He told me that he would take any help <eob> that he could get. <eob>
And I was there as that help. <eob>
But as I left Tony, <eol> I felt the sting and salt of tears <eob> welling up in my eyes. <eob>
I felt the weight of revelation <eob> that I could sit in one room on one night, <eob> where a few hundred people had <eol> half a trillion dollars, <eob> and another room, <eob> two days later, <eob> just 50 blocks up the road, <eob> where a man was going <eol> without a salary <eob> to get a child her only meal of the day. <eob>
And it wasn't the glaring inequality <eol> that made me want to cry, <eob> it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, <eob> it wasn't rage toward the one percent <eob> or pity toward the 99. <eob>
No, I was disturbed <eol> because I had finally realized <eob> that I was the dialysis <eob> for a country that needed <eol> a kidney transplant. <eob>
I realized that my story stood in for all those <eob> who were expected to pick <eol> themselves up by their bootstraps, <eob> even if they didn't have any boots; <eob> that my organization stood in <eob> for all the structural, systemic help <eol> that never went to Harlem <eob> or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; <eob> that my voice stood in for all those voices <eob> that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated. <eob>
And the shame of that, <eob> that shame washed over me <eob> like the shame of sitting <eol> in front of the television, <eob> watching Peter Jennings announce <eol> the new millennium <eob> again <eob> and again <eob> and again. <eob>
I had been duped, <eob> hoodwinked, bamboozled. <eob>
But this time, the false savior was me. <eob>
You see, I've come a long way <eol> from that altar <eob> on the night I thought <eol> the world would end, <eob> from a world where people <eol> spoke in tongues <eob> and saw suffering <eol> as a necessary act of God <eob> and took a text to be infallible truth. <eob>
Yes, I've come so far <eob> that I'm right back where I started. <eob>
Because it simply is not true to say <eob> that we live in an age <eol> of disbelief -- <eob> no, we believe today <eol> just as much as any time that came before. <eob>
Some of us may believe in the prophecy <eol> of Brené Brown <eob> or Tony Robbins. <eob>
We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker <eob> or the Harvard Business Review. <eob>
We may believe most deeply <eob> when we worship <eol> right here at the church of TED, <eob> but we desperately want to believe, <eob> we need to believe. <eob>
We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders <eob> that promise to solve <eol> all our problems. <eob>
We see suffering as a necessary act <eol> of the capitalism that is our god, <eob> we take the text <eol> of technological progress <eob> to be infallible truth. <eob>
And we hardly realize <eol> the human price we pay <eob> when we fail to question one brick, <eob> because we fear it might shake <eol> our whole foundation. <eob>
But if you are disturbed <eob> by the unconscionable things <eol> that we have come to accept, <eob> then it must be questioning time. <eob>
So I have not a gospel <eol> of disruption or innovation <eob> or a triple bottom line. <eob>
I do not have a gospel of faith <eol> to share with you today, in fact. <eob>
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt. <eob>
The gospel of doubt does not <eol> ask that you stop believing, <eob> it asks that you believe a new thing: <eob> that it is possible not to believe. <eob>
It is possible the answers <eol> we have are wrong, <eob> it is possible the questions <eol> themselves are wrong. <eob>
Yes, the gospel of doubt <eol> means that it is possible that we, <eob> on this stage, in this room, <eob> are wrong. <eob>
Because it raises the question, "Why?" <eob> With all the power <eol> that we hold in our hands, <eob> why are people still suffering so bad? <eob>
This doubt leads me to share <eol> that we are putting my organization, <eob> MBAs Across America, <eob> out of business. <eob>
We have shed our staff <eol> and closed our doors <eob> and we will share our model freely <eob> with anyone who sees their power to do this work <eob> without waiting for our permission. <eob>
This doubt compels me <eob> to renounce the role of savior <eob> that some have placed on me, <eob> because our time is too short and our odds <eol> are too long <eob> to wait for second comings, <eob> when the truth <eol> is that there will be no miracles here. <eob>
And this doubt, it fuels me, <eob> it gives me hope <eob> that when our troubles overwhelm us, <eob> when the paths laid out for us seem to lead <eol> to our demise, <eob> when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, <eob> it will not be our blind faith -- <eob> no, it will be our humble doubt <eob> that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives <eob> and of our world <eob> and lets us raise our voice to whisper <eob> or to shout <eob> or to say simply, <eob> very simply, <eob> "There must be another way." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
In case you are wondering, <eob> no, I'm not wearing a dress, <eob> and no, I'm not saying <eol> what I'm wearing underneath. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is a gho. <eob> This is my national dress. <eob>
This is how all men dress in Bhutan. <eob>
That is how our women dress. <eob>
Like our women, <eob> we men get to wear pretty bright colors, <eob> but unlike our women, <eob> we get to show off our legs. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Our national dress is unique, <eob> but this is not the only thing <eol> that's unique about my country. <eob>
Our promise to remain carbon <eol> neutral is also unique, <eob> and this is what I'd like <eol> to speak about today, <eob> our promise to remain carbon neutral. <eob>
But before I proceed, I should set <eol> you the context. <eob>
I should tell you our story. <eob>
Bhutan is a small country <eol> in the Himalayas. <eob>
We've been called Shangri-La, <eob> even the last Shangri-La. <eob>
But let me tell you right off the bat, <eol> we are not Shangri-La. <eob>
My country is not one big monastery <eob> populated with happy monks. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us <eob> sandwiched between two of the most populated <eol> countries on earth, <eob> China and India. <eob>
The reality is that we are a small, <eol> underdeveloped country <eob> doing our best to survive. <eob>
But we are doing OK. We are surviving. <eob> In fact, we are thriving, <eob> and the reason we are thriving <eol> is because we've been blessed <eob> with extraordinary kings. <eob>
Our enlightened monarchs <eol> have worked tirelessly <eob> to develop our country, <eob> balancing economic growth carefully <eob> with social development, environmental <eol> sustainability <eob> and cultural preservation, <eob> all within the framework <eol> of good governance. <eob>
We call this holistic approach to development <eob> "Gross National Happiness," <eol> or GNH. <eob>
Back in the 1970s, <eob> our fourth king famously <eol> pronounced that for Bhutan, <eob> Gross National Happiness is more important <eol> than Gross National Product. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Ever since, <eob> all development in Bhutan <eol> is driven by GNH, <eob> a pioneering vision <eol> that aims to improve the happiness <eob> and well-being of our people. <eob>
But that's easier said than done, <eob> especially when you are one <eol> of the smallest economies in the world. <eob>
Our entire GDP is less <eol> than two billion dollars. <eob>
I know that some of you here <eol> are worth more -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
individually <eob> than the entire economy of my country. <eob>
So our economy is small, <eob> but here is where it gets interesting. <eob>
Education is completely free. <eob>
All citizens are guaranteed <eol> free school education, <eob> and those that work hard <eol> are given free college education. <eob>
Healthcare is also completely free. <eob>
Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines: <eob> they are all provided by the state. <eob>
We manage this <eob> because we use our limited <eol> resources very carefully, <eob> and because we stay faithful <eol> to the core mission of GNH, <eob> which is development with values. <eob>
Our economy is small, <eol> and we must strengthen it. <eob>
Economic growth is important, <eob> but that economic growth <eol> must not come from undermining our unique culture <eob> or our pristine environment. <eob>
Today, our culture is flourishing. <eob>
We continue to celebrate <eol> our art and architecture, <eob> food and festivals, <eob> monks and monasteries. <eob>
And yes, we celebrate <eol> our national dress, too. <eob>
This is why I can wear my gho with pride. <eob>
Here's a fun fact: <eob> you're looking at the world's biggest pocket. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It starts here, <eob> goes around the back, <eob> and comes out from inside here. <eob>
In this pocket <eob> we store all manner of personal goods <eob> from phones and wallets <eob> to iPads, office files and books. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But sometimes -- <eob> sometimes even precious cargo. <eob>
So our culture is flourishing, <eob> but so is our environment. <eob>
72 percent of my country <eol> is under forest cover. <eob>
Our constitution demands <eol> that a minimum of 60 percent <eob> of Bhutan's total land shall <eol> remain under forest cover <eob> for all time. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Our constitution, <eob> this constitution, <eob> imposes forest cover on us. <eob>
Incidentally, our king used <eol> this constitution <eob> to impose democracy on us. <eob>
You see, we the people <eol> didn't want democracy. <eob>
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it, <eob> and we certainly didn't fight for it. <eob>
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us <eob> by insisting that he include it <eol> in the constitution. <eob>
But he went further. <eob>
He included provisions <eol> in the constitution <eob> that empower the people to impeach their kings, <eob> and included provisions in here <eol> that require all our kings to retire <eob> at the age of 65. <eob>
Fact is, we already have a king <eol> in retirement: <eob> our previous king, the Great Fourth, <eob> retired 10 years ago <eob> at the peak of his popularity. <eob>
He was all of 51 years at that time. <eob>
So as I was saying, <eob> 72 percent of our country <eol> is under forest cover, <eob> and all that forest is pristine. <eob>
That's why we are <eol> one of the few remaining <eob> global biodiversity hotspots in the world, <eob> and that's why we are <eol> a carbon neutral country. <eob>
In a world that is threatened <eol> with climate change, <eob> we are a carbon neutral country. <eob>
Turns out, it's a big deal. <eob>
Of the 200-odd countries <eol> in the world today, <eob> it looks like we are the only one <eob> that's carbon neutral. <eob>
Actually, that's not quite accurate. <eob>
Bhutan is not carbon neutral. <eob>
Bhutan is carbon negative. <eob>
Our entire country generates 2.2 million <eol> tons of carbon dioxide, <eob> but our forests, they sequester more <eol> than three times that amount, <eob> so we are a net carbon sink <eob> for more than four million tons <eol> of carbon dioxide each year. <eob>
But that's not all. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We export most of the renewable <eol> electricity <eob> we generate from our fast-flowing rivers. <eob>
So today, the clean energy <eol> that we export <eob> offsets about six million tons <eol> of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood. <eob>
By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity <eob> to offset 17 million tons <eol> of carbon dioxide. <eob>
And if we were to harness even half <eol> our hydropower potential, <eob> and that's exactly what we are working at, <eob> the clean, green energy <eol> that we export <eob> would offset something like 50 million tons <eol> of carbon dioxide a year. <eob>
That is more CO2 than what the entire city <eol> of New York generates in one year. <eob>
So inside our country, <eol> we are a net carbon sink. <eob>
Outside, we are offsetting carbon. <eob>
And this is important stuff. <eob>
You see, the world is getting warmer, <eob> and climate change is a reality. <eob>
Climate change is affecting my country. <eob>
Our glaciers are melting, <eob> causing flash floods <eol> and landslides, <eob> which in turn are causing disaster <eol> and widespread destruction in our country. <eob>
I was at that lake recently. <eob> It's stunning. <eob> That's how it looked 10 years ago, <eob> and that's how it looked 20 years ago. <eob>
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist. <eob>
It was a solid glacier. <eob>
A few years ago, a similar lake <eob> breached its dams <eob> and wreaked havoc in the valleys below. <eob>
That destruction was caused <eol> by one glacier lake. <eob>
We have 2,700 of them to contend with. <eob>
The point is this: <eob> my country and my people <eol> have done nothing <eob> to contribute to global warming, <eob> but we are already bearing the brunt <eol> of its consequences. <eob>
And for a small, poor country, <eol> one that is landlocked and mountainous, <eob> it is very difficult. <eob>
But we are not going to sit <eol> on our hands doing nothing. <eob>
We will fight climate change. <eob>
That's why we have promised <eol> to remain carbon neutral. <eob>
We first made this promise in 2009 <eob> during COP 15 in Copenhagen, <eob> but nobody noticed. <eob>
Governments were so busy arguing with one another <eob> and blaming each other <eol> for causing climate change, <eob> that when a small country <eol> raised our hands and announced, <eob> "We promise to remain carbon neutral <eob> for all time," <eob> nobody heard us. <eob> Nobody cared. <eob>
Last December in Paris, <eob> at COP 21, we reiterated <eob> our promise to remain carbon neutral <eob> for all time <eob> to come. <eob>
This time, we were heard. <eob>
We were noticed, and everybody cared. <eob>
What was different in Paris <eol> was that governments came round together <eob> to accept the realities of climate change, <eob> and were willing to come together <eol> and act together and work together. <eob>
All countries, from the very small <eol> to the very large, <eob> committed to reduce <eol> the greenhouse gas emissions. <eob>
The UN Framework Convention <eol> on Climate Change <eob> says that if these so-called intended <eol> commitments are kept, <eob> we'd be closer to containing global warming <eob> by two degrees Celsius. <eob>
By the way, <eob> I've requested the TED organizers here <eob> to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, <eob> so if some of you are feeling <eol> warmer than usual, <eob> you know who to blame. <eob>
It's crucial that all of us <eol> keep our commitments. <eob>
As far as Bhutan is concerned, <eob> we will keep <eob> our promise to remain carbon neutral. <eob>
Here are some of the ways we are doing it. <eob>
We are providing free electricity <eol> to our rural farmers. <eob>
The idea is that, with free electricity, <eol> they will no longer have to use firewood <eob> to cook their food. <eob>
We are investing in sustainable transport <eob> and subsidizing the purchase <eol> of electric vehicles. <eob>
Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost <eol> of LED lights, <eob> and our entire government <eol> is trying to go paperless. <eob>
We are cleaning up our entire <eol> country through Clean Bhutan, a national program, <eob> and we are planting trees <eol> throughout our country <eob> through Green Bhutan, <eob> another national program. <eob>
But it is our protected areas <eob> that are at the core <eol> of our carbon neutral strategy. <eob>
Our protected areas are our carbon sink. <eob>
They are our lungs. <eob>
Today, more than half <eol> our country is protected, <eob> as national parks, nature reserves <eob> and wildlife sanctuaries. <eob>
But the beauty is that we've connected them <eol> all with one another <eob> through a network of biological corridors. <eob>
Now, what this means <eob> is that our animals are free to roam <eol> throughout our country. <eob>
Take this tiger, for example. <eob>
It was spotted at 250 meters <eol> above sea level <eob> in the hot, subtropical jungles. <eob>
Two years later, that same tiger <eob> was spotted near 4,000 meters <eob> in our cold alpine mountains. <eob>
Isn't that awesome? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We must keep it that way. <eob>
We must keep our parks awesome. <eob>
So every year, we set aside resources <eol> to prevent poaching, hunting, <eob> mining and pollution in our parks, <eob> and resources to help communities <eol> who live in those parks <eob> manage their forests, <eob> adapt to climate change, <eob> and lead better lives while continuing <eol> to live in harmony with Mother Nature. <eob>
But that is expensive. <eob> Over the next few years, our small economy <eol> won't have the resources <eob> to cover all the costs that are required <eol> to protect our environment. <eob>
In fact, when we run the numbers, <eob> it looks like it'll take us <eol> at least 15 years <eob> before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts. <eob>
But neither Bhutan, <eob> nor the world <eob> can afford to spend <eol> 15 years going backwards. <eob>
This is why His Majesty the King <eob> started Bhutan For Life. <eob>
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. <eob>
It gives us breathing room. <eob>
It is essentially a funding mechanism <eob> to look after our parks, <eob> to protect our parks, <eob> until our government <eol> can take over on our own fully. <eob>
The idea is to raise a transition fund <eob> from individual donors, corporations <eol> and institutions, <eob> but the deal is closed only after <eol> predetermined conditions are met <eob> and all funds committed. <eob>
So multiparty, single closing: <eob> an idea we borrowed from Wall Street. <eob>
This means that individual donors <eol> can commit without having to worry <eob> that they'll be left <eol> supporting an underfunded plan. <eob>
It's something like a Kickstarter project, <eob> only with a 15-year time horizon <eob> and millions of tons <eol> of carbon dioxide at stake. <eob>
Once the deal is closed, <eob> we use the transition fund <eob> to protect our parks, <eob> giving our government <eol> time to increase our own funding gradually <eob> until the end of the 15-year period. <eob>
After that, our government guarantees <eol> full funding forever. <eob>
We are almost there. <eob> We expect to close later this year. <eob>
Naturally, I'm pretty excited. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The World Wildlife Fund <eol> is our principle partner in this journey, <eob> and I want to give them a big shoutout <eob> for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan <eob> and across the world. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Whew, it is getting warm in here. <eob>
I thank you for listening to our story, <eob> a story of how we are keeping <eob> our promise to remain carbon neutral, <eob> a story of how we are keeping <eol> our country pristine, <eob> for ourselves, our children, <eob> for your children and for the world. <eob>
But we are not here <eol> to tell stories, are we? <eob>
We are here to dream together. <eob>
So in closing, I'd like to share <eol> one more dream that I have. <eob>
What if we could mobilize <eol> our leadership and our resources, <eob> our influence and our passion, <eob> to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea <eol> to other countries <eob> so that they too <eob> can conserve their protected <eol> areas for all time. <eob>
After all, there are many other countries <eol> who face the same issues that we face. <eob>
They too have natural resources <eob> that can help win the world's fight <eol> for sustainability, <eob> only they may not have the ability to invest <eol> in them now. <eob>
So what if we set up Earth For Life, <eob> a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan <eol> For Life throughout the world? <eob>
I invite you to help me, <eob> to carry this dream beyond our borders <eob> to all those who care <eol> about our planet's future. <eob>
After all, we're here <eol> to dream together, <eob> to work together, <eob> to fight climate change together, <eol> to protect our planet together. <eob>
Because the reality is <eob> we are in it together. <eob>
Some of us might dress differently, <eob> but <eob> we are in it together. <eob>
Thank you very much, <eob> and kadrin chhe la. Thank you. <eob>
Thank you, thank you, thank you. <eob>
The following are my opinions, <eob> and do not reflect <eol> the opinions or policies <eob> of any particular prosecutor's office. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am a prosecutor. <eob> I believe in law and order. <eob>
I am the adopted son of a police officer, <eol> a Marine and a hairdresser. <eob>
I believe in accountability <eob> and that we should all be safe <eol> in our communities. <eob>
I love my job <eob> and the people that do it. <eob>
I just think that it's our responsibility <eob> to do it better. <eob>
By a show of hands, <eob> how many of you, <eol> by the age of 25, <eob> had either acted up in school, <eob> went somewhere you were specifically <eol> told to stay out of, <eob> or drank alcohol <eol> before your legal age? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
All right. <eob>
How many of you shoplifted, <eob> tried an illegal drug <eob> or got into a physical fight -- <eob> yes, even with a sibling? <eob>
Now, how many of you ever <eol> spent one day in jail <eob> for any of those decisions? <eob>
How many of you sitting here today <eob> think that you're <eol> a danger to society <eob> or should be defined by those actions <eol> of youthful indiscretion? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Point taken. <eob>
When we talk about criminal justice reform, <eob> we often focus on a few things, <eob> and that's what I want to talk <eol> to you about today. <eob>
But first I'm going to -- <eol> since you shared with me, <eob> I'm going to give you <eol> a confession on my part. <eob>
I went to law school <eob> to make money. <eob>
I had no interest <eol> in being a public servant, <eob> I had no interest <eol> in criminal law, <eob> and I definitely didn't think that I would ever <eol> be a prosecutor. <eob>
Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship <eob> in the Roxbury Division <eol> of Boston Municipal Court. <eob>
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished <eol> neighborhood in Boston, <eob> plagued by gun violence <eol> and drug crime. <eob>
My life and my legal career changed <eol> the first day of that internship. <eob>
I walked into a courtroom, <eol> and I saw an auditorium of people <eob> who, one by one, would approach <eol> the front of that courtroom <eob> to say two words and two words only: <eob> "Not guilty." <eob> They were predominately black and brown. <eob>
And then a judge, a defense attorney <eol> and a prosecutor <eob> would make life-altering decisions <eol> about that person without their input. <eob>
They were predominately white. <eob>
As each person, one by one, approached <eol> the front of that courtroom, <eob> I couldn't stop but think: <eob> How did they get here? <eob>
I wanted to know their stories. <eob>
And as the prosecutor read <eol> the facts of each case, <eob> I was thinking to myself, <eob> we could have predicted that. <eob>
That seems so preventable... <eob> not because I was an expert <eol> in criminal law, <eob> but because it was common sense. <eob>
Over the course of the internship, <eob> I began to recognize people <eol> in the auditorium, <eob> not because they were criminal masterminds <eob> but because they were coming <eol> to us for help <eob> and we were sending them <eol> out without any. <eob>
My second year of law school I worked <eol> as a paralegal for a defense attorney, <eob> and in that experience I met many young men <eol> accused of murder. <eob>
Even in our "worst," I saw human stories. <eob>
And they all contained childhood trauma, <eob> victimization, poverty, loss, <eob> disengagement from school, <eob> early interaction with the police <eol> and the criminal justice system, <eob> all leading to a seat in a courtroom. <eob>
Those convicted of murder <eol> were condemned to die in prison, <eob> and it was during those meetings <eol> with those men that I couldn't fathom <eob> why we would spend so much money <eob> to keep this one person in jail <eol> for the next 80 years <eob> when we could have reinvested it up front, <eob> and perhaps prevented the whole thing <eol> from happening in the first place. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My third year of law school, <eob> I defended people accused <eol> of small street crimes, <eob> mostly mentally ill, <eob> mostly homeless, <eob> mostly drug-addicted, <eob> all in need of help. <eob>
They would come to us, <eob> and we would send them away <eol> without that help. <eob>
They were in need of our assistance. <eob>
But we weren't giving them any. <eob>
Prosecuted, adjudged and defended <eob> by people who knew nothing about them. <eob>
The staggering inefficiency <eol> is what drove me to criminal justice work. <eob>
The unfairness of it all made me <eol> want to be a defender. <eob>
The power dynamic that I came to understand <eob> made me become a prosecutor. <eob>
I don't want to spend a lot of time <eol> talking about the problem. <eob>
We know the criminal justice system <eol> needs reform, <eob> we know there are 2.3 million people <eol> in American jails and prisons, <eob> making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet. <eob>
We know there's another seven million people <eol> on probation or parole, <eob> we know that the criminal justice system <eob> disproportionately <eol> affects people of color, <eob> particularly poor people of color. <eob>
And we know there are system <eol> failures happening everywhere <eob> that bring people to our courtrooms. <eob>
But what we do not discuss <eob> is how ill-equipped our prosecutors <eol> are to receive them. <eob>
When we talk about criminal justice reform, <eob> we, as a society, <eol> focus on three things. <eob>
We complain, we tweet, we protest <eob> about the police, about sentencing laws <eob> and about prison. <eob>
We rarely, if ever, talk <eol> about the prosecutor. <eob>
In the fall of 2009, <eob> a young man was arrested <eol> by the Boston Police Department. <eob>
He was 18 years old, <eol> he was African American <eob> and he was a senior <eol> at a local public school. <eob>
He had his sights set on college <eob> but his part-time, minimum-wage job <eol> wasn't providing the financial opportunity <eob> he needed to enroll in school. <eob>
In a series of bad decisions, <eob> he stole 30 laptops from a store <eol> and sold them on the Internet. <eob>
This led to his arrest <eob> and a criminal complaint <eol> of 30 felony charges. <eob>
The potential jail time he faced <eol> is what stressed Christopher out the most. <eob>
But what he had little understanding of <eob> was the impact a criminal record <eol> would have on his future. <eob>
I was standing in arraignments that day <eob> when Christopher's case <eol> came across my desk. <eob>
And at the risk of sounding <eol> dramatic, in that moment, <eob> I had Christopher's life in my hands. <eob>
I was 29 years old, <eol> a brand-new prosecutor, <eob> and I had little appreciation for how <eol> the decisions I would make <eob> would impact Christopher's life. <eob>
Christopher's case was a serious one <eob> and it needed to be dealt with as such, <eob> but I didn't think branding him a felon <eol> for the rest of his life <eob> was the right answer. <eob>
For the most part, prosecutors <eol> step onto the job <eob> with little appreciation of the impact <eol> of our decisions, <eob> regardless of our intent. <eob>
Despite our broad discretion, <eob> we learn to avoid risk at all cost, <eob> rendering our discretion <eob> basically useless. <eob>
History has conditioned us <eol> to believe that somehow, <eob> the criminal justice system <eol> brings about accountability <eob> and improves public safety, <eob> despite evidence to the contrary. <eob>
We're judged internally and externally <eol> by our convictions and our trial wins, <eob> so prosecutors aren't really incentivized <eol> to be creative <eob> at our case dispositions, <eob> or to take risks <eol> on people we might not otherwise. <eob>
We stick to an outdated method, <eob> counterproductive to achieving <eol> the very goal that we all want, <eob> and that's safer communities. <eob>
Yet most prosecutors standing <eol> in my space would have arraigned Christopher. <eob>
They have little appreciation <eol> for what we can do. <eob>
Arraigning Christopher would give him <eol> a criminal record, <eob> making it harder for him <eol> to get a job, <eob> setting in motion a cycle <eob> that defines the failing criminal justice <eol> system today. <eob>
With a criminal record <eol> and without a job, <eob> Christopher would be unable to find <eol> employment, education or stable housing. <eob>
Without those protective factors in his life, <eob> Christopher would be more likely to commit <eol> further, more serious crime. <eob>
The more contact Christopher had <eol> with the criminal justice system, <eob> the more likely it would be <eol> that he would return again <eob> and again and again -- <eob> all at tremendous social cost <eol> to his children, to his family <eob> and to his peers. <eob>
And, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us. <eob>
When I came out of law school, <eob> I did the same thing as everybody else. <eob>
I came out as a prosecutor <eol> expected to do justice, <eob> but I never learned what justice <eol> was in my classes -- <eob> none of us do. <eob>
None of us do. <eob>
And yet, prosecutors <eol> are the most powerful actors <eob> in the criminal justice system. <eob>
Our power is virtually boundless. <eob>
In most cases, not the judge, <eob> not the police, not the legislature, <eob> not the mayor, not the governor, <eol> not the President <eob> can tell us how to prosecute our cases. <eob>
The decision to arraign Christopher <eol> and give him a criminal record <eob> was exclusively mine. <eob>
I would choose whether to prosecute him <eol> for 30 felonies, for one felony, <eob> for a misdemeanor, <eob> or at all. <eob>
I would choose whether to leverage Christopher <eol> into a plea deal <eob> or take the case to trial, and ultimately, <eob> I would be in a position to ask <eol> for Christopher to go to jail. <eob>
These are decisions that prosecutors <eol> make every day unfettered, <eob> and we are unaware <eol> and untrained <eob> of the grave consequences <eol> of those decisions. <eob>
One night this past summer, <eob> I was at a small gathering <eol> of professional men of color <eob> from around the city. <eob>
As I stood there stuffing free finger <eol> sandwiches into my mouth, <eob> as you do as public servant -- <eob>
I noticed across the room, <eob> a young man waving and smiling at me <eol> and approaching me. <eob>
And I recognized him, <eol> but I couldn't place from where, <eob> and before I knew it, this young man <eol> was hugging me. <eob>
And thanking me. <eob> "You cared about me, and you changed my life." <eob> It was Christopher. <eob>
See, I never arraigned Christopher. <eob>
He never faced a judge or a jail, <eob> he never had a criminal record. <eob>
Instead, I worked with Christopher; <eob> first on being accountable <eol> for his actions, <eob> and then, putting him in a position <eol> where he wouldn't re-offend. <eob>
We recovered 75 percent <eol> of the computers that he sold <eob> and gave them back to Best Buy, <eob> and came up with a financial plan <eob> to repay for the computers <eol> we couldn't recover. <eob>
Christopher did community service. <eob>
He wrote an essay reflecting <eol> on how this case could impact his future <eob> and that of the community. <eob>
He applied to college, <eob> he obtained financial aid, <eob> and he went on to graduate <eol> from a four-year school. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
After we finished hugging, <eol> I looked at his name tag, <eob> to learn that Christopher was the manager <eol> of a large bank in Boston. <eob>
Christopher had accomplished -- <eol> and making a lot more money than me -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He had accomplished all of this <eob> in the six years since I had first seen him <eol> in Roxbury Court. <eob>
I can't take credit <eol> for Christopher's journey to success, <eob> but I certainly did my part <eol> to keep him on the path. <eob>
There are thousands of Christophers out there, <eob> some locked in our jails <eol> and prisons. <eob>
We need thousands of prosecutors <eob> to recognize that and to protect them. <eob>
An employed Christopher is better <eol> for public safety than a condemned one. <eob>
It's a bigger win for all of us. <eob>
In retrospect, the decision not <eol> to throw the book at Christopher <eob> makes perfect sense. <eob>
When I saw him that first day <eol> in Roxbury Court, <eob> I didn't see a criminal standing there. <eob>
I saw myself -- a young person <eol> in need of intervention. <eob>
As an individual caught selling a large quantity <eol> of drugs in my late teens, <eob> I knew firsthand the power of opportunity <eob> as opposed to the wrath <eol> of the criminal justice system. <eob>
Along the way, with the help and guidance <eol> of my district attorney, <eob> my supervisor and judges, <eob> I learned the power of the prosecutor <eob> to change lives instead of ruining them. <eob>
And that's how we do it in Boston. <eob>
We helped a woman who was arrested <eol> for stealing groceries to feed her kids <eob> get a job. <eob>
Instead of putting an abused <eol> teenager in adult jail <eob> for punching another teenager, <eob> we secured mental health treatment <eol> and community supervision. <eob>
A runaway girl who was arrested <eob> for prostituting, <eol> to survive on the streets, <eob> needed a safe place to live and grow -- <eob> something we could help her with. <eob>
I even helped a young man <eob> who was so afraid of the older gang kids <eol> showing up after school, <eob> that one morning instead of a lunchbox <eol> into his backpack, <eob> he put a loaded 9-millimeter. <eob>
We would spend our time <eol> that we'd normally take prepping our cases <eob> for months and months <eol> for trial down the road <eob> by coming up with real solutions <eol> to the problems as they presented. <eob>
Which is the better way to spend our time? <eob>
How would you prefer your prosecutors <eol> to spend theirs? <eob>
Why are we spending 80 billion dollars <eob> on a prison industry <eol> that we know is failing, <eob> when we could take that money <eol> and reallocate it into education, <eob> into mental health treatment, <eob> into substance abuse treatment <eob> and to community investment <eol> so we can develop our neighborhoods? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So why should this matter to you? <eob>
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money. <eob> Our money. <eob> It costs 109,000 dollars in some states <eob> to lock up a teenager for a year, <eob> with a 60 percent chance that that person <eol> will return to the very same system. <eob>
That is a terrible return on investment. <eob>
Number two: it's the right thing to do. <eob>
If prosecutors were a part <eol> of creating the problem, <eob> it's incumbent on us <eol> to create a solution <eob> and we can do that <eol> using other disciplines <eob> that have already done the data <eol> and research for us. <eob>
And number three: <eob> your voice and your vote <eol> can make that happen. <eob>
The next time there's a local <eol> district attorney's election <eob> in your jurisdiction, <eob> ask candidates these questions. <eob>
One: What are you doing to make me <eol> and my neighbors safer? <eob>
Two: What data are you collecting, <eob> and how are you training your prosecutors <eob> to make sure that it's working? <eob>
And number three: <eob> If it's not working for everybody, <eob> what are you doing to fix it? <eob>
If they can't answer the questions, <eob> they shouldn't be doing the job. <eob>
Each one of you that raised your hand <eol> at the beginning of this talk <eob> is a living, breathing example <eol> of the power of opportunity, <eob> of intervention, <eob> of support <eob> and of love. <eob>
While each of you may have faced <eol> your own brand of discipline <eob> for whatever malfeasances you committed, <eob> barely any of you needed a day in jail <eob> to make you the people that you are today -- <eob> some of the greatest minds <eol> on the planet. <eob>
Every day, thousands of times a day, <eob> prosecutors around the United States <eol> wield power so great <eob> that it can bring about catastrophe <eob> as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, <eob> intervention, <eob> support <eob> and yes, even love. <eob>
Those qualities <eol> are the hallmarks of a strong community, <eob> and a strong community is a safe one. <eob>
If our communities are broken, <eob> don't let the lawyers <eol> that you elect fix them <eob> with outdated, inefficient, <eol> expensive methods. <eob>
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor <eol> who's helping people stay out of jail, <eob> not putting them in. <eob>
Demand better. <eob> You deserve it, your children deserve it, <eob> the people who are tied up in the system deserve it, <eob> but most of all, <eob> the people that we are sworn <eol> to protect and do justice for demand it. <eob>
We must, <eob> we must do better. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
In India, we have these huge families. <eob>
I bet a lot of you all <eol> must have heard about it. <eob>
Which means that there are <eol> a lot of family events. <eob>
So as a child, my parents <eol> used to drag me to these family events. <eob>
But the one thing <eol> that I always looked forward to <eob> was playing around with my cousins. <eob>
And there was always this one uncle <eob> who used to be there, <eob> always ready, jumping around with us, <eob> having games for us, <eob> making us kids have the time of our lives. <eob>
This man was extremely successful: <eob> he was confident and powerful. <eob>
But then I saw this hale and hearty person <eol> deteriorate in health. <eob>
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's. <eob>
Parkinson's is a disease that causes <eol> degeneration of the nervous system, <eob> which means that this person <eol> who used to be independent <eob> suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, <eol> because of tremors, much more difficult. <eob>
My uncle started using a walker to walk, <eob> and to take a turn, <eob> he literally had to take <eol> one step at a time, like this, <eob> and it took forever. <eob>
So this person, who used to be <eol> the center of attention <eob> in every family gathering, <eob> was suddenly hiding behind people. <eob>
He was hiding from the pitiful look <eol> in people's eyes. <eob>
And he's not the only one in the world. <eob>
Every year, 60,000 people <eol> are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, <eob> and this number is only rising. <eob>
As designers, we dream that our designs <eol> solve these multifaceted problems, <eob> one solution that solves it all, <eob> but it need not always be like that. <eob>
You can also target simple problems <eob> and create small solutions for them <eol> and eventually make a big impact. <eob>
So my aim here was <eol> to not cure Parkinson's, <eob> but to make their everyday tasks <eol> much more simple, <eob> and then make an impact. <eob>
Well, the first thing I targeted <eol> was tremors, right? <eob>
My uncle told me that he had stopped <eol> drinking coffee or tea in public <eob> just out of embarrassment, <eob> so, well, I designed the no-spill cup. <eob>
It works just purely on its form. <eob>
The curve on top deflects the liquid <eol> back inside every time they have tremors, <eob> and this keeps the liquid inside <eol> compared to a normal cup. <eob>
But the key here is that it is not tagged <eol> as a Parkinson's patient product. <eob>
It looks like a cup that could be used <eol> by you, me, any clumsy person, <eob> and that makes it much more comforting <eol> for them to use, to blend in. <eob>
So, well, one problem solved, <eob> many more to go. <eob>
All this while, I was interviewing him, <eob> questioning him, <eob> and then I realized that I was getting <eol> very superficial information, <eob> or just answers to my questions. <eob>
But I really needed to dig deeper <eol> to get a new perspective. <eob>
So I thought, well, <eol> let's observe him in his daily tasks, <eob> while he's eating, while he's watching TV. <eob>
And then, when I was actually <eol> observing him walking to his dining table, <eob> it struck me, this man who finds it <eol> so difficult to walk on flat land, <eob> how does he climb a staircase? <eob>
Because in India we do not have <eol> a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase <eob> like in the developed countries. <eob>
One actually has to climb the stairs. <eob>
So he told me, <eob> "Well, let me show you how I do it." <eob> Let's take a look at what I saw. <eob>
So he took really long <eol> to reach this position, <eob> and then all this while, I'm thinking, <eob> "Oh my God, is he really going to do it? <eob>
Is he really, really going to do it <eol> without his walker? <eob> "And then... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And the turns, he took them so easily. <eob>
So -- shocked? <eob> Well, I was too. <eob> So this person who could not <eol> walk on flat land <eob> was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs. <eob>
On researching this, I realized that <eol> it's because it's a continuous motion. <eob>
There's this other man <eol> who also suffers from the same symptoms <eob> and uses a walker, <eob> but the moment he's put on a cycle, <eob> all his symptoms vanish, <eob> because it is a continuous motion. <eob>
So the key for me was to translate <eol> this feeling of walking on a staircase <eob> back to flat land. <eob>
And a lot of ideas <eol> were tested and tried on him, <eob> but the one that finally worked <eol> was this one. Let's take a look. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
He walked faster, right? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I call this the staircase illusion, <eob> and actually when the staircase illusion <eol> abruptly ended, he froze, <eob> and this is called freezing of gait. <eob>
So it happens a lot, <eob> so why not have a staircase illusion <eol> flowing through all their rooms, <eob> making them feel much more confident? <eob>
You know, technology is not always it. <eob>
What we need are human-centered solutions. <eob>
I could have easily <eol> made it into a projection, <eob> or a Google Glass, or something like that. <eob>
But I stuck to simple print on the floor. <eob>
This print could be taken into hospitals <eob> to make them feel much more welcome. <eob>
What I wish to do <eol> is make every Parkinson's patient <eob> feel like my uncle felt that day. <eob>
He told me that I made him feel <eol> like his old self again. <eob>
"Smart" in today's world <eol> has become synonymous to high tech, <eob> and the world is only getting <eol> smarter and smarter day by day. <eob>
But why can't smart be something <eol> that's simple and yet effective? <eob>
All we need is a little bit of empathy <eol> and some curiosity, <eob> to go out there, observe. <eob>
But let's not stop at that. <eob>
Let's find these complex problems. <eob>
Don't be scared of them. <eob>
Break them, boil them down <eol> into much smaller problems, <eob> and then find simple solutions for them. <eob>
Test these solutions, fail if needed, <eob> but with newer insights to make it better. <eob>
Imagine what we all could do <eol> if we all came up with simple solutions. <eob>
What would the world be like <eol> if we combined all our simple solutions? <eob>
Let's make a smarter world, <eol> but with simplicity. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, this is a story <eob> about how we know what we know. <eob>
It's a story about this woman, <eob> Natalia Rybczynski. <eob>
She's a paleobiologist, <eob> which means she specializes in digging <eol> up really old dead stuff. <eob>
(Audio) <eob> Natalia Rybczynski: <eob> Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. <eol> Dead Things." <eob>
Latif Nasser: And I think <eol> she's particularly interesting <eob> because of where she digs that stuff up, <eob> way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra. <eob>
Now, one summer day in 2006, <eob> she was at a dig site <eol> called the Fyles Leaf Bed, <eob> which is less than 10 degrees latitude <eol> away from the magnetic north pole. <eob>
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not <eol> going to sound very exciting, <eob> because it was a day of walking <eol> with your backpack and your GPS <eob> and notebook and just picking up anything <eol> that might be a fossil. <eob>
LN: And at some point, <eol> she noticed something. <eob>
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored, <eob> about the size of the palm of my hand. <eob>
It was just lying on the surface. <eob>
LN: And at first she thought <eol> it was just a splinter of wood, <eob> because that's the sort of thing <eol> people had found <eob> at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- <eol> prehistoric plant parts. <eob>
But that night, back at camp ... <eob>
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens, <eob> I'm looking a little bit <eol> more closely and realizing <eob> it doesn't quite look <eol> like this has tree rings. <eob>
Maybe it's a preservation thing, <eob> but it looks really like ... <eob> bone. <eob>
LN: Huh. So over the next four years, <eob> she went to that spot over and over, <eob> and eventually collected 30 fragments <eol> of that exact same bone, <eob> most of them really tiny. <eob>
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. <eob>
It fits in a small Ziploc bag. <eob>
LN: And she tried to piece them together <eol> like a jigsaw puzzle. <eob>
But it was challenging. <eob>
(Audio) NR: It's broken up <eol> into so many little tiny pieces, <eob> I'm trying to use sand and putty, <eol> and it's not looking good. <eob>
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner. <eob>
LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
LN: It turns out it was way easier <eol> to do it virtually. <eob>
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical <eol> when it all fits together. <eob>
LN: How certain were you <eol> that you had it right, <eob> that you had put it together in the right way? <eob>
Was there a potential <eol> that you'd put it together a different way <eob> and have, like, a parakeet or something? <eob>
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this. <eob>
LN: What she had, she discovered, <eol> was a tibia, a leg bone, <eob> and specifically, one that belonged <eol> to a cloven-hoofed mammal, <eob> so something like a cow or a sheep. <eob>
But it couldn't have been either of those. <eob>
It was just too big. <eob>
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, <eol> it was huge. <eob>
It's a really big animal. <eob>
LN: So what animal could it be? <eob>
Having hit a wall, <eol> she showed one of the fragments <eob> to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, <eob> and they had an idea. <eob>
(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked <eol> just the edge of it, <eob> and there was this really interesting <eol> smell that comes from it. <eob>
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh. <eob>
It was a smell that Natalia recognized <eob> from cutting up skulls <eol> in her gross anatomy lab: <eob> collagen. <eob>
Collagen is what gives structure <eol> to our bones. <eob>
And usually, after so many years, <eob> it breaks down. <eob>
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer <eol> and preserved it. <eob>
Then a year or two later, Natalia <eol> was at a conference in Bristol, <eob> and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley <eob> was demoing this new process <eol> that he called "collagen fingerprinting." <eob> It turns out that different species <eol> have slightly different structures <eob> of collagen, <eob> so if you get a collagen profile <eol> of an unknown bone, <eob> you can compare it to those of known species, <eob> and, who knows, maybe you get a match. <eob>
So she shipped him one of the fragments, <eob> FedEx. <eob>
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. <eol> It's kind of important. <eob>
LN: And he processed it, <eob> and compared it to 37 known <eol> and modern-day mammal species. <eob>
And he found a match. <eob>
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone <eob> that Natalia had dug out <eol> of the High Arctic <eob> belonged to ... <eob> a camel. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? <eol> That's amazing -- if it's true. <eob>
LN: So they tested a bunch <eol> of the fragments, <eob> and they got the same result for each one. <eob>
However, based on the size <eol> of the bone that they found, <eob> it meant that this camel <eol> was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels. <eob>
So this camel would have been <eol> about nine feet tall, <eob> weighed around a ton. <eob>
(Audience reacts) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, when you hear the word "camel," <eob> what may come to mind <eol> is one of these, <eob> the Bactrian camel <eol> of East and Central Asia. <eob>
But chances are the postcard image <eol> you have in your brain <eob> is one of these, the dromedary, <eob> quintessential desert creature -- <eob> hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East <eol> and the Sahara, <eob> has a big old hump on its back <eob> for storing water for those long desert treks, <eob> has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes. <eob>
So how on earth would one of these guys <eol> end up in the High Arctic? <eob>
Well, scientists have known for a long time, <eol> turns out, <eob> even before Natalia's discovery, <eob> that camels are actually originally American. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Music: The Star-Spangled Banner) <eob>
They started here. <eob> For nearly 40 of the 45 million years <eol> that camels have been around, <eob> you could only find them <eol> in North America, <eob> around 20 different species, maybe more. <eob>
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, <eol> would they look different? <eob>
NR: Yeah, you're going <eol> to have different body sizes. <eob>
You'll have some <eol> with really long necks, <eob> so they're actually functionally like giraffes. <eob>
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles. <eob>
(Audio) NR: The really primitive, <eol> early ones would have been really small, <eob> almost like rabbits. <eob>
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels? <eob>
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones. <eob>
So those ones <eol> you probably would not recognize. <eob>
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel. <eob>
(Audio) NR: I know, <eol> wouldn't that be great? <eob>
LN: And then about three <eol> to seven million years ago, <eob> one branch of camels <eol> went down to South America, <eob> where they became llamas <eol> and alpacas, <eob> and another branch crossed <eol> over the Bering Land Bridge <eob> into Asia and Africa. <eob>
And then around the end <eol> of the last ice age, <eob> North American camels went extinct. <eob>
So, scientists knew all of that already, <eob> but it still doesn't fully explain <eol> how Natalia found one so far north. <eob>
Like, this is, temperature-wise, <eol> the polar opposite of the Sahara. <eob>
Now to be fair, <eob> three and a half million years ago, <eob> it was on average 22 degrees Celsius <eol> warmer than it is now. <eob>
So it would have been boreal forest, <eob> so more like the Yukon or Siberia today. <eob>
But still, like, they would have <eol> six-month-long winters <eob> where the ponds would freeze over. <eob>
You'd have blizzards. <eob>
You'd have 24 hours a day <eol> of straight darkness. <eob>
Like, how ... How? <eob>
How is it that one of these Saharan <eol> superstars <eob> could ever have survived <eol> those arctic conditions? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Natalia and her colleagues <eol> think they have an answer. <eob>
And it's kind of brilliant. <eob>
What if the very features <eol> that we imagine make the camel so well-suited <eob> to places like the Sahara, <eob> actually evolved to help it <eol> get through the winter? <eob>
What if those broad feet were <eol> meant to tromp not over sand, <eob> but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes? <eob>
What if that hump -- <eol> which, huge news to me, <eob> does not contain water, it contains fat -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
was there to help the camel <eol> get through that six-month-long winter, <eob> when food was scarce? <eob>
And then, only later, long after it <eol> crossed over the land bridge <eob> did it retrofit those winter <eol> features for a hot desert environment? <eob>
Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful <eol> to camels in hotter climes <eob> because having all your fat in one place, <eob> like a, you know, fat backpack, <eob> means that you don't have to have <eol> that insulation <eob> all over the rest of your body. <eob>
So it helps heat dissipate easier. <eob>
It's this crazy idea, <eob> that what seems like proof <eol> of the camel's quintessential desert nature <eob> could actually be proof <eol> of its High Arctic past. <eob>
Now, I'm not the first person <eol> to tell this story. <eob>
Others have told it as a way <eol> to marvel at evolutionary biology <eob> or as a keyhole into the future <eol> of climate change. <eob>
But I love it for a totally <eol> different reason. <eob>
For me, it's a story about us, <eob> about how we see the world <eob> and about how that changes. <eob>
So I was trained as a historian. <eob>
And I've learned that, actually, <eol> a lot of scientists are historians, too. <eob>
They make sense of the past. <eob>
They tell the history of our universe, <eol> of our planet, of life on this planet. <eob>
And as a historian, <eob> you start with an idea in your mind <eol> of how the story goes. <eob>
(Audio) NR: We make up stories <eol> and we stick with it, <eob> like the camel <eol> in the desert, right? <eob>
That's a great story! <eob>
It's totally adapted for that. <eob>
Clearly, it always lived there. <eob>
LN: But at any moment, <eol> you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence. <eob>
You could learn some tiny thing <eob> that forces you to reframe everything <eol> you thought you knew. <eob>
Like, in this case, this one scientist <eol> finds this one shard <eob> of what she thought was wood, <eob> and because of that, science has a totally new <eol> and totally counterintuitive theory <eob> about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature <eob> looks the way it does. <eob>
And for me, it completely upended <eol> the way I think of the camel. <eob>
It went from being this ridiculously <eol> niche creature <eob> suited only to this <eol> one specific environment, <eob> to being this world traveler <eol> that just happens to be in the Sahara, <eob> and could end up virtually anywhere. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is Azuri. <eob> Azuri, hi, how are you doing? <eob>
OK, here, I've got one of these <eol> for you here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So Azuri is on a break <eol> from her regular gig <eob> at the Radio City Music Hall. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's not even a joke. <eob> Anyway -- <eob>
But really, Azuri is here <eol> as a living reminder <eob> that the story of our world <eol> is a dynamic one. <eob>
It requires our willingness <eol> to readjust, to reimagine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right, Azuri? <eob>
And, really, that we're all just <eol> one shard of bone away <eob> from seeing the world anew. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
I come from one of the most liberal, <eob> tolerant, progressive <eol> places in the United States, <eob> Seattle, Washington. <eob>
And I grew up with a family <eol> of great Seattlites. <eob>
My mother was an artist, my father <eol> was a college professor, <eob> and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, <eob> because I always felt <eol> completely comfortable designing my life <eob> exactly as I saw fit. <eob>
And in point of fact, <eob> I took a route that was not exactly <eol> what my parents had in mind. <eob>
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- <eob> dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I went on the road <eol> as a professional French horn player, <eob> which was my lifelong dream. <eob>
I played chamber music all over <eol> the United States and Europe, <eob> and I toured for a couple of years <eob> with a great jazz guitar player <eol> named Charlie Bird. <eob>
And by the end of my 20s, <eob> I wound up as a member <eol> of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain. <eob> What a great life. <eob>
And you know, my parents never complained. <eob>
They supported me all the way through it. <eob>
It wasn't their dream. <eob>
They used to tell their neighbors <eol> and friends, <eob> "Our son, he's taking a gap decade." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And — <eob> There was, however, one awkward <eol> conversation about my lifestyle <eob> that I want to tell you about. <eob>
I was 27, and I was home <eol> from Barcelona, <eob> and I was visiting <eol> my parents for Christmas, <eob> and I was cooking dinner with my mother, <eol> and we were alone in the kitchen. <eob>
And she was quiet, too quiet. <eob> Something was wrong. <eob> And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?" <eob> And she said, "Your dad <eol> and I are really worried about you." <eob> And I said, "What?" I mean, <eol> what could it be, at this point? <eob>
And she said, "I want you to be <eol> completely honest with me: <eob> have you been voting for Republicans?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the truth is, <eob> I wasn't really political, <eol> I was just a French horn player. <eob>
But I had a bit of an epiphany, <eob> and they had detected it, and it was causing <eol> some confusion. <eob>
You see, I had become <eol> an enthusiast for capitalism, <eob> and I want to tell you why that is. <eob>
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine <eob> in, believe it or not, poverty. <eob>
See, when I was a kid <eol> growing up in Seattle, <eob> I remember the first time <eol> I saw real poverty. <eob>
We were a lower middle class family, <eol> but that's of course not real poverty. <eob>
That's not even close. <eob>
The first time I saw poverty, <eol> and poverty's face, <eob> was when I was six or seven years old, <eol> early 1970s. <eob>
And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, <eol> kind of trite. <eob>
It was a picture <eol> in the National Geographic Magazine <eob> of a kid who was my age in East Africa, <eob> and there were flies on his face <eol> and a distended belly. <eob>
And he wasn't going to make it, <eol> and I knew that, and I was helpless. <eob>
Some of you remember that picture, <eob> not exactly that picture, <eol> one just like it. <eob>
It introduced the West to grinding <eol> poverty around the world. <eob>
Well, that vision kind of haunted me <eol> as I grew up and I went to school <eob> and I dropped out <eol> and dropped in <eob> and started my family. <eob>
And I wondered, what happened to that kid? <eob> Or to people just like him <eol> all over the world? <eob>
And so I started to study, <eol> even though I wasn't in college, <eob> I was looking for the answer: <eob> what happened to the world's poorest people? <eob>
Has it gotten worse? <eol> Has it gotten better? What? <eob>
And I found the answer, <eol> and it changed my life, <eob> and I want to share it with you. <eob>
See -- <eob> most Americans believe <eol> that poverty has gotten worse <eob> since we were children, since they saw <eol> that vision. <eob>
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty <eob> gotten <eol> worse or better around the world?", <eob> 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten <eol> worse since the early 1970s. <eob>
But here's the truth. <eob>
Here's the epiphany <eol> that I had that changed my thinking. <eob>
From 1970 until today, <eob> the percentage <eol> of the world's population <eob> living in starvation levels, <eob> living on a dollar a day or less, <eol> obviously adjusted for inflation, <eob> that percentage has declined <eob> by 80 percent. <eob>
There's been an 80 percent decline <eol> in the world's worst poverty <eob> since I was a kid. <eob>
And I didn't even know about it. <eob>
This, my friends, that's a miracle. <eob>
That's something we ought to celebrate. <eob>
It's the greatest antipoverty <eol> achievement in the history of mankind, <eob> and it happened in our lifetimes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So when I learned this, I asked, what did <eol> that? What made it possible? <eob>
Because if you don't know why, <eol> you can't do it again. <eob>
If you want to replicate it <eob> and get the next two billion people <eol> out of poverty, <eob> because that's what we're talking about: <eob> since I was a kid, <eob> two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, <eob> have been pulled out of poverty. <eob>
I want the next two billion, <eol> so I've got to know why. <eob>
And I went in search of an answer. <eob>
And it wasn't a political answer, <eol> because I didn't care. <eob>
You know what, I still don't care. <eob>
I wanted the best answer <eol> from mainstream economists <eob> left, right and center. <eob>
And here it is. <eob> Here are the reasons. <eob>
There are five reasons that <eol> two billion of our brothers and sisters <eob> have been pulled out of poverty <eob> since I was a kid. <eob>
Number one: globalization. <eob>
Number two: free trade. <eob>
Number three: property rights. <eob>
Number four: rule of law. <eob>
Number five: entrepreneurship. <eob>
It was the free enterprise system <eol> spreading around the world <eob> after 1970 that did that. <eob>
Now, I'm not naive. <eob>
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, <eob> and I know that free enterprise <eol> isn't everything we need <eob> to build a better world. <eob>
But that is great. <eob>
And that's beyond politics. <eob>
Here's what I learned. <eol> This is the epiphany. <eob>
Capitalism is not just about accumulation. <eob>
At its best, it's about aspiration, <eob> which is what so many people <eol> on this stage talk about, <eob> is the aspiration that comes from dreams <eob> that are embedded in the free enterprise system. <eob>
And we've got to share it <eol> with more people. <eob>
Now, I want to tell you <eol> about a second epiphany <eob> that's related to that first one <eob> that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, <eob> but right here at home. <eob>
The best quote I've ever heard <eob> to summarize the thoughts <eol> that I've just given you <eob> about pulling people out of poverty <eob> is as follows: <eob> "Free markets have created more wealth <eol> than any system in history. <eob>
They have lifted billions out of poverty." <eob>
Who said it? <eob> It sounds like Milton Friedman <eol> or Ronald Reagan. <eob> Wrong. <eob> President Barack Obama said that. <eob>
Why do I know it by heart? <eob>
Because he said it to me. <eob> Crazy. <eob> And I said, "Hallelujah." <eob> But more than that, I said, <eob> "What an opportunity." <eob>
You know what I was thinking? <eob>
It was at an event <eol> that we were doing on the subject <eob> at Georgetown University in May of 2015. <eob>
And I thought, this is the solution <eob> to the biggest problem <eol> facing America today. What? <eob> It's coming together <eol> around these ideas, <eob> liberals and conservatives, <eob> to help people who need us <eol> the most. <eob>
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room <eol> that we're in a crisis, <eob> in America and many countries around the world <eol> with political polarization. <eob>
It's risen to critical, crisis levels. <eob> It's unpleasant. It's not right. <eob>
There was an article last year <eob> in the Proceedings of the National <eol> Academy of Sciences, <eob> which is one of the most prestigious <eol> scientific journals <eob> published in the West. <eob>
And it was an article in 2014 <eob> on political motive <eol> asymmetry. <eob> What's that? That's what psychologists <eol> call the phenomenon <eob> of assuming that your ideology <eol> is based in love <eob> but your opponents' <eol> ideology is based in hate. <eob>
It's common in world conflict. <eob>
You expect to see this between Palestinians <eol> and Israelis, for example. <eob>
What the authors of this article found <eob> was that in America today, <eol> a majority of Republicans and Democrats <eob> suffer from political motive asymmetry. <eob>
A majority of people in our country today <eol> who are politically active believe <eob> that they are motivated <eol> by love but the other side is motivated by hate. <eob> Think about it. Think about it. <eob> Most people are walking <eol> around saying, <eob> "You know, my ideology is based <eol> on basic benevolence, <eob> I want to help people, <eob> but the other guys, <eol> they're evil and out to get me." <eob> You can't progress as a society <eol> when you have this kind of asymmetry. <eob> It's impossible. <eob>
How do we solve it? <eob> Well, first, let's be honest: <eol> there are differences. <eob>
Let's not minimize the differences. <eol> That would be really naïve. <eob> There's a lot of good research on this. <eob>
A veteran of the TED stage is my friend <eol> Jonathan Haidt. <eob>
He's a psychology professor <eol> at New York University. <eob>
He does work on the ideology <eol> and values and morals of different people <eob> to see how they differ. <eob>
And he's shown, for example, <eol> that conservatives and liberals <eob> have a very different emphasis <eol> on what they think is important. <eob>
For example, Jon Haidt has shown <eob> that liberals care about poverty <eob> 59 percent more than they care <eol> about economic liberty. <eob>
And conservatives care about economic liberty <eob> 28 percent more than they care <eol> about poverty. <eob>
Irreconcilable differences, right? <eob> We'll never come together. <eob> Wrong. <eob> That is diversity in which <eol> lies our strength. <eob>
Remember what pulled up the poor. <eob>
It was the obsession with poverty, <eob> accompanied by the method <eol> of economic freedom <eob> spreading around the world. <eob>
We need each other, in other words, <eob> if we want to help people <eob> and get the next two billion people <eol> out of poverty. <eob>
There's no other way. <eob>
Hmm. <eob> How are we going to get that? <eob> It's a tricky thing, isn't it. <eob> We need innovative thinking. <eob>
A lot of it's on this stage. <eob> Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal. <eob> We need investment overseas <eob> in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. <eol> Yes. Yes. <eob>
But you know what we really need? <eob>
We need a new day <eol> in flexible ideology. <eob> We need to be less predictable. <eob> Don't we? <eob> Do you ever feel like your own ideology <eol> is starting to get predictable? <eob> Kinda conventional? <eob> Do you ever feel like you're always <eol> listening to people who agree with you? <eob> Why is that dangerous? <eob>
Because when we talk in this country <eol> about economics, <eob> on the right, conservatives, <eob> you're always talking about taxes <eol> and regulations and big government. <eob>
And on the left, liberals, <eol> you're talking about economics, <eob> it's always about income inequality. <eob> Right? Now those are important things, <eob> really important to me, <eol> really important to you. <eob>
But when it comes to lifting people up <eob> who are starving and need us today, <eol> those are distractions. <eob>
We need to come together <eol> around the best ways <eob> to mitigate poverty <eol> using the best tools at our disposal, <eob> and that comes only when conservatives <eol> recognize that they need liberals <eob> and their obsession with poverty, <eob> and liberals need conservatives <eol> and their obsession with free markets. <eob>
That's the diversity in which <eol> lies the future strength of this country, <eob> if we choose to take it. <eob>
So how are we going to do it? <eol> How are we going to do it together? <eob>
I've got to have some action <eol> items, not just for you but for me. <eob> Number one. Action item number one: <eob> remember, it's not good enough just <eol> to tolerate people who disagree. <eob>
It's not good enough. <eob>
We have to remember that we need <eol> people who disagree with us, <eob> because there are people <eol> who need all of us <eob> who are still waiting for these tools. <eob> Now, what are you going to do? <eob>
We're blessed with leadership. <eob> When people hear us, with the kind <eol> of unpredictable ideology, <eob> then maybe people will listen. <eob>
Maybe progress will start at that point. <eob>
That's number one. Number two. <eob> Number two: I'm asking you <eol> and I'm asking me <eob> to be the person <eol> specifically who blurs the lines, <eob> who is ambiguous, <eol> who is hard to classify. <eob>
If you're a conservative, <eob> be the conservative who is always <eol> going on about poverty <eob> and the moral obligation <eol> to be a warrior for the poor. <eob>
And if you're a liberal, <eol> be a liberal who is always talking <eob> about the beauty of free markets <eol> to solve our problems <eob> when we use them responsibly. <eob>
If we do that, we get two things. <eob>
Number one: we get to start <eol> to work on the next two billion <eob> and be the solution <eol> that we've seen so much of in the past <eob> and we need to see more of in the future. <eol> That's what we get. <eob> And the second is that we might just be able <eob> to take the ghastly holy war of ideology <eol> that we're suffering under in this country <eob> and turn it into a competition <eol> of ideas <eob> based on solidarity and mutual respect. <eob>
And then maybe, just maybe, <eob> we'll all realize that our big differences <eob> aren't really that big after all. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hannah is excited to be going to college. <eob>
She couldn't wait to get out <eol> of her parents' house, <eob> to prove to them <eol> that she's an adult, <eob> and to prove to her new friends <eol> that she belongs. <eob>
She heads to a campus party <eob> where she sees a guy <eol> that she has a crush on. <eob> Let's call him Mike. <eob>
The next day, Hannah wakes up <eol> with a pounding headache. <eob> She can only remember <eol> the night in flashes. <eob>
But what she does remember is <eob> throwing up in the hall <eol> outside Mike's room <eob> and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her, <eob> wanting it to stop, <eob> then shakily stumbling home. <eob>
She doesn't feel good <eol> about what happened, <eob> but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex <eol> in college is?" <eob>
One in five women and one in 13 <eol> men will be sexually assaulted <eob> at some point during their college career <eol> in the United States. <eob>
Less than 10 percent will ever report <eol> their assault to their school <eob> or to the police. <eob>
And those who do, on average, <eol> wait 11 months to make the report. <eob>
Hannah initially just feels like dealing <eol> with what happened on her own. <eob>
But when she sees Mike taking girls <eol> home from parties, <eob> she's worried about them. <eob>
After graduation, Hannah learns <eob> that she was one of five women who Mike <eol> did the exact same thing to. <eob>
And this is not an unlikely scenario <eob> because 90 percent of sexual assaults <eob> are committed by repeat offenders. <eob>
But with such low reporting rates, <eob> it's fairly unlikely that even repeat <eol> perpetrators will be reported, <eob> much less anything happen if they are. <eob>
In fact, only six percent of assaults <eol> reported to the police <eob> end with the assailant spending <eol> a single day in prison. <eob>
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance <eol> that they'll get away with it. <eob>
This means there's practically <eol> no deterrent to assault <eob> in the United States. <eob>
Now, I'm an infectious disease <eol> epidemiologist by training. <eob>
I'm interested in systems and networks <eob> and where we can concentrate <eol> our resources to do the most good. <eob>
So this, to me, is a tragic <eol> but a solvable problem. <eob>
So when the issue of campus assault started <eol> hitting the news a few years ago, <eob> it felt like a unique opportunity <eol> to make a change. <eob>
And so we did. <eob>
We started by talking <eol> to college survivors. <eob>
And what they wish they'd had <eol> in college is pretty simple; <eob> they wanted a website, <eob> one they could use at the time and place <eob> that felt safest to them <eob> with clearly written information <eol> about their reporting options, <eob> with the ability to electronically <eol> report their assault, <eob> rather than having the first step <eob> to go in and talk to someone <eol> who may or may not believe them. <eob>
With the option to create <eol> a secure, timestamped document <eob> of what happened to them, <eob> preserving evidence even if they <eol> don't want to report yet. <eob>
And lastly, and perhaps most critically, <eob> with the ability to report their assault <eob> only if someone else reported <eol> the same assailant. <eob>
You see, knowing that you weren't <eol> the only one changes everything. <eob>
It changes the way <eol> you frame your own experience, <eob> it changes the way you think <eol> about your perpetrator, <eob> it means that if you do come forward, <eob> you'll have someone else's back <eol> and they'll have yours. <eob>
We created a website <eol> that actually does this <eob> and we launched it [...] in August, <eob> on two college campuses. <eob>
And we included <eol> a unique matching system <eob> where if Mike's first victim <eol> had come forward, <eob> saved her record, entered into the matching system <eob> and named Mike, <eob> and Mike's second victim <eol> had done the same thing <eob> a few months later, <eob> they would have matched <eob> and the verified contact information of both survivors <eob> would have been sent to the authorities <eol> at the same time <eob> for investigation and follow up. <eob>
If a system like this <eol> had existed for Hannah and her peers, <eob> it's more likely that they would have reported, <eob> that they would have been believed, <eob> and that Mike would have been <eol> kicked off campus, <eob> gone to jail, or at least gotten the help <eol> that he needed. <eob>
And if we were able to stop repeat <eol> offenders like Mike <eob> after just their second assault <eol> following a match, <eob> survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted <eob> in the first place. <eob>
We could prevent 59 percent <eol> of sexual assaults <eob> just by stopping repeat perpetrators <eol> earlier on. <eob>
And because we're creating <eol> a real deterrent to assault, <eob> for perhaps the first time, <eob> maybe the Mikes of the world <eol> would never even try to assault anyone. <eob>
The type of system I'm describing, <eob> the type of system <eol> that survivors want <eob> is a type of information escrow, <eob> meaning an entity that holds on to information for you <eob> and only releases it to a third party <eob> when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, <eob> such as a match. <eob>
The application that we built <eol> is for college campuses. <eob>
But the same type of system <eol> could be used in the military <eob> or even the workplace. <eob>
We don't have to live in a world <eob> where 99 percent of rapists <eol> get away with it. <eob>
We can create one <eob> where those who do wrong <eol> are held accountable, <eob> where survivors get <eol> the support and justice they deserve, <eob> where the authorities <eol> get the information they need, <eob> and where there's a real deterrent <eob> to violating the rights <eol> of another human being. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So in college, <eob> I was a government major, <eob> which means I had to write a lot of papers. <eob>
Now, when a normal student writes a paper, <eob> they might spread the work <eol> out a little like this. <eob> So, you know -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
you get started maybe a little slowly, <eob> but you get enough done in the first week <eob> that, with some heavier days later on, <eob> everything gets done, things stay civil. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I would want to do that like that. <eob>
That would be the plan. <eob> I would have it all ready to go, <eob> but then, actually, the paper <eol> would come along, <eob> and then I would kind of do this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that would happen every single paper. <eob>
But then came my 90-page senior <eol> thesis, <eob> a paper you're supposed <eol> to spend a year on. <eob>
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work <eol> flow was not an option. <eob> It was way too big a project. <eob>
So I planned things out, <eob> and I decided I kind of had <eol> to go something like this. <eob>
This is how the year would go. <eob>
So I'd start off light, <eob> and I'd bump it up <eol> in the middle months, <eob> and then at the end, <eol> I would kick it up into high gear <eob> just like a little staircase. <eob>
How hard could it be <eol> to walk up the stairs? <eob>
No big deal, right? <eob>
But then, the funniest thing happened. <eob> Those first few months? <eob> They came and went, <eob> and I couldn't quite do stuff. <eob>
So we had an awesome new revised plan. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But then those middle months <eol> actually went by, <eob> and I didn't really write words, <eob> and so we were here. <eob>
And then two months turned into one month, <eob> which turned into two weeks. <eob>
And one day I woke up <eob> with three days until the deadline, <eob> still not having written a word, <eob> and so I did the only thing I could: <eob> I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, <eob> pulling not one but two all-nighters -- <eob> humans are not supposed <eol> to pull two all-nighters -- <eob> sprinted across campus, <eob> dove in slow motion, <eob> and got it in just at the deadline. <eob>
I thought that was the end of everything. <eob>
But a week later I get a call, <eob> and it's the school. <eob>
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" <eob> And I say, "Yeah." <eob> And they say, "We need to talk <eol> about your thesis." <eob> And I say, "OK." <eob> And they say, <eob> "It's the best one we've ever seen." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That did not happen. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was a very, very bad thesis. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment <eol> when all of you thought, <eob> "This guy is amazing!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, no, it was very, very bad. <eob>
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. <eob>
I write the blog Wait But Why. <eob>
And a couple of years ago, <eol> I decided to write about procrastination. <eob>
My behavior has always perplexed <eol> the non-procrastinators around me, <eob> and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world <eob> what goes on in the heads <eol> of procrastinators, <eob> and why we are the way we are. <eob>
Now, I had a hypothesis <eob> that the brains of procrastinators were actually different <eob> than the brains of other people. <eob>
And to test this, <eol> I found an MRI lab <eob> that actually let me scan both my brain <eob> and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, <eob> so I could compare them. <eob>
I actually brought them here <eol> to show you today. <eob>
I want you to take a look carefully <eol> to see if you can notice a difference. <eob>
I know that if you're not <eol> a trained brain expert, <eob> it's not that obvious, <eol> but just take a look, OK? <eob>
So here's the brain <eol> of a non-procrastinator. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now... <eob> here's my brain. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is a difference. <eob> Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, <eob> but the procrastinator's brain <eob> also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. <eob>
Now, what does this mean <eol> for the procrastinator? <eob>
Well, it means everything's fine <eol> until this happens. <eob>
[This is a perfect time <eol> to get some work done.] [Nope!] <eob>
So the Rational Decision-Maker <eol> will make the rational decision <eob> to do something productive, <eob> but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, <eob> so he actually takes the wheel, <eob> and he says, "Actually, let's read <eol> the entire Wikipedia page <eob> of the Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding scandal, <eob> because I just remembered that that happened. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Then -- <eob>
Then we're going to go <eol> over to the fridge, <eob> to see if there's anything new in there <eol> since 10 minutes ago. <eob>
After that, we're going to go <eol> on a YouTube spiral <eob> that starts with videos of Richard <eol> Feynman talking about magnets <eob> and ends much, much later <eol> with us watching interviews <eob> with Justin Bieber's mom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"All of that's going to take a while, <eob> so we're not going to really have room <eol> on the schedule for any work today. <eob> Sorry!" <eob> (Sigh) <eob>
Now, what is going on here? <eob>
The Instant Gratification Monkey <eol> does not seem like a guy <eob> you want behind the wheel. <eob>
He lives entirely in the present moment. <eob>
He has no memory of the past, <eol> no knowledge of the future, <eob> and he only cares about two things: <eob> easy and fun. <eob>
Now, in the animal world, that works fine. <eob>
If you're a dog <eob> and you spend your whole life <eol> doing nothing other than <eob> easy and fun <eob> things, <eob> you're a huge success! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And to the Monkey, <eob> humans are just another animal species. <eob>
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating <eol> into the next generation, <eob> which in tribal times might have worked OK. <eob>
But, if you haven't noticed, <eol> now we're not in tribal times. <eob>
We're in an advanced civilization, <eol> and the Monkey does not know what that is. <eob>
Which is why we have another <eol> guy in our brain, <eob> the Rational Decision-Maker, <eob> who gives us the ability to do things <eol> no other animal can do. <eob>
We can visualize the future. <eob>
We can see the big picture. <eob>
We can make long-term plans. <eob>
And he wants to take <eol> all of that into account. <eob>
And he wants to just have us do <eob> whatever makes sense to be doing right now. <eob>
Now, sometimes it makes sense <eob> to be doing things that are <eob> easy and fun, <eob> like when you're having dinner <eol> or going to bed <eob> or enjoying well-earned leisure time. <eob>
That's why there's an overlap. <eob> Sometimes they agree. <eob> But other times, it makes much more sense <eob> to be doing things that are harder <eol> and less pleasant, <eob> for the sake of the big picture. <eob>
And that's when we have a conflict. <eob>
And for the procrastinator, <eob> that conflict tends to end <eol> a certain way every time, <eob> leaving him spending a lot of time <eol> in this orange zone, <eob> an <eob> easy and fun <eob> place that's entirely <eol> out of the Makes Sense circle. <eob>
I call it the Dark Playground. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the Dark Playground is a place <eob> that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. <eob>
It's where leisure activities happen <eob> at times when leisure activities <eol> are not supposed to be happening. <eob>
The fun you have in the Dark Playground <eob> isn't actually fun, <eol> because it's completely unearned, <eob> and the air is filled with guilt, <eol> dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- <eob> all of those good procrastinator feelings. <eob>
And the question is, in this situation, <eol> with the Monkey behind the wheel, <eob> how does the procrastinator ever get himself <eol> over here to this blue zone, <eob> a less pleasant place, but where really important <eol> things happen? <eob>
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, <eob> someone who's always looking down on him <eol> and watching over him <eob> in his darkest moments -- <eob> someone called the Panic Monster. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, <eob> but he suddenly wakes up anytime <eol> a deadline gets too close <eob> or there's danger of public embarrassment, <eob> a career disaster or some other scary consequence. <eob>
And importantly, he's the only thing <eol> the Monkey is terrified of. <eob>
Now, he became very relevant <eol> in my life pretty recently, <eob> because the people of TED reached <eol> out to me about six months ago <eob> and invited me to do a TED Talk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, of course, I said yes. <eob>
It's always been a dream of mine <eol> to have done a TED Talk in the past. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> But in the middle of all this excitement, <eob> the Rational Decision-Maker <eob> seemed to have something else on his mind. <eob>
He was saying, "Are we clear <eol> on what we just accepted? <eob>
Do we get what's going to be <eol> now happening one day in the future? <eob>
We need to sit down and work <eol> on this right now." <eob> And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, <eol> but let's just open Google Earth <eob> and zoom in to the bottom of India, <eol> like 200 feet above the ground, <eob> and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get <eol> to the top of the country, <eob> so we can get a better feel for India." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So that's what we did that day. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As six months turned into four <eol> and then two and then one, <eob> the people of TED decided <eol> to release the speakers. <eob>
And I opened up the website, <eol> and there was my face <eob> staring right back at me. <eob>
And guess who woke up? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the Panic Monster <eol> starts losing his mind, <eob> and a few seconds later, the whole <eol> system's in mayhem. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And the Monkey -- remember, <eol> he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- <eob> boom, he's up the tree! <eob>
And finally, <eob> finally, <eob> the Rational Decision-Maker <eob> can take the wheel <eob> and I can start working on the talk. <eob>
Now, the Panic Monster explains <eob> all kinds of pretty <eol> insane procrastinator behavior, <eob> like how someone like me <eol> could spend two weeks <eob> unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, <eob> and then miraculously find <eol> the unbelievable work ethic <eob> to stay up all night <eol> and write eight pages. <eob>
And this entire situation, <eol> with the three characters -- <eob> this is the procrastinator's system. <eob>
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. <eob>
This is what I decided to write <eol> about on the blog a couple of years ago. <eob>
When I did, I was amazed by the response. <eob>
Literally thousands of emails came in, <eob> from all different kinds of people <eol> from all over the world, <eob> doing all different kinds of things. <eob>
These are people who were nurses, <eol> bankers, painters, engineers <eob> and lots and lots of PhD students. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And they were all writing, <eol> saying the same thing: <eob> "I have this problem too." <eob> But what struck me was the contrast <eol> between the light tone of the post <eob> and the heaviness of these emails. <eob>
These people were writing <eol> with intense frustration <eob> about what procrastination had done to their lives, <eob> about what this Monkey had done to them. <eob>
And I thought about this, and I said, <eob> well, if the procrastinator's system works, <eol> then what's going on? <eob>
Why are all of these people <eol> in such a dark place? <eob>
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds <eol> of procrastination. <eob>
Everything I've talked about today, <eol> the examples I've given, <eob> they all have deadlines. <eob>
And when there's deadlines, <eob> the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term <eob> because the Panic Monster gets involved. <eob>
But there's a second kind <eol> of procrastination <eob> that happens in situations <eol> when there is no deadline. <eob>
So if you wanted a career <eol> where you're a self-starter -- <eob> something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- <eob> there's no deadlines on those things <eol> at first, because nothing's happening, <eob> not until you've gone out <eol> and done the hard work <eob> to get momentum, get things going. <eob>
There's also all kinds of important <eol> things outside of your career <eob> that don't involve any deadlines, <eob> like seeing your family or exercising <eol> and taking care of your health, <eob> working on your relationship <eob> or getting out of a relationship <eol> that isn't working. <eob>
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism <eol> of doing these hard things <eob> is the Panic Monster, <eol> that's a problem, <eob> because in all of these non-deadline situations, <eob> the Panic Monster doesn't show up. <eob>
He has nothing to wake up for, <eob> so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; <eob> they just extend outward forever. <eob>
And it's this long-term <eol> kind of procrastination <eob> that's much less visible <eol> and much less talked about <eob> than the funnier, short-term <eol> deadline-based kind. <eob>
It's usually suffered quietly <eol> and privately. <eob>
And it can be the source <eob> of a huge amount <eol> of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. <eob>
And I thought, that's why <eol> those people are emailing, <eob> and that's why they're <eol> in such a bad place. <eob>
It's not that they're cramming <eol> for some project. <eob>
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, <eob> at times, in their own lives. <eob>
The frustration is not that <eol> they couldn't achieve their dreams; <eob> it's that they weren't even able <eol> to start chasing them. <eob>
So I read these emails and I had a little bit <eol> of an epiphany -- <eob> that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. <eob> That's right -- I think all of you <eol> are procrastinators. <eob>
Now, you might not all be a mess, <eob> like some of us, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and some of you may have <eol> a healthy relationship with deadlines, <eob> but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick <eob> is when the deadlines aren't there. <eob>
Now, I want to show you one last thing. <eob>
I call this a Life Calendar. <eob>
That's one box for every week <eol> of a 90-year life. <eob>
That's not that many boxes, <eob> especially since we've already used <eol> a bunch of those. <eob>
So I think we need to all take a long, <eol> hard look at that calendar. <eob>
We need to think about <eol> what we're really procrastinating on, <eob> because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. <eob>
We need to stay aware <eol> of the Instant Gratification Monkey. <eob>
That's a job for all of us. <eob>
And because there's not <eol> that many boxes on there, <eob> it's a job that should probably start today. <eob>
Well, maybe not today, but ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know. <eob> Sometime soon. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today's computers are so amazing <eob> that we fail to notice <eol> how terrible they really are. <eob>
I'd like to talk to you today <eol> about this problem, <eob> and how we can fix it with neuroscience. <eob>
First, I'd like to take you back <eol> to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 <eob> that had a profound impact on me. <eob>
I was sitting in a dive bar <eol> outside of Columbia University, <eob> where I studied computer science and neuroscience, <eob> and I was having this great conversation <eol> with a fellow student <eob> about the power of holograms <eol> to one day replace computers. <eob>
And just as we were getting <eol> to the best part of the conversation, <eob> of course, his phone lights up. <eob>
And he pulls it towards himself, <eol> and he looks down and he starts typing. <eob>
And then he forces his eyeballs <eol> back up to mine and he goes, <eob> "Keep going. <eob>
I'm with you. <eob> "But of course his eyes were glazed over, <eob> and the moment was dead. <eob>
Meanwhile across the bar, <eob> I noticed another student <eol> holding his phone, <eob> this time towards a group. <eob>
He was swiping through pictures <eol> on Instagram, <eob> and these kids were laughing hysterically. <eob>
And that dichotomy <eol> between how crappy I was feeling <eob> and how happy they were feeling <eol> about the same technology, <eob> really got me thinking. <eob>
And the more I thought of it, <eol> the more I realized <eob> it was clearly not the digital <eol> information that was the bad guy here, <eob> it was simply the display position <eol> that was separating me from my friend <eob> and that was binding <eol> those kids together. <eob>
See, they were connected around something, <eob> just like our ancestors who evolved <eol> their social cognitions <eob> telling stories around the campfire. <eob>
And that's exactly <eol> what tools should do, I think. <eob> They should extend our bodies. <eob> And I think computers today <eol> are doing quite the opposite. <eob>
Whether you're sending <eol> an email to your wife <eob> or you're composing a symphony <eob> or just consoling a friend, <eob> you're doing it in pretty much the same way. <eob>
You're hunched <eol> over these rectangles, <eob> fumbling with buttons <eol> and menus and more rectangles. <eob>
And I think this is the wrong way, <eob> I think we can start using <eol> a much more natural machine. <eob>
We should use machines that bring <eol> our work back into the world. <eob>
We should use machines <eol> that use the principles of neuroscience <eob> to extend our senses <eol> versus going against them. <eob>
Now it just so happens <eol> that I have such a machine here. <eob>
It's called the Meta 2. <eob> Let's try it out. <eob> Now in front of me right now, <eol> I can see the audience, <eob> and I can see my very hands. <eob>
And in three, two, one, <eob> we're going to see <eol> an immersive hologram appear, <eob> a very realistic hologram appear <eol> in front of me, <eob> of our very glasses <eol> I'm wearing on my head right now. <eob>
And of course this could be anything <eol> that we're shopping for <eob> or learning from, <eob> and I can use my hands <eob> to very nicely kind of move it <eol> around with fine control. <eob>
And I think Iron Man would be proud. <eob>
We're going to come back <eol> to this in just a bit. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now if you're anything like me, <eol> your mind is already reeling <eob> with the possibilities of what we can do <eol> with this kind of technology, <eob> so let's look at a few. <eob>
My mom is an architect, <eob> so naturally the first thing <eol> I imagined <eob> was laying out a building in 3D space <eob> instead of having to use these 2D floor plans. <eob>
She's actually touching graphics right now <eob> and selecting an interior decor. <eob>
This was all shot through a GoPro <eol> through our very glasses. <eob>
And this next use case <eol> is very personal to me, <eob> it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, <eob> courtesy of UCSF. <eob>
As a neuroscience student, <eob> I would always fantasize <eob> about the ability to learn <eol> and memorize these complex brain structures <eob> with an actual machine, <eob> where I could touch and play <eol> with the various brain structures. <eob>
Now what you're seeing <eol> is called augmented reality, <eob> but to me, it's part of a much more important story -- <eob> a story of how we can begin <eol> to extend our bodies with digital devices, <eob> instead of the other way around. <eob>
Now... <eob> in the next few years, humanity's going <eol> to go through a shift, I think. <eob>
We're going to start putting <eol> an entire layer of digital information <eob> on the real world. <eob>
Just imagine for a moment <eob> what this could mean for storytellers, <eob> for painters, <eob> for brain surgeons, <eob> for interior decorators <eob> and maybe for all of us here today. <eob>
And what I think we need <eol> to do as a community, <eob> is really try and make an effort <eob> to imagine how we can create <eol> this new reality <eob> in a way that extends <eol> the human experience, <eob> instead of gamifying our reality <eob> or cluttering it <eol> with digital information. <eob>
And that's what I'm very passionate about. <eob>
Now, I want to tell you a little secret. <eob>
In about five years -- <eob> this is not the smallest device -- <eob> in about five years, <eob> these are all going to look <eol> like strips of glass on our eyes <eob> that project holograms. <eob>
And just like we don't care <eol> so much about which phone we buy <eob> in terms of the hardware -- <eol> we buy it for the operating system -- <eob> as a neuroscientist, <eob> I always dreamt of building <eol> the iOS of the mind, if you will. <eob>
And it's very, very important <eol> that we get this right, <eob> because we might be living inside of these things <eob> for at least as long as we've lived <eob> with the Windows graphical user interface. <eob>
And I don't know about you, <eob> but living inside of Windows scares me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
To isolate the single most intuitive <eol> interface out of infinity, <eob> we use neuroscience to drive <eol> our design guidelines, <eob> instead of letting a bunch of designers <eol> fight it out in the boardroom. <eob>
And the principle we all revolve around <eob> is what's called <eol> the "Neural Path of Least Resistance." <eob>
At every turn, we're connecting <eol> the iOS of the brain with our brain <eob> on, for the first time, <eol> our brain's terms. <eob>
In other words, we're trying <eol> to create a zero learning-curve computer. <eob>
We're building a system that you've <eol> always known how to use. <eob>
Here are the first three design <eol> guidelines that we employ <eob> in this brand-new form of user experience. <eob>
First and foremost, <eol> you are the operating system. <eob>
Traditional file systems <eol> are complex and abstract, <eob> and they take your brain extra steps <eol> to decode them. <eob>
We're going against the Neural Path <eol> of Least Resistance. <eob>
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, <eob> you can of course place <eol> your holographic TED panel over here, <eob> and your holographic email <eol> on the other side of the desk, <eob> and your spatial memory evolved just fine <eol> to go ahead and retrieve them. <eob>
You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for -- <eob> or whatever model my legal team <eol> told me to put in right before the show. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Perfect. And your brain knows <eol> exactly how to get it back. <eob>
The second interface guideline <eol> we call "touch to see." <eob> What do babies do when they see <eol> something that grabs their interest? <eob>
They try and reach out and touch it. <eob>
And that's exactly how the natural <eol> machine should work as well. <eob>
Turns out the visual system <eol> gets a fundamental boost <eob> from a sense we call proprioception -- <eob> that's the sense of our body <eol> parts in space. <eob>
So by touching our work directly, we're not <eol> only going to control it better, <eob> we're also going to understand it <eol> much more deeply. <eob>
Hence, touch to see. <eob>
But it's not enough to experience <eol> things ourselves. <eob>
We're inherently these social primates. <eob>
And this leads me <eol> to our third guideline, <eob> the holographic campfire <eol> from our first story. <eob>
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests <eob> that we can connect with each other <eol> and with our work much better <eob> if we can see each other's faces <eol> and hands in 3D. <eob>
So if you look at the video behind me, <eob> you can see two Meta users <eol> playing around with the same hologram, <eob> making eye contact, connected <eol> around this thing, <eob> instead of being distracted <eol> by external devices. <eob>
Let's go ahead and try this again <eol> with neuroscience in mind. <eob>
So again, our favorite interface, <eol> the iOS of the mind. <eob>
I'm going to now take a step further <eob> and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses <eob> and leave it right here by the desk. <eob>
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, <eob> we're connecting. <eob>
My spatial memory kicks in, <eol> and I can go ahead and grab it <eob> and bring it right back here, reminding me <eob> that I am the operating system. <eob>
And now my proprioception is working, <eob> and I can go ahead and explode <eol> these glasses into a thousand parts <eob> and touch the very sensor <eol> that is currently scanning my hand. <eob>
But it's not enough to see things alone, <eob> so in a second, <eol> my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call -- <eob> Ray? <eob>
(Ringing) <eob>
Hey Ray, how's it going? <eob>
Guys, I can see this guy in front me <eol> in full 3D. <eob>
And he is photo-realistic. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones <eob> in not too long. <eob>
Ray, how's it going? <eob>
Ray: Great. We're live today. <eob>
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift <eob> of the holographic brain we saw <eol> from the video earlier. <eob>
Guys, this is not only going <eol> to change phones, <eob> it's also going to change <eol> the way we collaborate. <eob>
Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
Thanks, Ray. <eob>
Ray: You're welcome. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
MG: So folks, this is the message <eol> that I discovered in that bar in 2011: <eob> The future of computers is not locked <eol> inside one of these screens. <eob>
It's right here, inside of us. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So if there's one idea that I could leave <eol> you with here today, <eob> it's that the natural machine <eol> is not some figment of the future, <eob> it's right here in 2016. <eob>
Which is why all hundred <eol> of us at Meta, <eob> including the administrative staff, <eob> the executives, <eob> the designers, the engineers -- <eob> before TED2017, <eob> we're all going to be throwing away <eol> our external monitors <eob> and replacing them with a truly <eol> and profoundly more natural machine. <eob>
Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you, <eob> appreciate it. <eob> Thanks, guys. <eob>
Chris Anderson: So help <eol> me out on one thing, <eob> because there've been <eol> a few augmented reality demos <eob> shown over the last year <eol> or so out there. <eob>
And there's sometimes a debate <eol> among technologists <eob> about, are we really seeing <eol> the real thing on-screen? <eob>
There's this issue of field of view, <eob> that somehow the technology <eol> is showing a broader view <eob> than you would actually see wearing the glasses. <eob>
Were we seeing the real deal there? <eob>
MG: Absolutely the real deal. <eob>
Not only that, <eob> we took extra measures <eol> to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens <eob> in the various videos that you've seen here. <eob>
We want to try to simulate <eol> the experience for the world <eob> that we're actually seeing <eol> through the glasses, <eob> and not cut any corners. <eob>
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that. <eob>
In 1962 at Rice University, <eob> JFK told the country <eol> about a dream he had, <eob> a dream to put a person on the moon <eol> by the end of the decade. <eob> The eponymous moonshot. <eob>
No one knew if it was possible to do <eob> but he made sure a plan was put in place <eol> to do it if it was possible. <eob>
That's how great dreams are. <eob>
Great dreams aren't just visions, <eob> they're visions coupled <eol> to strategies for making them real. <eob>
I have the incredible good fortune to work <eol> at a moonshot factory. <eob>
At X -- formerly called Google X -- <eob> you'll find an aerospace engineer <eol> working alongside a fashion designer <eob> and former military ops commanders <eol> brainstorming with laser experts. <eob>
These inventors, engineers and makers <eol> are dreaming up technologies <eob> that we hope can make the world <eol> a wonderful place. <eob>
We use the word "moonshots" <eol> to remind us to keep our visions big -- <eob> to keep dreaming. <eob>
And we use the word "factory" to remind ourselves <eob> that we want to have <eol> concrete visions -- <eob> concrete plans to make them real. <eob>
Here's our moonshot <eol> blueprint. <eob> Number one: <eob> we want to find a huge problem in the world <eob> that affects many millions of people. <eob>
Number two: <eob> we want to find or propose a radical solution <eol> for solving that problem. <eob>
And then number three: <eob> there has to be some reason to believe <eob> that the technology for such <eol> a radical solution <eob> could actually be built. <eob>
But I have a secret for you. <eob>
The moonshot factory is a messy place. <eob>
But rather than avoid the mess, <eob> pretend it's not there, <eob> we've tried to make that our strength. <eob>
We spend most of our time breaking things <eob> and trying to prove that we're wrong. <eob>
That's it, that's the secret. <eob>
Run at all the hardest parts <eol> of the problem first. <eob>
Get excited and cheer, <eob> "Hey! How are we going <eol> to kill our project today?" <eob>
We've got this interesting balance <eol> going <eob> where we allow our unchecked optimism <eol> to fuel our visions. <eob> But then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism <eob> to breathe life, breathe reality <eol> into those visions. <eob>
I want to show you a few of the projects <eob> that we've had to leave behind <eol> on the cutting room floor, <eob> and also a few of the gems <eob> that at least so far, have not <eol> only survived that process, <eob> but have been accelerated by it. <eob>
Last year we killed a project <eol> in automated vertical farming. <eob>
This is some of the lettuce that we grew. <eob>
One in nine people in the world <eol> suffers from undernourishment. <eob>
So this is a moonshot <eol> that needs to happen. <eob>
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water <eob> and a hundred times less land <eol> than conventional farming. <eob>
And because you can grow the food close <eol> to where it's consumed, <eob> you don't have to transport it <eol> large distances. <eob>
We made progress <eol> in a lot of the areas <eob> like automated <eol> harvesting and efficient lighting. <eob>
But unfortunately, <eob> we couldn't get staple crops <eol> like grains and rice to grow this way. <eob>
So we killed the project. <eob>
Here's another huge problem. <eob> We pay enormous costs in resources <eol> and environmental damage <eob> to ship goods worldwide. <eob>
Economic development of landlocked countries <eob> is limited by lack of shipping <eol> infrastructure. <eob> The radical solution? <eob> A lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship. <eob>
This has the potential to lower, <eob> at least overall, <eob> the cost, time and carbon <eol> footprint of shipping <eob> without needing runways. <eob>
We came up with this clever <eol> set of technical breakthroughs <eob> that together might make it possible <eol> for us to lower the cost enough <eob> that we could actually make these ships -- <eob> inexpensively enough in volume. <eob>
But however cheap they would have been <eol> to make in volume <eob> it turned out that it was going to cost <eol> close to 200 million dollars <eob> to design and build the first one. <eob>
200 million dollars <eol> is just way too expensive. <eob>
Because X is structured <eol> with these tight feedback loops <eob> of making mistakes and learning <eol> and new designs, <eob> we can't spend 200 million dollars <eob> to get the first data point <eob> about whether we're on the right track or not. <eob>
If there's an Achilles' heel <eol> in one our projects, <eob> we want to know it now, up front, <eol> not way down the road. <eob>
So we killed this project, too. <eob>
Discovering a major flaw in a project <eob> doesn't always mean <eol> that it ends the project. <eob>
Sometimes it actually gets us <eol> onto a more productive path. <eob>
This is our fully self-driving <eol> vehicle prototype, <eob> which we built without a steering wheel <eol> or break pedal. <eob>
But that wasn't actually our goal <eol> when we started. <eob>
With 1.2 million people dying <eol> on the roads globally every year, <eob> building a car that drives itself <eol> was a natural moonshot to take. <eob>
Three and a half years ago, <eob> when we had these Lexus, retrofitted, <eol> self-driving cars in testing, <eob> they were doing so well, we gave them <eol> out to other Googlers <eob> to find out what they thought <eol> of the experience. <eob>
And what we discovered <eob> was that our plan to have the cars <eol> do almost all the driving <eob> and just hand over to the users <eol> in case of emergency <eob> was a really bad plan. <eob>
It wasn't safe <eob> because the users didn't do their job. <eob>
They didn't stay alert <eob> in case the car needed to hand <eol> control back to them. <eob>
This was a major crisis for the team. <eob> It sent them back to the drawing board. <eob>
And they came up with a beautiful, <eol> new perspective. <eob>
Aim for a car where <eol> you're truly a passenger. <eob>
You tell the car where you want to go, <eob> you push a button <eob> and it takes you from point A <eol> to point B by itself. <eob>
We're really grateful <eob> that we had this insight <eol> as early on in the project as we did. <eob>
And it's shaped everything <eol> we've done since then. <eob>
And now our cars have self-driven more <eol> than 1.4 million miles, <eob> and they're out everyday <eob> on the streets of Mountain View, California <eol> and Austin, Texas. <eob>
The cars team shifted their perspective. <eob>
This is one of X's mantras. <eob> Sometimes shifting your perspective <eol> is more powerful than being smart. <eob>
Take wind energy. <eob> It's one of my favorite examples <eol> of perspective shifting. <eob>
There's no way <eol> that we're going to build <eob> a better standard wind turbine <eol> than the experts in that industry. <eob>
But we found a way <eol> to get up higher into the sky, <eob> and so get access to faster, <eol> more consistent winds, <eob> and so more energy without needing hundreds <eol> of tons of steel to get there. <eob>
Our Makani energy kite rises <eol> up from its perch <eob> by spinning up those propellers <eol> along its wing. <eob> And it pulls out a tether as it rises, <eob> pulling energy up through the tether. <eob>
Once the tether's all the way out, <eob> it goes into crosswind circles in the sky. <eob>
And now those propellers that lifted <eol> it up have become flying turbines. <eob>
And that sends energy back <eol> down the tether. <eob>
We haven't yet found a way <eol> to kill this project. <eob> And the longer it survives <eol> that pressure, the more excited we get <eob> that this could become a cheaper <eol> and more deployable form <eob> of wind energy for the world. <eob>
Probably the craziest sounding project <eol> we have is Project Loon. <eob>
We're trying to make <eol> balloon-powered Internet. <eob>
A network of balloons <eol> in the stratosphere <eob> that beam an internet connection down to rural <eol> and remote areas of the world. <eob>
This could bring online <eol> as many as four billion more people, <eob> who today have little or no internet connection. <eob>
But you can't just take <eol> a cell tower, <eob> strap it to a balloon <eol> and stick it in the sky. <eob>
The winds are too strong, <eol> it would be blown away. <eob> And the balloons <eol> are too high up to tie it to the ground. <eob>
Here comes the crazy moment. <eob>
What if, instead, <eob> we let the balloons drift <eob> and we taught them how to sail the winds <eol> to go where the needed to go? <eob>
It turns out the stratosphere has winds <eob> that are going in quite different <eol> speeds and directions in thin strata. <eob>
So we hoped that using smart algorithms <eol> and wind data from around the world, <eob> we could maneuver <eol> the balloons a bit, <eob> getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit <eol> in the stratosphere <eob> to grab those winds going <eol> in those different directions and speeds. <eob>
The idea is to have enough balloons <eob> so as one balloon floats <eol> out of your area, <eob> there's another balloon <eol> ready to float into place, <eob> handing off the internet connection, <eob> just like your phone hands off <eol> between cell towers <eob> as you drive down the freeway. <eob>
We get how crazy that vision sounds -- <eob> there's the name of the project <eol> to remind us of that. <eob>
So since 2012, <eob> the Loon team has prioritized <eol> the work that seems the most difficult <eob> and so the most likely to kill their project. <eob>
The first thing that they did <eob> was try to get a Wi-Fi connection <eol> from a balloon in the stratosphere <eob> down to an antenna on the ground. <eob> It worked. <eob> And I promise you there were bets <eol> that it wasn't going to. <eob>
So we kept going. <eob>
Could we get the balloon <eol> to talk directly to handsets, <eob> so that we didn't need the antenna <eol> as an intermediary receiver? <eob> Yeah. <eob>
Could we get the balloon band <eol>width high enough <eob> so it was a real Internet connection? <eob>
So that people could have something <eol> more than just SMS? <eob>
The early tests weren't even <eol> a megabit per second, <eob> but now we can do up <eol> to 15 megabits per second. <eob>
Enough to watch a TED Talk. <eob>
Could we get the balloons <eol> to talk to each other through the sky <eob> so that we could reach our signal <eol> deeper into rural areas? <eob> Check. <eob>
Could we get balloons the size of a house <eol> to stay up for more than 100 days, <eob> while costing less than five percent <eob> of what traditional, long-life balloons <eol> have cost to make? <eob> Yes. In the end. <eob> But I promise you, you name it, <eol> we had to try it to get there. <eob>
We made round, silvery balloons. <eob>
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons. <eob> We made balloons the size of a blue whale. <eob>
We busted a lot of balloons. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Since one of the things that was most likely <eol> to kill the Loon project <eob> was whether we could guide the balloons <eol> through the sky, <eob> one of our most important experiments <eol> was putting a balloon inside a balloon. <eob>
So there are two compartments here, one with air <eol> and then one with helium. <eob>
The balloon pumps air in <eol> to make itself heavier, <eob> or lets air out to make it lighter. <eob>
And these weight changes allow it <eol> to rise or fall, <eob> and that simple movement of the balloon <eol> is its steering mechanism. <eob>
It floats up or down, <eob> hoping to grab winds going <eol> in the speed and direction that it wants. <eob>
But is that good enough for it <eol> to navigate through the world? <eob>
Barely at first, <eob> but better all the time. <eob>
This particular balloon, our latest balloon, <eob> can navigate <eol> a two-mile vertical stretch of sky <eob> and can sail itself to within 500 meters <eol> of where it wants to go <eob> from 20,000 kilometers away. <eob>
We have lots more to do <eob> in terms of fine-tuning the system <eol> and reducing costs. <eob>
But last year, a balloon built <eol> inexpensively <eob> went around the world 19 times <eol> over 187 days. <eob>
So we're going to keep going. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Our balloons today <eob> are doing pretty much everything <eol> a complete system needs to do. <eob>
We're in discussions with telcos around the world, <eob> and we're going to fly <eol> over places like Indonesia <eob> for real service testing this year. <eob>
This probably all sounds <eol> too good to be true, <eob> and you're right. <eob>
Being audacious <eob> and working on big, risky things <eob> makes people inherently uncomfortable. <eob>
You cannot yell at people <eol> and force them to fail fast. <eob> People resist. They worry. <eob> "What will happen to me if I fail? <eob>
Will people laugh at me? <eob>
Will I be fired?" <eob>
I started with our secret. <eob>
I'm going to leave you with <eol> how we actually make it happen. <eob>
The only way to get people <eol> to work on big, risky things -- <eob> audacious ideas -- <eob> and have them run at all the hardest <eol> parts of the problem first, <eob> is if you make that the path <eol> of least resistance for them. <eob>
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail. <eob>
Teams kill their ideas <eol> as soon as the evidence is on the table <eob> because they're rewarded for it. <eob> They get applause from their peers. <eob>
Hugs and high fives from their <eol> manager, me in particular. <eob>
They get promoted for it. <eob>
We have bonused every single person <eol> on teams that ended their projects, <eob> from teams as small as two to teams <eol> of more than 30. <eob>
We believe in dreams at the moonshot factory. <eob>
But enthusiastic skepticism <eob> is not the enemy of boundless optimism. <eob>
It's optimism's perfect partner. <eob>
It unlocks the potential in every idea. <eob>
We can create the future <eol> that's in our dreams. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
Thousands of years from now, <eob> we'll look back <eol> at the first century of computing <eob> as a fascinating but very peculiar time -- <eob> the only time in history <eol> where humans were reduced to live in 2D space, <eob> interacting with technology <eol> as if we were machines; <eob> a singular, 100-year period <eol> in the vastness of time <eob> where humans communicated, <eob> were entertained and managed their lives <eob> from behind a screen. <eob>
Today, we spend most of our time <eol> tapping and looking at screens. <eob>
What happened to interacting <eol> with each other? <eob>
I don't know about you, <eol> but I feel limited <eob> inside this 2D world <eol> of monitors and pixels. <eob>
And it is this very limitation <eob> and my desire to connect with people <eob> that inspires me as a creator. <eob>
Put simply: I want <eol> to create a new reality, <eob> a reality where technology brings <eol> us infinitely closer to each other, <eob> a reality where people, not devices, <eob> are the center of everything. <eob>
I dream of a reality where technology senses <eol> what we see, touch and feel; <eob> a reality where technology <eol> no longer gets in our way, <eob> but instead embraces who we are. <eob>
I dream of technology <eob> on a human path. <eob>
We have all experienced technology <eob> that enables people to act more like people, <eob> products that enable natural interactions, <eol> voice controls or biometrics. <eob>
This is the next step in the evolution. <eob>
This is Microsoft HoloLens, <eob> the first fully untethered <eol> holographic computer. <eob>
Devices like this will bring <eol> 3D holographic content <eob> right into our world, <eob> enhancing the way <eol> we experience life <eob> beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. <eob>
Now, I'm not thinking <eol> about a distant future. <eob>
I'm talking about today. <eob>
We are already seeing car companies like Volvo <eob> designing cars differently <eol> with HoloLens; <eob> universities like Case Western redefining <eol> the way medical students learn; <eob> and my personal favorite, <eob> NASA is using HoloLens <eol> to let scientists explore planets <eob> holographically. <eob>
Now, this is important. <eob>
By bringing holograms into our world, <eob> I'm not just talking <eol> about a new device or a better computer. <eob> I'm talking about freeing ourselves <eol> from the 2D confines <eob> of traditional computing. <eob>
Put it this way: <eob> temporally adjusted, we're like cave <eol> people in computer terms. <eob>
We've barely discovered charcoal <eob> and started drawing the first <eol> stick figures in our cave. <eob>
Now, this is the perspective I apply <eol> to my work every single day. <eob>
And now for the next few minutes, <eob> I invite all of you to apply <eol> the same perspective <eob> to the journey ahead of us. <eob>
Now, as I put this HoloLens on, <eob> let me explain the setup a little bit. <eob>
It's probably the most risky demo <eol> we have ever done on any stage <eob> with HoloLens, <eob> and I can't think of a better place <eol> to do it than here at TED. <eob>
Momentarily, I am going <eol> to be seeing holograms <eob> right on this stage, <eob> just as clearly as I can see all of you. <eob>
Now at the same time, <eol> we have also this special camera <eob> that just walked in onstage <eob> so that all of you can share <eol> in this experience with me <eob> up on all the monitors. <eob>
So let's start our journey. <eob>
And what better place <eol> to begin our journey, <eob> than in the computer cave <eol> of 2D. <eob>
Let's explore the world <eol> all around us with this new lens, <eob> and understand the computer world <eol> from a brand new perspective. <eob>
The computer universe is both marvel <eol>ous and primitive. <eob>
It's a universe based on causality. <eob>
As developers, we dream the different causes <eob> and then we program <eol> the different effects. <eob>
Double click on an icon, that's a cause. <eob> Open an application, that's an effect. <eob>
Now when we compare this <eol> to our physical universe, <eob> it is overly constraining, <eob> because our universe is not digital. <eob>
Our universe is analog. <eob>
Our universe doesn't think <eol> in terms of zero or one, <eob> true or false, or black or white. <eob>
We exist in a world governed <eol> by quantum physics, <eob> a universe of zero and one both at the same time, <eob> a reality based on infinite <eol> probabilities and shades of gray. <eob>
You can see how these two worlds collide. <eob>
So why are screens so pervasive <eol> in our analog life? <eob>
We see screens from the moment we wake up, <eob> to the moment we fall asleep. <eob> Why? <eob>
I think it's because computers <eol> give us superpowers. <eob>
Within the digital universe, <eol> we have the power to displace space <eob> and the power to displace time. <eob>
It doesn't matter if you're using technology <eol> for entertainment, <eob> productivity or communication. <eob>
Think of it this way: <eob> let's all go home tonight <eob> and watch our favorite show on television. <eob>
This is theater -- time and space displaced. <eob>
As soon as I'm done <eol> with this TED Talk, <eob> I'm going to immediately call <eol> my lovely family in Seattle. <eob> That's displacement of space. <eob>
Now, these are such great superpowers <eob> that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations <eob> of our current digital world. <eob>
But what if we didn't have to? <eob>
What if we could have <eol> these same digital powers <eob> in our world? <eob>
You can already see glimmers of this, <eob> but I believe our children's children <eob> will grow up in a world devoid <eol> of 2D technology. <eob>
It's remarkable to dream of this world, <eob> a world where technology <eol> truly understands us -- <eob> where we live, work and communicate -- <eob> with tools that enhance the human experience, <eob> not machines that limit our humanity. <eob>
So how do we get there? <eob> For me, the answer required <eol> looking at the problem <eob> from a different perspective. <eob>
It required sensing the world <eol> from the perspective of a machine. <eob>
If you're a machine trying to sense our world, <eob> how would you actually <eol> break the problem down? <eob>
You'd probably try to classify things <eob> as a human, <eob> an environment <eob> or an object. <eob>
But how would that machine <eol> then interact with reality? <eob>
And I can think of three ways. <eob>
First, as a machine, <eob> I would observe or I would input reality. <eob>
Speech recognition <eol> and biometric authentication <eob> are great examples <eol> of a machine interacting with humans <eob> from an input perspective. <eob>
Secondly, as a machine, <eob> I could place digital information, <eol> or output information, <eob> into reality. <eob>
Holograms are examples <eol> of a machine interacting with <eob> an environment <eob> from an output perspective. <eob>
Finally, as a machine, <eob> I could exchange energy <eol> with the world via haptics. <eob>
Now, imagine being able to feel <eol> the temperature of a virtual object, <eob> or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram <eob> and having it push you back <eol> with equal force. <eob>
With this perspective, <eob> we are able to collapse reality <eol> into a simple matrix. <eob>
Now here's a secret: <eob> as an engineer, <eol> I get really excited <eob> anytime I can reduce something <eol> to the matrix. <eob>
From self-driving cars <eob> to smartphones <eob> to this holographic computer on my head, <eob> machines are becoming capable of understanding <eol> our world. <eob>
And they are starting to interact with us <eob> in significantly more personal ways. <eob>
Now, imagine having granular control <eob> over everything in the world. <eob>
Move the dial one way, <eob> and you get reality. <eob> Move the dial the other way, <eob> and you get virtual reality. <eob>
Now, imagine dialing your entire environment <eob> between virtual and real worlds. <eob>
I love it down here. <eob>
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you <eob> and dial from real humans into elves. <eob>
When technology truly understands our world, <eob> it will again transform <eol> the ways we interact, <eob> the ways we work and the ways we play. <eob>
Less than half a century ago, <eob> two courageous men landed on the moon, <eob> using computers that were less powerful <eol> than the phones in your pockets. <eob>
Six hundred million humans watched them <eob> on grainy, black-and-white televisions. <eob> And the world? <eob> The world was mesmerized. <eob>
Now imagine how our children <eol> and their children <eob> will experience the continued exploration <eol> of space <eob> with technology that understands this world. <eob>
We already live in a world where real-time <eol> universal translators exist. <eob>
And I can squint, <eol> and I can already see holographic telepresence <eob> in our near future. <eob>
In fact, since we've been lucky <eol> with our demo so far, <eob> let's try doing something else even more crazy. <eob>
I invite you to experience, <eob> for the first time anywhere in the world, <eob> here on the TED stage, <eob> a real-life holographic teleportation, <eob> between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris, <eob> from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <eob>
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff. <eob>
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex. <eob>
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. <eol> How are you doing today, Jeff? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week. <eob>
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, <eol> Jeff, about where you are? <eob>
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. <eob>
I'm standing in a room <eol> across the street, <eob> while I'm standing on this stage with you, <eob> while I'm standing on Mars, <eol> a hundred million miles away. <eob>
AK: Wow, a hundred million miles <eol> away. This is crazy! <eob> Can you tell us a little bit more <eol> about where all this data <eob> from Mars is coming from? <eob>
JN: Absolutely. <eob> This is a precise <eol> holographic replica of Mars, <eob> built from data captured <eol> by the Curiosity Mars Rover, <eob> that I can explore as easily <eol> as a place on Earth. <eob>
Humans are natural explorers. <eob>
We can instantly understand <eob> an environment, <eob> just by being present in it. <eob>
We've built tools like our Mars Rover <eob> to extend our vision and length <eol>en our reach. <eob>
But for decades, <eob> we've explored from a seat <eol> behind screens and keyboards. <eob>
Now, we're leaping over all of that, <eob> over the giant antennas <eol> and the relay satellites <eob> and the vastness between worlds <eob> to take our first steps on this landscape <eol> as if we were truly there. <eob>
Today, a group of scientists on our mission <eob> are seeing Mars as never before -- <eob> an alien world made a little more familiar, <eob> because they're finally exploring it <eol> as humans should. <eob>
But our dreams don't have to end <eol> with making it just like being there. <eob>
When we dial this real world <eol> to the virtual, <eob> we can do magical things. <eob>
We can see in invisible wavelengths <eob> or teleport to the top of a mountain. <eob>
Perhaps someday, we'll feel <eol> the minerals in a rock just by touching it. <eob>
We're taking the first steps. <eob>
But we want the whole world <eol> to join us in taking the next, <eob> because this is not a journey for a few, <eob> but for all of us. <eob>
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing. <eob>
Thank you so much for joining us <eol> on the TED stage today. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye. <eob>
AK: Bye, Jeff. <eob>
I dream about this future <eob> every single day. <eob>
I take inspiration from our ancestors. <eob>
We used to live in tribes <eol> where we interacted, <eob> communicated and worked together. <eob>
We are all beginning to build technology <eol> that will enable us to return <eob> to the humanity that brought us <eol> where we are today — <eob> technology that will let us stop living <eob> inside this 2D world <eol> of monitors and pixels, <eob> and let us start <eol> remembering what it feels like <eob> to live in our 3D world. <eob>
It's a phenomenal time to be human. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Helen Walters: Thanks so much. <eob>
I have some questions. <eob>
AK: OK. <eob>
HW: So there's been some talk in the press. <eob> And I'll just ask you straight, <eol> then we have a straight answer. <eob>
There's been talk about the difference <eol> between the demos <eob> and the reality of the commercial product. <eob>
Talk about this field of view issue. <eob>
Is this type of experience what someone <eol> who buys the product will get? <eob>
AK: It's a great question, <eob> Or, said better, this is a question <eol> we've been receiving <eob> in the media for possibly the last year. <eob>
If you do your research, <eol> I haven't answered that question. <eob>
I've purposely ignored it, <eob> because ultimately, <eol> it's the wrong question to ask. <eob>
That's the equivalent of me showing holograms <eol> to someone for the first time, <eob> and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?" <eob> The field of view for the product <eol> is almost irrelevant. <eob>
What we should be talking <eol> about is the density of lights, <eob> or radiance, that shows up. <eob> Better said, what the angular resolution <eol> is of the things that you see. <eob>
So from that perspective, what you saw -- <eob> you know, the camera <eol> is wearing a HoloLens. <eob> So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't. <eob>
HW: But the camera has a different lens <eol> on it than our eye. Right? <eob>
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it. <eob>
It's seeing a much wider view <eol> than the human eye is. <eob>
So if you think about the points <eol> of light that show up radially <eob> from the vision of the camera, <eob> which is the thing that matters: <eob> how many points of light <eol> can I get in a given volume? <eob>
That's the same as I get <eol> on this HoloLens as I will on that one. <eob>
Now, this camera sees a much wider view <eol> of the world, right? <eob>
HW: Jesus Christ! <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
AK: He did show up! <eob>
I told you he'd show up. <eob> Come this way. <eob>
HW: Oh, shit. <eob>
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris. <eob>
HW: I knew something was happening, <eol> but I really wasn't sure what. <eob>
AK: So in short: <eol> to be super crisp, <eob> the camera that you see on the screen <eol> has a wider field of view <eob> than the human eye. <eob>
But the angular resolution <eol> of the holograms that you see, <eob> the points of light per unit of area, <eob> are actually the same. <eob>
HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get <eol> to you in a minute -- <eob> so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage -- <eob>
AK: That's right. <eob>
HW: So help me out here: <eob> if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, <eob> I don't need to map my apartment, right? <eob>
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time <eol> at about five frames per second, <eob> with this technology that we call spatial <eol> mapping. <eob>
So in your home, as soon <eol> as you put it on, <eob> holograms will start showing up, <eol> and you'll start placing them <eob> and they'll start learning your home. <eob>
In a stage environment <eol> where we're trying to get something on my head <eob> to communicate with something over there <eob> with all of the wireless connectivity <eol> that usually brings all conferences down, <eob> we don't take the risk <eol> of trying to do this live. <eob>
So what we do is pre-map the stage <eol> at five frames per second <eob> with the same spatial-mapping technology <eob> that you'll use with the product at home, <eob> and then we store it, <eob> so that when there's shenanigans <eol> of wireless in <eob> an environment <eob> like this, <eob> between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, <eob> we don't have things disappear. <eob>
Because ultimately, the holograms <eol> are coming from this HoloLens, <eob> and that one is just viewing <eol> the HoloLens. <eob>
So if I lose connectivity, <eob> you would stop seeing <eol> beautiful things on the screen. <eob>
HW: And it was beautiful. <eob> Um ... Jeff? <eob>
JN: Yes? <eob>
HW: Hi. <eob>
AK: I'll take a step back. <eob>
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars, <eob> you were here, you were in a room <eol> across the street. <eob>
Tell me more about the fact that, <eol> with holograms, you have sight <eob> but you don't have touch, <eol> you don't have smell. <eob>
Is this scientifically useful now? <eob>
That's my question for a hologram. <eob>
JN: Thanks for the question. <eob>
Absolutely, I believe that these technologies <eob> are scientifically useful right now, <eob> and that's why we're using them <eol> in multiple parts of our work at NASA. <eob>
So we're using it to improve the ways <eol> that we explore Mars. <eob> We're also using it for our astronauts <eol> on the space station. <eob> We're even using it now to design <eob> the next generation <eol> of our spacecraft. <eob>
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. <eob> Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Alex, really, that was amazing. <eob> Thank you <eob> so much. <eob>
AK: <eob> Thank you. <eob>
HW: <eob> Thank you. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
It began with one question: <eob> If Africa was a bar, <eol> what would your country be drinking or doing? <eob>
I kicked it off with a guess <eol> about South Africa, <eob> which wasn't exactly according to the rules <eob> because South Africa's not my country. <eob>
But alluding to the country's continual attempts <eob> to build a postracial society <eob> after being ravaged <eol> for decades by apartheid, <eob> I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be <eol> drinking all kinds of alcohol <eob> and begging them to get along in its stomach. <eob>
And then I waited. <eob> And then I had that funny feeling <eol> where I wondered if I crossed the line. <eob>
So, I sent out a few other tweets <eol> about my own country <eob> and a few other African countries <eol> I'm familiar with. <eob>
And then I waited <eob> again, <eob> but this time <eob> I read through almost every tweet <eol> I had ever tweeted <eob> to convince myself, <eob> no, to remind myself <eol> that I'm really funny <eob> and that if nobody gets it, <eol> that's fine. <eob>
But luckily, <eob> I didn't have to do that for very long. <eob>
Very soon, people were participating. <eob>
In fact, by the end <eol> of that week in July, <eob> the hashtag #ifafricawasabar <eob> would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, <eob> lit up the continent <eob> and made its way to publications <eol> all over the world. <eob>
People were using the hashtag <eol> to do many different things. <eob>
To poke fun <eol> at their stereotypes: <eob> [#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria <eol> would be outside explaining <eob> that he will pay the entrance fee, <eob> all he needs is the bouncer's account details.] <eob>
To criticize government spending: <eob> [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles <eol> it can't pronounce <eob> running a tab it won't be able to pay] <eob>
To make light of geopolitical tensions: <eob> [#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan <eol> would be the new guy <eob> with serious anger management <eol> issues.] <eob>
To remind us that even in Africa <eob> there are some countries <eol> we don't know exist: <eob> [#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person <eob> who nobody really knows <eol> but is always in the pictures.] <eob>
And also to make fun of the countries <eol> that don't think that they're in Africa: <eob> [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco <eob> be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"] <eob>
And to note the countries <eol> that had made a big turnaround: <eob> [#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl <eob> that comes with no money <eol> and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich] <eob>
But most importantly, <eob> people were using the hashtag to connect. <eob>
People were connecting over <eol> their Africanness. <eob>
So for one week in July, <eob> Twitter became a real African bar. <eob>
And I was really thrilled, <eob> mainly because I realized <eol> that Pan-Africanism could work, <eob> that we had before us, between us, <eol> at our fingertips <eob> a platform <eol> that just needed a small spark <eob> to light in us a hunger for each other. <eob>
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, <eob> I'm 22 years old <eob> and I am Pan-Africanist by birth. <eob>
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth <eob> because my parents are from two different <eol> African countries. <eob>
My father's from a country called Botswana <eol> in southern Africa. <eob>
It's only slightly bigger than Germany. <eob>
This year we celebrate our 50th year <eol> of stable democracy. <eob>
And it has some very <eol> progressive social policies. <eob>
My mother's country <eol> is the Kingdom of Swaziland. <eob>
It's a very, very small country, <eol> also in southern Africa. <eob>
It is Africa's last complete monarchy. <eob>
So it's been ruled by a king <eol> and a royal family <eob> in line with their tradition, <eob> for a very long time. <eob>
On paper, these countries <eol> seem very different. <eob>
And when I was a kid, <eol> I could see the difference. <eob>
It rained a lot in one country, <eol> it didn't rain quite as much in the other. <eob>
But outside of that, I didn't really realize <eob> why it mattered that my parents <eol> were from two different places. <eob>
But it would go on to have <eol> a very peculiar effect on me. <eob>
You see, I was born in one country <eob> and raised in the other. <eob>
When we moved to Botswana, <eob> I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati <eob> and nothing else. <eob>
So I was being introduced <eol> to my new home, <eob> my new cultural identity, <eob> as a complete outsider, <eob> incapable of comprehending anything <eol> that was being said to me <eob> by the family and country <eol> whose traditions I was meant to move forward. <eob>
But very soon, I would shed SiSwati. <eob>
And when I would go back to Swaziland, <eob> I would be constantly confronted <eol> by how very non-Swazi I was becoming. <eob>
Add to that my entry <eol> into Africa's private school system, <eob> whose entire purpose is to beat <eol> the Africanness out of you, <eob> and I would have a very peculiar adolescence. <eob>
But I think that my interest <eol> in ideas of identity was born here, <eob> in the strange intersection <eol> of belonging to two places at once <eob> but not really belonging to either <eol> one very well <eob> and belonging to this vast space <eol> in between and around simultaneously. <eob>
I became obsessed with the idea <eol> of a shared African identity. <eob>
Since then, I have continued <eol> to read about politics <eob> and geography and identity <eol> and what all those things mean. <eob>
I've also held on to a deep <eol> curiosity about African philosophies. <eob>
When I began to read, <eob> I gravitated towards the works <eol> of black intellectuals <eob> like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, <eob> who tackled complex ideas <eob> like decolonization and black consciousness. <eob>
And when I thought, at 14, <eol> that I had digested these grand ideas, <eob> I moved on to the speeches <eol> of iconic African statesmen <eob> like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara <eob> and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. <eob>
I read every piece of African fiction <eol> that I could get my hands on. <eob>
So when Twitter came, <eob> I hopped on with the enthusiasm <eol> of a teenage girl <eob> whose friends are super, <eol> super bored of hearing about all this random stuff. <eob>
The year was 2011 <eob> and all over southern Africa <eol> and the whole continent, <eob> affordable data packages <eol> for smartphones and Internet surfing <eob> became much easier to get. <eob>
So my generation, we were sending messages <eol> to each other on this platform <eob> that just needed 140 characters <eol> and a little bit of creativity. <eob>
On long commutes to work, <eob> in lectures that some of us <eol> should have been paying attention to, <eob> on our lunch breaks, <eob> we would communicate as much as we could <eob> about the everyday realities <eol> of being young and African. <eob>
But of course, this luxury <eol> was not available to everybody. <eob>
So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana <eob> and you wanted to have fun <eol> on the Internet, <eob> one, you had to tweet in English. <eob> Two, you had to follow more than just <eol> the three other people you knew online. <eob>
You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians. <eob>
And suddenly, your whole world opened up. <eob>
And my whole world did open up. <eob>
I followed vibrant Africans <eol> who were travelling around the continent, <eob> taking pictures of themselves <eob> and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica. <eob>
Because at that time, <eob> if you were to search Africa <eol> on Twitter or on Google <eob> or any kind of social media, <eob> you would think that the entire continent <eol> was just pictures of animals <eob> and white guys drinking cocktails <eol> in hotel resorts. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But Africans were using this platform <eob> to take some kind of ownership <eol> of the tourism sectors. <eob>
It was Africans taking selfies <eol> on the beaches of Nigeria. <eob> It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi. <eob>
And these were the same Africans <eol> that I began to meet <eob> in my own travels around the continent. <eob>
We would discuss African literature, <eol> politics, economic policy. <eob>
But almost invariably, every single time, <eob> we would end up discussing Twitter. <eob>
And that's when I realized what this was. <eob>
We were standing in the middle <eol> of something amazing, <eob> because for the first time ever <eob> young Africans could discuss <eol> the future of our continent in real time, <eob> without the restriction of borders, <eol> finances and watchful governments. <eob>
Because the little known truth is <eob> many Africans know a lot less about <eol> other African countries <eob> than some Westerners might know <eol> about Africa as a whole. <eob>
This is by accident, <eob> but sometimes, it's by design. <eob>
For example, in apartheid South Africa, <eob> black South Africans were constantly <eol> being bombarded <eob> with this message that any country <eol> ruled by black people <eob> was destined for failure. <eob>
And this was done to convince them <eob> that they were much better <eol> off under crushing white rule <eob> than they were living in a black and free nation. <eob>
Add to that Africa's colonial, <eol> archaic education system, <eob> which has been unthinkingly <eol> carried over from the 1920s -- <eob> and at the age of 15, <eol> I could name all the various causes <eob> of the wars that had happened <eol> in Europe in the past 200 years, <eob> but I couldn't name the president <eol> of my neighboring country. <eob>
And to me, this doesn't make any sense <eob> because whether we like it or not, <eob> the fates of African people <eol> are deeply intertwined. <eob>
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, <eob> we share the consequences. <eob>
When Burundians flee political turmoil, <eob> they go to us, <eob> to other African countries. <eob>
Africa has six of the world's <eol> largest refugee centers. <eob>
What was once a Burundian problem <eob> becomes an African problem. <eob>
So to me, there are no <eol> Sudanese problems <eob> or South African problems <eol> or Kenyan problems, <eob> only African problems <eob> because eventually, we share <eol> the turmoil. <eob>
So if we share the problems, <eob> why aren't we doing a better job <eol> of sharing the successes? <eob>
How can we do that? <eob> Well, in the long term, <eob> we can shoot towards increasing <eol> inter-African trade, <eob> removing borders <eol> and putting pressure on leaders <eob> to fulfill regional <eol> agreements they've already signed. <eob>
But I think that the biggest way <eol> for Africa to share its successes <eob> is to foster something I like <eol> to call social Pan-Africanism. <eob>
Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists, <eob> so I'm not inventing <eol> anything totally new here. <eob>
But political Pan-Africanism <eob> is usually the African unity <eol> of the political elite. <eob>
And who does that benefit? <eob>
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively. <eob>
No, what I'm talking about <eob> is the Pan-Africanism <eol> of the ordinary African. <eob>
Young Africans like me, <eob> we are bursting with creative energy, <eob> with innovative ideas. <eob>
But with bad governance <eol> and shaky institutions, <eob> all of this potential could go to waste. <eob>
On a continent where more <eol> than a handful of leaders <eob> have been in power longer <eob> than the majority of the populations <eol> has been alive, <eob> we are in desperate need of something new, <eob> something that works. <eob>
And I think that thing <eol> is social Pan-Africanism. <eob>
My dream is that young Africans <eob> stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation. <eob>
My dream is that when a young African <eol> comes up with something brilliant, <eob> they don't say, "Well, this <eol> wouldn't work in my country," <eob> and then give up. <eob>
My dream is that young Africans <eob> begin to realize <eob> that the entire continent <eol> is our canvas, is our home. <eob>
Using the Internet, we can begin <eol> to think collaboratively, <eob> we can begin to innovate together. <eob>
In Africa, we say, <eol> "If you want to go fast, you go alone, <eob> but if you want to go far, you go together." <eob> And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together. <eob>
And this is already happening. <eob>
Access to these online networks <eol> has given young Africans <eob> something we've always had to violently take: a voice. <eob>
We now have a platform. <eob>
Before now, if you wanted to hear <eol> from the youth in Africa, <eob> you waited for the 65-year-old minister <eol> of youth -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
to wake up in the morning, <eob> take his heartburn medication <eob> and then tell you the plans <eol> he has for your generation <eob> in 20 years time. <eob>
Before now, if you wanted to be heard <eol> by your possibly tyrannical government, <eob> you were pushed to protest, suffer <eol> the consequences <eob> and have your fingers crossed <eob> that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care. <eob>
But now we have opportunities <eol> to back each other up <eob> in ways we never could before. <eob>
We support South African students <eob> who are marching against ridiculously <eol> high tertiary fees. <eob>
We support Zimbabwean women <eol> who are marching to parliament. <eob>
We support Angolan journalists <eol> who are being illegally detained. <eob>
For the first time ever, <eob> African pain and African aspiration <eob> has the ability to be witnessed <eob> by those who can empathize <eol> with it the most: <eob> other Africans. <eob>
I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking <eob> and using the Internet as a tool, <eob> we can begin to rescue each other, <eob> and ultimately, to rescue ourselves. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It has been 128 years <eob> since the last country <eol> in the world abolished slavery <eob> and 53 years <eob> since Martin Luther King pronounced <eol> his "I Have A Dream" speech. <eob>
But we still live in a world <eob> where the color of our skin <eol> not only gives a first impression, <eob> but a lasting one that remains. <eob>
I was born in a family full of colors. <eob>
My father is the son of a maid <eob> from whom he inherited <eol> an intense dark chocolate tone. <eob>
He was adopted by those <eol> who I know as my grandparents. <eob>
The matriarch, my grandma, <eob> has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair. <eob>
My grandpa was somewhere between <eol> a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, <eob> like my uncle and my cousin. <eob>
My mother is a cinnamon-skin <eol> daughter of a native Brazilian, <eob> with a pinch of hazel and honey, <eob> and a man [who is] <eol> a mix of coffee with milk, <eob> but with a lot of coffee. <eob>
She has two sisters. <eob>
One in a toasted-peanut skin <eob> and the other, <eob> also adopted, <eob> more on the beige side, <eob> like a pancake. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Growing up in this family, <eob> color was never important for me. <eob>
Outside home, however, <eol> things were different soon. <eob>
Color had many other meanings. <eob>
I remember my first <eol> drawing lessons in school <eob> as a bunch of contradictory feelings. <eob>
It was exciting and creative <eob> but I never understood <eol> the unique flesh-colored pencil. <eob>
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink. <eob>
My skin was brown, <eol> and people said I was black. <eob>
I was seven years old <eol> with a mess of colors in my head. <eob>
Later, <eob> when I took my cousin to school, <eob> I was usually taken for the nanny. <eob>
By helping in the kitchen <eol> at a friend's party, <eob> people thought I was the maid. <eob>
I was even treated like a prostitute <eob> just because I was walking alone <eol> on the beach with European friends. <eob>
And many times, <eob> visiting my grandma or friends <eol> in upper class buildings, <eob> I was invited not to use <eol> the main elevator. <eob>
Because in the end, <eob> with this color and this hair, <eob> I cannot belong to some places. <eob>
In some way, <eob> I get to used to it and accept part of it. <eob>
However, something inside of me <eol> keeps revolving and struggling. <eob>
Years later I married a Spaniard. <eob>
But not any Spaniard. <eob>
I chose one with the skin color <eol> of a lobster when sunburnt. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Since then, a new question <eol> started to chase me. <eob>
What will be the color of your children? <eob>
As you can understand, <eol> this is my last concern. <eob>
But thinking about it, <eob> with my previous background, <eob> my story led me to make <eol> my personal exercise as a photographer. <eob>
And that is how Humanae was born. <eob>
Humanae is a pursuit <eol> to highlight our true colors, <eob> rather than the untrue <eob> white, red, black or yellow <eol> associated with race. <eob>
It's a kind of game to question our codes. <eob>
It's a work in progress <eol> from a personal story to a global history. <eob>
I portray the subjects <eol> in a white background. <eob>
Then I choose an 11-pixel <eol> square from the nose, <eob> paint the background, <eob> and look for the corresponding color <eol> in the industrial palette, Pantone. <eob>
I started with my family and friends, <eob> then more and more people <eol> joined the adventure, <eob> thanks to public calls <eol> coming through the social media. <eob>
I thought that the main space <eol> to show my work was the Internet <eob> because I want an open concept <eol> that invites everybody <eob> to push the share button <eol> in both the computer and their brain. <eob>
The snowball started to roll. <eob>
The project had a great welcome -- <eob> invitations, exhibitions, <eob> physical formats, <eob> galleries and museums ... <eob> just happened. <eob>
And among them, my favorite: <eob> when Humanae occupies public spaces <eob> and appears in the street, <eob> it fosters a popular debate <eob> and creates a feeling of community. <eob>
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people <eob> in 13 different countries, <eob> 19 different cities around the world. <eob>
Just to mention some of them -- <eob> from someone included in the Forbes list, <eob> to refugees who crossed <eol> the Mediterranean by boat. <eob>
In Paris, from the UNESCO <eol> Headquarters to a shelter. <eob>
And students both in Switzerland <eol> and favelas in Rio de Janeiro. <eob>
All kinds of beliefs, <eob> gender identities <eob> or physical impairments, <eob> a newborn or terminally ill. <eob>
We all together build Humanae. <eob>
Those portraits make us rethink <eol> how we see each other. <eob>
When modern science <eol> is questioning the race concept, <eob> what does it mean for us <eol> to be black, white, yellow, red? <eob>
Is it the eye, the nose, <eol> the mouth, the hair? <eob>
Or does it have to do with our origin, <eob> nationality <eob> or bank account? <eob>
This personal exercise <eol> turned out to be a discovery. <eob>
Suddenly I realized that Humanae <eol> was useful for many people. <eob>
It represents a sort of mirror <eob> for those who cannot find <eol> themselves reflected in any label. <eob>
It was amazing <eob> that people started to share <eol> their thoughts about the work with me. <eob>
I have hundreds of that, <eob> I will share with you, too. <eob>
A mother of 11 years -- <eob> A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, <eob> "Very good for me as a tool <eol> to work on her confidence, <eob> as this past weekend <eob> one of her girlfriends argued with her <eol> that she does not belong <eob> and should not be allowed <eol> to live in Norway. <eob>
So your work has <eol> a very special place in my heart <eob> and it's very important for me." <eob>
A woman shared her portrait <eol> on Facebook and wrote, <eob> "All my life, <eob> people from across the globe <eol> had difficulties to place me in a group, <eob> a stereotype, <eob> a box. <eob>
Perhaps we should stop. <eob>
Instead of framing, ask the individual, <eob> 'How would you label yourself?' <eob> Then I would say, <eob> 'Hi. I'm Massiel. <eob> I'm a Dominican-Dutch, <eob> I grew up in a mixed family <eob> and I'm a bisexual woman.' " <eob>
Besides these unexpected <eol> and touching reactions, <eob> Humanae finds a new life <eol> in a different variety of fields. <eob>
Just to show you some examples, <eob> illustrators and art students <eob> using it as a reference <eol> for their sketches and their studies. <eob>
It's a collection of faces. <eob>
Researchers in the fields of anthropology, <eob> physics and neuroscience <eob> use Humanae with different <eol> scientific approaches <eob> related to human ethnicity, <eob> optophysiology, <eob> face recognition <eob> or Alzheimer's. <eob>
One of the most important <eol> impacts of the project <eob> is that Humanae was chosen <eol> to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, <eob> one of the most relevant <eol> political publications. <eob>
And talking about foreign affairs, <eob> I found the perfect <eol> ambassadors for my project ... <eob> teachers. <eob>
They are the ones that use Humanae <eol> as a tool for educational purposes. <eob>
Their passion encourages me <eol> to go back to drawing classes, <eob> but this time as a teacher myself. <eob>
My students, <eob> both adults and kids, <eob> paint their self-portraits, <eob> trying to discover <eol> their own unique color. <eob>
As a photographer, <eob> I realize that I can be a channel <eol> for others to communicate. <eob>
As an individual, <eob> as Angélica, <eob> every time I take a picture, <eob> I feel that I am sitting <eol> in front of a therapist. <eob>
All the frustration, fear and loneliness <eob> that I once felt ... <eob> becomes love. <eob>
The last country -- <eob> the last country in the world <eol> who abolished slavery <eob> is the country where I was born, <eob> Brazil. <eob>
We still have to work hard <eol> to abolish discrimination. <eob>
That remains a common practice worldwide, <eob> and that will not disappear by itself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Chris Anderson: This is such <eol> a strange thing. <eob>
Your software, Linux, <eol> is in millions of computers, <eob> it probably powers much of the Internet. <eob>
And I think that there are, like, <eob> a billion and a half active <eol> Android devices out there. <eob>
Your software is in every single <eol> one of them. <eob>
It's kind of amazing. <eob>
You must have some amazing software <eol> headquarters driving all this. <eob>
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked <eol> when I saw a picture of it. <eob>
I mean, this is -- <eob> this is the Linux world headquarters. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Linus Torvalds: It really <eol> doesn't look like much. <eob>
And I have to say, <eob> the most interesting part in this picture, <eob> that people mostly react to, <eob> is the walking desk. <eob>
It is the most interesting <eol> part in my office <eob> and I'm not actually using it anymore. <eob>
And I think the two things are related. <eob>
The way I work is ... <eob> I want to not have external stimulation. <eob>
You can kind of see, <eol> on the walls are this light green. <eob>
I'm told that at mental institutions <eol> they use that on the walls. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's like a calming color, <eob> it's not something <eol> that really stimulates you. <eob>
What you can't see is the computer here, <eol> you only see the screen, <eob> but the main thing I worry <eol> about in my computer is -- <eob> it doesn't have to be big and powerful, <eol> although I like that -- <eob> it really has to be completely silent. <eob>
I know people who work for Google <eob> and they have their own small <eol> data center at home, <eob> and I don't do that. <eob>
My office is the most boring <eol> office you'll ever see. <eob>
And I sit there alone in the quiet. <eob>
If the cat comes up, <eob> it sits in my lap. <eob>
And I want to hear the cat purring, <eob> not the sound of the fans in the computer. <eob>
CA: So this is astonishing, <eob> because working this way, <eob> you're able to run <eol> this vast technology empire -- <eob> it is an empire -- <eob> so that's an amazing testament <eol> to the power of open source. <eob>
Tell us how you got <eol> to understand open source <eob> and how it lead to the development <eol> of Linux. <eob>
LT: I mean, I still work alone. <eob>
Really -- I work alone in my house, <eob> often in my bathrobe. <eob>
When a photographer shows up, I dress up, <eob> so I have clothes on. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that's how I've always worked. <eob>
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too. <eob>
I did not start Linux <eol> as a collaborative project. <eob>
I started it as one <eol> in a series of many projects <eob> I had done at the time for myself, <eob> partly because I needed the end result, <eob> but even more because <eol> I just enjoyed programming. <eob>
So it was about the end of the journey, <eob> which, 25 years later, <eol> we still have not reached. <eob>
But it was really about the fact <eol> that I was looking for a project on my own <eob> and there was no open source, <eol> really, on my radar at all. <eob>
And what happened is ... <eob> the project grows and becomes something <eol> you want to show off to people. <eob>
Really, this is more of a, "Wow, <eol> look at what I did!" <eob> And trust me -- it was not <eol> that great back then. <eob>
I made it publicly available, <eob> and it wasn't even open source <eol> at that point. <eob>
At that point it was source <eol> that was open, but there was no intention <eob> behind using the kind of open-source <eol> methodology that we think of today <eob> to improve it. <eob>
It was more like, <eob> "Look, I've been working <eol> on this for half a year, <eob> I'd love to have comments." <eob>
And other people approached me. <eob>
At the University of Helsinki, <eob> I had a friend who was one of the open source -- <eob> it was called mainly "free software" back then -- <eob> and he actually introduced me <eol> to the notion that, hey, <eob> you can use these open-source licenses <eol> that had been around. <eob>
And I thought about it for a while. <eob>
I was actually worried about the whole <eol> commercial interests coming in. <eob>
I mean, that's one of the worries <eol> I think most people who start out have, <eob> is that they worry about somebody taking advantage <eol> of their work, right? <eob>
And I decided, "What the hell?" <eob> And -- <eob>
CA: And then at some point, <eob> someone contributed <eol> some code that you thought, <eob> "Wow, that really is interesting, <eol> I would not have thought of that. <eob>
This could actually improve this." <eob>
LT: It didn't even start <eol> by people contributing code, <eob> it was more that people started <eol> contributing ideas. <eob>
And just the fact that somebody else <eol> takes a look at your project -- <eob> and I'm sure it's true of other things, too, <eob> but it's definitely true in code -- <eob> is that somebody else takes <eol> an interest in your code, <eob> looks at it enough to actually give you feedback <eob> and give you ideas. <eob> That was a huge thing for me. <eob>
I was 21 at the time, so I was young, <eob> but I had already programmed <eol> for half my life, basically. <eob>
And every project <eol> before that had been completely personal <eob> and it was a revelation when people <eol> just started commenting, <eob> started giving feedback on your code. <eob>
And even before they started <eol> giving code back, <eob> that was, I think, one of the big <eol> moments where I said, <eob> "I love other people!" <eob> Don't get me wrong -- <eob> I'm actually not a people person. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I don't really love other people -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I love computers, <eob> I love interacting <eol> with other people on email, <eob> because it kind of gives you <eol> that buffer. <eob>
But I do love other people who comment <eol> and get involved in my project. <eob>
And it made it so much more. <eob>
CA: So was there a moment <eol> when you saw what was being built <eob> and it suddenly started taking off, <eob> and you thought, "Wait a sec, <eol> this actually could be something huge, <eob> not just a personal project <eol> that I'm getting nice feedback on, <eob> but a kind of explosive development <eol> in the whole technology world"? <eob>
LT: Not really. <eob> I mean, the big point for me, really, <eol> was not when it was becoming huge, <eob> it was when it was becoming little. <eob>
The big point for me was not being alone <eob> and having 10, maybe 100 people <eol> being involved -- <eob> that was a big point. <eob>
Then everything else was very gradual. <eob>
Going from 100 people to a million people <eol> is not a big deal -- to me. <eob>
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're -- <eob>
If you want to sell your result <eol> then it's a huge deal -- <eob> don't get me wrong. <eob>
But if you're interested in the technology <eob> and you're interested in the project, <eob> the big part was getting the community. <eob>
Then the community grew gradually. <eob>
And there's actually not a single <eol> point where I went like, <eob> "Wow, that just took off!" because it -- <eob> I mean -- it took a long time, relatively. <eob>
CA: So all the technologists <eol> that I talk to really credit you <eob> with massively changing their work. <eob>
And it's not just Linux, <eob> it's this thing called Git, <eob> which is this management system <eol> for software development. <eob>
Tell us briefly about that <eol> and your role in that. <eob>
LT: So one of the issues we had, <eob> and this took a while to start to appear, <eob> is when you... <eob> When you grow from having 10 people <eol> or 100 people working on a project <eob> to having 10,000 people, which — <eob> I mean, right now we're in the situation <eol> where just on the kernel, <eob> we have 1,000 people involved <eol> in every single release <eob> and that's every two months, roughly two or three months. <eob>
Some of those people don't do a lot. <eob>
There's a lot of people who make <eol> small, small changes. <eob>
But to maintain this, <eob> the scale changes how you have <eol> to maintain it. <eob>
And we went through a lot of pain. <eob>
And there are whole projects <eol> that do only source-code maintenance. <eob>
CVS is the one that used <eol> to be the most commonly used, <eob> and I hated CVS with a passion <eol> and refused to touch it <eob> and tried something else that was radical <eol> and interesting <eob> and everybody else hated. <eob>
CA: (Laughs) <eob>
LT: And we were in this bad spot, <eob> where we had thousands of people <eol> who wanted to participate, <eob> but in many ways, I was the kind of break point, <eob> where I could not scale to the point <eob> where I could work <eol> with thousands of people. <eob>
So Git is my second big project, <eob> which was only created for me <eol> to maintain my first big project. <eob>
And this is literally how I work. <eob>
I don't code for — <eob> well, I do code for fun — <eob> but I want to code for something meaningful <eob> so every single project <eol> I've ever done has been something I needed <eob> and — <eob>
CA: So really, both Linux <eol> and Git kind of arose <eob> almost as an unintended consequence <eob> of your desire not to have to work <eol> with too many people. <eob>
LT: Absolutely. Yes. <eob>
CA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And yet, you're the man <eol> who's transformed technology <eob> not just once but twice, <eob> and we have to try and understand <eol> why it is. <eob>
You've given us some clues, but ... <eob> Here's a picture of you as a kid, <eol> with a Rubik's Cube. <eob>
You mentioned that you've been programming <eol> since you were like 10 or 11, <eob> half your life. <eob>
Were you this sort of computer genius, <eol> you know, übernerd, <eob> were you the star at school <eol> who could do everything? <eob>
What were you like as a kid? <eob>
LT: Yeah, I think I was <eol> the prototypical nerd. <eob>
I mean, I was ... <eob> I was not a people person back then. <eob>
That's my younger brother. <eob>
I was clearly more interested <eol> in the Rubik's Cube <eob> than my younger brother. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My younger sister, <eol> who's not in the picture, <eob> when we had family meetings -- <eob> and it's not a huge family, <eol> but I have, like, a couple of cousins -- <eob> she would prep me beforehand. <eob>
Like, before I stepped into the room <eol> she would say, <eob> "OK. That's so-and-so ..." <eob> Because I was not -- <eob> I was a geek. <eob>
I was into computers, <eob> I was into math, <eob> I was into physics. <eob>
I was good at that. <eob>
I don't think I was particularly <eol> exceptional. <eob>
Apparently, my sister said <eob> that my biggest exceptional <eol> quality was that I would not let go. <eob>
CA: OK, so let's go there, <eol> because that's interesting. <eob>
You would not let go. <eob>
So that's not about being <eol> a geek and being smart, <eob> that's about being ... stubborn? <eob>
LT: That's about being stubborn. <eob>
That's about, like, <eob> just starting something <eob> and not saying, "OK, I'm done, <eol> let's do something else -- <eob> Look: shiny!" <eob>
And I notice that in many other <eol> parts in my life, too. <eob>
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years. <eob>
And I worked for the same company, <eol> in Silicon Valley, <eob> for the whole time. <eob>
That is unheard of. <eob>
That's not how Silicon Valley works. <eob>
The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people <eol> jump between jobs <eob> to kind of mix up the pot. <eob>
And that's not the kind of person I am. <eob>
CA: But during the actual development <eol> of Linux itself, <eob> that stubbornness sometimes brought you <eol> in conflict with other people. <eob> Talk about that a bit. <eob> Was that essential to sort of maintain <eol> the quality of what was being built? <eob>
How would you describe what happened? <eob>
LT: I don't know if it's essential. <eob>
Going back to the "I'm not <eol> a people person," — <eob> sometimes I'm also... <eob> shall we say, <eob> "myopic" when it comes <eol> to other people's feelings, <eob> and that sometimes makes you say things <eol> that hurt other people. <eob>
And I'm not proud of that. <eob>
But, at the same time, it's -- <eob> I get people who tell me <eol> that I should be nice. <eob>
And then when I try to explain to them <eol> that maybe you're nice, <eob> maybe you should be more aggressive, <eob> they see that as me being not nice. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What I'm trying to say <eol> is we are different. <eob>
I'm not a people person; <eob> it's not something <eol> I'm particularly proud of, <eob> but it's part of me. <eob>
And one of the things <eol> I really like about open source <eob> is it really allows different people to work together. <eob>
We don't have to like each other -- <eob> and sometimes we really don't like each other. <eob>
Really -- I mean, there are very, <eol> very heated arguments. <eob>
But you can, actually, <eol> you can find things that -- <eob> you don't even agree to disagree, <eob> it's just that you're interested <eol> in really different things. <eob>
And coming back to the point where I said earlier <eob> that I was afraid of commercial people <eol> taking advantage of your work, <eob> it turned out, and very quickly turned out, <eob> that those commercial people were lovely, <eol> lovely people. <eob>
And they did all the things <eol> that I was not at all interested in doing, <eob> and they had completely different goals. <eob>
And they used open source in ways <eol> that I just did not want to go. <eob>
But because it was open source <eol> they could do it, <eob> and it actually works really beautifully together. <eob>
And I actually think <eol> it works the same way. <eob>
You need to have the people-people, <eol> the communicators, <eob> the warm and friendly people <eob> who like -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
really want to hug you <eol> and get you into the community. <eob>
But that's not everybody. <eob>
And that's not me. <eob>
I care about the technology. <eob>
There are people who care about the UI. <eob>
I can't do UI to save my life. <eob>
I mean, if I was stranded on an island <eob> and the only way to get off <eol> that island was the make a pretty UI, <eob> I'd die there. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So there's different kinds of people, <eob> and I'm not making excuses, <eol> I'm trying to explain. <eob>
CA: Now, when we talked last week, <eob> you talked about some other <eol> trait that you have, <eob> which I found really interesting. <eob>
It's this idea called taste. <eob>
And I've just got a couple of images here. <eob>
I think this is an example <eol> of not particularly good taste in code, <eob> and this one is better taste, <eob> which one can immediately see. <eob>
What is the difference between these two? <eob>
LT: So this is -- <eob> How many people here actually have coded? <eob>
CA: Oh my goodness. <eob>
LT: So I guarantee you, <eob> everybody who raised their hand, <eob> they have done what's called <eol> a singly-linked list. <eob>
And it's taught -- <eob> This, the first not very good taste approach, <eob> is basically how it's taught to be done <eol> when you start out coding. <eob>
And you don't have to understand the code. <eob>
The most interesting part to me <eob> is the last if statement. <eob>
Because what happens in a singly-linked list -- <eob> this is trying to remove <eol> an existing entry from a list -- <eob> and there's a difference <eol> between if it's the first entry <eob> or whether it's an entry <eol> in the middle. <eob>
Because if it's the first entry, <eob> you have to change the pointer <eol> to the first entry. <eob>
If it's in the middle, <eob> you have to change the pointer <eol> of a previous entry. <eob>
So they're two completely different cases. <eob>
CA: And that's better. <eob>
LT: And this is better. <eob>
It does not have the if statement. <eob>
And it doesn't really matter -- <eob> I don't want you understand <eol> why it doesn't have the if statement, <eob> but I want you to understand <eob> that sometimes you can see <eol> a problem in a different way <eob> and rewrite it so <eol> that a special case goes away <eob> and becomes the normal case. <eob>
And that's good code. <eob> But this is simple code. <eob> This is CS 101. <eob>
This is not important -- although, details <eol> are important. <eob>
To me, the sign of people <eol> I really want to work with <eob> is that they have good taste, <eol> which is how ... <eob> I sent you this stupid example <eob> that is not relevant <eol> because it's too small. <eob>
Good taste is much bigger than this. <eob>
Good taste is about really <eol> seeing the big patterns <eob> and kind of instinctively knowing <eol> what's the right way to do things. <eob>
CA: OK, so we're putting <eol> the pieces together here now. <eob>
You have taste, <eob> in a way that's meaningful <eol> to software people. <eob> You're -- <eob>
CA: You're a very smart computer coder, <eob> and you're hellish stubborn. <eob>
But there must be something else. <eob>
I mean, you've changed the future. <eob>
You must have the ability <eol> of these grand visions of the future. <eob>
You're a visionary, right? <eob>
LT: I've actually felt <eol> slightly uncomfortable at TED <eob> for the last two days, <eob> because there's a lot of vision <eol> going on, right? <eob>
And I am not a visionary. <eob> I do not have a five-year plan. <eob> I'm an engineer. <eob>
And I think it's really -- <eob> I mean -- I'm perfectly happy <eol> with all the people <eob> who are walking around <eol> and just staring at the clouds <eob> and looking at the stars and saying, <eol> "I want to go there." <eob> But I'm looking at the ground, <eob> and I want to fix the pothole <eol> that's right in front of me <eob> before I fall in. <eob>
This is the kind of person I am. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
CA: So you spoke to me last week <eol> about these two guys. <eob>
Who are they and how do you relate <eol> to them? <eob>
LT: Well, so this is kind <eol> of cliché in technology, <eob> the whole Tesla versus Edison, <eob> where Tesla is seen <eol> as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man. <eob>
And people love Tesla. <eob>
I mean, there are people <eol> who name their companies after him. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The other person there is Edison, <eob> who is actually often vilified <eol> for being kind of pedestrian <eob> and is -- <eob> I mean, his most famous quote is, <eob> "Genius is one percent inspiration <eol> and 99 percent perspiration." <eob> And I'm in the Edison camp, <eob> even if people don't always like him. <eob>
Because if you actually compare the two, <eob> Tesla has kind of this mind <eol> grab these days, <eob> but who actually changed the world? <eob>
Edison may not have been a nice person, <eob> he did a lot of things -- <eob> he was maybe not so intellectual, <eob> not so visionary. <eob>
But I think I'm more <eol> of an Edison than a Tesla. <eob>
CA: So our theme at TED this week <eol> is dreams -- <eob> big, bold, audacious dreams. <eob>
You're really the antidote to that. <eob>
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> We embrace you, we embrace you. <eob>
Companies like Google <eol> and many others have made, arguably, <eob> like, billions <eol> of dollars out of your software. <eob> Does that piss you off? <eob>
LT: No. <eob> No, it doesn't piss me off <eol> for several reasons. <eob>
And one of them is, I'm doing fine. <eob>
I'm really doing fine. <eob>
But the other reason is -- <eob> I mean, without doing the whole open source <eol> and really letting go thing, <eob> Linux would never have been what it is. <eob>
And it's brought experiences <eol> I don't really enjoy, public talking, <eob> but at the same time, this <eol> is an experience. <eob> Trust me. <eob> So there's a lot of things <eol> going on that make me a very happy man <eob> and thinking I did the right choices. <eob>
CA: Is the open source idea -- <eob> this is, I think we'll end here -- <eob> is the open source idea <eol> fully realized now in the world, <eob> or is there more that it could go, <eob> are there more things <eol> that it could do? <eob>
LT: So, I'm of two minds there. <eob>
I think one reason open source <eol> works so well in code <eob> is that at the end of the day, <eob> code tends to be somewhat black and white. <eob>
There's often a fairly good way to decide, <eob> this is done correctly <eol> and this is not done well. <eob>
Code either works <eol> or it doesn't, <eob> which means that there's less <eol> room for arguments. <eob>
And we have arguments despite this, right? <eob>
In many other areas -- <eob> I mean, people have talked <eol> about open politics and things like that -- <eob> and it's really hard sometimes to say <eob> that, yes, you can apply <eol> the same principles in some other areas <eob> just because the black <eol> and white turns into not just gray, <eob> but different colors. <eob>
So, obviously open source in science <eol> is making a comeback. <eob>
Science was there first. <eob>
But then science ended up being pretty closed, <eob> with very expensive journals <eol> and some of that going on. <eob>
And open source is making <eol> a comeback in science, <eob> with things like arXiv <eol> and open journals. <eob>
Wikipedia changed the world, too. <eob>
So there are other examples, <eob> I'm sure there are more to come. <eob>
CA: But you're not a visionary, <eob> and so it's not up to you to name them. <eob>
LT: No. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's up to you guys to make them, right? <eob>
CA: Exactly. <eob>
Linus Torvalds, <eob> thank you for Linux, <eol> thank you for the Internet, <eob> thank you for all those Android phones. <eob>
Thank you for coming here to TED <eol> and revealing so much of yourself. <eob>
LT: Thank you. <eob>
I'm here to talk to you today <eob> about a story that we have <eol> all been conditioned to believe <eob> is not possible. <eob>
It's a story about a living, <eol> breathing start-up <eob> flourishing in an unlikely environment: <eob> the United States government. <eob>
Now, this start-up <eol> is fundamentally beginning to disrupt <eob> the way government does business <eol> from the inside out. <eob>
But before I get there, <eol> let's start with the problem. <eob>
For me, the problem begins <eol> with a number: 137. <eob>
137 is the average number of days <eob> a veteran has to wait <eol> to have benefits processed by the VA. <eob> 137 days. <eob> Now, in order to file that application <eol> in the first place, <eob> she has to navigate <eol> over 1,000 different websites <eob> and over 900 different <eol> call-in numbers, <eob> all owned and operated by <eob> the United States government. <eob>
Now, we live in times <eol> of incredible change. <eob>
The private sector is constantly changing <eob> and improving itself all the time. <eob>
For that matter, it's removing <eol> every single inconvenience in my life <eob> that I could possibly think of. <eob>
I could be sitting <eol> on my couch in my apartment, <eob> and from my phone, I can order <eol> a warm, gluten-free meal <eob> that can arrive at my door <eol> in less than 10 minutes. <eob>
But meanwhile, a working mother <eol> who depends on food stamps <eob> to support her family <eob> has to complete an arduous, complicated application <eob> which she might not even be able to do online. <eob>
And the inability of her to do <eol> that same work from her couch means <eob> that she might be having to take days <eol> or hours off of work <eob> that she can't spare. <eob>
And this growing dichotomy <eob> between the beneficiaries <eol> of the tech revolution <eob> and those it's left behind <eob> is one of the greatest challenges <eol> of our time -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Because government's failure <eol> to deliver digital services that work <eob> is disproportionately impacting <eol> the very people who need it most. <eob> It's impacting the students <eol> trying to go to college, <eob> the single mothers trying <eol> to get health care, <eob> the veterans coming home from battle. <eob>
They can't get what they need <eol> when they need it. <eob>
And for these Americans, <eob> government is more than just a presidential election <eol> every four years. <eob>
Government is a lifeline that provides <eol> services they need <eob> and depend on and deserve. <eob>
Which is, quite frankly, <eob> why government needs <eol> to get its shit together and catch up. <eob> Just saying. <eob>
Now, this wasn't always a problem <eol> I was passionate about. <eob>
When I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008, <eob> we brought the tech <eol> industry's best practices into politics. <eob>
We earned more money, <eob> we engaged more volunteers <eob> and we earned more votes <eol> than any political campaign in history. <eob>
We were a cutting-edge start-up <eol> that changed the game of politics forever. <eob>
So when the President asked <eol> a small group of us <eob> to bring that very same disruption <eol> directly into government, <eob> I knew it wasn't going to be easy work, <eob> but I was eager and showed up <eol> ready to get to work. <eob>
Now, on my first day in DC, <eob> my first day in government, <eob> I walked into the office <eol> and they handed me a laptop. <eob>
And the laptop was running Windows 98. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I mean, three entire presidential elections <eol> had come and gone <eob> since the government had updated <eol> the operating system on that computer. <eob> Three elections! <eob> Which is when we realized <eob> this problem was a whole lot bigger <eol> than we ever could have imagined. <eob>
Let me paint the picture for you. <eob>
The federal government <eol> is the largest institution in the world. <eob>
It spends over 86 billion dollars <eol> a year -- 86 billion -- <eob> on federal IT projects. <eob>
For context: <eob> that is more than the entire venture capital <eol> industry spends <eob> annually -- on everything. <eob>
Now, the problem here <eob> is that we the taxpayers <eol> are not getting what we pay for, <eob> because 94 percent of federal <eol> IT projects <eob> are over budget or behind schedule. <eob> 94 percent! <eob> For those of you keeping score, <eob> yes, the number 94 is very close to 100. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There's another problem: <eob> 40 percent of those never end up <eol> seeing the light of day. <eob>
They are completely scrapped or abandoned. <eob>
Now, this is a very existentially <eol> painful moment for any organization, <eob> because it means as government <eol> continues to operate <eob> as it's programmed to do, <eob> failure is nearly inevitable. <eob>
And when the status quo <eol> is the riskiest option, <eob> that means there is simply no other choice <eob> than radical disruption. <eob>
So, what do we do about it? <eob> How do we fix this? <eob>
Well, the irony of all of this <eob> is that we actually don't have to look <eol> any further than our backyard, <eob> because right here in America <eol> are the very ideas, the very people, <eob> who have swept our world <eol> into a radically different place <eob> than it was two decades ago. <eob>
So what would it look like <eob> if it was actually as easy <eol> to get student loans or veterans' benefits <eob> as it is to order cat food to my house? <eob>
What would it look like <eob> if there was an easy pathway <eol> for the very entrepreneurs and innovators <eob> who have disrupted our tech sector <eob> to come and disrupt their government? <eob>
Well, my friends, here's where we get to talk <eob> about some of the exciting <eol> new formulas we've discovered <eob> for creating change in government. <eob>
Enter the United States Digital Service. <eob>
The United States Digital Service <eol> is a new network of start-ups, <eob> a team of teams, <eob> organizing themselves across government <eol> to create radical change. <eob>
The mission of the United States <eol> Digital Service is to help government <eob> deliver world-class digital services <eob> for students, immigrants, <eol> children, the elderly -- everybody -- <eob> at dramatically lower costs. <eob>
We are essentially trying to build <eol> a more awesome government, <eob> for the people, by the people, today. <eob>
We don't care — <eob> (Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
Who doesn't want a more <eol> awesome government, right? <eob>
We don't care about politics. <eob> We care about making government work better, <eob> because it's the only one we've got. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Now, you can think of our team -- <eol> well, it's pretty funny -- <eob> you can think of our team <eol> a little bit like <eob> the Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6. <eob>
We're like the Peace Corps <eol> for nerds, <eob> but instead of traveling to crazy, <eol> interesting, far-off places, <eob> you spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers, <eob> helping restore <eol> the fabric of our democracy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, this team -- our playbook <eol> for the United States Digital Service <eob> is pretty simple. <eob>
The first play is we recruit <eol> the very best talent <eob> our country has to offer, <eob> and recruit them for short tours <eol> of duty inside government. <eob>
These are the very people <eol> who have helped build the products and companies <eob> that have made our tech sector <eol> amongst the most innovative in the world. <eob>
Second, we pair these incredible <eol> people from the tech core <eob> with the dedicated civil servants <eol> already inside government <eob> on the ground creating change. <eob>
Third, we strategically deploy them <eol> in a targeted formation <eob> at the most mission-critical, <eol> life-changing, important services <eob> that government offers. <eob>
And finally, we give them <eol> massive air cover, <eob> from the leadership inside the agencies <eob> all the way up to the President himself, <eob> to transform these services for the better. <eob>
Now, this team is beginning to disrupt <eob> how government does business <eol> from the inside out. <eob>
If you study classic patterns of disruption, <eob> one very common pattern <eol> is rather simple. <eob>
It's to take something that has become <eol> routine and standard in one industry <eob> and apply it to another <eol> where it's a radical departure <eob> from the status quo. <eob>
Think about what Airbnb took <eol> that was normal from hospitality <eob> and revolutionized my apartment. <eob>
The United States Digital <eol> Service is doing exactly that. <eob>
We are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned <eob> through a ton of hard work <eob> about how to build planetary-scale digital services <eob> that delight users at lower cost, <eob> and we're applying that to government, <eob> where it is a radical departure <eob> from the status quo. <eob>
Now, the good news is: <eob> it's starting to work. <eob>
We know this because <eol> we can already see the results <eob> from some of our early projects, <eol> like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov, <eob> when that went off the rails. <eob>
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place <eol> that we ran this play, <eob> and today we are taking that same play <eob> and scaling it across a large number <eob> of government's most important <eol> citizen-facing services. <eob>
Now, if I can take a moment <eob> and brag about the team <eol> for a second -- <eob> it is the highest concentration of badasses <eob> I could have ever dreamed of. <eob>
We have top talent from Google, <eol> Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes, <eob> all on staff today, <eob> all choosing to join their government. <eob>
And what's incredible is, <eob> everybody is as eager and kind <eol> as they are intelligent. <eob>
And I might add, by the way, <eol> over half of us are women. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The best way to understand <eol> this strategy <eob> is actually to walk <eol> through a couple of examples <eob> of how it's working out in the wild. <eob>
I'm going to give you <eol> two examples quickly. <eob>
The first one is about immigration. <eob>
This, my friends, <eol> is your typical immigration application. <eob>
Yes, you guessed it -- <eob> it's almost entirely paper-based. <eob>
In the best case, <eob> the application takes about <eol> six to eight months to process. <eob>
It is physically shipped thousands <eol> of miles -- thousands of miles! -- <eob> between no less than six processing centers. <eob>
Now, little story: <eob> about a decade ago, <eob> the government thought <eol> that if it brought this system online, <eob> it could save taxpayer dollars <eol> and provide a better service, <eob> which was a great idea. <eob>
So, the typical government process began. <eob>
Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later, <eob> no working product was delivered -- <eob> 1.2 billion with a "B." <eob> Now at this point, the agency responsible, <eob> US Citizenship <eol> and Immigration Services, <eob> could have kept pouring money <eol> into the failing program. <eob>
Sadly, that's what often happens. <eob>
That's the status quo today. <eob>
But they didn't. <eob>
The dedicated civil servants <eol> inside the agency <eob> decided to stand up <eol> and call for change. <eob>
We deployed a small team <eol> of just six people, <eob> and what many people don't know is <eob> that's the same size as the rescue <eol> effort of Healthcare.gov -- <eob> just six people. <eob>
And that team jumped in, <eol> side-by-side, <eob> to support the agency in transitioning this project <eob> into more modern business practices, <eol> more modern development practices. <eob>
Now, in non-tech speak, <eob> what that basically means is taking big, <eol> multi-year projects <eob> and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks, <eob> so that way we can reduce the risk <eob> and actually start to see results <eol> every couple of weeks, <eob> instead of waiting in a black box for years. <eob>
So within less than three months <eol> of our team being on the ground, <eob> we were already able to push <eol> our first products to production. <eob>
The first one, this is the form I-90. <eob>
This is used to file <eol> for your replacement green card. <eob>
Now, for immigrant visa holders, <eob> a replacement green card is a big deal. <eob>
Your green card is your proof <eol> of identification, <eob> it's your work authorization, <eob> it's the proof that you can <eol> be here in this country. <eob>
So waiting six months <eol> while the government processes the replacement <eob> is not cool. <eob>
I'm excited to tell you that today, <eob> you can now, for the first time, <eol> file for a replacement green card <eob> entirely online <eol> without anyone touching a piece of paper. <eob>
It is faster, it is cheaper, <eob> and it's a better user <eol> experience for the applicant <eob> and the government employees alike. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Another one, quickly. <eob> Last fall, we just released a brand-new practice <eol> civics test. <eob>
So as part of becoming a US citizen, <eob> you have to pass a civics test. <eob>
For anyone who has taken this test, <eol> it can be quite the stressful process. <eob>
So our team released a very easy, <eol> simple-to-use tool in plain language <eob> to help people prepare, <eob> to help ease their nerves, <eob> to help them feel more confident <eob> in taking the next step <eol> in pursuing their American dream. <eob>
Because all of this work, <eol> all of this work on immigration, <eob> is about taking complicated processes <eol> and making them more human. <eob>
The other day, one of the dedicated <eol> civil servants on the ground <eob> said something incredibly profound. <eob>
She said that she's never been <eol> this hopeful or optimistic <eob> about a project in her entire <eol> time in government. <eob>
And she's been doing this for 30 years. <eob>
That is exactly the kind of hope <eol> and culture change <eob> we are trying to create. <eob>
For my second example, I want to bring <eol> it back to veterans for a second, <eob> and what we are doing <eol> to build them a VA <eob> that is worthy of their service <eol> and their sacrifice. <eob>
I'm proud to say <eol> that just a few months ago, <eob> we released a brand-new beta <eob> of a new website, Vets.gov. <eob> Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website <eob> that brings all of the online services <eol> a veteran needs into one place. <eob>
One website, not thousands. <eob>
The site is a work in progress, <eol> but it's significant progress, <eob> because it's designed with the users <eol> who matter most: <eob> the veterans themselves. <eob>
This might sound incredibly obvious, <eol> because it should be, <eob> but sadly, this isn't normal <eol> for government. <eob>
Far too often, product decisions are made <eol> by committees of stakeholders <eob> who do their best to represent <eol> the interests of the user, <eob> but they're not necessarily <eol> the users themselves. <eob>
So our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data, <eob> we talked to veterans themselves <eob> and we started simple and small, <eob> with the two most important services <eol> that matter most to them: <eob> education benefits <eol> and disability benefits. <eob>
I'm proud to say that they are live <eol> on the site today, <eob> and as the team continues to streamline <eol> more services, <eob> they will be ported over here, <eol> and the old sites, shut down. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
To me, this is what change <eol> looks like in 2016. <eob>
When you walk out <eol> of the Oval Office, <eob> the first time I was ever there, <eol> I noticed a quote <eob> the President had embroidered on the rug. <eob>
It's the classic JFK quote. <eob> It says, "No problem of human destiny <eol> is beyond human beings." <eob> It's true. <eob>
We have the tools to solve these problems. <eob>
We have the tools to come together <eol> as a society, as a country, <eob> and to fix this together. <eob>
Yes, it's hard. <eob>
It's particularly hard <eol> when we have to fight, <eob> when we have to refuse <eol> to succumb to the belief that things won't change. <eob>
But in my experience, <eob> it's often the hardest things <eol> that are the most worth doing, <eob> because if we don't do them, <eob> who will? <eob>
This is on us, <eob> all of us, together, <eob> because government is not <eol> an abstract institution or a concept. <eob>
Our government is us. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today, it is no longer a question <eob> of if change is possible. <eob>
The question is not, "Can we?" <eob> The question is, "Will we?" <eob>
Will you? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
When I was seven years old, <eob> some well-meaning adult <eol> asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. <eob>
Proudly, I said: "An artist." <eob> "No, you don't," he said, <eob> "You can't make a living being an artist!" <eob>
My little seven-year-old Picasso <eol> dreams were crushed. <eob>
But I gathered myself, <eob> went off in search of a new dream, <eob> eventually settling on being a scientist, <eob> perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I have always loved math and science, <eob> later, coding. <eob>
And so I decided to study computer <eol> programming in college. <eob>
In my junior year, <eob> my computer graphics professor <eol> showed us these wonderful short films. <eob>
It was the first computer animation <eol> any of us had ever seen. <eob>
I watched these films in wonder, transfixed, <eob> fireworks going off in my head, <eob> thinking, "That is what I want to do with my life." <eob> The idea that all the math, science and code <eol> I had been learning <eob> could come together to create <eol> these worlds and characters <eob> and stories I connected with, <eob> was pure magic for me. <eob>
Just two years later, I started working <eob> at the place that made those films, <eol> Pixar Animation Studios. <eob>
It was here I learned how we actually <eol> execute those films. <eob>
To create our movies, <eob> we create a three-dimensional world <eol> inside the computer. <eob>
We start with a point that makes <eol> a line that makes a face <eob> that creates characters, <eob> or trees and rocks that eventually <eol> become a forest. <eob>
And because it's a three-dimensional world, <eob> we can move a camera around <eol> inside that world. <eob>
I was fascinated by all of it. <eob>
But then I got my first taste of lighting. <eob>
Lighting in practice is placing lights <eol> inside this three-dimensional world. <eob>
I actually have icons of lights <eol> I move around in there. <eob>
Here you can see I've added a light, <eob> I'm turning on the rough <eol> version of lighting in our software, <eob> turn on shadows <eob> and placing the light. <eob>
As I place a light, <eob> I think about what it might <eol> look like in real life, <eob> but balance that out with what we need <eol> artistically and for the story. <eob>
So it might look like this at first, <eob> but as we adjust this and move that <eob> in weeks of work, <eob> in rough form it might look like this, <eob> and in final form, like this. <eob>
There's this moment in lighting <eol> that made me fall utterly in love with it. <eob>
It's where we go from this <eob> to this. <eob>
It's the moment <eol> where all the pieces come together, <eob> and suddenly the world comes to life <eob> as if it's an actual place <eol> that exists. <eob>
This moment never gets old, <eob> especially for that little seven-year-old girl <eol> that wanted to be an artist. <eob>
As I learned to light, <eob> I learned about using light <eol> to help tell story, <eob> to set the time of day, <eob> to create the mood, <eob> to guide the audience's eye, <eob> how to make a character look appealing <eob> or stand out in a busy set. <eob>
Did you see WALL-E? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There he is. <eob>
As you can see, <eob> we can create any world <eol> that we want inside the computer. <eob>
We can make a world with monsters, <eob> with robots that fall in love, <eob> we can even make pigs fly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
While this is an incredible thing, <eob> this untethered artistic freedom, <eob> it can create chaos. <eob>
It can create unbelievable worlds, <eob> unbelievable movement, <eob> things that are jarring to the audience. <eob>
So to combat this, <eol> we tether ourselves with science. <eob>
We use science and the world we know <eob> as a backbone, <eob> to ground ourselves in something relatable <eol> and recognizable. <eob> "Finding Nemo" is an excellent example of this. <eob>
A major portion of the movie <eol> takes place underwater. <eob>
But how do you make it look underwater? <eob>
In early research and development, <eob> we took a clip of underwater footage <eol> and recreated it in the computer. <eob>
Then we broke it back down <eob> to see which elements <eol> make up that underwater look. <eob>
One of the most critical elements <eob> was how the light travels <eol> through the water. <eob>
So we coded up a light <eol> that mimics this physics -- <eob> first, the visibility of the water, <eob> and then what happens with the color. <eob>
Objects close to the eye have <eol> their full, rich colors. <eob>
As light travels deeper into the water, <eob> we lose the red wavelengths, <eob> then the green wavelengths, <eob> leaving us with blue at the far depths. <eob>
In this clip you can see <eol> two other important elements. <eob>
The first is the surge and swell, <eob> or the invisible underwater current <eob> that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water. <eob>
The second is the caustics. <eob>
These are the ribbons of light, <eob> like you might see <eol> on the bottom of a pool, <eob> that are created when the sun <eol> bends through the crests <eob> of the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface. <eob>
Here we have the fog beams. <eob>
These give us color depth cues, <eob> but also tells which direction <eol> is up <eob> in shots where we don't see the water surface. <eob>
The other really cool thing you can see here <eob> is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics, <eob> so that as it goes in and out <eol> of those ribbons of light, <eob> it appears and disappears, <eob> lending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater. <eob>
You can see how we're using the science -- <eob> the physics of water, <eol> light and movement -- <eob> to tether that artistic freedom. <eob>
But we are not beholden to it. <eob>
We considered each of these elements <eob> and which ones had to be scientifically accurate <eob> and which ones we could push and pull <eol> to suit the story and the mood. <eob>
We realized early on that color <eol> was one we had some leeway with. <eob>
So here's a traditionally <eol> colored underwater scene. <eob>
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor <eol> and push it fairly green <eob> to suit the sad mood <eol> of what's happening. <eob>
In this scene, it's really important <eol> we see deep into the underwater, <eob> so we understand what the East <eol> Australian Current is, <eob> that the turtles are diving into and going <eol> on this roller coaster ride. <eob>
So we pushed the visibility of the water <eob> well past anything you would <eol> ever see in real life. <eob>
Because in the end, <eob> we are not trying to recreate <eol> the scientifically correct real world, <eob> we're trying to create a believable world, <eob> one the audience can immerse themselves <eol> in to experience the story. <eob>
We use science to create <eol> something wonderful. <eob>
We use story and artistic touch <eol> to get us to a place of wonder. <eob>
This guy, WALL-E, <eol> is a great example of that. <eob>
He finds beauty in the simplest things. <eob>
But when he came in to lighting, <eol> we knew we had a big problem. <eob>
We got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot, <eob> that we made his binoculars <eol> practically optically perfect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
His binoculars are one of the most critical <eol> acting devices he has. <eob>
He doesn't have a face or even traditional <eol> dialogue, for that matter. <eob>
So the animators were heavily dependent <eol> on the binoculars <eob> to sell his acting and emotions. <eob>
We started lighting and we realized <eob> the triple lenses inside his binoculars <eol> were a mess of reflections. <eob>
He was starting to look glassy-eyed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, glassy-eyed <eol> is a fundamentally awful thing <eob> when you are trying to convince an audience <eob> that a robot has a personality <eol> and he's capable of falling in love. <eob>
So we went to work on these optically <eol> perfect binoculars, <eob> trying to find a solution <eol> that would maintain his true robot materials <eob> but solve this reflection problem. <eob>
So we started with the lenses. <eob> Here's the flat-front lens, <eob> we have a concave lens <eob> and a convex lens. <eob>
And here you see all three together, <eob> showing us all these reflections. <eob>
We tried turning them down, <eob> we tried blocking them, <eob> nothing was working. <eob>
You can see here, <eob> sometimes we needed something <eol> specific reflected in his eyes -- <eob> usually Eve. <eob>
So we couldn't just use some faked <eol> abstract image on the lenses. <eob>
So here we have Eve on the first lens, <eob> we put Eve on the second lens, <eob> it's not working. <eob>
We turn it down, <eob> it's still not working. <eob>
And then we have our eureka moment. <eob>
We add a light to WALL-E <eol> that accidentally leaks into his eyes. <eob>
You can see it light up <eol> these gray aperture blades. <eob>
Suddenly, those aperture blades <eol> are poking through that reflection <eob> the way nothing else has. <eob>
Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye. <eob>
As humans we have the white of our eye, <eob> the colored iris <eob> and the black pupil. <eob>
and the black pupil. <eob> Now WALL-E has the black of an eye, <eob> the gray aperture blades <eob>
Suddenly, WALL-E feels <eol> like he has a soul, <eob> like there's a character <eol> with emotion inside. <eob>
Later in the movie towards the end, <eob> WALL-E loses his personality, <eob> essentially going dead. <eob>
This is the perfect time <eol> to bring back that glassy-eyed look. <eob>
In the next scene, WALL-E <eol> comes back to life. <eob>
We bring that light back to bring <eol> the aperture blades back, <eob> and he returns to that sweet, soulful <eol> robot we've come to love. <eob>
(Video) WALL-E: Eva? <eob>
Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty <eol> in these unexpected moments -- <eob> when you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul, <eob> the moment when you discover <eol> what you want to do with your life. <eob>
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo" <eol> was one of those moments for me. <eob>
There are scenes in every movie <eol> that struggle to come together. <eob>
This was one of those scenes. <eob>
The director had a vision for this scene <eob> based on some wonderful footage <eol> of jellyfish in the South Pacific. <eob>
As we went along, <eob> we were floundering. <eob>
The reviews with the director <eob> turned from the normal look-and-feel conversation <eob> into more and more questions <eol> about numbers and percentages. <eob>
Maybe because unlike normal, <eob> we were basing it on something <eol> in real life, <eob> or maybe just because we had lost our way. <eob>
But it had become about using our brain <eol> without our eyes, <eob> the science without the art. <eob> That scientific tether was strangling the scene. <eob>
But even through all the frustrations, <eob> I still believed it could be beautiful. <eob>
So when it came in to lighting, <eob> I dug in. <eob>
As I worked to balance <eol> the blues and the pinks, <eob> the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells, <eob> the undulating fog beams, <eob> something promising began to appear. <eob>
I came in one morning and checked <eol> the previous night's work. <eob> And I got excited. <eob> And then I showed it to the lighting director <eob> and she got excited. <eob>
Soon, I was showing to the director <eol> in a dark room full of 50 people. <eob>
In director review, <eob> you hope you might get some nice words, <eob> then you get some notes and fixes, generally. <eob>
And then, hopefully, you get a final, <eob> signaling to move on to the next stage. <eob>
I gave my intro, and I played <eol> the jellyfish scene. <eob>
And the director was silent for an uncomfort <eol>ably long amount of time. <eob>
Just long enough for me to think, <eob> "Oh no, this is doomed." <eob> And then he started clapping. <eob>
And then the production designer <eol> started clapping. <eob>
And then the whole room was clapping. <eob>
This is the moment <eol> that I live for in lighting. <eob>
The moment where it all comes together <eob> and we get a world that we can believe in. <eob>
We use math, science and code <eol> to create these amazing worlds. <eob>
We use storytelling and art <eol> to bring them to life. <eob>
It's this interweaving of art and science <eob> that elevates the world <eol> to a place of wonder, <eob> a place with soul, <eob> a place we can believe in, <eob> a place where the things <eol> you imagine can become real -- <eob> and a world where a girl suddenly realizes <eob> not only is she a scientist, <eob> but also an artist. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Cancer affects all of us -- <eob> especially the ones <eol> that come back over and over again, <eob> the highly invasive and drug-resistant ones, <eob> the ones that defy medical treatment, <eob> even when we throw our best drugs at them. <eob>
Engineering at the molecular level, <eob> working at the smallest of scales, <eob> can provide exciting new ways <eob> to fight the most aggressive forms <eol> of cancer. <eob>
Cancer is a very clever disease. <eob>
There are some forms of cancer, <eob> which, fortunately, we've learned <eol> how to address relatively well <eob> with known and established drugs and surgery. <eob>
But there are some forms of cancer <eob> that don't respond to these approaches, <eob> and the tumor survives or comes back, <eob> even after an onslaught of drugs. <eob>
We can think of these <eol> very aggressive forms of cancer <eob> as kind of supervillains <eol> in a comic book. <eob>
They're clever, they're adaptable, <eob> and they're very good at staying alive. <eob>
And, like most supervillains <eol> these days, <eob> their superpowers come <eol> from a genetic mutation. <eob>
The genes that are modified <eol> inside these tumor cells <eob> can enable and encode <eol> for new and unimagined modes of survival, <eob> allowing the cancer cell <eol> to live through <eob> even our best chemotherapy treatments. <eob>
One example is a trick <eol> in which a gene allows a cell, <eob> even as the drug approaches the cell, <eob> to push the drug out, <eob> before the drug can have any effect. <eob>
Imagine -- the cell effectively spits <eol> out the drug. <eob>
This is just one example <eol> of the many genetic tricks <eob> in the bag of our supervillain, cancer. <eob>
All due to mutant genes. <eob>
So, we have a supervillain <eol> with incredible superpowers. <eob>
And we need a new <eol> and powerful mode of attack. <eob>
Actually, we can turn off a gene. <eob>
The key is a set of molecules <eol> known as siRNA. <eob> siRNA are short sequences <eol> of genetic code <eob> that guide a cell to block a certain gene. <eob>
Each siRNA molecule <eol> can turn off a specific gene <eob> inside the cell. <eob>
For many years since its discovery, <eob> scientists have been very excited <eob> about how we can apply <eol> these gene blockers in medicine. <eob>
But, there is a problem. <eob> siRNA works well <eob> inside the cell. <eob>
But if it gets exposed <eol> to the enzymes <eob> that reside in our blood <eol>stream or our tissues, <eob> it degrades within seconds. <eob>
It has to be packaged, protected through its journey <eol> through the body <eob> on its way to the final target <eol> inside the cancer cell. <eob>
So, here's our strategy. <eob> First, we'll dose the cancer cell <eol> with siRNA, the gene blocker, <eob> and silence those survival genes, <eob> and then we'll whop it <eol> with a chemo drug. <eob>
But how do we carry that out? <eob>
Using molecular engineering, <eob> we can actually design a superweapon <eob> that can travel through the bloodstream. <eob>
It has to be tiny enough <eol> to get through the bloodstream, <eob> it's got to be small enough <eol> to penetrate the tumor tissue, <eob> and it's got to be tiny enough <eol> to be taken up inside the cancer cell. <eob>
To do this job well, <eob> it has to be about one one-hundredth the size <eol> of a human hair. <eob>
Let's take a closer look at <eol> how we can build this nanoparticle. <eob>
First, let's start <eol> with the nanoparticle core. <eob>
It's a tiny capsule <eol> that contains the chemotherapy drug. <eob>
This is the poison that will actually <eol> end the tumor cell's life. <eob>
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin, <eob> nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA. <eob>
This is our gene blocker. <eob>
Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged, <eob> we can protect it <eob> with a nice, protective layer <eol> of positively charged polymer. <eob>
The two oppositely charged molecules <eol> stick together <eob> through charge attraction, <eob> and that provides us <eol> with a protective layer <eob> that prevents the siRNA <eol> from degrading in the bloodstream. <eob>
We're almost done. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But there is one more big obstacle <eol> we have to think about. <eob>
In fact, it may be <eol> the biggest obstacle of all. <eob>
How do we deploy this superweapon? <eob>
I mean, every good weapon <eol> needs to be targeted, <eob> we have to target this superweapon <eol> to the supervillain cells <eob> that reside in the tumor. <eob>
But our bodies have <eol> a natural immune-defense system: <eob> cells that reside in the bloodstream <eob> and pick out things that don't belong, <eob> so that it can destroy <eol> or eliminate them. <eob> And guess what? Our nanoparticle <eol> is considered a foreign object. <eob>
We have to sneak our nanoparticle past <eol> the tumor defense system. <eob>
We have to get it past this mechanism <eol> of getting rid of the foreign object <eob> by disguising it. <eob>
So we add one more negatively charged layer <eob> around this nanoparticle, <eob> which serves two purposes. <eob>
First, this outer layer is one <eol> of the naturally charged, <eob> highly hydrated polysaccharides <eol> that resides in our body. <eob>
It creates a cloud of water molecules <eol> around the nanoparticle <eob> that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect. <eob>
This invisibility cloak allows <eol> the nanoparticle <eob> to travel through the bloodstream <eob> long and far enough to reach the tumor, <eob> without getting eliminated by the body. <eob>
Second, this layer contains molecules <eob> which bind specifically to our tumor cell. <eob>
Once bound, the cancer cell <eol> takes up the nanoparticle, <eob> and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell <eob> and ready to deploy. <eob>
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go! <eob>
The siRNA is deployed first. <eob>
It acts for hours, <eob> giving enough time to silence <eol> and block those survival genes. <eob>
We have now disabled those genetic <eol> superpowers. <eob>
What remains is a cancer cell <eol> with no special defenses. <eob>
Then, the chemotherapy drug comes <eol> out of the core <eob> and destroys the tumor cell cleanly <eol> and efficiently. <eob>
With sufficient gene blockers, <eob> we can address many different <eol> kinds of mutations, <eob> allowing the chance to sweep out tumors, <eob> without leaving behind any bad guys. <eob>
So, how does our strategy work? <eob>
We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals <eob> using a highly aggressive form <eol> of triple-negative breast cancer. <eob>
This triple-negative breast cancer <eol> exhibits the gene <eob> that spits out cancer drug <eol> as soon as it is delivered. <eob>
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call it "dox" -- is the cancer drug <eob> that is the first line of treatment <eol> for breast cancer. <eob>
So, we first treated our animals <eol> with a dox core, dox only. <eob>
The tumor slowed their rate of growth, <eob> but they still grew rapidly, <eob> doubling in size over a period of two weeks. <eob>
Then, we tried our combination <eol> superweapon. <eob>
A nanolayer particle with siRNA <eol> against the chemo pump, <eob> plus, we have the dox in the core. <eob>
And look -- we found <eol> that not only did the tumors stop growing, <eob> they actually decreased in size <eob> and were eliminated in some cases. <eob> The tumors were actually regressing. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What's great about this approach <eol> is that it can be personalized. <eob>
We can add many different <eol> layers of siRNA <eob> to address different mutations <eol> and tumor defense mechanisms. <eob>
And we can put different drugs <eol> into the nanoparticle core. <eob>
As doctors learn <eol> how to test patients <eob> and understand certain tumor genetic types, <eob> they can help us determine <eol> which patients can benefit from this strategy <eob> and which gene blockers we can use. <eob>
Ovarian cancer strikes <eol> a special chord with me. <eob>
It is a very aggressive cancer, <eob> in part because it's discovered <eol> at very late stages, <eob> when it's highly advanced <eob> and there are a number of genetic mutations. <eob>
After the first round of chemotherapy, <eob> this cancer comes back <eol> for 75 percent of patients. <eob>
And it usually comes back <eol> in a drug-resistant form. <eob>
High-grade ovarian cancer <eob> is one of the biggest <eol> supervillains out there. <eob>
And we're now directing our superweapon <eob> toward its defeat. <eob>
As a researcher, <eob> I usually don't get to work with patients. <eob>
But I recently met a mother <eob> who is an ovarian cancer <eol> survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige. <eob>
I was deeply inspired <eol> by the optimism and strength <eob> that both mother <eol> and daughter displayed <eob> and by their story of courage and support. <eob>
At this event, we spoke about <eol> the different technologies <eob> directed at cancer. <eob>
And Mimi was in tears <eob> as she explained how learning <eol> about these efforts <eob> gives her hope for future generations, <eob> including her own daughter. <eob>
This really touched me. <eob>
It's not just about building really elegant science. <eob> It's about changing people's lives. <eob>
It's about understanding the power <eol> of engineering <eob> on the scale of molecules. <eob>
I know that as students like Paige move <eol> forward in their careers, <eob> they'll open new possibilities <eob> in addressing some of the big health problems in the world -- <eob> including ovarian cancer, <eol> neurological disorders, infectious disease -- <eob> just as chemical engineering has found <eol> a way to open doors for me, <eob> and has provided a way of engineering <eob> on the tiniest scale, that of molecules, <eob> to heal on the human scale. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Extraordinary claims <eol> require extraordinary evidence, <eob> and it is my job, my responsibility, <eol> as an astronomer <eob> to remind people that alien hypotheses <eol> should always be a last resort. <eob>
Now, I want to tell you <eol> a story about that. <eob>
It involves data from a NASA mission, <eob> ordinary people and one of the most <eol> extraordinary stars in our galaxy. <eob>
It began in 2009 with the launch <eol> of NASA's Kepler mission. <eob> Kepler's main scientific objective <eob> was to find planets outside of our solar system. <eob>
It did this by staring <eol> at a single field in the sky, <eob> this one, with all the tiny boxes. <eob>
And in this one field, <eob> it monitored the brightness <eol> of over 150,000 stars <eob> continuously for four years, <eob> taking a data point <eol> every 30 minutes. <eob>
It was looking for what astronomers <eol> call a transit. <eob>
This is when the planet's orbit <eol> is aligned in our line of sight, <eob> just so that the planet crosses <eol> in front of a star. <eob>
And when this happens, it blocks <eol> out a tiny bit of starlight, <eob> which you can see <eol> as a dip in this curve. <eob>
And so the team at NASA had developed <eol> very sophisticated computers <eob> to search for transits in all the Kepler data. <eob>
At the same time of the first data release, <eob> astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing: <eob> What if computers missed something? <eob>
And so we launched the citizen science <eol> project called Planet Hunters <eob> to have people look at the same data. <eob>
The human brain has an amazing ability <eol> for pattern recognition, <eob> sometimes even better than a computer. <eob>
However, there was a lot <eol> of skepticism around this. <eob>
My colleague, Debra Fischer, founder <eol> of the Planet Hunters project, <eob> said that people at the time were saying, <eob> "You're crazy. <eob>
There's no way that a computer <eol> will miss a signal. <eob> "And so it was on, <eol> the classic human versus machine gamble. <eob>
And if we found one planet, <eol> we would be thrilled. <eob>
When I joined the team four years ago, <eob> we had already found a couple. <eob>
And today, with the help of over 300,000 <eol> science enthusiasts, <eob> we have found dozens, <eob> and we've also found one <eol> of the most mysterious stars <eob> in our galaxy. <eob>
So to understand this, <eob> let me show you what a normal <eol> transit in Kepler data looks like. <eob>
On this graph on the left-hand side <eol> you have the amount of light, <eob> and on the bottom is time. <eob>
The white line is light <eol> just from the star, <eob> what astronomers call a light curve. <eob>
Now, when a planet transits a star, <eol> it blocks out a little bit of this light, <eob> and the depth of this transit reflects <eol> the size of the object itself. <eob>
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter. <eob>
Planets don't get much bigger <eol> than Jupiter. <eob>
Jupiter will make a one percent drop <eol> in a star's brightness. <eob>
Earth, on the other hand, <eol> is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, <eob> and the signal is barely visible in the data. <eob>
So back to our mystery. <eob> A few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting <eol> through data looking for transits, <eob> and they spotted a mysterious signal coming <eol> from the star KIC 8462852. <eob>
The observations in May of 2009 <eol> were the first they spotted, <eob> and they started talking about this <eol> in the discussion forums. <eob>
They said and object like Jupiter <eob> would make a drop like this <eol> in the star's light, <eob> but they were also saying <eol> it was giant. <eob>
You see, transits normally <eol> only last for a few hours, <eob> and this one lasted for almost a week. <eob>
They were also saying <eol> that it looks asymmetric, <eob> meaning that instead of the clean, <eol> U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter, <eob> it had this strange slope <eol> that you can see on the left side. <eob>
This seemed to indicate <eob> that whatever was getting in the way <eol> and blocking the starlight <eob> was not circular like a planet. <eob>
There are few more dips that happened, <eob> but for a couple of years, <eol> it was pretty quiet. <eob>
And then in March of 2011, we see this. <eob>
The star's light drops <eol> by a whole 15 percent, <eob> and this is huge compared to a planet, <eob> which would only make a one percent drop. <eob>
We described this feature <eol> as both smooth and clean. <eob>
It also is asymmetric, <eob> having a gradual dimming that <eol> lasts almost a week, <eob> and then it snaps right back up <eol> to normal in just a matter of days. <eob>
And again, after this, not much happens <eob> until February of 2013. <eob>
Things start to get really crazy. <eob>
There is a huge complex of dips <eol> in the light curve that appear, <eob> and they last for like a hundred days, <eob> all the way up into the Kepler <eol> mission's end. <eob>
These dips have variable shapes. <eob>
Some are very sharp, and some are broad, <eob> and they also have variable durations. <eob>
Some last just for a day or two, <eol> and some for more than a week. <eob>
And there's also up and down trends <eol> within some of these dips, <eob> almost like several independent events <eol> were superimposed on top of each other. <eob>
And at this time, this star drops <eol> in its brightness over 20 percent. <eob>
This means that whatever <eol> is blocking its light <eob> has an area of over 1,000 times <eol> the area of our planet Earth. <eob>
This is truly remarkable. <eob> And so the citizen scientists, <eol> when they saw this, <eob> they notified the science team <eol> that they found something weird enough <eob> that it might be worth following up. <eob>
And so when the science team looked at it, <eob> we're like, "Yeah, there's probably <eol> just something wrong with the data." <eob> But we looked really, really, really hard, <eob> and the data were good. <eob>
And so what was happening <eol> had to be astrophysical, <eob> meaning that something in space <eol> was getting in the way <eob> and blocking starlight. <eob>
And so at this point, <eob> we set out to learn <eol> everything we could about the star <eob> to see if we could find any clues <eol> to what was going on. <eob>
And the citizen scientists <eol> who helped us in this discovery, <eob> they joined along for the ride <eob> watching science in action firsthand. <eob>
First, somebody said, you know, <eol> what if this star was very young <eob> and it still had the cloud of material <eol> it was born from surrounding it. <eob>
And then somebody else said, <eob> well, what if the star <eol> had already formed planets, <eob> and two of these planets had collided, <eob> similar to the Earth-Moon forming event. <eob>
Well, both of these theories <eol> could explain part of the data, <eob> but the difficulties were that <eol> the star showed no signs of being young, <eob> and there was no glow <eol> from any of the material <eob> that was heated up <eol> by the star's light, <eob> and you would expect this <eol> if the star was young <eob> or if there was a collision <eol> and a lot of dust was produced. <eob>
And so somebody else said, <eob> well, how about a huge swarm of comets <eob> that are passing by this star <eol> in a very elliptical orbit? <eob>
Well, it ends up that this is actually <eol> consistent with our observations. <eob> But I agree, it does feel a little contrived. <eob> You see, it would take hundreds of comets <eob> to reproduce what we're observing. <eob>
And these are only the comets <eob> that happen to pass <eol> between us and the star. <eob> And so in reality, <eol> we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets. <eob>
But of all the bad ideas we had, <eob> this one was the best. <eob>
And so we went ahead and published our findings. <eob>
Now, let me tell you, this was one <eol> of the hardest papers I ever wrote. <eob>
Scientists are meant to publish results, <eob> and this situation was far from that. <eob>
And so we decided to give it <eol> a catchy title, <eob> and we called it: <eol> "Where's The Flux?" <eob> I will let you work out the acronym. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this isn't the end of the story. <eob>
Around the same time <eol> I was writing this paper, <eob> I met with a colleague of mine, <eol> Jason Wright, <eob> and he was also writing a paper <eol> on Kepler data. <eob>
And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision, <eob> it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars, <eob> but it didn't. <eob>
And then I showed him this weird data <eol> that our citizen scientists had found, <eob> and he said to me, <eob> "Aw crap, Tabby. <eob> Now I have to rewrite my paper." <eob>
So yes, the natural <eol> explanations were weak, <eob> and we were curious now. <eob>
So we had to find a way <eol> to rule out aliens. <eob>
So together, we convinced a colleague of ours <eob> who works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, <eob> that this would be an extraordinary <eol> target to pursue. <eob>
We wrote a proposal <eol> to observe the star <eob> with the world's largest radio telescope <eol> at the Green Bank Observatory. <eob>
A couple months later, <eob> news of this proposal <eol> got leaked to the press <eob> and now there are <eol> thousands of articles, <eob> over 10,000 articles, on this star alone. <eob>
And if you search Google Images, <eob> this is what you'll find. <eob>
Now, you may be wondering, OK, <eol> Tabby, well, <eob> how do aliens actually explain this light curve? <eob> OK, well, imagine a civilization <eol> that's much more advanced than our own. <eob>
In this hypothetical circumstance, <eob> this civilization would have exhausted <eol> the energy supply of their home planet, <eob> so where could they get more energy? <eob>
Well, they have a host star just <eol> like we have a sun, <eob> and so if they were able to capture <eol> more energy from this star, <eob> then that would solve <eol> their energy needs. <eob>
So they would go <eol> and build huge structures. <eob>
These giant megastructures, <eob> like ginormous solar panels, <eol> are called Dyson spheres. <eob>
This image above <eob> are lots of artists' impressions <eol> of Dyson spheres. <eob>
It's really hard to provide perspective <eol> on the vastness of these things, <eob> but you can think of it this way. <eob>
The Earth-Moon distance is a quarter <eol> of a million miles. <eob>
The simplest element on one of these structures <eob> is 100 times that size. <eob> They're enormous. <eob> And now imagine one of these structures <eol> in motion around a star. <eob>
You can see how it would produce <eol> anomalies in the data <eob> such as uneven, unnatural looking dips. <eob>
But it remains <eol> that even alien megastructures <eob> cannot defy the laws of physics. <eob>
You see, anything <eol> that uses a lot of energy <eob> is going to produce heat, <eob> and we don't observe this. <eob>
But it could be something as simple <eob> as they're just reradiating it away in another direction, <eob> just not at Earth. <eob>
Another idea that's one <eol> of my personal favorites <eob> is that we had just witnessed <eol> an interplanetary space battle <eob> and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. <eob>
Now, I admit that this <eol> would produce a lot of dust <eob> that we don't observe. <eob>
But if we're already invoking <eol> aliens in this explanation, <eob> then who is to say they didn't <eol> efficiently clean up all this mess <eob> for recycling purposes? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You can see how this quickly <eol> captures your imagination. <eob> Well, there you have it. <eob>
We're in a situation that could unfold <eob> to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand <eob> or an alien technology we don't understand. <eob>
Personally, as a scientist, my money <eol> is on the natural explanation. <eob> But don't get me wrong, <eol> I do think it would be awesome to find aliens. <eob>
Either way, there is something new <eol> and really interesting to discover. <eob>
So what happens next? <eob> We need to continue to observe this star <eob> to learn more about what's happening. <eob>
But professional astronomers, like me, <eob> we have limited resources <eol> for this kind of thing, <eob> and Kepler is on to a different mission. <eob>
And I'm happy to say that once again, <eob> citizen scientists have come <eol> in and saved the day. <eob>
You see, this time, <eob> amateur astronomers <eol> with their backyard telescopes <eob> stepped up immediately and started <eol> observing this star nightly <eob> at their own facilities, <eob> and I am so excited to see what they find. <eob>
What's amazing to me is that this star <eol> would have never been found by computers <eob> because we just weren't looking <eol> for something like this. <eob>
And what's more exciting <eob> is that there's more data to come. <eob>
There are new missions that are coming up <eob> that are observing millions more stars <eob> all over the sky. <eob>
And just think: What will it mean <eol> when we find another star like this? <eob>
And what will it mean <eol> if we don't find another star like this? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
People returning to work <eol> after a career break: <eob> I call them relaunchers. <eob>
These are people who have taken <eol> career breaks for elder care, <eob> for childcare reasons, <eob> pursuing a personal interest <eob> or a personal health issue. <eob>
Closely related are career <eol> transitioners of all kinds: <eob> veterans, military spouses, <eob> retirees coming out of retirement <eob> or repatriating expats. <eob>
Returning to work after a career <eol> break is hard <eob> because of a disconnect between the employers <eob> and the relaunchers. <eob>
Employers can view hiring people <eol> with a gap on their resume <eob> as a high-risk proposition, <eob> and individuals on career break can have doubts <eol> about their abilities <eob> to relaunch their careers, <eob> especially if they've been out for a long time. <eob>
This disconnect is a problem <eol> that I'm trying to help solve. <eob>
Now, successful relaunchers <eol> are everywhere and in every field. <eob> This is Sami Kafala. <eob> He's a nuclear physicist in the UK <eob> who took a five-year career break to be home <eol> with his five children. <eob>
The Singapore press recently wrote <eol> about nurses returning to work <eob> after long career breaks. <eob>
And speaking of long career breaks, <eob> this is Mimi Kahn. <eob> She's a social worker <eol> in Orange County, California, <eob> who returned to work <eol> in a social services organization <eob> after a 25-year career break. <eob>
That's the longest career <eol> break that I'm aware of. <eob>
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day <eol> O'Connor <eob> took a five-year career <eol> break early in her career. <eob>
And this is Tracy Shapiro, <eol> who took a 13-year career break. <eob>
Tracy answered a call for essays <eol> by the Today Show <eob> from people who were trying <eol> to return to work <eob> but having a difficult time of it. <eob>
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom <eol> of five who loved her time at home, <eob> but she had gone through a divorce <eol> and needed to return to work, <eob> plus she really wanted to bring <eol> work back into her life <eob> because she loved working. <eob>
Tracy was doing what so many of us do <eob> when we feel like we've put <eol> in a good day in the job search. <eob>
She was looking for a finance <eol> or accounting role, <eob> and she had just spent the last nine months <eob> very diligently researching companies online <eob> and applying for jobs with no results. <eob>
I met Tracy in June of 2011, <eob> when the Today Show asked me <eol> if I could work with her <eob> to see if I could help her turn things around. <eob>
The first thing I told Tracy <eol> was she had to get out of the house. <eob> I told her she had to go public with her job search <eob> and tell everyone she knew <eol> about her interest in returning to work. <eob>
I also told her, "You are going <eol> to have a lot of conversations <eob> that don't go anywhere. <eob>
Expect that, and don't be <eol> discouraged by it. <eob>
There will be a handful <eob> that ultimately lead <eol> to a job opportunity." <eob>
I'll tell you what happened <eol> with Tracy in a little bit, <eob> but I want to share with you <eol> a discovery that I made <eob> when I was returning to work <eob> after my own career break of 11 years <eol> out of the full-time workforce. <eob>
And that is, that people's view <eol> of you is frozen in time. <eob>
What I mean by this is, when you start <eol> to get in touch with people <eob> and you get back in touch <eol> with those people from the past, <eob> the people with whom you worked <eol> or went to school, <eob> they are going to remember you <eol> as you were <eob> before your career break. <eob>
And that's even if your sense of self <eol> has diminished over time, <eob> as happens with so many of us <eob> the farther removed we are from our professional identities. <eob>
So for example, you might think of yourself <eob> as someone who looks like this. <eob> This is me, crazy after a day <eol> of driving around in my minivan. <eob>
Or here I am in the kitchen. <eob>
But those people from the past, <eob> they don't know about any of this. <eob>
They only remember you as you were, <eob> and it's a great confidence <eol> boost to be back in touch with these people <eob> and hear their enthusiasm about <eol> your interest in returning to work. <eob>
There's one more thing I remember <eol> vividly from my own career break. <eob> And that was that I hardly kept up <eol> with the business news. <eob>
My background is in finance, <eob> and I hardly kept up with any news <eob> when I was home caring <eol> for my four young children. <eob>
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview <eob> and start talking about a company <eol> that didn't exist anymore. <eob>
So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal <eob> and read it for a good six months cover <eol> to cover before I felt <eob> like I had a handle on what was going <eol> on in the business world again. <eob>
I believe relaunchers are a gem <eol> of the workforce, <eob> and here's why. <eob> Think about our life stage: <eob> for those of us who took career breaks <eob> for childcare reasons, <eob> we have fewer <eol> or no maternity leaves. <eob>
We did that already. <eob>
We have fewer spousal <eol> or partner job relocations. <eob> We're in a more settled <eol> time of life. <eob>
We have great work experience. <eob>
We have a more mature perspective. <eob>
We're not trying to find ourselves <eol> at an employer's expense. <eob>
Plus we have an energy, <eol> an enthusiasm about returning to work <eob> precisely because we've been away <eol> from it for a while. <eob>
On the flip side, I speak with employers, <eob> and here are two concerns <eol> that employers have <eob> about hiring relaunchers. <eob>
The first one is, employers <eol> are worried that relaunchers <eob> are technologically obsolete. <eob>
Now, I can tell you, <eob> having been technologically <eol> obsolete myself at one point, <eob> that it's a temporary condition. <eob>
I had done my financial analysis so long ago <eol> that I used Lotus 1-2-3. <eob>
I don't know if anyone <eol> can even remember back that far, <eob> but I had to relearn it on Excel. <eob>
It actually wasn't that hard. <eob>
A lot of the commands are the same. <eob>
I found PowerPoint much more challenging, <eob> but now I use PowerPoint all the time. <eob>
I tell relaunchers that employers expect them <eol> to come to the table <eob> with a working knowledge of basic office <eol> management software. <eob>
And if they're not up to speed, <eob> then it's their responsibility <eol> to get there. <eob> And they do. <eob>
The second area of concern <eol> that employers have about relaunchers <eob> is they're worried <eol> that relaunchers don't know what they want to do. <eob>
I tell relaunchers that they need <eol> to do the hard work <eob> to figure out whether their interests <eol> and skills have changed <eob> or have not changed <eob> while they have been on career break. <eob>
That's not the employer's job. <eob>
It's the relauncher's responsibility <eol> to demonstrate to the employer <eob> where they can add the most value. <eob>
Back in 2010 I started noticing something. <eob>
I had been tracking return <eol> to work programs since 2008, <eob> and in 2010, I started noticing <eob> the use of a short-term <eol> paid work opportunity, <eob> whether it was called <eol> an internship or not, <eob> but an internship-like experience, <eob> as a way for professionals to return to work. <eob>
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee <eob> start corporate reentry <eol> internship programs. <eob>
I saw a returning engineer, <eol> a nontraditional reentry candidate, <eob> apply for an entry-level <eol> internship program in the military, <eob> and then get a permanent job afterward. <eob>
I saw two universities <eol> integrate internships <eob> into mid-career executive education programs. <eob>
So I wrote a report <eol> about what I was seeing, <eob> and it became this article <eol> for Harvard Business Review <eob> called "The 40-Year-Old Intern." <eob> I have to thank the editors <eol> there for that title, <eob> and also for this artwork <eob> where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst <eol> of all the college interns. <eob>
And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, <eob> they called the concept <eol> "The 50-Year-Old Intern." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So five of the biggest financial services companies <eob> have reentry internship programs <eol> for returning finance professionals. <eob>
And at this point, hundreds <eol> of people have participated. <eob>
These internships are paid, <eob> and the people who move <eol> on to permanent roles <eob> are commanding competitive salaries. <eob>
And now, seven <eol> of the biggest engineering companies <eob> are piloting reentry internship programs <eol> for returning engineers <eob> as part of an initiative with the Society <eol> of Women Engineers. <eob>
Now, why are companies embracing <eol> the reentry internship? <eob>
Because the internship allows the employer <eob> to base their hiring decision <eol> on an actual work sample <eob> instead of a series of interviews, <eob> and the employer does not have <eol> to make that permanent hiring decision <eob> until the internship period is over. <eob>
This testing out period removes <eol> the perceived risk <eob> that some managers <eol> attach to hiring relaunchers, <eob> and they are attracting excellent candidates <eob> who are turning into great hires. <eob>
Think about how far we have come. <eob>
Before this, most employers <eol> were not interested <eob> in engaging with relaunchers at all. <eob>
But now, not only are programs being developed <eob> specifically with relaunchers in mind, <eob> but you can't even apply for these programs <eob> unless you have a gap on your résumé. <eob>
This is the mark of real change, <eob> of true institutional shift, <eob> because if we can solve this problem <eol> for relaunchers, <eob> we can solve it for other career <eol> transitioners too. <eob>
In fact, an employer just told me <eob> that their veterans return to work program <eob> is based on their reentry internship program. <eob>
And there's no reason why there <eol> can't be a retiree internship program. <eob>
Different pool, same concept. <eob>
So let me tell you what happened <eol> with Tracy Shapiro. <eob>
Remember that she had to tell <eol> everyone she knew <eob> about her interest in returning to work. <eob>
Well, one critical conversation <eol> with another parent in her community <eob> led to a job offer for Tracy, <eob> and it was an accounting job in a finance department. <eob>
But it was a temp job. <eob>
The company told her there was a possibility <eob> it could turn into something <eol> more, but no guarantees. <eob>
This was in the fall of 2011. <eob>
Tracy loved this company, <eol> and she loved the people <eob> and the office was less than 10 minutes <eol> from her house. <eob>
So even though she had a second job offer <eob> at another company <eol> for a permanent full-time role, <eob> she decided to take her chances <eol> with this internship <eob> and hope for the best. <eob>
Well, she ended up blowing away <eol> all of their expectations, <eob> and the company not only made her <eol> a permanent offer <eob> at the beginning of 2012, <eob> but they made it even more interesting <eol> and challenging, <eob> because they knew what Tracy <eol> could handle. <eob>
Fast forward to 2015, <eob> Tracy's been promoted. <eob>
They've paid for her to get her <eol> MBA at night. <eob>
She's even hired another <eol> relauncher to work for her. <eob>
Tracy's temp job was a tryout, <eob> just like an internship, <eob> and it ended up being a win <eol> for both Tracy and her employer. <eob>
Now, my goal is to bring the reentry <eol> internship concept <eob> to more and more employers. <eob>
But in the meantime, <eob> if you are returning to work <eol> after a career break, <eob> don't hesitate to suggest an internship <eol> or an internship-like arrangement <eob> to an employer that does not have <eol> a formal reentry internship program. <eob>
Be their first success story, <eob> and you can be the example <eol> for more relaunchers to come. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here are two reasons companies fail: <eob> they only do more of the same, <eob> or they only do what's new. <eob>
To me the real, real <eol> solution to quality growth <eob> is figuring out the balance <eol> between two activities: <eob> exploration and exploitation. <eob>
Both are necessary, <eob> but it can be too much of a good thing. <eob>
Consider Facit. <eob> I'm actually old enough to remember them. <eob>
Facit was a fantastic company. <eob>
They were born deep in the Swedish forest, <eob> and they made the best <eol> mechanical calculators in the world. <eob> Everybody used them. <eob> And what did Facit do when <eol> the electronic calculator came along? <eob>
They continued doing exactly the same. <eob>
In six months, they went <eol> from maximum revenue ... <eob> and they were gone. <eob> Gone. <eob>
To me, the irony about the Facit story <eob> is hearing about the Facit engineers, <eob> who had bought cheap, small <eol> electronic calculators in Japan <eob> that they used to double-check <eol> their calculators. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Facit did too much exploitation. <eob>
But exploration can go wild, too. <eob>
A few years back, <eob> I worked closely alongside <eol> a European biotech company. <eob>
Let's call them OncoSearch. <eob>
The company was brilliant. <eob>
They had applications that promised <eol> to diagnose, even cure, <eob> certain forms of blood cancer. <eob>
Every day was about <eol> creating something new. <eob>
They were extremely innovative, <eob> and the mantra was, <eol> "When we only get it right," <eob> or even, "We want it perfect." <eob> The sad thing is, <eob> before they became perfect -- <eob> even good enough -- <eob> they became obsolete. <eob>
OncoSearch did too much exploration. <eob>
I first heard about <eob> exploration and exploitation <eob> about 15 years ago, <eob> when I worked as a visiting <eol> scholar at Stanford University. <eob>
The founder of the idea is Jim March. <eob>
And to me the power of the idea <eol> is its practicality. <eob>
Exploration. <eob> Exploration is about <eol> coming up with what's new. <eob>
It's about search, <eob> it's about discovery, <eob> it's about new products, <eob> it's about new innovations. <eob>
It's about changing our frontiers. <eob>
Our heroes are people <eol> who have done exploration: <eob> Madame Curie, <eob> Picasso, <eob> Neil Armstrong, <eob> Sir Edmund Hillary, etc. <eob> I come from Norway; <eob> all our heroes are explorers, <eol> and they deserve to be. <eob>
We all know that exploration is risky. <eob>
We don't know the answers, <eob> we don't know if we're going to find them, <eob> and we know that the risks are high. <eob>
Exploitation is the opposite. <eob> Exploitation is taking <eol> the knowledge we have <eob> and making good, better. <eob>
Exploitation is about making <eol> our trains run on time. <eob>
It's about making good products <eol> faster and cheaper. <eob>
Exploitation is not risky -- <eob> in the short term. <eob>
But if we only exploit, <eob> it's very risky in the long term. <eob>
And I think we all have memories <eol> of the famous pop groups <eob> who keep singing the same songs <eol> again and again, <eob> until they become obsolete <eol> or even pathetic. <eob>
That's the risk of exploitation. <eob>
So if we take a long-term <eol> perspective, we explore. <eob>
If we take a short-term <eol> perspective, we exploit. <eob>
Small children, they explore all day. <eob>
All day it's about exploration. <eob>
As we grow older, <eob> we explore less because we have <eol> more knowledge to exploit on. <eob>
The same goes for companies. <eob>
Companies become, <eol> by nature, less innovative <eob> as they become more competent. <eob>
And this is, of course, <eol> a big worry to CEOs. <eob>
And I hear very often questions <eol> phrased in different ways. <eob> For example, <eob> "How can I both effectively run <eol> and reinvent my company?" <eob> Or, "How can I make sure <eob> that our company changes <eol> before we become obsolete <eob> or are hit by a crisis?" <eob> So, doing one well is difficult. <eob>
Doing both well as the same time is art — <eob> pushing both <eob> exploration and exploitation. <eob>
So one thing we've found <eob> is only about two percent of companies <eol> are able to effectively explore <eob> and exploit at the same time, in parallel. <eob>
But when they do, <eob> the payoffs are huge. <eob>
So we have lots of great examples. <eob>
We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, <eob> we have Lego going into animated films, <eob> Toyota creating the hybrids, <eob> Unilever pushing into sustainability -- <eob> there are lots of examples, <eol> and the benefits are huge. <eob>
Why is balancing so difficult? <eob>
I think it's difficult <eol> because there are so many traps <eob> that keep us where we are. <eob>
So I'll talk about two, <eol> but there are many. <eob>
So let's talk about <eol> the perpetual search trap. <eob>
We discover something, <eob> but we don't have the patience <eol> or the persistence <eob> to get at it and make it work. <eob>
So instead of staying with it, <eol> we create something new. <eob>
But the same goes for that, <eob> then we're in the vicious circle <eob> of actually coming up with ideas <eol> but being frustrated. <eob>
OncoSearch was a good example. <eob>
A famous example is, of course, Xerox. <eob>
But we don't only see this in companies. <eob>
We see this in the public sector as well. <eob>
We all know that any kind <eol> of effective reform of education, <eob> research, health care, even defense, <eob> takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work. <eob>
But still, we change much more often. <eob>
We really don't give them the chance. <eob>
Another trap is the success trap. <eob>
Facit fell into the success trap. <eob>
They literally held <eol> the future in their hands, <eob> but they couldn't see it. <eob>
They were simply so good <eol> at making what they loved doing, <eob> that they wouldn't change. <eob>
We are like that, too. <eob>
When we know something well, <eol> it's difficult to change. <eob>
Bill Gates has said: <eob> "Success is a lousy teacher. <eob>
It seduces us into thinking <eol> we cannot fail." <eob> That's the challenge with success. <eob>
So I think there are some lessons, <eol> and I think they apply to us. <eob> And they apply to our companies. <eob>
The first lesson is: <eol> get ahead of the crisis. <eob>
And any company that's able to innovate <eob> is actually able to also buy <eol> an insurance in the future. <eob>
Netflix -- they could so easily <eol> have been content <eob> with earlier generations of distribution, <eob> but they always -- and I think <eol> they will always -- <eob> keep pushing for the next battle. <eob>
I see other companies that say, <eob> "I'll win the next innovation cycle, <eol> whatever it takes." <eob>
Second one: think in multiple time scales. <eob>
I'll share a chart with you, <eob> and I think it's a wonderful one. <eob>
Any company we look at, <eob> taking a one-year perspective <eob> and looking at the valuation <eol> of the company, <eob> innovation typically accounts <eol> for only about 30 percent. <eob>
So when we think one year, <eob> innovation isn't really that important. <eob>
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective <eol> on the same company -- <eob> suddenly, innovation and ability <eol> to renew account for 70 percent. <eob>
But companies can't choose. <eob>
They need to fund the journey <eol> and lead the long term. <eob>
Third: <eob> invite talent. <eob> I don't think it's possible for any of us <eob> to be able to balance <eob> exploration and exploitation <eob> by ourselves. <eob>
I think it's a team sport. <eob>
I think we need to allow challenging. <eob>
I think the mark of a great company <eol> is being open to be challenged, <eob> and the mark of a good corporate board <eol> is to constructively challenge. <eob>
I think that's also what <eol> good parenting is about. <eob>
Last one: be skeptical of success. <eob>
Maybe it's useful to think back <eol> at the old triumph marches in Rome, <eob> when the generals, after a big victory, <eob> were given their celebration. <eob>
Riding into Rome on the carriage, <eob> they always had a companion <eol> whispering in their ear, <eob> "Remember, you're only human." <eob>
So I hope I made the point: <eob> balancing <eob> exploration and exploitation <eob> has a huge payoff. <eob>
But it's difficult, <eol> and we need to be conscious. <eob>
I want to just point out two questions <eol> that I think are useful. <eob>
First question is, <eol> looking at your own company: <eob> In which areas do you see <eol> that the company is at the risk <eob> of falling into success traps, <eob> of just going on autopilot? <eob>
And what can you do to challenge? <eob>
Second question is: <eob> When did I explore something new last, <eob> and what kind of effect did it have on me? <eob>
Is that something I should do more of? <eob>
In my case, yes. <eob> So let me leave you with this. <eob>
Whether you're an explorer by nature <eob> or whether you tend to exploit <eol> what you already know, <eob> don't forget: the beauty <eol> is in the balance. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So there are lands <eol> few and far between on Earth itself <eob> that are hospitable to humans <eol> by any measure, <eob> but survive we have. <eob>
Our primitive ancestors, when they found <eol> their homes and livelihood endangered, <eob> they dared to make their way <eol> into unfamiliar territories <eob> in search of better opportunities. <eob>
And as the descendants of these explorers, <eob> we have their nomadic blood <eol> coursing through our own veins. <eob>
But at the same time, <eob> distracted by our bread and circuses <eob> and embroiled in the wars <eol> that we have waged on each other, <eob> it seems that we have forgotten <eol> this desire to explore. <eob>
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely <eob> for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, <eob> and so content are we <eol> with our living conditions <eob> that we have grown complacent <eol> and just too busy <eob> to notice that its resources are finite, <eob> and that our Sun's life is also finite. <eob>
While Mars and all the movies <eol> made in its name <eob> have reinvigorated <eol> the ethos for space travel, <eob> few of us seem to truly realize <eol> that our species' fragile constitution <eob> is woefully unprepared <eol> for long duration journeys into space. <eob>
Let us take a trek <eol> to your local national forest <eob> for a quick reality check. <eob>
So just a quick show of hands here: <eob> how many of you think you would be able <eol> to survive in this lush wilderness <eob> for a few days? <eob> Well, that's a lot of you. <eob>
That's a decent amount. <eob> How about a few months? <eob> That's pretty good too. <eob>
Now, let us imagine <eol> that this local national forest <eob> experiences an eternal winter. <eob>
Same questions: how many of you think <eol> you would be able to survive <eob> for a few days? <eob> That's quite a lot. <eob> How about a few weeks? <eob>
So for a fun twist, let us imagine <eol> that the only source of water available <eob> is trapped as frozen blocks <eol> miles below the surface. <eob>
Soil nutrients are so minimal <eol> that no vegetation can be found, <eob> and of course hardly any atmosphere <eol> exists to speak of. <eob>
Such examples are only a few <eol> of the many challenges we would face <eob> on a planet like Mars. <eob>
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages <eol> whose destinations are so far removed <eob> from a tropical vacation? <eob>
Will we continuously ship supplies <eol> from Planet Earth? <eob>
Build space elevators, <eol> or impossible miles of transport belts <eob> that tether your planet of choice <eol> to our home planet? <eob>
And how do we grow things like food <eol> that grew up on Earth like us? <eob>
But I'm getting ahead of myself. <eob>
In our species' journey <eol> to find a new home under a new sun, <eob> we are more likely than not <eol> going to be spending much time <eob> in the journey itself, <eob> in space, <eob> on a ship, a hermetic flying can, <eob> possibly for many generations. <eob>
The longest continuous amount of time <eol> that any human has spent <eob> in space <eob> is in the vicinity <eol> of 12 to 14 months. <eob>
From astronauts' experiences <eob> in space, <eob> we know that spending time <eol> in a microgravity environment <eob> means bone loss, muscle atrophy, <eol> cardiovascular problems, <eob> among many other complications <eob> that range for the physiological <eol> to the psychological. <eob>
And what about macrogravity, <eob> or any other variation <eol> in gravitational pull <eob> of the planet that we find ourselves on? <eob>
In short, our cosmic voyages <eol> will be fraught with dangers <eob> both known and unknown. <eob>
So far we've been looking to this <eol> new piece of mechanical technology <eob> or that great next generation robot <eob> as part of a lineup to ensure <eol> our species safe passage in space. <eob>
Wonderful as they are, <eol> I believe the time has come <eob> for us to complement <eol> these bulky electronic giants <eob> with what nature has already invented: <eob> the microbe, <eob> a single-celled organism that is itself <eol> a self-generating, self-replenishing, <eob> living machine. <eob>
It requires fairly little to maintain, <eob> offers much flexibility in design <eob> and only asks to be carried <eol> in a single plastic tube. <eob>
The field of study that has enabled us <eol> to utilize the capabilities of the microbe <eob> is known as synthetic biology. <eob>
It comes from molecular biology, <eol> which has given us antibiotics, vaccines <eob> and better ways to observe <eol> the physiological nuances <eob> of the human body. <eob>
Using the tools of synthetic biology, <eob> we can now edit the genes <eol> of nearly any organism, <eob> microscopic or not, <eob> with incredible speed and fidelity. <eob>
Given the limitations <eol> of our man-made machines, <eob> synthetic biology will be a means for us <eol> to engineer not only our food, <eob> our fuel and our environment, <eob> but also ourselves <eob> to compensate <eol> for our physical inadequacies <eob> and to ensure our survival in space. <eob>
To give you an example <eob> of how we can use synthetic biology <eol> for space exploration, <eob> let us return to the Mars environment. <eob>
The Martian soil composition is similar <eol> to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, <eob> with trace amounts of organic material. <eob>
Let's say, hypothetically, <eob> what if martian soil <eol> could actually support plant growth <eob> without using Earth-derived nutrients? <eob>
The first question <eol> we should probably ask is, <eob> how would we make <eol> our plants cold-tolerant? <eob>
Because, on average, <eol> the temperature on Mars <eob> is a very uninviting <eol> negative 60 degrees centigrade. <eob> The next question we should ask is, <eob> how do we make <eol> our plants drought-tolerant? <eob>
Considering that most of the water <eol> that forms as frost <eob> evaporates more quickly <eol> than I can say the word "evaporate." <eob> Well, it turns out <eol> we've already done things like this. <eob>
By borrowing genes <eol> for anti-freeze protein from fish <eob> and genes for drought tolerance <eol> from other plants like rice <eob> and then stitching them <eol> into the plants that need them, <eob> we now have plants that can tolerate <eol> most droughts and freezes. <eob>
They're known on Earth as GMOs, <eob> or genetically modified organisms, <eob> and we rely on them to feed <eol> all the mouths of human civilization. <eob>
Nature does stuff like this already, <eob> without our help. <eob>
We have simply found <eol> more precise ways to do it. <eob>
So why would we want to change <eol> the genetic makeup of plants for space? <eob>
Well, to not do so <eol> would mean needing to engineer <eob> endless acres of land <eol> on an entirely new planet <eob> by releasing trillions of gallons <eol> of atmospheric gasses <eob> and then constructing <eol> a giant glass dome to contain it all. <eob>
It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise <eob> that quickly becomes <eol> a high-cost cargo transport mission. <eob>
One of the best ways to ensure <eob> that we will have the food supplies <eol> and the air that we need <eob> is to bring with us organisms <eol> that have been engineered <eob> to adapt to new and harsh environments. <eob>
In essence, using engineered organisms <eol> to help us terraform a planet <eob> both in the short and long term. <eob>
These organisms can then also <eol> be engineered to make medicine or fuel. <eob>
So we can use synthetic biology <eol> to bring highly engineered plants with us, <eob> but what else can we do? <eob>
Well, I mentioned earlier <eol> that we, as a species, <eob> were evolved uniquely for planet Earth. <eob>
That fact has not changed much <eol> in the last five minutes <eob> that you were sitting here <eol> and I was standing there. <eob>
And so, if we were to dump <eol> any of us on Mars right this minute, <eob> even given ample food, water, air <eob> and a suit, <eob> we are likely to experience <eol> very unpleasant health problems <eob> from the amount of ionizing radiation <eol> that bombards the surface <eob> of planets like Mars that have little <eol> or nonexistent atmosphere. <eob>
Unless we plan <eol> to stay holed up underground <eob> for the duration of our stay <eol> on every new planet, <eob> we must find better ways <eol> of protecting ourselves <eob> without needing to resort <eol> to wearing a suit of armor <eob> that weighs something <eol> equal to your own body weight, <eob> or needing to hide behind a wall of lead. <eob>
So let us appeal <eol> to nature for inspiration. <eob>
Among the plethora of life here on Earth, <eob> there's a subset of organisms <eol> known as extremophiles, <eob> or lovers of extreme living conditions, <eob> if you'll remember <eol> from high school biology. <eob>
And among these organisms is a bacterium <eol> by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans. <eob>
It is known to be able to withstand cold, <eol> dehydration, vacuum, acid, <eob> and, most notably, radiation. <eob>
While its radiation <eol> tolerance mechanisms are known, <eob> we have yet to adapt <eol> the relevant genes to mammals. <eob>
To do so is not particularly easy. <eob>
There are many facets <eol> that go into its radiation tolerance, <eob> and it's not as simple <eol> as transferring one gene. <eob>
But given a little bit of human ingenuity <eob> and a little bit of time, <eob> I think to do so is not very hard either. <eob>
Even if we borrow just a fraction <eol> of its ability to tolerate radiation, <eob> it would be infinitely better <eol> than what we already have, <eob> which is just the melanin in our skin. <eob>
Using the tools of synthetic biology, <eob> we can harness Deinococcus <eol> radiodurans' ability <eob> to thrive under otherwise <eol> very lethal doses of radiation. <eob>
As difficult as it is to see, <eob> homo sapiens, that is humans, <eob> evolves every day, <eob> and still continues to evolve. <eob>
Thousands of years of human evolution <eob> has not only given us <eol> humans like Tibetans, <eob> who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, <eob> but also Argentinians, <eol> who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, <eob> the chemical element <eol> that can kill the average human being. <eob>
Every day, the human body evolves <eol> by accidental mutations <eob> that equally accidentally <eol> allow certain humans <eob> to persevere in dismal situations. <eob>
But, and this is a big but, <eob> such evolution requires two things <eol> that we may not always have, <eob> or be able to afford, <eob> and they are death and time. <eob>
In our species' struggle <eol> to find our place in the universe, <eob> we may not always have the time necessary <eob> for the natural evolution <eol> of extra functions <eob> for survival on non-Earth planets. <eob>
We're living in what E.O. Wilson <eol> has termed the age of gene circumvention, <eob> during which we remedy our genetic defects <eol> like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy <eob> with temporary external supplements. <eob>
But with every passing day, <eob> we approach the age <eol> of volitional evolution, <eob> a time during which we as a species <eob> will have the capacity to decide <eol> for ourselves our own genetic destiny. <eob>
Augmenting the human body <eol> with new abilities <eob> is no longer a question of how, <eob> but of when. <eob>
Using synthetic biology <eob> to change the genetic makeup <eol> of any living organisms, <eob> especially our own, <eob> is not without its moral <eol> and ethical quandaries. <eob>
Will engineering ourselves <eol> make us less human? <eob>
But then again, what is humanity <eob> but star stuff <eol> that happens to be conscious? <eob>
Where should human genius direct itself? <eob>
Surely it is a bit of a waste <eol> to sit back and marvel at it. <eob>
How do we use our knowledge <eob> to protect ourselves <eol> from the external dangers <eob> and then protect ourselves from ourselves? <eob>
I pose these questions <eob> not to engender the fear of science <eob> but to bring to light <eol> the many possibilities <eob> that science has afforded <eol> and continues to afford us. <eob>
We must coalesce as humans <eol> to discuss and embrace the solutions <eob> not only with caution <eob> but also with courage. <eob>
Mars is a destination, <eob> but it will not be our last. <eob>
Our true final frontier <eol> is the line we must cross <eob> in deciding what we can and should make <eol> of our species' improbable intelligence. <eob>
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving. <eob>
Our path to the stars <eol> will be rife with trials <eob> that will bring us to question <eol> not only who we are <eob> but where we will be going. <eob>
The answers will lie in our choice <eol> to use or abandon the technology <eob> that we have gleaned from life itself, <eob> and it will define us for the remainder <eol> of our term in this universe. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
OK, so, confession: <eob> I've always been weirdly <eol> obsessed with advertising. <eob>
I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, <eob> paying more attention <eol> to the commercials <eob> than to the shows, <eob> trying to figure out how they were trying <eol> to get inside my head. <eob>
Ultimately, that led me to my dream job. <eob>
I became a partner at a big New York ad agency. <eob>
But then, all of that suddenly <eol> changed on February 23, 1997, <eob> when my little brother Matt was shot in the head <eob> in a shooting <eol> that happened on the observation deck <eob> of the Empire State Building. <eob>
Suddenly, my family was thrown <eol> into the middle of a nightmare, <eob> being told that my brother was going to die, <eob> actually being given the opportunity <eol> to say goodbye to him, <eob> then several emergency brain surgeries <eob> and now what's amounted, for Matt, <eob> to a lifetime spent courageously recovering <eol> from a traumatic brain injury. <eob>
He is definitely my hero. <eob>
But as much as (Applause) <eol> — yeah, deserves it — <eob>
But as much as this tragedy <eol> was a nightmare for my family, <eob> I often think about how much worse <eol> it could have been; <eob> in fact, how much worse it is <eol> for the 90 families every day <eob> who aren't as fortunate, <eob> who lose loved ones -- brothers, <eol> sisters, sons, daughters, parents. <eob>
They don't all make national headlines. <eob>
In fact, most of them don't. <eob>
They go largely unnoticed, <eob> in a nation that's kind of come <eol> to accept a disgraceful national epidemic <eob> as some kind of new normal. <eob>
So I quit my job in advertising <eob> to try and do something <eol> about this disgraceful national epidemic, <eob> because I came to realize <eob> that the challenges <eol> to preventing gun violence <eob> are actually the same ones <eol> that made me love advertising, <eob> which is to try to figure out <eol> how to engage people. <eob>
Only instead of doing it to sell products, <eob> doing it to save lives. <eob>
And that comes down <eol> to finding common ground, <eob> where what I want overlaps <eol> with what you want. <eob>
And you might be surprised to learn, <eol> when it comes to gun violence, <eob> just how much common ground there is. <eob>
Let's look, for example, <eol> at people who love to hunt, <eob> a sport enjoyed by millions <eol> across the US. <eob>
It's a proud tradition. Families. <eob> In some places, <eob> the first day of hunting season <eol> is actually a school holiday. <eob>
What do hunters want? <eob> Well, they want to hunt. <eol> They love their guns. <eob>
They believe deeply <eob> in the Second Amendment <eol> right to own those guns. <eob>
But that doesn't mean <eol> there isn't common ground. <eob>
In fact, there's a lot of it, <eob> starting with the basic idea <eol> of keeping guns out of dangerous hands. <eob>
This isn't about taking certain guns <eol> away from all people. <eob> It's about keeping all guns away <eol> from certain people, <eob> and it's the people that, it turns out, <eol> we all agree shouldn't have guns: <eob> convicted violent criminals, <eol> domestic abusers, <eob> the dangerously mentally ill. <eob>
We can all appreciate <eob> how Brady background checks <eol> have been incredibly effective <eob> in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands. <eob>
In 20 years, Brady background checks <eol> at federally licensed firearm dealers <eob> have blocked 2.4 million gun sales <eob> to those people that we all agree <eol> shouldn't have guns. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And whether you love guns or hate guns, <eol> you probably also appreciate <eob> that there shouldn't be <eol> thousands of gun sales every day <eob> at guns shows or online <eob> without those Brady background checks, <eob> just like there shouldn't be <eol> two lines to get on an airplane — <eob> one with security <eol> and one with no security. <eob> And — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And the numbers show the overwhelming <eol> agreement among the American public: <eob> 90 percent of Americans support expanding <eol> Brady background checks <eob> to all gun sales -- including <eol> 90 percent of Republicans, <eob> more than 80 percent of gun owners, <eob> more than 70 percent of NRA members. <eob>
This is not a controversial idea. <eob>
In fact, only six percent of the American <eol> public disagrees. <eob>
That's about the percentage <eol> of the American public <eob> that believes the moon <eol> landing was a fake. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it's also about the percentage <eol> that believes the government <eob> is putting mind-controlling technology <eol> in our TV broadcast signals. <eob>
That's the extent to which we agree <eol> about background checks. <eob>
But what about the 300 million guns <eob> already out there in homes across America? <eob>
Well first, it's important to realize <eob> that those guns are mostly in the hands <eol> and homes <eob> of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, <eob> who want what we all want -- <eol> including keeping our families safe. <eob>
In fact, that's why more and more people <eol> are choosing to own guns. <eob>
Ten years ago, 42 percent <eol> of the American public <eob> believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun <eol> makes your home safer. <eob>
Today, that number is 63 percent. <eob>
Why? <eob> I kind of hate to say it, <eob> because it gets to the dark <eol> underbelly of advertising, <eob> which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, <eob> eventually that lie becomes the truth. <eob>
And that's exactly what's happened here. <eob>
The corporate gun lobby <eol> has spent billions of dollars <eob> blocking the CDC from doing research <eol> into the public health epidemic <eob> of gun violence; <eob> blocking pediatricians <eol> from talking to parents <eob> about the dangers of guns in the home; <eob> blocking smart-gun technology and other technology <eob> that would prevent kids <eol> from firing parents' guns <eob> and would save lives. <eob>
They're desperate to hide the truth, <eob> because they view the truth <eol> as a threat to their bottom line. <eob>
And every day, <eob> people are dying as a result. <eob>
And a lot of those people are children. <eob>
Every day in the US, <eob> nine kids are just shot unintentionally. <eob>
900 children and teens take <eol> their own lives every year. <eob>
And here's the thing: <eol> they're almost all with a parent's gun. <eob>
Even two-thirds of school shootings <eol> happen with a gun taken from the home, <eob> including the terrible tragedy <eob> at Sandy Hook. <eob>
I meet so many of these parents; <eob> it's the most heartbreaking <eol> part of my job. <eob>
These are not bad people. <eob>
They're just living with the unimaginable <eol> consequences of a very bad decision, <eob> made based on very bad information <eob> that was put into their minds <eol> by very bad people, <eob> who know good and well the misery <eol> that they're causing, <eob> but just don't care. <eob>
And the result is a nightmare -- <eob> not only for families like mine, <eob> but for, really, at the end <eol> of the day, all of us. <eob>
But I'm not here <eol> to talk about the nightmare <eob> of gun violence. <eob>
I'm here to talk about our dream, <eol> and it's a dream we all share, <eob> which is the dream of a better, <eol> safer, future. <eob>
For my organization, for the Brady Campaign, <eob> that dream is reflected <eol> in the bold goal <eob> to cut the number of gun deaths <eol> in the US in half by 2025. <eob>
And I hope to leave <eol> all of you here tonight <eob> with a strong sense of exactly <eol> why that dream is so absolutely within reach. <eob>
Because folks, <eob> for every great movement <eol> around the world, <eob> there's a moment where you can look back and say, <eob> "That's when things <eol> really started to change." <eob> And I'm here to say <eob> that for the movement to end <eol> gun violence in America, <eob> that moment is here. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We are so clearly at a tipping point, <eob> because the American public <eol> has come together by the millions <eob> like never before, <eol> based on that common ground, <eob> to say, "Enough." <eob> Enough of the mass shootings <eol> in malls and movie theaters <eob> and churches and schools. <eob>
Enough of the daily terror <eob> of gun violence <eob> in homes and streets <eob> that's claimed the lives of women <eol> and young black men <eob> in staggering proportions. <eob>
Enough of easy access to guns <eob> by the people that we all agree <eol> shouldn't have them. <eob>
And enough of a small group <eol> of craven politicians <eob> putting the interests <eol> of the corporate gun lobby <eob> ahead of the people they have been elected <eol> to represent. <eob> Enough. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And the really exciting thing is, it's not <eol> just the usual suspects like me <eob> that are saying it anymore. <eob>
It's so much bigger than that. <eob>
And if you want proof, <eob> let's start where most conversations <eol> in the US seem to start — <eob> with Kim Kardashian. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And here's the thing: <eol> it's not really a joke. <eob>
I mean, think about when issues change. <eob> It's when they go <eol> from being political and advocacy issues <eob> to being part of pop culture, <eob> voices coming from everywhere, <eol> celebrities using their platforms, <eob> musicians, athletes. <eob>
The NBA has come forward. <eob>
Conservative pundits <eol> that you never would have imagined <eob> have come forward. <eob>
There's real cultural change -- <eob> I even hear there's a TED Talk <eol> about it this year. <eob>
That's the extent to which this <eol> cultural change is happening. <eob>
And yes, Kim Kardashian <eol> has made an unsolicited passionate appeal <eob> to her 35 million Twitter followers <eob> for expanded background checks. <eob>
Let's look at the political elections <eol> that are heating up. <eob> This used to be the classic third-rail issue <eol> for Democrats. <eob>
Couldn't run from it fast enough. <eob>
Now candidates are running on it. <eob>
Some are being forced <eol> to reverse very bad positions <eob> they defended very comfortably, <eol> until very recently. <eob>
For somebody like me, <eob> watching people wave <eol> around their negative NRA ratings -- <eob> it's almost surreal to watch. <eob>
We're still outfunded, yes, <eol> by the corporate gun lobby, <eob> and ultimately that needs to change. <eob>
But you know what? <eob>
We're smarter and we're scrappier, <eol> and we have the truth on our side. <eob>
And we're on offense. <eob>
You know, they say that <eol> the Internet democratizes information. <eob>
Social media and some of the organizing <eol> tools that plug into it <eob> have democratized activism. <eob>
It's allowed us to show what 90 percent <eol> support really looks like. <eob>
Sometimes I think of it -- <eob> you know, we're converging <eol> and attacking instantly by the millions, <eob> kind of like white blood cells. <eob>
It's enabled us to start to really close -- <eol> and this is the bottom line -- <eob> close that disgraceful disconnect <eob> between what the American public wants <eob> and what our elected leaders <eol> are doing about it. <eob>
Until recently, <eob> the narrative in Congress <eol> was that calls from the other side, <eob> from that six percent, <eob> outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one. <eob> We're flipping that narrative on its head. <eob> After that recent terrible tragedy <eol> in San Bernardino, <eob> we jammed Congressional switchboards. <eob>
We put 15,000 calls into Congress <eol> in 24 hours. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
We got a vote on a bill <eob> that nobody thought was going <eol> to see the light of day anytime soon. <eob>
We're seeing real movement <eol> to repeal some of the most evil, <eob> ugly gun lobby legislation <eol> passed over the last dark decade. <eob>
The stranglehold of the gun lobby <eol> is clearly being broken. <eob>
We've seen President Obama's <eol> historic executive actions. <eob>
They don't go all the way, <eob> but they are going to save lives, <eob> because they expand Brady background checks <eob> to thousands of gun sales <eol> that didn't have them previously. <eob>
And we're marching across the country -- <eol> we're not just waiting <eob> for Congress to act; that would almost <eol> be the definition of insanity. <eob>
We're marching across the country, <eob> state by state, marriage-equality style. <eob>
And you know what? <eob> We're winning. <eob> Congress is almost always the last <eol> to wake up and realize <eob> that it's on the wrong side of history. <eob>
And when they do, it's always because <eol> the American public shakes them. <eob>
And that's exactly <eol> what we're doing right now, <eob> as we're in this tipping point. <eob>
You know, recently I was flying <eol> cross-country to give a speech <eob> to a large group like this, <eol> although far less intimidating, <eob> and the woman sitting next to me <eol> happened to be binge-watching <eob> one of my all-time favorite TV shows, <eol> "Mad Men," <eob> a period TV show about advertising <eob> in the 1960s. <eob>
And as I was trying to think <eol> about how to end my remarks, <eob> I'd glance up at her screen every now and then, <eob> and it seemed that every time I did, <eob> I'd see somebody smoking <eol> in an office or around children <eob> or while pregnant or drinking <eol> and driving <eob> or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker. <eob>
And ultimately it dawned on me: <eob> what tremendous inspiration <eob> to those of us who have this dream <eol> to end gun violence. <eob>
I mean, think about how much <eol> the world has changed <eob> in a relatively short period of time, <eob> how all those behaviors <eol> that were once considered commonplace or normal -- <eob> some even glamorous or sexy -- <eob> have become stigmatized <eol> in just a generation or two, <eob> once they became conversations <eol> about our common ground. <eob>
That is the magnitude of the change <eol> we have the potential to create <eob> around gun violence. <eob>
And that's my dream, <eob> that maybe someday, <eob> some period TV show will depict <eol> the terrible nightmare <eob> of gun violence, <eob> and a future generation of children <eol> might only be able to imagine <eob> how terrible it must have been. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So, there's an actor called <eol> Dustin Hoffman. <eob>
And years ago, he made this movie <eol> which some of you may have heard of, <eob> called "The Graduate." <eob> And there's two key scenes in that movie. <eob>
The first one is the seduction scene. <eob>
I'm not going to talk about that tonight. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The second scene is where he's taken <eol> out by the old guy to the pool, <eob> and as a young college graduate, <eol> the old guy basically says one word, <eob> just one word. <eob>
And of course, all of you know <eol> what that word is. <eob>
It's "plastics." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And the only problem with that is, <eol> it was completely the wrong advice. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let me tell you why it was so wrong. <eob>
The word should have been "silicon." <eob> And the reason <eol> it should have been silicon <eob> is because the basic patents for semiconductors <eol> had already been made, <eob> had already been filed, <eob> and they were already building them. <eob>
So Silicon Valley was just <eol> being built in 1967, <eob> when this movie was released. <eob>
And the year after the movie was released, <eob> Intel was founded. <eob>
So had the graduate heard <eol> the right one word, <eob> maybe he would have ended up onstage -- <eol> oh, I don't know -- <eob> maybe with these two. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So as you're thinking of that, <eob> let's see what bit of advice <eol> we might want to give <eob> so that your next graduate <eol> doesn't become a Tupperware salesman. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So in 2015, what word of advice <eol> would you give people, <eob> when you took a college graduate <eol> out by the pool <eob> and you said one word, <eob> just one word? <eob>
I think the answer would be "lifecode." <eob> So what is "lifecode?" <eob> Lifecode is the various ways <eol> we have of programming life. <eob>
So instead of programming computers, <eob> we're using things <eol> to program viruses <eob> or retroviruses or proteins <eob> or DNA or RNA <eob> or plants or animals, <eol> or a whole series of creatures. <eob>
And as you're thinking <eol> about this incredible ability <eob> to make life do <eol> what you want it to do, <eob> what it's programmed to do, <eob> what you end up doing <eob> is taking what we've been doing <eol> for thousands of years, <eob> which is breeding, changing, <eob> mixing, matching <eob> all kinds of life-forms, <eob> and we accelerate it. <eob>
And this is not something new. <eob>
This humble mustard weed has been modified <eob> so that if you change it in one way, <eol> you get broccoli. <eob> And if you change it in a second way, <eol> you get kale. <eob> And if you change it in a third way, <eob> you get cauliflower. <eob>
So when you go to these all-natural, <eol> organic markets, <eob> you're really going to a place <eob> where people have been changing <eol> the lifecode of plants for a long time. <eob>
The difference today, <eob> to pick a completely politically neutral term -- <eob>
[Intelligent design] <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We're beginning to practice <eol> intelligent design. <eob>
That means that instead of doing this at random <eob> and seeing what happens over generations, <eob> we're inserting specific genes, <eol> we're inserting specific proteins, <eob> and we're changing lifecode <eol> for very deliberate purposes. <eob>
And that allows us to accelerate <eol> how this stuff happens. <eob>
Let me just give you one example. <eob>
Some of you occasionally <eol> might think about sex. <eob>
And we kind of take it for granted <eol> how we've changed sex. <eob>
So we think it's perfectly normal <eol> and natural to change it. <eob>
What's happened with sex over time is -- <eob> normally, sex equals baby, eventually. <eob>
But in today's world, <eob> sex plus pill equals no baby. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And again, we think <eol> that's perfectly normal and natural, <eob> but that has not been the case <eol> for most of human history. <eob>
And it's not the case for animals. <eob>
What it is does is it gives us control, <eob> so sex becomes separate from conception. <eob>
And as you're thinking <eol> of the consequences of that, <eob> then we've been playing with stuff <eob> that's a little bit more advanced, like art. <eob> Not in the sense of painting <eol> and sculpture, <eob> but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies. <eob>
So what are assisted reproductive <eol> technologies? <eob>
Assisted reproductive technologies <eol> are things like in vitro fertilization. <eob>
And when you do in vitro fertilization, <eol> there's very good reasons to do it. <eob>
Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise. <eob>
But when you do that, <eob> what you ’ re doing <eol> is separating sex, conception, baby. <eob>
So you haven't just taken control <eol> of when you have a baby, <eob> you've separated when the baby <eol> and where the baby is fertilized. <eob>
So you've separated the baby <eob> from the body from the act. <eob>
And as you're thinking of other <eol> things we've been doing, <eob> think about twins. <eob>
So you can freeze sperm, <eol> you can freeze eggs, <eob> you can freeze fertilized eggs. <eob>
And what does that mean? <eob>
Well, that's a good thing <eol> if you're a cancer patient. <eob>
You're about to go <eol> under chemotherapy or under radiation, <eob> so you save these things. <eob>
You don't irradiate them. <eob>
But if you can save them <eol> and you can freeze them, <eob> and you can have a surrogate mother, <eob> it means that you've decoupled sex from time. <eob>
It means you can have twins born -- <eol> oh, in 50 years? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In a hundred years? <eob> Two hundred years? <eob> And these are three really profound changes <eob> that are not, like, future stuff. <eob> This is stuff we take <eol> for granted today. <eob>
So this lifecode stuff turns out <eol> to be a superpower. <eob>
It turns out to be this incredibly <eol> powerful way of changing viruses, <eob> of changing plants, <eol> of changing animals, <eob> perhaps even of evolving ourselves. <eob>
It's something that Steve Gullans <eol> and I have been thinking about for a while. <eob>
Let's have some risks. <eob> Like every powerful technology, <eol> like electricity, like an automobile, <eob> like computers, this stuff potentially <eol> can be misused. <eob>
And that scares a lot of people. <eob>
And as you apply these technologies, <eob> you can even turn human beings <eol> into chimeras. <eob>
Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals? <eob>
Well, some of these treatments <eob> actually end up changing your blood type. <eob> Or they'll put male cells in a female body <eol> or vice versa, <eob> which sounds absolutely horrible <eob> until you realize, the reason you're doing that <eob> is you're substituting bone marrow <eol> during cancer treatments. <eob>
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow, <eob> you may be changing some <eol> fundamental aspects of yourself, <eob> but you're also saving your life. <eob>
And as you're thinking about this stuff, <eob> here's something that happened <eol> 20 years ago. <eob>
This is Emma Ott. <eob> She's a recent college admittee. <eob> She's studying accounting. <eob>
She played two varsity sports. <eob>
She graduated as a valedictorian. <eob>
And that's not particularly extraordinary, <eob> except that she's the first human being born <eol> to three parents. <eob> Why? <eob> Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease <eob> that she might have inherited. <eob>
So when you swap out a third person's DNA <eob> and you put it in there, <eob> you save the lives of people. <eob>
But you also are doing germline engineering, <eob> which means her kids, <eol> if she has kids, will be saved <eob> and won't go through this. <eob>
And [their] kids will be saved, <eob> and their grandchildren will be saved, <eob> and this passes on. <eob>
That makes people nervous. <eob> So 20 years ago, <eol> the various authorities said, <eob> why don't we study <eol> this for a while? <eob>
There are risks to doing stuff, <eol> and there are risks to not doing stuff, <eob> because there were a couple dozen <eol> people saved by this technology, <eob> and then we've been thinking about it <eol> for the next 20 years. <eob>
So as we think about it, <eob> as we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies, <eob> maybe we should do this, <eol> maybe we should do that," <eob> there are consequences to acting, <eol> and there are consequences to not acting. <eob>
Like curing deadly diseases -- <eob> which, by the way, <eol> is completely unnatural. <eob>
It is normal and natural <eol> for humans to be felled <eob> by massive epidemics of polio, <eol> of smallpox, of tuberculosis. <eob>
When we put vaccines into people, <eol> we are putting unnatural things <eob> into their body <eob> because we think the benefit outweighs the risk. <eob>
Because we've built unnatural plants, <eol> unnatural animals, <eob> we can feed about seven billion people. <eob>
We can do things like create <eol> new life-forms. <eob>
And as you create new life-forms, again, <eol> that sounds terribly scary <eob> and terribly bothersome, <eob> until you realize that those life-forms live <eol> on your dining room table. <eob>
Those flowers you've got <eol> on your dining room table -- <eob> there's not a lot that's natural about them, <eob> because people have been breeding <eol> the flowers to make this color, <eob> to be this size, to last for a week. <eob>
You don't usually give <eol> your loved one wildflowers <eob> because they don't last a whole lot of time. <eob>
What all this does <eob> is it flips Darwin completely on his head. <eob>
See, for four billion years, <eob> what lived and died <eol> on this planet depended on two principles: <eob> on natural selection and random mutation. <eob>
And so what lived and died, <eol> what was structured, <eob> has now been flipped on its head. <eob>
And what we've done <eob> is created this completely parallel <eol> evolutionary system <eob> where we are practicing unnatural selection <eol> and non-random mutation. <eob>
So let me explain these things. <eob> This is natural selection. <eob>
This is unnatural selection. <eob>
So what happens with this stuff is, <eob> we started breeding wolves <eol> thousands of years ago <eob> in central Asia to turn them into dogs. <eob>
And then we started turning them <eol> into big dogs <eob> and into little dogs. <eob>
But if you take one of the chihuahuas <eob> you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue <eob> and you let it loose on the African plain, <eob> you can watch natural selection happen. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Few things on Earth are less natural <eol> than a cornfield. <eob>
You will never, under any scenario, <eol> walk through a virgin forest <eob> and see the same plant <eol> growing in orderly rows <eob> at the same time, <eob> nothing else living there. <eob>
When you do a cornfield, <eob> you're selecting what lives <eol> and what dies. <eob> And you're doing that through <eol> unnatural selection. <eob>
It's the same with a wheat field, <eol> it's the same with a rice field. <eob>
It's the same with a city, <eol> it's the same with a suburb. <eob>
In fact, half the surface of Earth <eob> has been unnaturally engineered <eob> so that what lives and what dies <eol> there is what we want, <eob> which is the reason why you <eol> don't have grizzly bears <eob> walking through downtown Manhattan. <eob>
How about this random mutation stuff? <eob>
Well, this is random mutation. <eob> This is Antonio Alfonseca. <eob> He's otherwise known as the Octopus, <eol> his nickname. <eob>
He was the Relief Pitcher <eol> of the Year in 2000. <eob>
And he had a random mutation <eol> that gave him six fingers <eob> on each hand, <eob> which turns out to be really useful <eol> if you're a pitcher. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How about non-random mutation? <eob> A non-random mutation is beer. <eob> It's wine. It's yogurt. <eob> How many times have you walked <eol> through the forest <eob> and found all-natural cheese? <eob> Or all-natural yogurt? <eob> So we've been engineering this stuff. <eob>
Now, the interesting thing is, <eob> we get to know the stuff better. <eob>
We found one of the single <eol> most powerful gene-editing instruments, <eob> CRISPR, inside yogurt. <eob>
And as we start engineering cells, <eob> we're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products, <eob> including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis, <eob> which is the number one best-selling <eol> drug, Humira. <eob>
So this lifecode stuff. <eob> It really is a superpower. <eob>
It really is a way of programming stuff, <eob> and there's nothing <eol> that's going to change us <eob> more than this lifecode. <eob>
So as you're thinking of lifecode, <eob> let's think of five principles <eob> as to how we start guiding, <eob> and I'd love you to give me more. <eob>
So, principle number one: <eob> we have to take responsibility <eol> for this stuff. <eob>
The reason we have to take responsibility <eob> is because we're in charge. <eob>
These aren't random mutations. <eob>
This is what we are doing, <eol> what we are choosing. <eob>
It's not, "Stuff happened." <eob> It didn't happen at random. <eob>
It didn't come down by a verdict <eol> of somebody else. <eob>
We engineer this stuff, <eob> and it's the Pottery Barn rule: <eol> you break it, you own it. <eob>
Principle number two: <eob> we have to recognize and celebrate <eol> diversity in this stuff. <eob>
There have been at least 33 versions <eol> of hominids <eob> that have walked around this Earth. <eob>
Most all of them went extinct except us. <eob>
But the normal and natural state of this Earth <eob> is we have various versions <eol> of humans walking around <eob> at the same time, <eob> which is why most of us have <eol> some Neanderthal in us. <eob>
Some of us have some Denisova in us. <eob>
And some in Washington have <eol> a lot more of it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Principle number three: <eob> we have to respect other people's choices. <eob> Some people will choose to never alter. <eob>
Some people will choose to alter all. <eob> Some people will choose <eol> to alter plants but not animals. <eob> Some people will choose to alter themselves. <eob> Some people will choose <eol> to evolve themselves. <eob>
Diversity is not a bad thing, <eob> because even though we think <eol> of humans as very diverse, <eob> we came so close to extinction <eob> that all of us descend <eol> from a single African mother <eob> and the consequence of that <eob> is there's more genetic diversity <eol> in 55 African chimpanzees <eob> than there are in seven billion humans. <eob>
Principle number four: <eob> we should take about <eol> a quarter of the Earth <eob> and only let Darwin run the show there. <eob>
It doesn't have to be contiguous, <eob> doesn't have to all be tied together. <eob>
It should be part <eol> in the oceans, part on land. <eob>
But we should not run <eol> every evolutionary decision on this planet. <eob>
We want to have <eol> our evolutionary system running. <eob>
We want to have Darwin's evolutionary <eol> system running. <eob>
And it's just really important to have <eol> these two things running in parallel <eob> and not overwhelm evolution. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Last thing I'll say. <eob> This is the single most exciting adventure <eol> human beings have been on. <eob>
This is the single greatest <eol> superpower humans have ever had. <eob>
It would be a crime for you not <eol> to participate in this stuff <eob> because you're scared of it, <eob> because you're hiding from it. <eob>
You can participate in the ethics. <eol> You can participate in the politics. <eob>
You can participate in the business. <eob>
You can participate in just thinking <eol> about where medicine is going, <eob> where industry is going, <eob> where we're going to take the world. <eob>
It would be a crime for all of us <eob> not to be aware when somebody <eol> shows up at a swimming pool <eob> and says one word, <eob> just one word, <eob> if you don't listen if that word is "lifecode." <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
Seven years ago, a student came to me <eol> and asked me to invest in his company. <eob>
He said, "I'm working <eol> with three friends, <eob> and we're going to try to disrupt <eol> an industry by selling stuff online." <eob> And I said, "OK, you guys <eol> spent the whole summer on this, right?" <eob> "No, we all took internships <eol> just in case it doesn't work out." <eob> "All right, but you're going to go in full time <eol> once you graduate." <eob> "Not exactly. <eob>
We've all lined up backup jobs. <eob> "Six months go by, <eob> it's the day before the company launches, <eob> and there is still not a functioning website." <eob> You guys realize, the entire company <eol> is a website. <eob>
That's literally all it is." <eob> So I obviously declined to invest. <eob>
And they ended up naming <eol> the company Warby Parker. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> They sell glasses online. <eob>
They were recently recognized <eol> as the world's most innovative company <eob> and valued at over a billion dollars. <eob> And now? My wife handles our investments. <eob>
Why was I so wrong? <eob>
To find out, I've been studying people <eol> that I come to call "originals." <eob> Originals are nonconformists, <eob> people who not only have new ideas <eob> but take action to champion them. <eob>
They are people <eol> who stand out and speak up. <eob>
Originals drive creativity <eol> and change in the world. <eob>
They're the people you want to bet on. <eob>
And they look nothing like I expected. <eob>
I want to show you today three things <eol> I've learned <eob> about recognizing originals <eob> and becoming a little bit more like them. <eob>
So the first reason <eol> that I passed on Warby Parker <eob> was they were really slow <eol> getting off the ground. <eob>
Now, you are all intimately familiar <eol> with the mind of a procrastinator. <eob>
Well, I have a confession for you. <eob>
I'm the opposite. <eob>
I'm a precrastinator. <eob>
Yes, that's an actual term. <eob>
You know that panic you feel <eol> a few hours before a big deadline <eob> when you haven't done anything yet. <eob>
I just feel <eol> that a few months ahead of time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this started early: when I was a kid, <eol> I took Nintendo games very seriously. <eob>
I would wake up at 5am, <eob> start playing and not stop <eol> until I had mastered them. <eob>
Eventually it got so out of hand <eol> that a local newspaper came <eob> and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. <eob> But this served me well in college, <eob> because I finished my senior <eol> thesis four months before the deadline. <eob>
And I was proud of that, <eol> until a few years ago. <eob>
I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said, <eob> "I have my most creative ideas <eol> when I'm procrastinating." <eob> And I was like, "That's cute, <eol> where are the four papers you owe me?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, she was one of our most <eol> creative students, <eob> and as an organizational psychologist, <eol> this is the kind of idea that I test. <eob>
So I challenged her to get some data. <eob>
She goes into a bunch of companies. <eob> She has people fill out surveys <eol> about how often they procrastinate. <eob>
Then she gets their bosses to rate <eol> how creative and innovative they are. <eob>
And sure enough, <eol> the precrastinators like me, <eob> who rush in and do everything early <eob> are rated as less creative <eob> than people who procrastinate moderately. <eob>
So I want to know what happens <eol> to the chronic procrastinators. <eob>
She was like, "I don't know. <eob>
They didn't fill out my survey. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, here are our results. <eob> You actually do see that the people <eol> who wait until the last minute <eob> are so busy goofing off that <eol> they don't have any new ideas. <eob>
And on the flip side, <eol> the people who race in <eob> are in such a frenzy of anxiety <eol> that they don't have original thoughts either. <eob>
There's a sweet spot <eol> where originals seem to live. <eob> Why is this? <eob> Maybe original people just have bad work habits. <eob> Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity. <eob>
To find out, we designed some experiments. <eob>
We asked people <eol> to generate new business ideas, <eob> and then we get independent readers <eob> to evaluate how creative and useful <eol> they are. <eob>
And some of them are asked to do <eol> the task right away. <eob>
Others we randomly assign to procrastinate <eob> by dangling Minesweeper in front of them <eob> for either five or 10 minutes. <eob>
And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators <eob> are 16 percent more creative <eol> than the other two groups. <eob>
Now, Minesweeper is awesome, <eol> but it's not the driver of the effect, <eob> because if you play the game <eol> first before you learn about the task, <eob> there's no creativity boost. <eob>
It's only when you're told that <eol> you're going to be working on this problem, <eob> and then you start procrastinating, <eob> but the task is still active <eol> in the back of your mind, <eob> that you start to incubate. <eob>
Procrastination gives you time <eol> to consider divergent ideas, <eob> to think in nonlinear ways, <eol> to make unexpected leaps. <eob>
So just as we were finishing <eol> these experiments, <eob> I was starting to write <eol> a book about originals, <eob> and I thought, "This is the perfect time <eol> to teach myself to procrastinate, <eob> while writing a chapter <eol> on procrastination." <eob> So I metaprocrastinated, <eob> and like any self-respecting precrastinator, <eob> I woke up early the next morning <eob> and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I worked diligently <eob> toward my goal of not making <eol> progress toward my goal. <eob>
I started writing the procrastination chapter, <eob> and one day -- I was halfway through -- <eob> I literally put it away in mid-sentence <eob> for months. <eob> It was agony. <eob> But when I came back to it, <eol> I had all sorts of new ideas. <eob>
As Aaron Sorkin put it, <eob> "You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking." <eob> And along the way I discovered <eob> that a lot of great originals in history <eol> were procrastinators. <eob>
Take Leonardo da Vinci. <eob>
He toiled on and off for 16 years <eob> on the Mona Lisa. <eob>
He felt like a failure. <eob>
He wrote as much in his journal. <eob>
But some of the diversions he took in optics <eob> transformed the way <eol> that he modeled light <eob> and made him into a much better painter. <eob>
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? <eob>
The night before the biggest <eol> speech of his life, <eob> the March on Washington, <eob> he was up past 3am, rewriting it. <eob>
He's sitting in the audience <eol> waiting for his turn to go onstage, <eob> and he is still scribbling notes <eol> and crossing out lines. <eob>
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, <eob> he leaves his prepared remarks <eob> to utter four words <eol> that changed the course of history: <eob> "I have a dream." <eob> That was not in the script. <eob>
By delaying the task of finalizing the speech <eol> until the very last minute, <eob> he left himself open to the widest <eol> range of possible ideas. <eob>
And because the text wasn't set in stone, <eob> he had freedom to improvise. <eob>
Procrastinating is a vice <eol> when it comes to productivity, <eob> but it can be a virtue for creativity. <eob>
What you see with a lot <eol> of great originals <eob> is that they are quick to start <eol> but they're slow to finish. <eob>
And this is what I missed <eol> with Warby Parker. <eob>
When they were dragging their <eol> heels for six months, <eob> I looked at them and said, <eob> "You know, a lot of other companies <eol> are starting to sell glasses online." <eob> They missed the first-mover advantage. <eob>
But what I didn't realize <eol> was they were spending all that time <eob> trying to figure out <eol> how to get people <eob> to be comfortable ordering glasses online. <eob>
And it turns out the first-mover advantage <eol> is mostly a myth. <eob>
Look at a classic study <eol> of over 50 product categories, <eob> comparing the first movers <eol> who created the market <eob> with the improvers who introduced something <eol> different and better. <eob>
What you see is that the first movers <eol> had a failure rate of 47 percent, <eob> compared with only 8 percent <eol> for the improvers. <eob>
Look at Facebook, waiting <eol> to build a social network <eob> until after Myspace and Friendster. <eob>
Look at Google, waiting for years <eol> after Altavista and Yahoo. <eob>
It's much easier to improve <eol> on somebody else's idea <eob> than it is to create something new from scratch. <eob>
So the lesson I learned is that to be original <eol> you don't have to be first. <eob> You just have to be different and better. <eob>
But that wasn't the only reason <eol> I passed on Warby Parker. <eob>
They were also full of doubts. <eob>
They had backup plans lined up, <eob> and that made me doubt that they had <eol> the courage to be original, <eob> because I expected that originals <eol> would look something like this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, on the surface, <eob> a lot of original people <eol> look confident, <eob> but behind the scenes, <eob> they feel the same fear and doubt <eol> that the rest of us do. <eob>
They just manage it differently. <eob>
Let me show you: this is a depiction <eob> of how the creative process <eol> works for most of us. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, in my research, I discovered <eol> there are two different kinds of doubt. <eob>
There's self-doubt and idea doubt. <eob> Self-doubt is paralyzing. <eob> It leads you to freeze. <eob>
But idea doubt is energizing. <eob>
It motivates you to test, <eol> to experiment, to refine, <eob> just like MLK did. <eob>
And so the key to being original <eob> is just a simple thing <eob> of avoiding the leap from step <eol> three to step four. <eob>
Instead of saying, "I'm crap," <eob> you say, "The first few <eol> drafts are always crap, <eob> and I'm just not there yet." <eob> So how do you get there? <eob>
Well, there's a clue, it turns out, <eob> in the Internet browser that you use. <eob>
We can predict your job performance <eol> and your commitment <eob> just by knowing what web browser you use. <eob>
Now, some of you are not going <eol> to like the results of this study -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But there is good evidence that Firefox <eol> and Chrome users <eob> significantly outperform Internet Explorer <eol> and Safari users. <eob> Yes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way. <eob> Why? It's not a technical advantage. <eob>
The four browser groups <eol> on average have similar typing speed <eob> and they also have similar <eol> levels of computer knowledge. <eob>
It's about how you got the browser. <eob>
Because if you use Internet <eol> Explorer or Safari, <eob> those came preinstalled <eol> on your computer, <eob> and you accepted the default option <eol> that was handed to you. <eob>
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default <eob> and ask, is there a different option out there, <eob> and then be a little resourceful <eol> and download a new browser. <eob>
So people hear about this study <eol> and they're like, <eob> "Great, if I want to get better at my job, <eol> I just need to upgrade my browser?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No, it's about being the kind of person <eob> who takes the initiative to doubt the default <eob> and look for a better option. <eob>
And if you do that well, <eob> you will open yourself up <eol> to the opposite of déjà vu. <eob>
There's a name for it. <eob>
It's called vuja de. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Vuja de is when you look at something <eol> you've seen many times before <eob> and all of a sudden see it <eol> with fresh eyes. <eob>
It's a screenwriter <eol> who looks at a movie script <eob> that can't get the green light <eol> for more than half a century. <eob>
In every past version, the main character <eol> has been an evil queen. <eob>
But Jennifer Lee starts <eol> to question whether that makes sense. <eob>
She rewrites the first act, <eob> reinvents the villain as a tortured hero <eob> and Frozen becomes the most successful <eol> animated movie ever. <eob>
So there's a simple message <eol> from this story. <eob>
When you feel doubt, don't let it go. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What about fear? <eob> Originals feel fear, too. <eob>
They're afraid of failing, <eob> but what sets them apart <eol> from the rest of us <eob> is that they're even more afraid <eol> of failing to try. <eob>
They know you can fail by starting <eol> a business that goes bankrupt <eob> or by failing to start a business at all. <eob>
They know that in the long run, <eol> our biggest regrets are not our actions <eob> but our inactions. <eob>
The things we wish we could redo, <eol> if you look at the science, <eob> are the chances not taken. <eob>
Elon Musk told me recently, <eol> he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. <eob>
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches <eob> would fail to make it to orbit, <eol> let alone get back, <eob> but it was too important <eol> not to try. <eob>
And for so many of us, <eol> when we have an important idea, <eob> we don't bother to try. <eob>
But I have some good news for you. <eob>
You are not going to get judged <eol> on your bad ideas. <eob>
A lot of people think they will. <eob>
If you look across industries <eob> and ask people about their biggest idea, <eol> their most important suggestion, <eob> 85 percent of them stayed silent <eol> instead of speaking up. <eob>
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, <eol> of looking stupid. <eob> But guess what? Originals have lots <eol> and lots of bad ideas, <eob> tons of them, in fact. <eob>
Take the guy who invented this. <eob>
Do you care that he came up <eol> with a talking doll so creepy <eob> that it scared not only kids <eol> but adults, too? <eob> No. You celebrate Thomas Edison <eol> for pioneering the light bulb. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If you look across fields, <eob> the greatest originals are the ones <eol> who fail the most, <eob> because they're the ones <eol> who try the most. <eob>
Take classical composers, <eol> the best of the best. <eob>
Why do some of them get more pages <eol> in encyclopedias than others <eob> and also have their compositions <eol> rerecorded more times? <eob>
One of the best predictors <eob> is the sheer volume <eol> of compositions that they generate. <eob>
The more output you churn out, <eol> the more variety you get <eob> and the better your chances of stumbling <eol> on something truly original. <eob>
Even the three icons of classical music -- <eol> Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- <eob> had to generate hundreds and hundreds <eol> of compositions <eob> to come up with a much smaller <eol> number of masterpieces. <eob>
Now, you may be wondering, <eob> how did this guy become <eol> great without doing a whole lot? <eob>
I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. <eob>
But for most of us, <eol> if we want to be more original, <eob> we have to generate more ideas. <eob>
The Warby Parker founders, <eol> when they were trying to name their company, <eob> they needed something sophisticated, unique, <eol> with no negative associations <eob> to build a retail brand, <eob> and they tested over 2,000 possibilities <eob> before they finally put together <eob> Warby and Parker. <eob>
So if you put all this together, <eol> what you see is that originals <eob> are not that different <eol> from the rest of us. <eob>
They feel fear and doubt. <eol> They procrastinate. <eob> They have bad ideas. <eob>
And sometimes, it's not in spite <eol> of those qualities but because of them <eob> that they succeed. <eob>
So when you see those things, <eol> don't make the same mistake I did. <eob>
Don't write them off. <eob>
And when that's you, <eol> don't count yourself out either. <eob>
Know that being quick <eol> to start but slow to finish <eob> can boost your creativity, <eob> that you can motivate yourself <eol> by doubting your ideas <eob> and embracing the fear <eol> of failing to try, <eob> and that you need a lot of bad ideas <eol> in order to get a few good ones. <eob>
Look, being original is not easy, <eob> but I have no doubt about this: <eob> it's the best way to improve <eol> the world around us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth. <eob>
Think of the planet like a human body <eol> that we inhabit. <eob>
The skeleton <eol> is the transportation system of roads and railways, <eob> bridges and tunnels, <eol> air and seaports <eob> that enable our mobility <eol> across the continents. <eob>
The vascular system that powers the body <eob> are the oil and gas pipelines <eol> and electricity grids. <eob> that distribute energy. <eob>
And the nervous system <eol> of communications <eob> is the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks <eob> and data centers that allow us <eol> to share information. <eob>
This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix <eob> already consists of 64 million kilometers of roads, <eob> four million kilometers of railways, <eob> two million kilometers of pipelines <eob> and one million kilometers of Internet cables. <eob>
What about international borders? <eob>
We have less than 500,000 <eol> kilometers of borders. <eob>
Let's build a better map of the world. <eob>
And we can start by overcoming <eol> some ancient mythology. <eob>
There's a saying with which all students <eol> of history are familiar: <eob> "Geography is destiny." <eob> Sounds so grave, doesn't it? <eob>
It's such a fatalistic adage. <eob>
It tells us that landlocked countries <eol> are condemned to be poor, <eob> that small countries cannot escape <eol> their larger neighbors, <eob> that vast distances are insurmountable. <eob>
But every journey I take around the world, <eob> I see an even greater force <eol> sweeping the planet: <eob> connectivity. <eob>
The global connectivity revolution, <eol> in all of its forms -- <eob> transportation, energy <eol> and communications -- <eob> has enabled such a quantum <eol> leap in the mobility of people, <eob> of goods, of resources, <eol> of knowledge, <eob> such that we can no longer even think <eol> of geography as distinct from it. <eob>
In fact, I view the two forces <eol> as fusing together <eob> into what I call "connectography." <eob>
Connectography represents a quantum leap <eob> in the mobility of people, <eol> resources and ideas, <eob> but it is an evolution, <eob> an evolution of the world <eol> from political geography, <eob> which is how we legally divide the world, <eob> to functional geography, <eob> which is how we actually use the world, <eob> from nations and borders, to infrastructure <eol> and supply chains. <eob>
Our global system is evolving <eob> from the vertically integrated <eol> empires of the 19th century, <eob> through the horizontally interdependent nations <eol> of the 20th century, <eob> into a global network civilization <eol> in the 21st century. <eob>
Connectivity, not sovereignty, <eob> has become the organizing principle <eol> of the human species. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We are becoming this global network civilization <eob> because we are literally building it. <eob>
All of the world's defense budgets <eol> and military spending taken together <eob> total just under two trillion dollars per year. <eob>
Meanwhile, our global infrastructure spending <eob> is projected to rise <eol> to nine trillion dollars per year <eob> within the coming decade. <eob>
And, well, it should. <eob>
We have been living off an infrastructure stock <eob> meant for a world population <eol> of three billion, <eob> as our population has crossed seven <eol> billion to eight billion <eob> and eventually nine billion and more. <eob>
As a rule of thumb, we should spend <eol> about one trillion dollars <eob> on the basic infrastructure needs <eol> of every billion people in the world. <eob>
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead. <eob>
In 2015, China announced the creation <eob> of the Asian Infrastructure <eol> Investment Bank, <eob> which together with a network <eol> of other organizations <eob> aims to construct a network <eol> of iron and silk roads, <eob> stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon. <eob>
And as all of this topographical engineering unfolds, <eob> we will likely spend more on infrastructure <eol> in the next 40 years, <eob> we will build more infrastructure <eol> in the next 40 years, <eob> than we have in the past 4,000 years. <eob>
Now let's stop and think <eol> about it for a minute. <eob>
Spending so much more on building <eol> the foundations of global society <eob> rather than on the tools to destroy it <eob> can have profound consequences. <eob>
Connectivity is how we optimize the distribution <eob> of people and resources <eol> around the world. <eob>
It is how mankind comes to be more <eol> than just the sum of its parts. <eob>
I believe that is what is happening. <eob>
Connectivity has a twin megatrend <eol> in the 21st century: <eob> planetary urbanization. <eob>
Cities are the infrastructures that most define us. <eob>
By 2030, more than two thirds <eol> of the world's population <eob> will live in cities. <eob>
And these are not <eol> mere little dots on the map, <eob> but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers. <eob>
Here we are in Vancouver, <eob> at the head of the Cascadia Corridor <eob> that stretches south across the US border <eol> to Seattle. <eob>
The technology powerhouse <eol> of Silicon Valley <eob> begins north of San Francisco <eol> down to San Jose <eob> and across the bay to Oakland. <eob>
The sprawl of Los Angeles <eol> now passes San Diego <eob> across the Mexican border to Tijuana. <eob>
San Diego and Tijuana <eol> now share an airport terminal <eob> where you can exit <eol> into either country. <eob>
Eventually, a high-speed rail <eol> network may connect the entire Pacific spine. <eob>
America's northeastern megalopolis <eol> begins in Boston through New York <eob> and Philadelphia to Washington. <eob>
It contains more than 50 million people <eob> and also has plans for a high-speed rail network. <eob>
But Asia is where we really <eol> see the megacities coming together. <eob>
This continuous strip of light from Tokyo <eol> through Nagoya to Osaka <eob> contains more than 80 million people <eob> and most of Japan's economy. <eob>
It is the world's largest megacity. <eob> For now. <eob>
But in China, megacity clusters <eol> are coming together <eob> with populations reaching 100 million people. <eob>
The Bohai Rim around Beijing, <eob> The Yangtze River Delta <eol> around Shanghai <eob> and the Pearl River Delta, <eob> stretching from Hong Kong north <eol> to Guangzhou. <eob>
And in the middle, <eob> the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster, <eob> whose geographic footprint is almost <eol> the same size <eob> as the country of Austria. <eob>
And any number of these megacity clusters <eob> has a GDP approaching <eol> two trillion dollars -- <eob> that's almost the same as all of India today. <eob>
So imagine if our global diplomatic <eol> institutions, such as the G20, <eob> were to base their membership <eol> on economic size <eob> rather than national representation. <eob>
Some Chinese megacities <eol> may be in and have a seat at the table, <eob> while entire countries, like Argentina <eol> or Indonesia would be out. <eob>
Moving to India, whose population <eol> will soon exceed that of China, <eob> it too has a number of megacity clusters, <eob> such as the Delhi Capital Region <eob> and Mumbai. <eob>
In the Middle East, <eob> Greater Tehran is absorbing one third <eol> of Iran's population. <eob>
Most of Egypt's 80 million people <eob> live in the corridor between Cairo <eol> and Alexandria. <eob>
And in the gulf, a necklace <eol> of city-states is forming, <eob> from Bahrain and Qatar, <eob> through the United Arab Emirates <eol> to Muscat in Oman. <eob>
And then there's Lagos, <eob> Africa's largest city and Nigeria's <eol> commercial hub. <eob>
It has plans for a rail network <eob> that will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor, <eob> stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana, <eob> to Abidjan, the capital <eol> of the Ivory Coast. <eob>
But these countries are suburbs of Lagos. <eob>
In a megacity world, <eob> countries can be suburbs of cities. <eob>
By 2030, we will have as many <eol> as 50 such megacity clusters in the world. <eob>
So which map tells you more? <eob>
Our traditional map of 200 discrete nations <eob> that hang on most of our walls, <eob> or this map of the 50 megacity clusters? <eob>
And yet, even this is incomplete <eob> because you cannot understand <eol> any individual megacity <eob> without understanding its connections to the others. <eob>
People move to cities to be connected, <eob> and connectivity is why <eol> these cities thrive. <eob>
Any number of them, such as Sao <eol> Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow, <eob> has a GDP approaching <eol> or exceeding one third of one half <eob> of their entire national GDP. <eob>
But equally importantly, <eob> you cannot calculate <eol> any of their individual value <eob> without understanding the role <eol> of the flows of people, <eob> of finance, of technology <eob> that enable them to thrive. <eob>
Take the Gauteng province <eol> of South Africa, <eob> which contains Johannesburg <eol> and the capital Pretoria. <eob>
It too represents just over a third <eol> of South Africa's GDP. <eob>
But equally importantly, <eob> it is home to the offices <eob> of almost every single <eol> multinational corporation <eob> that invests directly into South Africa <eob> and indeed, into the entire African continent. <eob>
Cities want to be part <eol> of global value chains. <eob>
They want to be part <eol> of this global division of labor. <eob>
That is how cities think. <eob>
I've never met a mayor who said to me, <eob> "I want my city to be cut off." <eob> They know that their cities <eol> belong as much <eob> to the global network civilization <eol> as to their home countries. <eob>
Now, for many people, urbanization <eol> causes great dismay. <eob>
They think cities are wrecking the planet. <eob>
But right now, <eob> there are more than 200 intercity <eol> learning networks thriving. <eob>
That is as many as the number <eol> of intergovernmental organizations <eob> that we have. <eob>
And all of these intercity networks <eol> are devoted to one purpose, <eob> mankind's number one priority <eol> in the 21st century: <eob> sustainable urbanization. <eob>
Is it working? <eob> Let's take climate change. <eob>
We know that summit <eol> after summit in New York and Paris <eob> is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <eob>
But what we can see <eol> is that transferring technology <eob> and knowledge and policies between cities <eob> is how we've actually begun to reduce <eol> the carbon intensity of our economies. <eob>
Cities are learning from each other. <eob>
How to install zero-emissions buildings, <eob> how to deploy electric car-sharing systems. <eob>
In major Chinese cities, <eob> they're imposing quotas <eol> on the number of cars on the streets. <eob>
In many Western cities, <eob> young people don't even want <eol> to drive anymore. <eob>
Cities have been part of the problem, <eob> now they are part of the solution. <eob>
Inequality is the other great challenge <eol> to achieving <eob> sustainable urbanization. <eob>
When I travel through megacities <eol> from end to end -- <eob> it takes hours and days -- <eob> I experience the tragedy <eol> of extreme disparity <eob> within the same geography. <eob>
And yet, our global stock <eol> of financial assets <eob> has never been larger, <eob> approaching 300 trillion dollars. <eob>
That's almost four times <eol> the actual GDP of the world. <eob>
We have taken on such enormous debts <eol> since the financial crisis, <eob> but have we invested them <eol> in inclusive growth? <eob>
No, not yet. <eob>
Only when we build sufficient, affordable public housing, <eob> when we invest in robust transportation networks <eob> to allow people to connect to each other <eol> both physically and digitally, <eob> that's when our divided cities <eol> and societies <eob> will come to feel whole again. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And that is why infrastructure <eol> has just been included <eob> in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, <eob> because it enables all the others. <eob>
Our political and economic leaders <eob> are learning that connectivity <eol> is not charity, <eob> it's opportunity. <eob>
And that's why our financial community <eol> needs to understand <eob> that connectivity is the most important <eol> asset class of the 21st century. <eob>
Now, cities can make the world <eol> more sustainable, <eob> they can make the world more equitable, <eob> I also believe that connectivity between cities <eob> can make the world more peaceful. <eob>
If we look at regions of the world <eol> with dense relations across borders, <eob> we see more trade, more investment <eob> and more stability. <eob>
We all know the story of Europe <eol> after World War II, <eob> where industrial integration <eol> kicked off a process <eob> that gave rise to today's <eol> peaceful European Union. <eob>
And you can see that Russia, by the way, <eob> is the least connected of major powers <eol> in the international system. <eob>
And that goes a long way <eol> towards explaining the tensions today. <eob>
Countries that have less <eol> stake in the system <eob> also have less to lose in disturbing it. <eob>
In North America, the lines <eol> that matter most on the map <eob> are not the US-Canada border <eol> or the US-Mexico border, <eob> but the dense network of roads <eol> and railways and pipelines <eob> and electricity grids and even water canals <eob> that are forming an integrated <eol> North American union. <eob>
North America does not need more walls, <eol> it needs more connections. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But the real promise of connectivity <eol> is in the postcolonial world. <eob>
All of those regions where borders <eol> have historically been the most arbitrary <eob> and where generations of leaders <eob> have had hostile relations with each other. <eob>
But now a new group of leaders <eol> has come into power <eob> and is burying the hatchet. <eob>
Let's take Southeast Asia, <eol> where high-speed rail networks <eob> are planned to connect Bangkok <eol> to Singapore <eob> and trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar. <eob>
Now this region of 600 million people <eol> coordinates its agricultural resources <eob> and its industrial output. <eob>
It is evolving <eol> into what I call a Pax Asiana, <eob> a peace among Southeast Asian nations. <eob>
A similar phenomenon <eol> is underway in East Africa, <eob> where a half dozen countries <eob> are investing in railways <eol> and multimodal corridors <eob> so that landlocked countries <eol> can get their goods to market. <eob>
Now these countries coordinate <eol> their utilities <eob> and their investment policies. <eob>
They, too, are evolving <eol> into a Pax Africana. <eob>
One region we know could especially <eol> use this kind of thinking <eob> is the Middle East. <eob>
As Arab states tragically collapse, <eob> what is left behind <eol> but the ancient cities, <eob> such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad? <eob>
In fact, the nearly 400 million <eol> people of the Arab world <eob> are almost entirely urbanized. <eob>
As societies, as cities, <eob> they are either water rich or water poor, <eob> energy rich or energy poor. <eob>
And the only way <eol> to correct these mismatches <eob> is not through more wars and more borders, <eob> but through more connectivity <eol> of pipelines and water canals. <eob>
Sadly, this is not yet the map <eol> of the Middle East. <eob>
But it should be, <eob> a connected Pax Arabia, <eob> internally integrated <eob> and productively connected <eol> to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa. <eob>
Now, it may not seem like connectivity <eol> is what we want right now <eob> towards the world's most turbulent region. <eob>
But we know from history <eol> that more connectivity is the only way <eob> to bring about stability in the long run. <eob>
Because we know that in region after region, <eob> connectivity is the new reality. <eob>
Cities and countries <eol> are learning to aggregate <eob> into more peaceful <eol> and prosperous wholes. <eob>
But the real test is going to be Asia. <eob>
Can connectivity overcome <eol> the patterns of rivalry <eob> among the great powers <eol> of the Far East? <eob>
After all, this is where World War II <eol>I is supposed to break out. <eob>
Since the end of the Cold War, <eol> a quarter century ago, <eob> at least six major wars <eol> have been predicted for this region. <eob>
But none have broken out. <eob>
Take China and Taiwan. <eob> In the 1990s, this was everyone's leading <eol> World War III scenario. <eob>
But since that time, <eob> the trade and investment volumes <eol> across the straits have become so intense <eob> that last November, <eob> leaders from both sides <eol> held a historic summit <eob> to discuss eventual peaceful <eol> reunification. <eob>
And even the election <eol> of a nationalist party in Taiwan <eob> that's pro-independence earlier this year <eob> does not undermine this <eol> fundamental dynamic. <eob>
China and Japan have an even longer history <eol> of rivalry <eob> and have been deploying <eol> their air forces and navies <eob> to show their strength in island disputes. <eob>
But in recent years, <eob> Japan has been making its largest <eol> foreign investments in China. <eob>
Japanese cars are selling <eol> in record numbers there. <eob>
And guess where the largest <eol> number of foreigners <eob> residing in Japan today comes from? <eob>
You guessed it: China. <eob>
China and India have fought a major war <eob> and have three outstanding border <eol> disputes, <eob> but today India is the second largest <eol> shareholder <eob> in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. <eob>
They're building a trade corridor stretching <eol> from Northeast India <eob> through Myanmar and Bangladesh <eol> to Southern China. <eob>
Their trade volume has grown <eol> from 20 billion dollars a decade ago <eob> to 80 billion dollars today. <eob>
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan <eol> have fought three wars <eob> and continue to dispute Kashmir, <eob> but they're also negotiating <eol> a most-favored-nation trade agreement <eob> and want to complete a pipeline <eob> stretching from Iran through Pakistan to India. <eob>
And let's talk about Iran. <eob>
Wasn't it just two years ago <eol> that war with Iran seemed inevitable? <eob>
Then why is every single major power <eol> rushing to do business there today? <eob>
Ladies and gentlemen, <eob> I cannot guarantee <eol> that World War III will not break out. <eob>
But we can definitely see <eol> why it hasn't happened yet. <eob>
Even though Asia is home <eol> to the world's fastest growing militaries, <eob> these same countries <eol> are also investing billions of dollars <eob> in each other's infrastructure <eol> and supply chains. <eob>
They are more interested <eol> in each other's functional geography <eob> than in their political geography. <eob>
And that is why their leaders think twice, <eol> step back from the brink, <eob> and decide to focus on economic ties <eol> over territorial tensions. <eob>
So often it seems like the world <eol> is falling apart, <eob> but building more connectivity <eob> is how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again, <eob> much better than before. <eob>
And by wrapping the world <eob> in such seamless physical <eol> and digital connectivity, <eob> we evolve towards a world <eob> in which people can rise <eol> above their geographic constraints. <eob>
We are the cells and vessels <eob> pulsing through these <eol> global connectivity networks. <eob>
Everyday, hundreds of millions <eol> of people go online <eob> and work with people <eol> they've never met. <eob>
More than one billion people <eol> cross borders every year, <eob> and that's expected to rise <eol> to three billion in the coming decade. <eob>
We don't just build connectivity, <eob> we embody it. <eob>
We are the global network civilization, <eob> and this is our map. <eob>
A map of the world in which geography <eol> is no longer destiny. <eob>
Instead, the future has a new <eol> and more hopeful motto: <eob> connectivity is destiny. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Strap yourselves in, <eob> we're going to Mars. <eob>
Not just a few astronauts -- <eob> thousands of people <eol> are going to colonize Mars. <eob>
And I am telling you that <eol> they're going to do this soon. <eob>
Some of you will end up <eol> working on projects on Mars, <eob> and I guarantee that some of your children <eol> will end up living there. <eob>
That probably sounds preposterous, <eob> so I'm going to share with you <eol> how and when that will happen. <eob>
But first I want <eol> to discuss the obvious question: <eob> Why the heck should we do this? <eob>
12 years ago, <eob> I gave a TED talk <eol> on 10 ways the world could end suddenly. <eob>
We are incredibly vulnerable <eol> to the whims of our own galaxy. <eob>
A single, large asteroid <eol> could take us out forever. <eob>
To survive we have to reach <eol> beyond the home planet. <eob>
Think what a tragedy it would be <eob> if all that humans have accomplished <eol> were suddenly obliterated. <eob>
And there's another reason we should go: <eob> exploration is in our DNA. <eob>
Two million years ago <eol> humans evolved in Africa <eob> and then slowly but surely spread out <eol> across the entire planet <eob> by reaching into the wilderness <eol> that was beyond their horizons. <eob>
This stuff is inside us. <eob>
And they prospered doing that. <eob>
Some of the greatest <eol> advances in civilization and technology <eob> came because we explored. <eob>
Yes, we could do a lot of good <eob> with the money it will take <eol> to establish a thriving colony on Mars. <eob>
And yes we should all be taking <eol> far better care of our own home planet. <eob>
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars <eol> the way we've screwed up Earth. <eob>
But think for a moment, <eob> what we had when John F. Kennedy <eol> told us we would put a human on the moon. <eob>
He excited an entire generation to dream. <eob>
Think how inspired we will be <eol> to see a landing on Mars. <eob>
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth <eob> and see that that is one people instead of many <eob> and perhaps then we will look back at Earth, <eob> as we struggle to survive on Mars, <eob> and realize how precious <eol> the home planet is. <eob>
So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure <eol> we're about to undertake. <eob>
But first, <eob> a few fascinating facts <eol> about where we're going. <eob>
This picture actually represents the true size <eol> of Mars compared to Earth. <eob>
Mars is not our sister planet. <eob>
It's far less than half <eol> the size of the Earth, <eob> and yet despite the fact <eol> that it's smaller, <eob> the surface area of Mars <eol> that you can stand on <eob> is equivalent to the surface area <eol> of the Earth that you can stand on, <eob> because the Earth is mostly <eol> covered by water. <eob>
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- <eob> 100 times thinner than on Earth -- <eob> and it's not breathable, <eol> it's 96 percent carbon dioxide. <eob>
It's really cold there. <eob>
The average temperature is minus 81 degrees, <eob> although there is quite a range <eol> of temperature. <eob>
A day on Mars is about <eol> as long as a day on Earth, <eob> plus about 39 minutes. <eob>
Seasons and years on Mars are twice <eol> as long as they are on Earth. <eob>
And for anybody who wants to strap <eol> on some wings and go flying one day, <eob> Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth, <eob> and it's the kind of place <eob> where you can jump over your car <eol> instead of walk around it. <eob>
Now, as you can see, <eol> Mars isn't exactly Earth-like, <eob> but it's by far the most livable other place <eol> in our entire solar system. <eob>
Here's the problem. <eob> Mars is a long way away, <eob> a thousand times farther away <eol> from us than our own moon. <eob>
The Moon is 250,000 miles away <eob> and it took Apollo astronauts <eol> three days to get there. <eob>
Mars is 250 million miles away <eob> and it will take us eight months <eol> to get there -- <eob> 240 days. <eob>
And that's only if we launch <eol> on a very specific day, <eob> at a very specific time, <eob> once every two years, <eob> when Mars and the Earth <eol> are aligned just so, <eob> so the distance that the rocket <eol> would have to travel will be the shortest. <eob>
240 days <eob> is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues <eol> in a tin can. <eob>
And meanwhile, our track record <eol> of getting to Mars is lousy. <eob>
We and the Russians, <eol> the Europeans, the Japanese, <eob> the Chinese and the Indians, <eob> have actually sent 44 rockets there, <eob> and the vast majority of them <eol> have either missed or crashed. <eob>
Only about a third of the missions <eol> to Mars have been successful. <eob>
And we don't at the moment <eol> have a rocket big enough to get there anyway. <eob>
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. <eob> A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there. <eob>
It was the most magnificent <eol> machine ever built by humans, <eob> and it was the rocket <eol> that took us to the Moon. <eob>
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 <eol> to launch the Skylab space station, <eob> and we decided to do something <eol> called the shuttle <eob> instead of continuing on to Mars <eol> after we landed on the Moon. <eob>
The biggest rocket we have now <eob> is only half big enough <eol> to get us anything to Mars. <eob>
So getting to Mars is not <eol> going to be easy <eob> and that brings up a really interesting question ... <eob> how soon will the first humans <eol> actually land here? <eob>
Now, some pundits think <eol> if we got there by 2050, <eob> that'd be a pretty good achievement. <eob>
These days, NASA seems to be saying <eol> that it can get humans to Mars by 2040. <eob> Maybe they can. <eob> I believe that they can get human beings <eol> into Mars orbit by 2035. <eob>
But frankly, <eob> I don't think they're going <eol> to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, <eob> because we will already be there. <eob>
We're going to land on Mars in 2027. <eob>
And the reason is <eob> this man is determined <eol> to make that happen. <eob>
His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO <eol> of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. <eob>
Now, he actually told me <eol> that we would land on Mars by 2025, <eob> but Elon Musk is more optimistic <eol> than I am -- <eob> and that's going a ways -- <eob> so I'm giving him <eol> a couple of years of slack. <eob>
Still... <eob> you've got to ask yourself, <eob> can this guy really do <eol> this by 2025 or 2027? <eob>
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk <eol> into a little perspective. <eob>
Where was this 10 years ago? <eob>
That's the Tesla electric automobile. <eob>
In 2005, a lot of people <eol> in the automobile industry were saying, <eob> we would not have a decent electric car <eol> for 50 years. <eob>
And where was that? <eob> That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, <eob> lifting six tons of supplies <eol> to the International Space Station. <eob>
10 years ago, <eob> SpaceX had not launched anything, <eol> or fired a rocket to anywhere. <eob>
So I think it's a pretty good bet <eob> that the person who is revolutionizing <eol> the automobile industry <eob> in less than 10 years <eob> and the person who created an entire rocket <eol> company in less than 10 years <eob> will get us to Mars by 2027. <eob>
Now, you need to know this: <eob> governments and robots <eol> no longer control this game. <eob>
Private companies are leaping into space <eob> and they will be happy <eol> to take you to Mars. <eob>
And that raises a really big question. <eob> Can we actually live there? <eob> Now, NASA may not be able to get us there <eol> until 2040, <eob> or we may get there a long time before NASA, <eob> but NASA has taken a huge responsibility <eol> in figuring out how we can live on Mars. <eob>
Let's look at the problem this way. <eob>
Here's what you need to live on Earth: <eob> food, water, shelter and clothing. <eob>
And here's what you need to live on Mars: <eob> all of the above, plus oxygen. <eob>
So let's look at the most important <eol> thing on this list first. <eob>
Water is the basis of all life <eol> as we know it, <eob> and it's far too heavy <eol> for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live, <eob> so we have to find water <eol> if our life is going to succeed on Mars. <eob>
And if you look at Mars, it <eol> looks really dry, <eob> it looks like the entire planet is a desert. <eob>
But it turns out that it's not. <eob>
The soil alone on Mars contains up <eol> to 60 percent water. <eob>
And a number of orbiters that we still <eol> have flying around Mars have shown us -- <eob> and by the way, that's a real photograph -- <eob> that lots of craters on Mars <eol> have a sheet of water ice in them. <eob>
It's not a bad place to start a colony. <eob>
Now, here's a view of a little dig <eol> the Phoenix Lander did in 2008, <eob> showing that just below the surface <eol> of the soil is ice -- <eob> that white stuff is ice. <eob>
In the second picture, <eob> which is four days later <eol> than the first picture, <eob> you can see that some of it <eol> is evaporating. <eob>
Orbiters also tell us <eob> that there are huge amounts <eol> of underground water on Mars <eob> as well as glaciers. <eob>
In fact, if only the water ice at the poles <eol> on Mars melted, <eob> most of the planet would be under <eol> 30 feet of water. <eob>
So there's plenty of water there, <eob> but most of it's ice, most of it's underground, <eob> it takes a lot of energy <eol> to get it and a lot of human labor. <eob>
This is a device cooked <eol> up at the University of Washington <eob> back in 1998. <eob>
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier. <eob>
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere <eol> is often 100 percent humid. <eob>
So this device can extract <eol> all the water that humans will need <eob> simply from the atmosphere on Mars. <eob>
Next we have to worry <eol> about what we will breathe. <eob>
Frankly, I was really shocked <eob> to find out that NASA has this <eol> problem worked out. <eob>
This is a scientist at MIT <eol> named Michael Hecht. <eob>
And he's developed this machine, Moxie. <eob>
I love this thing. <eob>
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially, <eob> that sucks in the Martian atmosphere <eol> and pumps out oxygen. <eob>
And you have to remember that CO2 -- <eob> carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent <eol> of Mars' atmosphere -- <eob> CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen. <eob>
Now, the next big rover <eol> that NASA sends to Mars in 2020 <eob> is going to have one of these devices aboard, <eob> and it will be able to produce <eol> enough oxygen <eob> to keep one person alive <eol> indefinitely. <eob>
But the secret to this -- <eob> and that's just for testing -- <eob> the secret to this is that this thing <eol> was designed from the get-go <eob> to be scalable by a factor of 100. <eob>
Next, what will we eat? <eob> Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food, <eob> but we're not going to be able to grow <eob> more than 15 to 20 percent <eol> of our food there, <eob> at least not until water is running <eol> on the surface of Mars <eob> and we actually have the probability <eol> and the capability of planting crops. <eob>
In the meantime, <eob> most of our food will arrive from Earth, <eob> and it will be dried. <eob>
And then we need some shelter. <eob>
At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings <eob> as well as the landers themselves. <eob>
But this really only works <eol> during the daytime. <eob>
There is too much solar radiation <eol> and too much radiation from cosmic rays. <eob>
So we really have to go underground. <eob>
Now, it turns out <eol> that the soil on Mars, <eob> by and large, is perfect <eol> for making bricks. <eob>
And NASA has figured this one out, too. <eob>
They're going to throw some polymer <eol> plastic into the bricks, <eob> shove them in a microwave oven, <eob> and then you will be able to build buildings <eol> with really thick walls. <eob>
Or we may choose to live underground <eol> in caves or in lava tubes, <eob> of which there are plenty. <eob>
And finally there's clothing. <eob>
On Earth we have miles <eol> of atmosphere piled up on us, <eob> which creates 15 pounds of pressure <eol> on our bodies at all times, <eob> and we're constantly pushing <eol> out against that. <eob>
On Mars there's hardly any <eol> atmospheric pressure. <eob>
So Dava Newman, <eob> a scientist at MIT, <eob> has created this sleek space suit. <eob> It will keep us together, <eob> block radiation and keep us warm. <eob>
So let's think about this for a minute. <eob> Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ... <eob> we can do this. <eob> We really can. <eob> But it's still a little complicated <eol> and a little difficult. <eob>
So that leads to the next big -- <eob> really big step -- <eob> in living the good life on Mars. <eob>
And that's terraforming the planet: <eob> making it more like Earth, <eob> reengineering an entire planet. <eob>
That sounds like a lot of hubris, <eob> but the truth is <eob> that the technology to do everything <eol> I'm about to tell you already exists. <eob>
First we've got to warm it up. <eob>
Mars is incredibly cold <eol> because it has a very thin atmosphere. <eob>
The answer lies here, at the south pole <eol> and at the north pole of Mars, <eob> both of which are covered <eob> with an incredible amount <eol> of frozen carbon dioxide -- <eob> dry ice. <eob>
If we heat it up, <eob> it sublimes directly into the atmosphere <eob> and thickens the atmosphere the same way <eol> it does on Earth. <eob>
And as we know, <eob> CO2 is an incredibly potent <eol> greenhouse gas. <eob>
Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail <eob> and focus it -- <eob> it essentially serves as a mirror -- <eob> and focus it on the south pole <eol> of Mars at first. <eob>
As the planet spins, <eol> it will heat up all that <eob> dry ice, <eob> sublime it, <eob> and it will go into the atmosphere. <eob>
It actually won't take long <eob> for the temperature <eol> on Mars to start rising, <eob> probably less than 20 years. <eob>
Right now, <eob> on a perfect day <eol> at the equator, <eob> in the middle of summer on Mars, <eob> temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees, <eob> but then they go down to minus 100 at night. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What we're shooting <eol> for is a runaway greenhouse effect: <eob> enough temperature rise to see <eol> a lot of that ice on Mars -- <eob> especially the ice in the ground -- melt. <eob>
Then we get some real magic. <eob>
As the atmosphere gets thicker, <eol> everything gets better. <eob>
We get more protection from radiation, <eob> more atmosphere makes us warmer, <eol> makes the planet warmer, <eob> so we get running water <eob> and that makes crops possible. <eob>
Then more water vapor goes into the air, <eol> forming yet another potent greenhouse gas. <eob>
It will rain and it will snow on Mars. <eob>
And a thicker atmosphere will create <eol> enough pressure <eob> so that we can throw away those space suits. <eob>
We only need about five pounds <eol> of pressure to survive. <eob>
Eventually, Mars will be made <eol> to feel a lot like British Columbia. <eob>
We'll still be left <eol> with the complicated problem <eob> of making the atmosphere breathable, <eob> and frankly that could take <eol> 1,000 years to accomplish. <eob>
But humans are amazingly smart <eol> and incredibly adaptable. <eob>
There is no telling what our future <eol> technology will be able to accomplish <eob> and no telling what we can do <eol> with our own bodies. <eob>
In biology right now, <eob> we are on the very verge <eol> of being able to control our own genetics, <eob> what the genes in our own bodies are doing, <eob> and certainly, <eob> eventually, our own evolution. <eob>
We could end up with a species <eol> of human being on Earth <eob> that is slightly different <eol> from the species of human beings on Mars. <eob>
But what would you do there? <eol> How would you live? <eob> It's going to be the same <eol> as it is on Earth. <eob>
Somebody's going to start a restaurant, <eob> somebody's going to build an iron foundry. <eob>
Someone will make documentary <eol> movies of Mars <eob> and sell them on Earth. <eob>
Some idiot will start a reality TV show. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There will be software companies, <eob> there will be hotels, there will be bars. <eob>
This much is certain: <eob> it will be the most disruptive <eol> event in our lifetimes, <eob> and I think it will be the most inspiring. <eob>
Ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants <eol> to go to Mars. <eob>
Children who are now in elementary school <eol> are going to choose to live there. <eob>
Remember when we landed <eol> humans on the Moon? <eob>
When that happened, people <eol> looked at each other and said, <eob> "If <eob> we can do this, <eob> we can do anything." <eob> What are they going to think <eol> when we actually form a colony on Mars? <eob>
Most importantly, <eob> it will make us a spacefaring species. <eob>
And that means humans will survive <eol> no matter what happens on Earth. <eob>
We will never be the last of our kind. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I want to introduce you <eol> to an amazing woman. <eob>
Her name is Davinia. <eob>
Davinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US <eol> at the age of 18, <eob> and now lives just outside <eol> of Washington, DC. <eob>
She's not a high-powered <eol> political staffer, <eob> nor a lobbyist. <eob>
She'd probably tell you <eol> she's quite unremarkable, <eob> but she's having the most remarkable impact. <eob>
What's incredible about Davinia <eob> is that she's willing <eol> to spend time every single week <eob> focused on people who are not her: <eob> people not her in her neighborhood, <eol> her state, nor even in her country -- <eob> people she'd likely never meet. <eob>
Davinia's impact started <eol> a few years ago <eob> when she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook, <eob> and asked them to donate their pennies <eob> so she could fund girls' education. <eob>
She wasn't expecting a huge response, <eob> but 700,000 pennies later, <eob> she's now sent over 120 girls to school. <eob>
When we spoke last week, <eob> she told me she's become <eol> a little infamous at the local bank <eob> every time she rocks up with a shopping <eol> cart full of pennies. <eob>
Now -- Davinia is not alone. <eob> Far from it. <eob> She's part of a growing movement. <eob>
And there's a name <eol> for people like Davinia: <eob> global citizens. <eob>
A global citizen is someone <eol> who self-identifies first and foremost <eob> not as a member of a state, <eol> a tribe or a nation, <eob> but as a member of the human race, <eob> and someone who is <eol> prepared to act on that belief, <eob> to tackle our world's greatest challenges. <eob>
Our work is focused on finding, <eob> supporting and activating <eob> global citizens. <eob>
They exist in every country <eob> and among every demographic. <eob>
I want to make the case to you today <eob> that the world's future depends on <eob> global citizens. <eob>
I'm convinced that if we had more <eob> global citizens <eob> active in our world, <eob> then every single one of the major <eol> challenges we face — <eob> from poverty, climate change, gender inequality — <eob> these issues become solvable. <eob>
They are ultimately global issues, <eob> and they can ultimately only be solved <eob> by <eob> global citizens <eob> demanding global solutions from their leaders. <eob>
Now, some people's immediate reaction <eol> to this idea <eob> is that it's either a bit utopian <eol> or even threatening. <eob>
So I'd like to share with you <eol> a little of my story today, <eob> how I ended up here, <eob> how it connects with Davinia <eob> and, hopefully, with you. <eob>
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia, <eob> I was one of those seriously <eol> irritating little kids <eob> that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?" <eob> You might have been one yourself. <eob>
I used to ask my mum <eol> the most annoying questions. <eob>
I'd ask her questions like, "Mum, why I can't I dress up <eob> and play with puppets all day?" <eob> "Why do you want fries with that?" <eob> "What is a shrimp, <eob> and why do we have to keep throwing them <eol> on the barbie?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"And mum -- this haircut. <eob> Why?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The worst haircut, I think. <eob> Still terrible. <eob>
As a "why" kid, I thought <eol> I could change the world, <eob> and it was impossible <eol> to convince me otherwise. <eob>
And when I was 12 and in <eol> my first year of high school, <eob> I started raising money <eol> for communities in the developing world. <eob>
We were a really enthusiastic group of kids, <eob> and we raised more money <eol> than any other school in Australia. <eob>
And so I was awarded the chance <eol> to go to the Philippines to learn more. <eob> It was 1998. <eob> We were taken into a slum <eol> in the outskirts of Manila. <eob>
But don't let the romance of that name fool you, <eob> because it was nothing more <eol> than a rancid landfill <eob> that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging <eol> through every single day <eob> to find something, <eol> anything of value. <eob>
That night with Sonny Boy and his family <eol> changed my life forever, <eob> because when it came time <eol> to go to sleep, <eob> we simply laid down on this concrete <eol> slab the size of half my bedroom <eob> with myself, Sonny Boy, <eol> and the rest of his family, <eob> seven of us in this long line, <eob> with the smell of rubbish all around us <eob> and cockroaches crawling all around. <eob>
And I didn't sleep a wink, <eob> but I lay awake thinking to myself, <eob> "Why should anyone have to live like this <eob> when I have so much? <eob>
Why should Sonny Boy's ability <eol> to live out his dreams <eob> be determined by where he's born, <eob> or what Warren Buffett called <eol> 'the ovarian lottery?'" <eob> I just didn't get it, <eob> and I needed to understand why. <eob>
Now, I only later came to understand <eob> that the poverty <eol> I'd seen in the Philippines <eob> was the result of decisions made <eol> or not made, man-made, <eob> by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments <eob> who had anything but the interests <eol> of Sonny Boy at heart. <eob>
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, <eol> but they may as well have. <eob>
And if we're to try to help <eol> kids like Sonny Boy, <eob> it wouldn't work just to try <eol> to send him a few dollars <eob> or to try to clean up the garbage <eol> dump on which he lived, <eob> because the core <eol> of the problem lay elsewhere. <eob>
And as I worked on community <eol> development projects over the coming years <eob> trying to help build schools, <eob> train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS, <eob> I came to see that community development <eob> should be driven by communities themselves, <eob> and that although charity <eol> is necessary, it's not sufficient. <eob>
We need to confront these challenges <eob> on a global scale and in a systemic way. <eob>
And the best thing I could do <eob> is try to mobilize a large group <eol> of citizens back home <eob> to insist that our leaders <eol> engage in that systemic change. <eob>
That's why, a few years later, <eob> I joined with a group of college friends <eob> in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia. <eob>
We had this dream of staging <eol> this small concert <eob> around the time of the G20 <eol> with local Aussie artists, <eob> and it suddenly exploded one day <eob> when we got a phone call from Bono, <eol> the Edge and Pearl Jam, <eob> who all agreed to headline <eol> our concert. <eob>
I got a little bit excited that day, <eol> as you can see. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But to our amazement, <eob> the Australian government <eol> heard our collective voices, <eob> and they agreed to double <eol> investment into global health and development -- <eob> an additional 6.2 billion dollars. <eob> It felt like -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It felt like this incredible validation. <eob>
By rallying citizens together, <eol> we helped persuade our government <eob> to do the unthinkable, <eob> and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> it didn't last. <eob>
See, there was a change in government, <eob> and six years later, <eol> all that new money <eob> disappeared. <eob> What did we learn? <eob> We learned that one-off spikes <eol> are not enough. <eob>
We needed a sustainable movement, <eob> not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating <eol> moods of a politician <eob> or the hint <eol> of an economic downturn. <eob>
And it needed to happen everywhere; <eob> otherwise, every individual government <eol> would have this built-in excuse mechanism <eob> that they couldn't possibly carry the burden <eol> of global action alone. <eob>
And so this is what we embarked upon. <eob>
And as we embarked <eol> upon this challenge, we asked ourselves, <eob> how do we gain enough pressure <eol> and build a broad enough army <eob> to win these fights for the long term? <eob>
We could only think of one way. <eob> We needed to somehow turn <eol> that short-term excitement <eob> of people involved with the Make <eol> Poverty History campaign <eob> into long-term passion. <eob>
It had to be part of their identity. <eob>
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization <eol> that had exactly that as its goal. <eob>
And there was only one name for it: <eob> Global Citizen. <eob> But this is not about <eol> any one organization. <eob>
This is about citizens taking action. <eob>
And research data tells us <eob> that of the total population <eol> who even care about global issues, <eob> only 18 percent have done anything about it. <eob>
It's not that people don't want to act. <eob> It's often that they don't know <eol> how to take action, <eob> or that they believe <eol> that their actions will have no effect. <eob>
So we had to somehow recruit <eol> and activate millions of citizens <eob> in dozens of countries <eob> to put pressure on their leaders <eol> to behave altruistically. <eob>
And as we did so, we discovered <eol> something really thrilling, <eob> that when you make global citizenship your mission, <eob> you suddenly find yourself <eol> with some extraordinary allies. <eob>
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue <eol> that's fundamentally global. <eob> So, too, is climate change, <eob> human rights, gender equality, <eob> even conflict. <eob>
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder <eob> with people who are passionate <eol> about targeting all these interrelated issues. <eob>
But how did we actually <eol> go about recruiting <eob> and engaging those <eob> global citizens? <eob>
Well, we used the universal language: <eob> music. <eob>
We launched the <eob> Global Citizen <eob> Festival <eob> in the heart of New York City <eol> in Central Park, <eob> and we persuaded some of the world's <eol> biggest artists to participate. <eob>
We made sure that these festivals coincided <eob> with the UN General <eol> Assembly meeting, <eob> so that leaders who need <eol> to hear our voices <eob> couldn't possible ignore them. <eob>
But there was a twist: <eob> you couldn't buy a ticket. <eob>
You had to earn it. <eob>
You had to take action <eol> on behalf of a global cause, <eob> and only once you'd done that could you earn <eol> enough points to qualify. <eob>
Activism is the currency. <eob>
I had no interest in citizenship purely <eol> as some sort of feel-good thing. <eob>
For me, citizenship means you have to act, <eol> and that's what we required. <eob>
And amazingly, it worked. <eob>
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens <eol> in the New York area alone <eob> earned enough points to qualify. <eob>
Globally, we've now signed up citizens <eol> in over 150 countries around the world. <eob>
And last year, we signed up more <eol> than 100,000 new members <eob> each and every week of the whole year. <eob>
See, we don't need to create <eob> global citizens <eob> from nothing. <eob>
We're already everywhere. <eob> We just need to be organized <eob> and motivated to start acting. <eob>
And this is where I believe <eol> we can learn a lot from Davinia, <eob> who started taking action <eol> as a global citizen back in 2012. <eob>
Here's what she did. <eob> It wasn't rocket science. <eob> She started writing letters, <eob> emailing politicians' offices. <eob>
She volunteered her time <eol> in her local community. <eob> That's when she got active on social media <eob> and started to collect pennies -- <eob> a lot of pennies. <eob>
Now, maybe that doesn't sound <eol> like a lot to you. <eob>
How will that achieve anything? <eob>
Well, it achieved a lot <eol> because she wasn't alone. <eob>
Her actions, alongside 142,000 other <eob> global citizens', <eob> led the US government <eol> to double their investment <eob> into Global Partnership for Education. <eob>
And here's Dr. Raj Shah, <eob> the head of USAID, making that announcement. <eob>
See, when thousands of <eob> global citizens <eob> find inspiration from each other, <eob> it's amazing to see <eol> their collective power. <eob>
Global citizens like Davinia helped <eol> persuade the World Bank <eob> to boost their investment <eol> into water and sanitation. <eob>
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage <eob> at <eob> Global Citizen, <eob> and Prime Minister Modi <eol> of India affirmed his commitment <eob> to put a toilet <eol> in every household and school across India by 2019. <eob>
Global citizens encouraged <eol> by the late-night host Stephen Colbert <eob> launched a Twitter invasion on Norway. <eob>
Erna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, <eol> got the message, <eob> committing to double investment <eol> into girls' education. <eob>
Global citizens together with Rotarians <eol> called on the Canadian, UK, <eob> and Australian governments <eob> to boost their investment <eol> into polio eradication. <eob>
They got together <eol> and committed 665 million dollars. <eob>
But despite all of this momentum, <eob> we face some huge challenges. <eob>
See, you might be thinking to yourself, <eob> how can we possibly persuade world leaders <eob> to sustain a focus on global issues? <eob>
Indeed, the powerful American politician <eol> Tip O'Neill once said, <eob> "All politics is local." <eob> That's what always got politicians elected: <eob> to seek, gain and hold onto power <eob> through the pursuit of local <eol> or at very best national interests. <eob>
I experienced this for the first time <eol> when I was 21 years old. <eob>
I took a meeting <eob> with a then-Australian Foreign Minister <eol> who shall remain nameless -- <eob>
[Alexander Downer] <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And behind closed doors, <eob> I shared with him my passion <eol> to end extreme poverty. <eob>
I said, "Minister -- Australia <eol> has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity <eob> to help achieve the Millennium <eol> Development Goals. <eob>
We can do this." <eob> And he paused, <eob> looked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes, <eob> and he said, "Hugh, <eob> no one gives a funk <eol> about foreign aid." <eob> Except he didn't use the word "funk." <eob> He went on. <eob>
He said we need to look <eol> after our own backyard first. <eob>
This is, I believe, <eob> outdated, even dangerous thinking. <eob>
Or as my late grandfather would say, <eob> complete BS. <eob>
Parochialism offers <eol> this false dichotomy <eob> because it pits the poor in one country <eol> against the poor in another. <eob>
It pretends we can isolate ourselves <eol> and our nations from one another. <eob>
The whole world is our backyard, <eob> and we ignore it at our peril. <eob>
See, look what happened <eol> when we ignored Rwanda, <eob> when we ignore Syria, <eob> when we ignore climate change. <eob>
Political leaders ought to give a "funk" <eob> because the impact of climate change <eol> and extreme poverty <eob> comes right to our shore. <eob>
Now, <eob> global citizens <eob> — they understand this. <eob>
We live in a time that favors <eol> the global citizen, <eob> in an age where every single <eol> voice can be heard. <eob>
See, do you remember <eob> when the Millennium Development <eol> Goals were signed back in the year 2000? <eob> The most we could do in those days <eol> was fire off a letter <eob> and wait for the next election. <eob>
There was no social media. <eob>
Today, billions of citizens <eol> have more tools, <eob> more access to information, <eob> more capacity to influence <eol> than ever before. <eob>
Both the problems and the tools <eol> to solve them are right before us. <eob>
The world has changed, <eob> and those of us <eol> who look beyond our borders <eob> are on the right side of history. <eob>
So where are we? <eob> So we run this amazing festival, <eob> we've scored some big policy wins, <eob> and citizens are signing up <eol> all over the world. <eob>
But have we achieved our mission? <eob> No. <eob> We have such a long way to go. <eob>
But this is the opportunity that I see. <eob>
The concept of global citizenship, <eob> self-evident in its logic <eol> but until now impractical in many ways, <eob> has coincided with this particular moment <eol> in which we are privileged to live. <eob>
We, as <eob> global citizens, <eob> now have a unique opportunity <eol> to accelerate large-scale positive change <eob> around the world. <eob>
So in the months and years ahead, <eob> global citizens <eob> will hold world leaders accountable <eob> to ensure that the new Global Goals <eol> for Sustainable Development <eob> are tracked and implemented. <eob>
Global citizens will partner <eol> with the world's leading NGOs <eob> to end diseases <eol> like polio and malaria. <eob>
Global citizens will sign up <eol> in every corner of this globe, <eob> increasing the frequency, quality <eob> and impact of their actions. <eob>
These dreams are within reach. <eob>
Imagine an army of millions <eob> growing into tens of millions, <eob> connected, informed, engaged <eob> and unwilling to take no for an answer. <eob>
Over all these years, <eob> I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy. <eob>
Sadly, I've been unable to. <eob>
We met long before social media, <eob> and his address has now been relocated <eol> by the authorities, <eob> as often happens with slums. <eob>
I'd love to sit down with him, <eob> wherever he is, <eob> and share with him how much the time <eol> I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me. <eob>
Thanks to him and so many others, <eob> I came to understand the importance <eol> of being part of a movement of people — <eob> the kids willing to look up from their screens <eol> and out to the world, <eob> the <eob> global citizens. <eob>
Global citizens who stand together, <eob> who ask the question "Why?," <eob> who reject the naysayers, <eob> and embrace the amazing possibilities <eol> of the world we share. <eob>
I'm a global citizen. <eob>
Are you? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data <eol> leak in history.] <eob> [The Panama Papers <eol> exposed rich and powerful people] <eob> [hiding vast amounts of money <eol> in offshore accounts.] <eob> [What does this mean?] <eob> [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness <eol> to explain.] <eob>
This week, there have been a whole slew <eol> and deluge of stories <eob> coming out from the leak <eol> of 11 million documents <eob> from a Panamanian-based law firm <eol> called Mossack Fonseca. <eob>
The release of these papers <eol> from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece <eob> of the secretive offshore world. <eob>
We get an insight <eol> into how clients and banks and lawyers <eob> go to companies like Mossack Fonseca <eob> and say, "OK, we want an anonymous company, <eob> can you give us one?" <eob> So you actually get to see the emails, <eob> you get to see the exchanges of messages, <eob> you get to see the mechanics <eol> of how this works, <eob> how this operates. <eob>
Now, this has already started to have <eol> pretty immediate repercussions. <eob>
The Prime Minister <eol> of Iceland has resigned. <eob>
We've also had news <eob> that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator <eol> Bashar Al-Assad <eob> has also got offshore companies. <eob>
There's been allegations <eol> of a $2 billion money trail <eob> that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia <eob> via his close childhood friend, <eob> who happens to be <eol> a top cellist. <eob>
And there will be a lot <eol> of rich individuals out there <eob> and others who will be nervous <eol> about the next set of stories <eob> and the next set of leaked documents. <eob>
Now, this sounds like the plot <eol> of a spy thriller <eob> or a John Grisham novel. <eob>
It seems very distant from you, <eol> me, ordinary people. <eob>
Why should we care about this? <eob>
But the truth is <eol> that if rich and powerful individuals <eob> are able to keep their money offshore <eob> and not pay the taxes that they should, <eob> it means that there is less money <eol> for vital public services <eob> like healthcare, education, roads. <eob>
And that affects all of us. <eob>
Now, for my organization Global Witness, <eob> this exposé has been phenomenal. <eob>
We have the world's media and political leaders <eob> talking about how individuals <eol> can use offshore secrecy <eob> to hide and disguise their assets -- <eob> something we have been talking <eol> about and exposing for a decade. <eob>
Now, I think a lot of people find <eol> this entire world baffling and confusing, <eob> and hard to understand <eol> how this sort of offshore world works. <eob>
I like to think of it a bit <eol> like a Russian doll. <eob>
So you can have one company <eol> stacked inside another company, <eob> stacked inside another company, <eob> making it almost impossible <eol> to really understand <eob> who is behind these structures. <eob>
It can be very difficult for law enforcement <eob> or tax authorities, <eol> journalists, civil society <eob> to really understand what's going on. <eob>
I also think it's interesting <eob> that there's been less coverage <eol> of this issue in the United States. <eob>
And that's perhaps <eol> because some prominent US people <eob> just haven't figured in this exposé, <eol> in this scandal. <eob>
Now, that's not because <eol> there are no rich Americans <eob> who are stashing their assets offshore. <eob>
It's just because of the way <eol> in which offshore works, <eob> Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients. <eob>
I think if we saw leaks <eol> from the Cayman Islands <eob> or even from Delaware <eol> or Wyoming or Nevada, <eob> you would see many more cases <eol> and examples linking back to Americans. <eob>
In fact, in a number of US states <eol> you need less information, <eob> you need to provide less information <eol> to get a company <eob> than you do to get a library card. <eob>
That sort of secrecy in America <eol> has allowed employees of school districts <eob> to rip off schoolchildren. <eob>
It has allowed scammers <eol> to rip off vulnerable investors. <eob>
This is the sort of behavior <eol> that affects all of us. <eob>
Now, at Global Witness, <eob> we wanted to see what this actually <eol> looked like in practice. <eob>
How does this actually work? <eob>
So what we did <eob> is we sent in an undercover investigator <eol> to 13 Manhattan law firms. <eob>
Our investigator posed as an African minister <eob> who wanted to move suspect funds <eol> into the United States <eob> to buy a house, a yacht, a jet. <eob>
Now, what was truly shocking was <eol> that all but one of those lawyers <eob> provided our investigator with suggestions <eob> on how to move those suspect funds. <eob>
These were all preliminary meetings, <eob> and none of the lawyers <eol> took us on as a client <eob> and of course no money moved hands, <eob> but it really shows the problem with the system. <eob>
It's also important <eob> to not just think about this <eol> as individual cases. <eob>
This is not just about an individual lawyer <eob> who's spoken to our undercover <eol> investigator and provided suggestions. <eob>
It's not just about a particular senior <eol> politician <eob> who's been caught up in a scandal. <eob>
This is about how a system works, <eob> that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty <eol> and instability. <eob>
And in order to tackle this, <eob> we need to change the game. <eob>
We need to change the rules of the game <eob> to make this sort of behavior harder. <eob>
This may seem like doom <eol> and gloom, <eob> like there's nothing we can do about it, <eob> like nothing has ever changed, <eob> like there will always be rich <eol> and powerful individuals. <eob>
But as a natural optimist, <eob> I do see that we are starting <eol> to get some change. <eob>
Over the last couple of years, <eob> we've seen a real push towards greater <eol> transparency <eob> when it comes to company ownership. <eob>
This issue was put <eol> on the political agenda <eob> by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron <eob> at a big G8 Summit that was held <eol> in Northern Ireland in 2013. <eob>
And since then, the European Union <eol> is going to be creating <eob> central registers <eol> at a national level <eob> of who really owns <eol> and controls companies across Europe. <eob>
One of the things that is sad is that, <eol> actually, the US is lagging behind. <eob>
There's bipartisan legislation <eol> that had been introduced <eob> in the House and the Senate, <eob> but it isn't making as much progress <eol> as we'd like to see. <eob>
So we'd really want to see <eol> the Panama leaks, <eob> this huge peek into the offshore world, <eob> be used as a way of opening up <eol> in the US and around the world. <eob>
For us at Global Witness, <eol> this is a moment for change. <eob>
We need ordinary people to get angry <eob> at the way in which people <eol> can hide their identity <eob> behind secret companies. <eob>
We need business leaders <eol> to stand up and say, <eob> "Secrecy like this <eol> is not good for business." <eob> We need political leaders <eol> to recognize the problem, <eob> and to commit to changing the law <eol> to open up this sort of secrecy. <eob>
Together, we can end the secrecy <eob> that is currently allowing tax evasion, <eob> corruption, money laundering to flourish. <eob>
I'm a copy editor. <eob> I work at The New Yorker, <eob> and copyediting for The New Yorker <eol> is like playing shortstop <eob> for a Major League Baseball team: <eob> every little movement gets <eol> picked over by the critics -- <eob> God forbid you should commit <eol> an error. <eob>
Just to clarify: copy editors <eol> don't choose what goes into the magazine. <eob>
We work at the level of the sentence, <eob> maybe the paragraph, <eob> the words, the punctuation. <eob>
Our business is in the details. <eob>
We put the diaeresis, the double dot, <eol> over the "i" in "naïve." <eob> We impose house style. <eob>
Every publication has a house style. <eob>
The New Yorker's <eol> is particularly distinctive. <eob>
We sometimes get teased for our style. <eob>
Imagine -- we still spell "teen-ager" <eol> with a hyphen, <eob> as if that word had just been coined. <eob>
But you see that hyphen <eol> in "teen-age" <eob> and that diaeresis <eol> over "coöperate," <eob> and you know you're reading The New Yorker. <eob>
Copyediting at The New Yorker <eol> is a mechanical process. <eob>
There is a related role <eol> called query proofreading, <eob> or page-OK'ing. <eob>
Whereas copyediting is mechanical, <eob> query proofreading is interpretive. <eob>
We make suggestions to the author <eol> through the editor <eob> to improve the emphasis of a sentence <eob> or point out unintentional repetitions <eob> and supply compelling alternatives. <eob>
Our purpose is to make <eol> the author look good. <eob>
Note that we give our proofs <eol> not directly to the author, <eob> but to the editor. <eob> This often creates a good cop / bad cop dynamic <eob> in which the copy editor — I'll use <eol> that as an umbrella term — <eob> is invariably the bad cop. <eob>
If we do our job well, we're invisible, <eob> but as soon as we make a mistake, <eob> we copy editors become glaringly visible. <eob>
Here is the most recent mistake <eol> that was laid at my door. <eob>
[Last Tuesday, <eol> Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment <eob> of populist no-nothingism <eol> in the Republican Party, <eob> endorsed Trump.] <eob>
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy <eol> editors?" a reader wrote. <eob> "Didn't the writer mean <eol> 'know-nothingism'?" <eob>
Ouch. <eob> There's no excuse for this mistake. <eob>
But I like it: <eol> "no-nothingism." <eob> It might be American vernacular for "nihilism." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here, another reader quotes <eol> a passage from the magazine: <eob>
[Ruby was seventy-six, <eol> but she retained her authoritative bearing; <eob> only her unsteady gait belied her age.] <eob>
He added: <eob> "Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows <eol> the meaning of 'belied,' <eob> and that it is the opposite <eol> of how it is used in this sentence. <eob> Come on! Get it together." <eob>
Belie: to give a false impression. <eob>
It should have been "betrayed." <eob>
E.B. White once wrote of commas <eol> in The New Yorker: <eob> "They fall with the precision <eol> of knives outlining a body." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And it's true -- we get <eol> a lot of complaints about commas. <eob> "Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?" <eob> There may not be on the sign, <eol> but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr." <eob> One wag wrote: <eob>
["Please, could you expel, <eol> or, at least, restrain, <eob> the comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"] <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Ah, well. <eob> In this case, those commas <eol> are well-placed, <eob> except that there should not be one <eob> between "maniac" and "on." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Also, if we must have <eol> commas around "at least," <eob> we might change it up <eol> by using dashes around that phrase: <eob> "... -- or, at least, restrain --" <eob> Perfect. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Then there's this: <eob> "Love you, love your magazine, <eob> but can you please stop writing <eol> massive numbers as text?" <eob>
[two and a half million ...] <eob>
No. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
One last cri de coeur <eol> from a spelling stickler: <eob>
["Those long stringy things <eol> are vocal cords, not chords."] <eob>
The outraged reader added, <eob> "I'm sure I'm not <eol> the first to write <eob> regarding this egregious proofreading error, <eob> but I'm equally sure I won't be the last. <eob> Fie!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I used to like getting mail. <eob>
There is a pact between writers <eol> and editors. <eob>
The editor never sells out the writer, <eob> never goes public about bad jokes <eol> that had to be cut <eob> or stories that went on too long. <eob>
A great editor saves a writer <eol> from her excesses. <eob>
Copy editors, too, have a code; <eob> we don't advertise our oversights. <eob>
I feel disloyal divulging them here, <eob> so let's have look at what we do right. <eob>
Somehow, I've gotten <eol> a reputation for sternness. <eob>
But I work with writers who know <eol> how to have their way with me. <eob>
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy," since the early 80s. <eob>
And he's one of my favorites, <eob> even though he sometimes writes a sentence <eob> that gives a copy editor pause. <eob>
Here is one from a story <eol> about Staten Island <eob> after Hurricane Sandy: <eob>
[A dock that had been broken in the middle <eol> and lost its other half <eob> sloped down toward the water, <eob> its support pipes and wires leaning forward <eob> like when you open a box <eol> of linguine and it slides out.] <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore. <eob>
But what could I do? <eob>
Technically, the "like" <eol> should be an "as," <eob> but it sounds ridiculous, <eob> as if the author were about to embark <eol> on an extended Homeric simile -- <eob> "as when you open a box of linguine." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy <eob> and let the sentence stand. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Generally, if I think something is wrong, <eob> I query it three times. <eob>
I told Sandy that not long ago in <eol> a moment of indiscretion and he said, <eob>
"Only three?" <eob>
So, he has learned to hold out. <eob>
Recently, he wrote a story <eol> for "Talk of the Town," <eob> that's the section <eol> at the front of the magazine <eob> with short pieces on subjects <eol> ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit <eob> at the Metropolitan Museum <eob> to the introduction of doggie bags in France. <eob>
Sandy's story was about <eol> the return to the Bronx <eob> of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. <eob>
There were three things <eol> in it that I had to challenge. <eob>
First, a grammar query. <eob>
The justice was wearing black <eol> and Sandy wrote, <eob>
[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, <eol> mostly dark painting.] <eob>
Now, unlike with the hurricane, <eob> with this "like," the author <eol> didn't have the excuse <eob> of describing hurricane damage. <eob> "Like" in this sense <eol> is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object, <eob> which is a noun. <eob>
This "like" had to be an "as." <eob> "As in an old, mostly dark painting." <eob>
Second, a spelling issue. <eob>
The author was quoting someone <eol> who was assisting the justice: <eob>
["It will be just a minute. <eob>
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"] <eob>
Mic'ed? <eob> The music industry spells it "mic" <eob> because that's how <eol> it's spelled on the equipment. <eob>
I'd never seen it used <eol> as a verb with this spelling, <eob> and I was distraught <eol> to think that "mic'ed" <eob> would get into the magazine on my watch. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
New Yorker style for "microphone" <eol> in its abbreviated form is "mike." <eob>
Finally, there was a sticky grammar <eol> and usage issue <eob> in which the pronoun has to have <eol> the same grammatical number <eob> as its antecedent. <eob>
[everyone in the vicinity <eol> held their breath] <eob>
"Their" is plural and "everyone," <eol> its antecedent, is singular. <eob>
You would never say, "Everyone were there." <eob> Everyone was there. Everyone is here. <eob> But people say things like, <eol> "Everyone held their breath" all the time. <eob>
To give it legitimacy, <eob> copy editors call it <eol> "the singular 'their,'" <eob> as if calling it singular makes it <eol> no longer plural. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It is my job when I see it in print <eol> to do my best to eliminate it. <eob>
I couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath," <eob> or "Everyone held his breath," <eob> or "Everyone held his or her breath." <eob> Whatever I suggested had to blend in. <eob>
I asked, through the editor, <eob> if the author would consider changing it <eob> to "All in the vicinity <eol> held their breath," <eob> because "all" is plural. <eob> Nope. <eob>
I tried again: "All those present <eol> held their breath?" <eob> I thought this sounded vaguely judicial. <eob>
But the editor pointed out <eob> that we could not have "present" <eol> and "presence" <eob> in the same sentence. <eob>
When the final proof came back, <eob> the author had accepted "as" for "like," <eob> and "miked" for "mic'ed." <eob> But on "Everyone held their breath," <eol> he stood his ground. <eob>
Two out of three isn't bad. <eob>
In the same issue, <eob> in that piece on doggie bags in France, <eob> there was the gratuitous use <eol> of the f-word by a Frenchman. <eob>
I wonder, when the mail comes in, <eob> which will have offended the readers more. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I have one more reason for optimism: <eob> climate change. <eob>
Maybe you don't believe it, <eol> but here is the fact. <eob>
On December 12, 2015, <eob> in Paris, under the United Nations, <eob> 195 governments got together <eob> and unanimously -- <eob> if you've worked with governments, <eol> you know how difficult that is -- <eob> unanimously decided <eob> to intentionally change the course <eol> of the global economy <eob> in order to protect the most vulnerable <eob> and improve the life of all of us. <eob>
Now, that is a remarkable achievement. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But it is even more remarkable <eob> if you consider where we had been <eol> just a few years ago. <eob> 2009, Copenhagen. <eob> Who remembers Copenhagen? <eob> Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement, <eob> the same governments convened in Copenhagen <eob> and failed miserably. <eob>
Why did it fail miserably? <eob> For many different reasons, <eob> but primarily because of the deeply <eol> entrenched divide <eob> between the global North <eol> and the global South. <eob>
So now, six months after this failure, <eob> I was called in to assume the responsibility <eob> of the global <eob> climate change <eob> negotiations. <eob>
You can imagine, the perfect moment <eol> to start this new job. <eob>
The global mood on <eob> climate change <eob> was in the trash can. <eob>
No one believed <eob> that a global agreement <eol> could ever be possible. <eob>
In fact, neither did I. <eob> If you promise not to tell anyone <eol> outside of this wonderful TED audience, <eob> I'm going to divulge a secret <eob> that has been gratefully buried by history. <eob>
On my first press conference, <eob> a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres, <eob> do you think that a global agreement <eol> is ever going to be possible?" <eob> And without engaging brain, <eol> I heard me utter, <eob> "Not in my lifetime." <eob> Well, you can imagine <eol> the faces of my press team <eob> who were horrified <eol> at this crazy Costa Rican woman <eob> who was their new boss. <eob>
And I was horrified, too. <eob>
Now, I wasn't horrified at me, <eol> because I'm kind of used to myself. <eob>
I was actually horrified <eob> at the consequences of what I had just said, <eob> at the consequences for the world <eob> in which all our children <eol> are going to have to live. <eob>
It was frankly a horrible moment for me, <eob> and I thought, well, no, hang on, <eob> hang on. <eob>
Impossible is not a fact, <eob> it's an attitude. <eob> It's only an attitude. <eob>
And I decided right then and there <eol> that I was going to change my attitude <eob> and I was going to help the world <eol> change its attitude on <eob> climate change. <eob>
So I don't know — <eob> No, just this? Thanks. <eob> I don't know — <eob> what you would do <eob> if you were told your job <eol> is to save the planet. <eob>
Put that on the job description. <eob>
And you have full responsibility, <eob> but you have absolutely no authority, <eob> because governments are sovereign <eol> in every decision that they take. <eob>
Well, I would really love to know <eob> what you would do <eob> on the first Monday morning, <eob> but here's what I did: I panicked. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I panicked again, <eob> because I realized I have no idea <eol> how we're going to solve this problem. <eob>
And then I realized I have no idea <eol> how we're going to solve this problem, <eob> but I do know one thing: <eob> we have got to change the tone <eol> of this conversation. <eob>
Because there is no way <eol> you can deliver victory <eob> without optimism. <eob>
And here, <eob> I use optimism as a very simple word, <eob> but let's understand it <eol> in its broader sense. <eob>
Let's understand it as courage, <eob> hope, trust, solidarity, <eob> the fundamental belief <eol> that we humans can come together <eob> and can help each other <eol> to better the fate of mankind. <eob>
Well, you can imagine <eol> that I thought that without that, <eob> there was no way we were going to get out <eol> of the paralysis of Copenhagen. <eob>
And for six years, <eob> I have stubbornly, relentlessly injected <eol> optimism into the system, <eob> no matter what the questions <eol> from the press -- <eob> and I have gotten better at those -- <eob> and no matter what the evidence <eol> to the contrary. <eob>
And believe you me, <eol> there has been a lot of contrary evidence. <eob>
But relentless optimism into the system. <eob>
And pretty soon, <eob> we began to see changes <eol> happening in many areas, <eob> precipitated by thousands of people, <eob> including many of you here today, <eob> and I thank you. <eob>
And this TED community <eol> will not be surprised <eob> if I tell you the first area <eob> in which we saw remarkable change <eob> was... <eob> technology. <eob>
We began to see that clean technologies, <eob> in particular renewable energy technologies, <eob> began to drop price and increase <eol> in capacity, <eob> to the point where today we are already building <eob> concentrated solar power plants <eob> that have the capacity to power <eol> entire cities, <eob> to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility <eob> and intelligent buildings. <eob>
And with this shift in technologies, <eob> we were able to begin to understand <eob> that there was a shift in the economic equation, <eob> because we were able to recognize <eob> that yes, there are huge costs <eol> to climate change, <eob> and yes, there are compounded risks. <eob>
But there also are economic advantages <eob> and intrinsic benefits, <eob> because the dissemination <eol> of the clean technologies <eob> is going to bring us cleaner air, <eob> better health, <eob> better transportation, more livable cities, <eob> more energy security, <eob> more energy access <eol> to the developing world. <eob>
In sum, a better world <eol> than what we have now. <eob>
And with that understanding, <eob> you should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were, <eob> the spread of ingenuity <eol> and excitement <eob> that went through, first through <eol> nonnational governments, <eob> the private sector, captains <eol> of industry, insurance companies, <eob> investors, city leaders, faith communities, <eob> because they all began to understand, <eol> this actually can be in their interest. <eob>
This can actually improve <eol> their bottom line. <eob>
And it wasn't just the usual suspects. <eob>
I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, <eol> major oil and gas company <eob> come to me <eol> at the beginning of last year <eob> and say — <eob> privately, of course — <eob> he did not know how he was going <eol> to change his company, <eob> but he is going to change it, <eob> because he's interested in long-term viability. <eob>
Well, now we have a shift <eol> in the economic equation, <eob> and with that, with broader support from everyone, <eob> it did not take very long before <eol> we saw that national governments <eob> woke up to the fact that this <eol> is in their national interest. <eob>
And when we asked countries <eol> to begin to identify <eob> how they could contribute <eol> to global efforts <eob> but based on their national interest, <eob> 189 countries out of 195, <eob> 189 countries <eol> sent their comprehensive <eob> climate change <eob> plans, <eob> based on their national interest, <eob> concurrent with their priorities, <eob> consistent with their national sustainable development plans. <eob>
Well, <eob> once you protect the core interests of nations, <eob> then you can understand that nations were ready <eob> to begin to converge <eol> onto a common path, <eob> onto a common direction of travel <eob> that is going to take us probably several decades, <eob> but over those several decades <eol> is going to take us <eob> into the new economy, <eob> into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy, <eob> And the national contributions <eol> that are currently on the table <eob> on behalf of national governments <eob> are insufficient to get us <eol> to a stabilized climate, <eob> but they are only the first step, <eob> and they will improve over time. <eob>
And the measurement, reporting and verification <eol> of all of those efforts <eob> is legally binding. <eob>
is legally binding. <eob> And the checkpoints that we're going <eol> to have every five years <eob> to assess collective progress <eol> towards our goal are legally binding, <eob> and the path itself toward a decarbonized <eol> and more resilient economy <eob>
And here's the more important part: <eob> What did we have before? <eob>
Now what do we have? <eob>
Now we have all countries of the world <eol> contributing with different intensities <eob> from different approaches in different sectors, <eob> but all of them contributing to a common goal <eob> and along a path <eob> with environmental integrity. <eob>
Well, once you have all of this in place <eob> and you have shifted this understanding, <eob> then you see that governments <eol> were able to go to Paris <eob> and adopt the Paris agreement. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, <eob> as I look back <eob> over the past six years, <eob> first I remember <eob> the day the Paris agreement was adopted. <eob>
I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room. <eob>
5,000 people jumping out of their seats, <eob> crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, <eob> torn between euphoria and still disbelief <eol> at what they had just seen, <eob> because so many people <eob> had worked for years towards this, <eol> and this was finally their reality. <eob>
And it wasn't just those <eol> who had participated directly. <eob>
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague <eob> who was trying to decide <eob> on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give <eol> to his wonderful wife Natasha. <eob>
And once he had finally decided <eol> what he was going to buy, <eob> the jeweler said to him, <eob> "You know, you're very lucky <eol> that you're buying this now, <eob> because these pearls <eol> could go extinct very soon because of climate change." <eob> "But," the jeweler said, "have you heard, <eob> the governments have just come to a decision, <eob> and Tahiti could have a chance." <eob> Well, what a fantastic confirmation <eob> that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, <eob> here is a possible chance. <eob>
I'm the first one to recognize <eol> that we have a lot of work still to do. <eob>
We've only just started our work on <eob> climate change. <eob>
And in fact, we need to make sure <eol> that we redouble our efforts <eob> over the next five years <eol> that are the urgent five years. <eob>
But I do believe <eob> that we have come <eob> over the past six years <eob> from the impossible <eob> to the now unstoppable. <eob> And how did we do that? <eol> By injecting transformational optimism <eob> that allowed us <eol> to go from confrontation to collaboration, <eob> that allowed us to understand <eol> that national and local interests <eob> are not necessarily at odds <eol> with global needs, <eob> and that if we understand <eol> that, we can bring them together <eob> and we can merge them harmoniously. <eob>
And as I look forward <eol> to other global issues <eob> that will require <eol> our attention this century -- <eob> food security, water security, <eol> home security, forced migration -- <eob> I see that we certainly do not know <eob> how we are going to solve <eol> those problems yet. <eob>
But we can take a page <eol> out of what we have done on <eob> climate change <eob> and we can understand <eob> that we have got to reinterpret <eol> the zero-sum mentality. <eob>
Because we were trained to believe <eol> that there always are winners and losers, <eob> and that your loss is my gain. <eob>
Well, <eob> now that we're in a world <eob> in which we have reached <eol> planetary boundaries <eob> and that we are not just so interconnected, <eob> but increasingly interdependent on each other, <eob> your loss is no longer my gain. <eob>
We're either all losers <eob> or we all can be winners. <eob>
But we are going to have to decide <eob> between zero and sum. <eob>
We're going to have to decide <eol> between zero benefit for all <eob> or living life as the sum of all of us. <eob>
We've done it once. We can do it again. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm turning 44 next month, <eob> and I have the sense that 44 <eol> is going to be a very good year, <eob> a year of fulfillment, realization. <eob>
I have that sense, <eob> not because of anything <eol> particular in store for me, <eob> but because I read it would be a good year <eob> in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer. <eob>
"He felt his own age, <eol> forty-four ..." <eob> wrote Mailer in "The <eol> Armies of the Night," <eob> "... felt as if he were a solid embodiment <eob> of bone, muscle, heart, mind, <eol> and sentiment to be a man, <eob> as if he had arrived." <eob>
Yes, I know Mailer wasn't <eol> writing about me. <eob>
But I also know that he was; <eob> for all of us -- you, me, the subject of his book, <eob> age more or less in step, <eob> proceed from birth along the same great sequence: <eob> through the wonders and confinements <eol> of childhood; <eob> the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; <eob> the empowerments and millstones of adulthood; <eob> the recognitions and resignations of old age. <eob>
There are patterns to life, <eob> and they are shared. <eob>
As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen <eol> to me as to them." <eob>
We don't simply live these patterns. <eob> We record them, too. <eob> We write them down in books, <eol> where they become narratives <eob> that we can then read and recognize. <eob>
Books tell us who we've been, <eob> who we are, who we will be, too. <eob>
So they have for millennia. <eob>
As James Salter wrote, <eob> "Life passes into pages <eol> if it passes into anything." <eob>
And so six years ago, <eol> a thought leapt to mind: <eob> if life passed into pages, <eol> there were, somewhere, <eob> passages written about every age. <eob>
If I could find them, I could assemble them <eol> into a narrative. <eob> I could assemble them into a life, <eob> a long life, a hundred-year life, <eob> the entirety of that same great sequence <eob> through which the luckiest <eol> among us pass. <eob>
I was then 37 years old, <eob> "an age of discretion," <eol> wrote William Trevor. <eob>
I was prone to meditating on time and age. <eob>
An illness in the family and later an injury to me <eob> had long made clear that growing old <eol> could not be assumed. <eob>
And besides, growing old only <eol> postponed the inevitable, <eob> time seeing through what circumstance did not. <eob>
It was all a bit disheartening. <eob>
A list, though, would last. <eob>
To chronicle a life year <eol> by vulnerable year <eob> would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting, <eob> would be to provide myself <eol> and others a glimpse into the future, <eob> whether we made it there or not. <eob>
And when I then began to compile my list, <eol> I was quickly obsessed, <eob> searching pages and pages for ages and ages. <eob>
Here we were at every annual step <eol> through our first hundred years. <eob> "Twenty-seven ... a time <eol> of sudden revelations," <eob> "sixty-two, ... of subtle <eol> diminishments." <eob>
I was mindful, of course, <eol> that such insights were relative. <eob>
For starters, we now live longer, <eol> and so age more slowly. <eob>
Christopher Isherwood used <eol> the phrase "the yellow leaf" <eob> to describe a man at 53, <eob> only one century after Lord Byron used it <eol> to describe himself at 36. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was mindful, too, that life <eol> can swing wildly and unpredictably <eob> from one year to the next, <eob> and that people may experience <eol> the same age differently. <eob>
But even so, as the list coalesced, <eob> so, too, on the page, clear <eol> as the reflection in the mirror, <eob> did the life that I had been living: <eob> finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure <eol> of who one is;" <eob> emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation <eol> into active life;" <eob> learning at 40 "... to close softly <eol> the doors to rooms <eob> [I would] not be coming back to." <eob> There I was. <eob>
Of course, there we all are. <eob>
Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer <eob> whose beautiful visualizations <eol> you see here, <eob> and who today is 85 -- <eob> all those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," <eol> wrote Nabokov -- <eob> noted to me that, like art and like color, <eob> literature helps us to remember <eol> what we've experienced. <eob>
And indeed, when I shared <eol> the list with my grandfather, <eob> he nodded in recognition. <eob>
He was then 95 and soon to die, <eob> which, wrote Roberto Bolaño, <eob> "... is the same as never dying." <eob> And looking back, he said <eol> to me that, yes, <eob> Proust was right that at 22, <eol> we are sure we will not die, <eob> just as a thanatologist <eol> named Edwin Shneidman was right <eob> that at 90, we are sure we will. <eob>
It had happened to him, <eob> as to them. <eob>
Now the list is done: <eob> a hundred years. <eob>
And looking back over it, <eob> I know that I am not done. <eob>
I still have my life to live, <eob> still have many more pages to pass into. <eob>
And mindful of Mailer, <eob> I await 44. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Periods. <eob> Blood. <eob> Menstruation. <eob> Gross. <eob> Secret. <eob> Hidden. <eob> Why? <eob>
A natural biological process <eob> that every girl and woman <eol> goes through every month <eob> for about half of her life. <eob>
A phenomenon that is so significant <eob> that the survival and propagation <eol> of our species depends on it. <eob>
Yet we consider it a taboo. <eob>
We feel awkward <eol> and shameful talking about it. <eob>
When I got my first periods, <eob> I was told to keep it <eol> a secret from others -- <eob> even from my father and brother. <eob>
Later when this chapter <eol> appeared in our textbooks, <eob> our biology teacher skipped the subject. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know what I learned from it? <eob>
I learned that it is really <eol> shameful to talk about it. <eob>
I learned to be ashamed of my body. <eob>
I learned to stay unaware of periods <eob> in order to stay decent. <eob>
Research in various parts of India <eob> shows that three out of every 10 girls <eol> are not aware of menstruation <eob> at the time of their first periods. <eob>
And in some parts of Rajasthan <eob> this number is as high as nine <eol> out of 10 girls being unaware of it. <eob>
You'd be surprised to know <eob> that most of the girls <eol> that I have spoken to, <eob> who did not know about periods <eol> at the time of their first menstruation <eob> thought that they have got blood cancer <eob> and they're going to die soon. <eob>
Menstrual hygiene <eol> is a very important risk factor <eob> for reproductive tract infections. <eob>
But in India, only 12 percent <eol> of girls and women <eob> have access to hygienic ways <eol> of managing their periods. <eob>
If you do the math, <eob> 88 percent of girls and women use <eol> unhygienic ways to manage their periods. <eob>
I was one of them. <eob> I grew up in a small town <eol> called Garhwa, in Jharkhand, <eob> where even buying a sanitary napkin <eol> is considered shameful. <eob>
So when I started getting my periods, <eob> I began with using rags. <eob>
After every use <eol> I would wash and reuse them. <eob>
But to store them, <eob> I would hide and keep it <eol> in a dark, damp place <eob> so that nobody finds out <eol> that I'm menstruating. <eob>
Due to repeated washing <eol> the rags would become coarse, <eob> and I would often get rashes <eol> and infections using them. <eob>
I wore these already for five years <eol> until I moved out of that town. <eob>
Another issue <eol> that periods brought in my life <eob> those of the social restrictions <eob> that are imposed upon our girls <eol> and women when they're on their periods. <eob>
I think you all must be aware of it, <eob> but I'll still list it <eol> for the few who don't. <eob>
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. <eob>
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa <eol> or some other family member's bed. <eob>
I had to wash my bed sheet <eol> after every period, <eob> even if it was not stained. <eob>
I was considered impure <eob> and forbidden from worshipping or touching <eol> any object of religious importance. <eob>
You'll find signposts outside temples <eob> denying the entry <eol> of menstruating girls and women. <eob>
Ironically, <eob> most of the time it is the older woman <eob> who imposes such restrictions <eol> on younger girls in a family. <eob>
After all, they have grown up <eol> accepting such restrictions as norms. <eob>
And in the absence of any intervention, <eob> it is the myth and misconception <eob> that propagate <eol> from generation to generation. <eob>
During my years of work in this field, <eob> I have even come across stories <eob> where girls have to eat <eol> and wash their dishes separately. <eob>
They're not allowed <eol> to take baths during periods, <eob> and in some households they are even <eol> secluded from other family members. <eob>
About 85 percent of girls <eol> and women in India <eob> would follow one or more restrictive <eol> customs on their periods every month. <eob>
Can you imagine what this does <eob> to the self-esteem <eol> and self-confidence of a young girl? <eob>
The psychological trauma <eol> that this inflicts, <eob> affecting her personality, <eob> her academic performance <eob> and every single aspect of growing up <eol> during her early formative years? <eob>
I religiously followed all these <eol> restrictive customs for 13 years, <eob> until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin, <eob> changed my perception <eol> about menstruation forever. <eob>
In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing <eol> our postgraduation in design. <eob>
We fell in love with each other <eob> and I was at ease <eol> discussing periods with him. <eob>
Tuhin knew little about periods. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He was astonished to know <eol> that girls get painful cramps <eob> and we bleed every month. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob> He was completely shocked to know <eob> about the restrictions that are imposed <eol> upon menstruating girls and women <eob> by their own families and their society. <eob>
In order to help me with my cramps, <eob> he would go on the Internet <eol> and learn more about menstruation. <eob>
When he shared his findings with me, <eob> I realized how little I knew <eol> about menstruation myself. <eob>
And many of my beliefs actually <eol> turned out to be myths. <eob>
That's when we wondered: <eob> if we, being so well educated, <eob> were so ill-informed about menstruation, <eob> there would be millions of girls out there <eol> who would be ill-informed, too. <eob>
To study -- <eob> to understand the problem better, <eob> I undertook a year-long research to study <eol> the lack of awareness about menstruation <eob> and the root cause behind it. <eob>
While it is generally believed <eob> that menstrual unawareness <eol> and misconception is a rural phenomenon, <eob> during my research, <eob> I found that it is as much <eol> an urban phenomenon as well. <eob>
And it exists <eol> with the educated urban class, also. <eob>
While talking to many <eol> parents and teachers, <eob> I found that many of them actually <eol> wanted to educate girls about periods <eob> before they have started <eol> getting their menstrual cycle. <eob>
And -- <eob> but they lacked <eol> the proper means themselves. <eob>
And since it is a taboo, <eob> they feel inhibition and shameful <eol> in talking about it. <eob>
Girls nowadays get their periods <eol> in classes six and seven, <eob> but our educational curriculum <eob> teaches girls about periods <eol> only in standard eight and nine. <eob>
And since it is a taboo, <eob> teachers still skip <eol> the subject altogether. <eob>
So school does not <eol> teach girls about periods, <eob> parents don't talk about it. <eob>
Where do the girls go? <eob>
Two decades ago and now -- <eob> nothing has changed. <eob>
I shared these finding with Tuhin <eol> and we wondered: <eob> What if we could create something <eob> that would help girls understand <eol> about menstruation on their own -- <eob> something that would help <eol> parents and teachers <eob> talk about periods <eol> comfortably to young girls? <eob>
During my research, <eob> I was collecting a lot of stories. <eob>
These were stories of experiences <eol> of girls during their periods. <eob>
These stories would make girls <eol> curious and interested <eob> in talking about menstruation <eol> in their close circle. <eob>
That's what we wanted. <eob>
We wanted something <eol> that would make the girls curious <eob> and drive them to learn about it. <eob>
We wanted to use these stories <eol> to teach girls about periods. <eob>
So we decided to create a comic book, <eob> where the cartoon characters <eol> would enact these stories <eob> and educate girls about menstruation <eol> in a fun and engaging way. <eob>
To represent girls <eol> in their different phases of puberty, <eob> we have three characters. <eob>
Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet, <eob> Jiya who gets her period <eol> during the narrative of the book <eob> and Mira who has already <eol> been getting her period. <eob>
There is a fourth character, Priya Didi. <eob>
Through her, girls come to know <eol> about the various aspects of growing up <eob> and menstrual hygiene management. <eob>
While making the book, we took great care <eob> that none of the illustrations <eol> were objectionable in any way <eob> and that it is culturally sensitive. <eob>
During our prototype testing, <eol> we found that the girls loved the book. <eob>
They were keen on reading it <eob> and knowing more and more <eol> about periods on their own. <eob>
Parents and teachers were <eol> comfortable in talking about periods <eob> to young girls using the book, <eob> and sometimes even boys <eol> were interested in reading it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The comic book helped <eol> in creating an environment <eob> where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. <eob>
Many of the volunteers took this prototype <eol> themselves to educate girls <eob> and take menstrual awareness workshops <eol> in five different states in India. <eob>
And one of the volunteers <eol> took this prototype to educate young monks <eob> and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. <eob>
We made the final version of the book, <eol> called "Menstrupedia Comic" <eob> and launched in September last year. <eob>
And so far, <eob> more than 4,000 girls have been <eol> educated by using the book in India and -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
And 10 different countries. <eob> We are constantly translating the book <eol> into different languages <eob> and collaborating <eol> with local organizations <eob> to make this book available <eol> in different countries. <eob>
15 schools in different parts of India <eob> have made this book <eol> a part of their school curriculum <eob> to teach girls about menstruation. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am amazed to see how volunteers, <eob> individuals, parents, <eol> teachers, school principals, <eob> have come together <eob> and taken this menstrual awareness <eol> drive to their own communities, <eob> have made sure that the girls <eol> learn about periods at the right age <eob> and helped in breaking this taboo. <eob>
I dream of a future <eol> where menstruation is not a curse, <eob> not a disease, <eob> but a welcoming change in a girl's life. <eob> And I would -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I would like to end this <eob> with a small request <eol> to all the parents here. <eob>
Dear parents, <eob> if you would be ashamed of periods, <eob> your daughters would be, too. <eob>
So please be period positive. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
How do you find a dinosaur? <eob>
Sounds impossible, doesn't it? <eob> It's not. <eob> And the answer relies on a formula <eol> that all paleontologists use. <eob>
And I'm going to tell you the secret. <eob>
First, find rocks of the right age. <eob>
Second, those rocks <eol> must be sedimentary rocks. <eob>
And third, layers of those rocks <eol> must be naturally exposed. <eob> That's it. <eob> Find those three things <eol> and get yourself on the ground, <eob> chances are good that you <eol> will find fossils. <eob>
Now let me break down this formula. <eob> Organisms exist only during certain <eol> geological intervals. <eob>
So you have to find rocks <eol> of the right age, <eob> depending on what your interests are. <eob>
If you want to find trilobites, <eob> you have to find the really, really old rocks <eol> of the Paleozoic -- <eob> rocks between a half a billion <eol> and a quarter-billion years old. <eob>
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, <eob> don't look in the Paleozoic, <eol> you won't find them. <eob>
They hadn't evolved yet. <eob>
You have to find the younger rocks <eol> of the Mesozoic, <eob> and in the case of dinosaurs, <eob> between 235 and 66 million years ago. <eob>
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks <eol> of the right age at this point, <eob> because the Earth is, to a coarse degree, <eob> geologically mapped. <eob>
This is hard-won information. <eob>
The annals of Earth history <eol> are written in rocks, <eob> one chapter upon the next, <eob> such that the oldest pages are on bottom <eob> and the youngest on top. <eob>
It's not. <eob> Now, were it quite that easy, <eol> geologists would rejoice. <eob> The library of Earth <eol> is an old one. <eob>
It has no librarian to impose order. <eob>
Operating over vast swaths of time, <eob> myriad geological processes <eol> offer every possible insult <eob> to the rocks of ages. <eob>
Most pages are destroyed soon after <eol> being written. <eob>
Some pages are overwritten, <eob> creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests <eol> of long-gone landscapes. <eob>
Pages that do find sanctuary <eol> under the advancing sands of time <eob> are never truly safe. <eob>
Unlike the Moon -- our dead, <eol> rocky companion -- <eob> the Earth is alive, pulsing <eol> with creative and destructive forces <eob> that power its geological metabolism. <eob>
Lunar rocks brought back <eol> by the Apollo astronauts <eob> all date back to about the age <eol> of the Solar System. <eob>
Moon rocks are forever. <eob>
Earth rocks, on the other hand, <eol> face the perils of a living lithosphere. <eob>
All will suffer ruination, <eob> through some combination <eol> of mutilation, compression, <eob> folding, tearing, scorching and baking. <eob>
Thus, the volumes of Earth history <eol> are incomplete and disheveled. <eob>
The library is vast and magnificent -- <eob> but decrepit. <eob>
And it was this tattered complexity <eol> in the rock record <eob> that obscured its meaning <eol> until relatively recently. <eob>
Nature provided no card <eol> catalog for geologists -- <eob> this would have to be invented. <eob>
Five thousand years after the Sumerians learned <eol> to record their thoughts <eob> on clay tablets, <eob> the Earth's volumes remained <eol> inscrutable to humans. <eob>
We were geologically illiterate, <eob> unaware of the antiquity of our own planet <eob> and ignorant of our connection <eob> to deep time. <eob>
It wasn't until the turn <eol> of the 19th century <eob> that our blinders were removed, <eob> first, with the publication <eol> of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth," <eob> in which he told us <eol> that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning <eob> and no prospect of an end; <eob> and then, with the printing <eol> of William Smith's map of Britain, <eob> the first country-scale geological map, <eob> giving us for the first time <eob> predictive insight <eol> into where certain types of rocks might occur. <eob>
After that, you could say things like, <eob> "If we go over there, <eol> we should be in the Jurassic," <eob> or, "If we go up over that hill, <eol> we should find the Cretaceous." <eob>
So now, if you want to find trilobites, <eob> get yourself a good geological map <eob> and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic. <eob>
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do, <eob> find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there. <eob>
Now of course, you can only make <eol> a fossil in a sedimentary rock, <eob> a rock made by sand and mud. <eob>
You can't have a fossil <eob> in an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite, <eob> or in a metamorphic rock <eol> that's been heated and squeezed. <eob>
And you have to get yourself in a desert. <eob>
It's not <eob> that dinosaurs <eol> particularly lived in deserts; <eob> they lived on every land mass <eob> and in every imaginable environment. <eob>
It's that you need to go to a place <eol> that's a desert today, <eob> a place that doesn't have too many plants <eol> covering up the rocks, <eob> and a place where erosion is always exposing <eol> new bones at the surface. <eob>
So find those three things: <eob> rocks of the right age, <eob> that are sedimentary rocks, <eol> in a desert, <eob> and get yourself on the ground, <eob> and you literally walk <eob> until you see a bone <eol> sticking out of the rock. <eob>
Here's a picture that I took <eol> in Southern Patagonia. <eob>
Every pebble that you see <eol> on the ground there <eob> is a piece of dinosaur bone. <eob>
So when you're in that right situation, <eob> it's not a question <eol> of whether you'll find fossils or not; <eob> you're going to find fossils. <eob>
The question is: Will you find something <eol> that is scientifically significant? <eob>
And to help with that, I'm going <eol> to add a fourth part to our formula, <eob> which is this: <eob> get as far away from other <eol> paleontologists as possible. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's not <eob> that I don't like other paleontologists. <eob>
When you go to a place <eol> that's relatively unexplored, <eob> you have a much better chance <eol> of not only finding fossils <eob> but of finding something <eol> that's new to science. <eob>
So that's my formula <eol> for finding dinosaurs, <eob> and I've applied it all around the world. <eob>
In the austral summer of 2004, <eob> I went to the bottom of South America, <eob> to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina, <eob> to prospect for dinosaurs: <eob> a place that had terrestrial sedimentary <eob> rocks of the right age, <eob> in a desert, <eob> a place that had been barely visited <eol> by paleontologists. <eob>
And we found this. <eob>
This is a femur, a thigh bone, <eob> of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur. <eob>
That bone is 2.2 meters across. <eob>
That's over seven feet long. <eob>
Now, unfortunately, <eol> that bone was isolated. <eob>
We dug and dug and dug, <eol> and there wasn't another bone around. <eob>
But it made us hungry <eol> to go back the next year for more. <eob>
And on the first day <eol> of that next field season, <eob> I found this: another two-meter femur, <eob> only this time not isolated, <eob> this time associated <eol> with 145 other bones <eob> of a giant plant eater. <eob>
And after three more hard, <eol> really brutal field seasons, <eob> the quarry came to look like this. <eob>
And there you see the tail of that great <eol> beast wrapping around me. <eob>
The giant that lay in this grave, <eol> the new species of dinosaur, <eob> we would eventually call "Dreadnoughtus schrani." <eob> Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet <eol> from snout to tail. <eob>
It stood two-and-a-half <eol> stories at the shoulder, <eob> and all fleshed out in life, <eol> it weighed 65 tons. <eob>
People ask me sometimes, <eol> "Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?" <eob> That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex. <eob>
Now, one of the really cool things <eol> about being a paleontologist <eob> is when you find a new species, <eol> you get to name it. <eob>
And I've always thought it a shame <eol> that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs <eob> are too often portrayed as passive, <eol> lumbering platters of meat <eob> on the landscape. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They're not. <eob> Big herbivores can be surly, <eol> and they can be territorial -- <eob> you do not want to mess <eol> with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo. <eob>
The bison in Yellowstone injure <eol> far more people than do the grizzly bears. <eob>
So can you imagine <eol> a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus <eob> in the breeding season, <eob> defending a territory? <eob>
That animal would have been <eol> incredibly dangerous, <eob> a menace to all around, <eol> and itself would have had nothing to fear. <eob>
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus," <eob> or, "fears nothing." <eob>
Now, to grow so large, <eob> an animal like Dreadnoughtus <eol> would've had to have been <eob> a model of efficiency. <eob>
That long neck and long tail help it <eol> radiate heat into the environment, <eob> passively controlling its temperature. <eob>
And that long neck also serves <eol> as a super-efficient feeding mechanism. <eob>
Dreadnoughtus could stand <eol> in one place and with that neck <eob> clear out a huge envelope of vegetation, <eob> taking in tens of thousands of calories <eol> while expending very few. <eob>
And these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance, <eob> giving them immense stability, <eob> because when you're 65 tons, when you're <eol> literally as big as a house, <eob> the penalty for falling over <eob> is death. <eob>
Yeah, these animals are big and tough, <eob> but they won't take a blow like that. <eob>
Dreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break <eol> and pierce lungs. <eob> Organs burst. <eob> If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus, <eob> you don't get to fall down in life -- <eol> even once. <eob>
Now, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried <eob> and de-fleshed by a multitude <eol> of bacteria, worms and insects, <eob> its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis, <eob> exchanging molecules <eol> with the groundwater <eob> and becoming more and more like the entombing rock. <eob>
As layer upon layer <eol> of sediment accumulated, <eob> pressure from all sides <eol> weighed in like a stony glove <eob> whose firm and enduring grip held each bone <eol> in a stabilizing embrace. <eob>
And then came the long ... <eob> nothing. <eob>
Epoch after epoch of sameness, <eob> nonevents without number. <eob>
All the while, the skeleton <eol> lay everlasting and unchanging <eob> in perfect equilibrium <eob> within its rocky grave. <eob>
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above. <eob>
The dinosaurs would reign <eol> for another 12 million years <eob> before their hegemony was snuffed <eol> out in a fiery apocalypse. <eob> The continents drifted. The mammals rose. <eob> The Ice Age came. <eob>
And then, in East Africa, <eob> an unpromising species of ape <eol> evolved the odd trick of sentient thought. <eob>
These brainy primates <eol> were not particularly fast or strong. <eob>
But they excelled at covering ground, <eob> and in a remarkable diaspora <eob> surpassing even the dinosaurs' record <eol> of territorial conquest, <eob> they dispersed across the planet, <eob> ravishing every ecosystem they encountered, <eob> along the way, inventing culture <eol> and metalworking and painting <eob> and dance and music <eob> and science <eob> and rocket ships that would eventually <eol> take 12 particularly excellent apes <eob> to the surface of the Moon. <eob>
With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet, <eob> it was perhaps inevitable <eob> that one of them would eventually trod <eol> on the grave of the magnificent titan <eob> buried beneath the badlands <eol> of Southern Patagonia. <eob>
I was that ape. <eob>
And standing there, alone in the desert, <eob> it was not lost on me <eob> that the chance of any one individual <eol> entering the fossil record <eob> is vanishingly small. <eob>
But the Earth is very, very old. <eob>
And over vast tracts of time, <eol> the improbable becomes the probable. <eob>
That's the magic of the geological record. <eob>
Thus, multitudinous creatures <eol> living and dying on an old planet <eob> leave behind immense numbers of fossils, <eob> each one a small miracle, <eob> but collectively, inevitable. <eob>
Sixty-six million years ago, <eol> an asteroid hits the Earth <eob> and wipes out the dinosaurs. <eob>
This easily might not have been. <eob>
But we only get one history, <eol> and it's the one that we have. <eob>
But this particular reality <eol> was not inevitable. <eob>
The tiniest perturbation <eol> of that asteroid far from Earth <eob> would have caused it to miss our planet <eol> by a wide margin. <eob>
The pivotal, calamitous day <eol> during which the dinosaurs were wiped out, <eob> setting the stage for the modern world <eol> as we know it <eob> didn't have to be. <eob>
It could've just been another day -- <eob> a Thursday, perhaps -- <eob> among the 63 billion days already enjoyed <eol> by the dinosaurs. <eob>
But over geological time, <eob> improbable, nearly impossible events <eob> do occur. <eob>
Along the path from our wormy, <eol> Cambrian ancestors <eob> to primates dressed in suits, <eob> innumerable forks in the road <eol> led us to this very particular reality. <eob>
The bones of Dreadnoughtus <eol> lay underground for 77 million years. <eob>
Who could have imagined <eob> that a single species <eol> of shrew-like mammal <eob> living in the cracks <eol> of the dinosaur world <eob> would evolve into sentient beings <eob> capable of characterizing <eol> and understanding <eob> the very dinosaurs they must <eol> have dreaded? <eob>
I once stood at the head <eol> of the Missouri River <eob> and bestraddled it. <eob>
There, it's nothing more <eol> than a gurgle of water <eob> that issues forth from beneath <eol> a rock in a boulder in a pasture, <eob> high in the Bitterroot Mountains. <eob>
The stream next to it runs <eol> a few hundred yards <eob> and ends in a small pond. <eob>
Those two streams -- they look identical. <eob>
But one is an anonymous trickle of water, <eob> and the other is the Missouri River. <eob>
Now go down to the mouth <eol> of the Missouri, near St. Louis, <eob> and it's pretty obvious that that river <eol> is a big deal. <eob>
But go up into the Bitterroots <eol> and look at the Missouri, <eob> and human prospection does not <eol> allow us to see it as anything special. <eob>
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period <eob> and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors. <eob>
You would never guess <eob> that they would amount <eol> to anything special, <eob> and they probably wouldn't have, <eob> were it not for that pesky asteroid. <eob>
Now, make a thousand more worlds <eol> and a thousand more solar systems <eob> and let them run. <eob> You will never get the same result. <eob>
No doubt, those worlds would be both amazing <eol> and amazingly improbable, <eob> but they would not be our world <eol> and they would not have our history. <eob>
There are an infinite number of histories <eol> that we could've had. <eob>
We only get one, and wow, <eol> did we ever get a good one. <eob>
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real. <eob>
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real. <eob>
Dragonflies with the wingspan <eob> of an eagle and pill bugs <eol> the length of a car <eob> really existed. <eob>
Why study the ancient past? <eob> Because it gives us perspective <eob> and humility. <eob>
The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, <eob> snuffed out in a cosmic accident <eol> through no fault of their own. <eob>
They didn't see it coming, <eol> and they didn't have a choice. <eob>
We, on the other hand, do have a choice. <eob>
And the nature of the fossil record <eol> tells us that our place on this planet <eob> is both precarious <eol> and potentially fleeting. <eob>
Right now, our species is propagating <eol> an environmental disaster <eob> of geological proportions <eol> that is so broad and so severe, <eob> it can rightly be called <eol> the sixth extinction. <eob>
Only unlike the dinosaurs, <eob> we can see it coming. <eob>
And unlike the dinosaurs, <eob> we can do something about it. <eob>
That choice is ours. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Some people think <eol> that there's a TED Talk formula: <eob>
"Give a talk on a round, red rug." <eob>
"Share a childhood story." <eob>
"Divulge a personal secret." <eob>
"End with an inspiring call to action." <eob>
No. <eob> That's not how to think of a TED Talk. <eob>
In fact, if you overuse those devices, <eob> you're just going to come <eol> across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative. <eob>
But there is one thing <eol> that all great TED Talks have in common, <eob> and I would like to share <eol> that thing with you, <eob>
because over the past 12 years, <eol> I've had a ringside seat, <eob> listening to many hundreds of amazing <eol> TED speakers, like these. <eob>
I've helped them prepare their talks <eol> for prime time, <eob> and learned directly from them <eob> their secrets of what makes <eol> for a great talk. <eob>
And even though these speakers <eol> and their topics all seem <eob> completely different, <eob> they actually do have one key <eol> common ingredient. <eob>
And it's this: <eob> Your number one task as a speaker <eob> is to transfer into your listeners' minds <eol> an extraordinary gift -- <eob> a strange and beautiful object <eol> that we call an idea. <eob>
Let me show you what I mean. <eob> Here's Haley. <eob> She is about to give a TED Talk <eob> and frankly, she's terrified. <eob>
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck! <eob>
Over the course of 18 minutes, <eob> 1,200 people, many of whom <eol> have never seen each other before, <eob> are finding that their brains <eol> are starting to sync with Haley's brain <eob> and with each other. <eob>
They're literally beginning <eol> to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns. <eob>
And I don't just mean <eol> they're feeling the same emotions. <eob>
There's something even more <eol> startling happening. <eob>
Let's take a look inside Haley's brain <eol> for a moment. <eob>
There are billions of interconnected <eol> neurons in an impossible tangle. <eob>
But look here, right here -- <eob> a few million of them <eol> are linked to each other <eob> in a way which represents a single idea. <eob>
And incredibly, this exact pattern <eol> is being recreated in real time <eob> inside the minds of everyone listening. <eob>
That's right; <eol> in just a few minutes, <eob> a pattern involving millions of neurons <eob> is being teleported into 1,200 minds, <eob> just by people listening to a voice <eol> and watching a face. <eob>
But wait -- what is an idea anyway? <eob>
Well, you can think of it <eol> as a pattern of information <eob> that helps you understand <eol> and navigate the world. <eob>
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes, <eob> from the complex and analytical <eob> to the simple and aesthetic. <eob>
Here are just a few examples shared <eol> from the TED stage. <eob>
Sir Ken Robinson -- <eol> creativity is key to our kids' future. <eob>
(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: <eol> My contention is that creativity now <eob> is as important in education <eol> as literacy, <eob> and we should treat it <eol> with the same status. <eob>
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy -- <eol> building from bamboo is beautiful. <eob>
(Video) Elora Hardy: <eol> It is growing all around us, <eob> it's strong, it's elegant, <eol> it's earthquake-resistant. <eob>
CA: Chimamanda Adichie -- <eol> people are more than a single identity. <eob>
(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story <eol> creates stereotypes, <eob> and the problem with stereotypes <eol> is not that they are untrue, <eob> but that they are incomplete. <eob>
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas, <eob> and not just randomly. <eob>
They're carefully linked together. <eob>
Collectively they form <eol> an amazingly complex structure <eob> that is your personal worldview. <eob>
It's your brain's operating system. <eob>
It's how you navigate the world. <eob>
And it is built up out of millions <eol> of individual ideas. <eob>
So, for example, <eol> if one little component of your worldview <eob> is the idea that kittens are adorable, <eob> then when you see this, <eob> you'll react like this. <eob>
then when you see this, <eob> But if another component of your worldview <eob> is the idea that leopards are dangerous, <eob> you'll react a little bit differently. <eob>
So, it's pretty obvious <eob> why the ideas that make up <eol> your worldview are crucial. <eob>
You need them to be as reliable <eol> as possible -- a guide, <eob> to the scary but wonderful <eol> real world out there. <eob>
Now, different people's worldviews <eol> can be dramatically different. <eob>
For example, <eob> how does your worldview <eol> react when you see this image: <eob>
(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think <eol> when you look at me? <eob> "A woman of faith," <eol> "an expert," maybe even "a sister"? <eob> Or "oppressed," "brainwashed," <eob> "a terrorist"? <eob>
CA: Whatever your answer, <eob> there are millions of people out there <eol> who would react very differently. <eob>
So that's why ideas really matter. <eob>
If communicated properly, <eol> they're capable of changing, forever, <eob> how someone thinks <eol> about the world, <eob> and shaping their actions both now <eol> and well into the future. <eob>
Ideas are the most powerful force <eol> shaping human culture. <eob>
So if you accept <eob> that your number one task as <eol> a speaker is to build an idea <eob> inside the minds of your audience, <eob> here are four guidelines <eol> for how you should go about that task: <eob>
One, limit your talk <eol> to just one major idea. <eob>
Ideas are complex things; <eob> you need to slash back your content <eol> so that you can focus <eob> on the single idea <eol> you're most passionate about, <eob> and give yourself a chance to explain <eol> that one thing properly. <eob>
You have to give context, <eol> share examples, make it vivid. <eob>
So pick one idea, <eob> and make it the through-line <eol> running through your entire talk, <eob> so that everything you say links back <eol> to it in some way. <eob>
Two, give your listeners a reason to care. <eob>
Before you can start building things <eob> inside the minds of your audience, <eob> you have to get their permission <eol> to welcome you in. <eob>
And the main tool to achieve that? <eob> Curiosity. <eob> Stir your audience's curiosity. <eob>
Use intriguing, provocative questions <eob> to identify why something <eol> doesn't make sense and needs explaining. <eob>
If you can reveal a disconnection <eol> in someone's worldview, <eob> they'll feel the need to bridge <eol> that knowledge gap. <eob>
And once you've sparked that desire, <eob> it will be so much easier to start building your idea. <eob>
Three, build your idea, piece by piece, <eob> out of concepts that <eol> your audience already understands. <eob>
You use the power of language <eob> to weave together concepts <eol> that already exist <eob> in your listeners' minds -- <eob> but not your language, their language. <eob>
You start where they are. <eob>
The speakers often forget that many <eol> of the terms and concepts they live with <eob> are completely unfamiliar to their audiences. <eob>
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role <eol> in showing how the pieces fit together, <eob> because they reveal the desired <eol> shape of the pattern, <eob> based on an idea that the listener <eol> already understands. <eob>
For example, <eob> when Jennifer Kahn <eob> wanted to explain the incredible <eol> new biotechnology called CRISPR, <eob> she said, "It's as if, for the first time, <eob> you had a word processor <eol> to edit DNA. <eob>
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste <eol> genetic information really easily." <eob> Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers <eol> a satisfying aha moment <eob> as it snaps into place in our minds. <eob>
It's important, therefore, <eol> to test your talk on trusted friends, <eob> and find out which parts they get <eol> confused by. <eob>
Four, here's the final tip: <eob> Make your idea worth sharing. <eob>
By that I mean, ask yourself the question: <eob> "Who does this idea benefit?" <eob> And I need you to be honest with the answer. <eob>
If the idea only serves <eol> you or your organization, <eob> then, I'm sorry to say, <eol> it's probably not worth sharing. <eob>
The audience will see right through you. <eob>
But if you believe that the idea has the potential <eob> to brighten up someone else's day <eob> or change someone else's perspective <eol> for the better <eob> or inspire someone to do <eol> something differently, <eob> then you have the core <eol> ingredient to a truly great talk, <eob> one that can be a gift to them and to all of us. <eob>
How much do you need to know about a person <eob> before you'd feel comfortable <eol> making a loan? <eob>
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars <eob> to the person sitting two rows behind you. <eob>
What would you need to know about that person <eob> before you'd feel comfortable? <eob>
My mom came to the US from India <eol> in her late thirties. <eob>
She's a doctor in Brooklyn, <eob> and she often lets friends <eol> and neighbors come to see her for health services, <eob> whether they can pay right away or not. <eob>
I remember running into her patients <eol> with her at the grocery store <eob> or on the sidewalk, <eob> and sometimes they would come <eol> and pay her right on the spot <eob> for previous appointments. <eob>
She would thank them, <eob> and ask them about their families <eol> and their health. <eob>
She gave them credit <eol> because she trusted them. <eob>
Most of us are like my mom. <eob>
We would give credit to someone we know <eob> or that we live next to. <eob>
But most of us are probably <eol> not going to lend to a stranger <eob> unless we know a little something about them. <eob>
Banks, credit card companies <eol> and other financial institutions <eob> don't know us on a personal level, <eob> but they do have a way of trusting us, <eob> and that's through our credit <eol> scores. <eob>
Our credit scores have been created <eob> through an aggregation and analysis <eol> of our public consumer credit data. <eob>
And because of them, <eol> we have pretty much easy access <eob> to all of the goods and services <eol> that we need, <eob> from getting electricity <eol> to buying a home, <eob> or taking a risk <eol> and starting a business. <eob>
But... <eob> there are 2.5 billion people <eol> around the world <eob> that don't have a credit score. <eob>
That's a third of the world's population. <eob>
They don't have a score <eob> because there are no formal <eol> public records on them -- <eob> no bank accounts, <eob> no credit histories <eob> and no social security numbers. <eob>
And because they don't have a score, <eob> they don't have access <eol> to the credit or financial products <eob> that can improve their lives. <eob>
They are not trusted. <eob>
So we wanted to find a way to build trust <eob> and to open up financial <eol> access for these 2.5 billion. <eob>
So we created a mobile application <eob> that builds credit scores <eol> for them using mobile data. <eob>
There are currently over one billion smartphones <eol> in emerging markets. <eob>
And people are using them <eol> the same way that we do. <eob> They're texting their friends, <eol> they're looking up directions, <eob> they're browsing the Internet <eob> and they're even making financial <eol> transactions. <eob>
Over time, this data is getting <eol> captured on our phones, <eob> and it provides a really rich picture <eol> of a person's life. <eob>
Our customers give us access to this data <eob> and we capture it through <eol> our mobile application. <eob>
It helps us understand the creditworthiness <eob> of people like Jenipher, <eol> a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya. <eob>
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades <eol> has been running a food stall <eob> in the central business district. <eob>
She has three sons who she put <eol> through vocational school, <eob> and she's also the leader <eol> of her local chama, <eob> or savings group. <eob>
Jenipher's food stall does well. <eob>
She makes just enough every day <eol> to cover her expenses. <eob>
But she's not financially secure. <eob>
Any emergency could force her into debt. <eob>
And she has no discretionary income <eob> to improve her family's way of living, <eob> for emergencies, <eob> or for investing into growing her business. <eob>
If Jenipher wants credit, <eol> her options are limited. <eob>
She could get a microloan, <eob> but she'd have to form a group <eol> that could help vouch for her credibility. <eob>
And even then, the loan sizes <eol> would be way too small <eob> to really have an impact <eol> on her business, <eob> averaging around 150 dollars. <eob>
Loan sharks are always an option, <eob> but with interest rates that <eol> are well above 300 percent, <eob> they're financially risky. <eob>
And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral <eol> or a credit history, <eob> she can't walk into a bank and ask <eol> for a business loan. <eob>
But one day, <eob> Jenipher's son <eol> convinced her to download our application <eob> and apply for a loan. <eob>
Jenipher answered <eol> a few questions on her phone <eob> and she gave us access <eol> to a few key data points on her device. <eob>
And here's what we saw. <eob>
So, bad news first. <eob>
Jenipher had a low savings balance <eol> and no previous loan history. <eob>
These are factors <eob> that would have thrown up <eol> a red flag to a traditional bank. <eob>
But there were other points <eol> in her history that showed us <eob> a much richer picture <eol> of her potential. <eob>
So for one, <eob> we saw that she made regular phone <eol> calls to her family in Uganda. <eob>
Well, it turns out that the data shows <eob> a four percent increase in repayment <eob> among people who consistently communicate <eol> with a few close contacts. <eob>
We could also see <eob> that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day, <eob> she actually had pretty regular travel patterns, <eob> and she was either at home <eol> or at her food stall. <eob>
And the data shows <eol> a six percent increase in repayment <eob> among customers who are consistent <eob> with where they spend most of their time. <eob>
We could also see <eob> that she communicated a lot <eob> with many different people throughout the day <eob> and that she had a strong support network. <eob>
Our data shows <eob> that people who communicate with more <eol> than 58 different contacts <eob> tend to be more likely to be <eol> good borrowers. <eob>
In Jenipher's case, <eob> she communicated with 89 different individuals, <eob> which showed a nine percent <eol> increase in her repayment. <eob>
These are just some <eol> of the thousands of different data points <eob> that we look at to understand <eol> a person's creditworthiness. <eob>
And after analyzing all <eol> of these different data points, <eob> we took the first risk <eob> and gave Jenipher a loan. <eob>
This is data that would not <eol> be found on a paper trail <eob> or in any formal financial record. <eob>
But it proves trust. <eob>
By looking beyond income, <eob> we can see that people <eol> in emerging markets <eob> that may seem risky <eol> and unpredictable on the surface <eob> are actually willing <eol> and have the capacity to repay. <eob>
Our credit scores have helped us <eol> deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya <eob> in just the past year. <eob>
And our repayment rates <eol> are above 90 percent -- <eob> which, by the way, is in line <eol> with traditional bank repayment rates. <eob>
With something as simple as a credit score, <eob> we're giving people the power <eol> to build their own futures. <eob>
Our customers have used their loans <eol> for family expenses, <eob> emergencies, travel <eob> and for investing back into growing <eol> their businesses. <eob>
They're now building better <eol> economies and communities <eob> where more people can succeed. <eob>
Over the past two years <eol> of using our product, <eob> Jenipher has increased <eol> her savings by 60 percent. <eob>
She's also started two additional <eol> food stalls <eob> and is now making plans <eol> for her own restaurant. <eob>
She's applying for a small-business loan <eol> from a commercial bank, <eob> because she now has the credit history <eol> to prove she deserves it. <eob>
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week, <eob> and she told me how excited <eol> she was to get started. <eob>
She said, <eob> "Only my son believed I could do this. <eob>
I didn't think this was for me. <eob> "She's lived her whole life <eob> believing that there was a part of the world <eol> that was closed off to her. <eob>
Our job now is to open the world <eol> to Jenipher <eob> and the billions like her <eol> that deserve to be trusted. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I'm an artist, <eob> but a little bit of a peculiar one. <eob>
I don't paint. <eob>
I can't draw. <eob>
My shop teacher in high school <eol> wrote that I was a menace <eob> on my report card. <eob>
You probably don't really <eol> want to see my photographs. <eob>
But there is one thing I know how to do: <eob> I know how to program a computer. <eob> I can code. <eob>
And people will tell me <eol> that 100 years ago, <eob> folks like me didn't exist, <eob> that it was impossible, <eob> that art made with data is a new thing, <eob> it's a product of our age, <eob> it's something that's really important <eob> to think of as something <eol> that's very "now." <eob> And that's true. <eob>
But there is an art form <eol> that's been around for a very long time <eob> that's really about using information, <eob> abstract information, <eob> to make emotionally resonant pieces. <eob>
And it's called music. <eob>
We've been making music <eol> for tens of thousands of years, right? <eob>
And if you think about what music is -- <eob> notes and chords and keys <eol> and harmonies and melodies -- <eob> these things are algorithms. <eob> These things are systems <eob> that are designed to unfold over time, <eob> to make us feel. <eob>
I came to the arts through music. <eob>
I was trained as a composer, <eob> and about 15 years ago, <eol> I started making pieces <eob> that were designed to look <eol> at the intersection <eob> between sound and image, <eob> to use an image to unveil <eol> a musical structure <eob> or to use a sound to show you <eol> something interesting <eob> about something that's usually pictorial. <eob>
So what you're seeing on the screen <eol> is literally being drawn <eob> by the musical structure <eol> of the musicians onstage, <eob> and there's no accident <eol> that it looks like a plant, <eob> because the underlying <eol> algorithmic biology of the plant <eob> is what informed the musical structure <eol> in the first place. <eob>
So once you know how to do this, <eol> once you know how to code with media, <eob> you can do some pretty cool stuff. <eob>
This is a project I did <eol> for the Sundance Film Festival. <eob>
Really simple idea: you take <eol> every Academy Award Best Picture, <eob> you speed it up to one minute each <eob> and string them all together. <eob>
And so in 75 minutes, I can show you <eol> the history of Hollywood cinema. <eob>
And what it really shows you <eol> is the history of editing <eob> in Hollywood cinema. <eob>
So on the left, we've got Casablanca; <eol> on the right, we've got Chicago. <eob>
And you can see that Casablanca <eol> is a little easier to read. <eob>
That's because the average length <eol> of a cinematic shot in the 1940s <eob> was 26 seconds, <eob> and now it's around six seconds. <eob>
This is a project that was inspired <eob> by some work that was funded <eol> by the US Federal Government <eob> in the early 2000s, <eob> to look at video footage and find <eol> a specific actor in any video. <eob>
And so I repurposed this code <eol> to train a system on one person <eob> in our culture who would never need <eol> to be surveilled in that manner, <eob> which is Britney Spears. <eob>
I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi <eol> photos of Britney Spears <eob> and trained my computer to find her face <eob> and her face alone. <eob>
I can run any footage of her through it <eol> and will center her eyes in the frame, <eob> and this sort of is a little <eol> double commentary <eob> about surveillance in our society. <eob>
We are very fraught with anxiety <eol> about being watched, <eob> but then we obsess over celebrity. <eob>
What you're seeing on the screen here <eol> is a collaboration I did <eob> with an artist named Lián Amaris. <eob>
What she did is very simple <eol> to explain and describe, <eob> but very hard to do. <eob>
She took 72 minutes of activity, <eob> getting ready for a night out on the town, <eob> and stretched it over three days <eob> and performed it on a traffic island <eol> in slow motion in New York City. <eob>
I was there, too, with a film crew. <eob>
We filmed the whole thing, <eob> and then we reversed the process, <eol> speeding it up to 72 minutes again, <eob> so it looks like she's moving normally <eob> and the whole world is flying by. <eob>
At a certain point, I figured out <eob> that what I was doing <eol> was making portraits. <eob>
When you think about portraiture, <eol> you tend to think about stuff like this. <eob>
The guy on the left <eol> is named Gilbert Stuart. <eob>
He's sort of the first real portraitist <eol> of the United States. <eob>
And on the right is his portrait <eol> of George Washington from 1796. <eob>
This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait. <eob>
And if you look at this painting, <eol> there's a lot of symbolism, right? <eob>
We've got a rainbow out the window. <eob>
We've got a sword. <eob>
We've got a quill on the desk. <eob>
All of these things are meant to evoke <eob> George Washington <eol> as the father of the nation. <eob>
This is my portrait of George Washington. <eob>
And this is an eye chart, <eob> only instead of letters, they're words. <eob>
And what the words are is the 66 words <eob> in George Washington's <eol> State of the Union addresses <eob> that he uses more <eol> than any other president. <eob> So "gentlemen" has its own symbolism <eol> and its own rhetoric. <eob>
And it's really kind of significant <eol> that that's the word he used the most. <eob>
This is the eye chart for George W. Bush, <eob> who was president when I made this piece. <eob>
And how you get there, <eob> from "gentlemen" to "terror" <eol> in 43 easy steps, <eob> tells us a lot about American history, <eob> and gives you a different insight <eob> than you would have <eol> looking at a series of paintings. <eob>
These pieces provide a history lesson <eol> of the United States <eob> through the political <eol> rhetoric of its leaders. <eob>
Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time <eol> talking about deficits. <eob>
Bill Clinton spent a lot of time <eob> talking about the century in which <eol> he would no longer be president, <eob> but maybe his wife would be. <eob>
Lyndon Johnson was the first President <eob> to give his State of the Union addresses <eol> on prime-time television; <eob> he began every paragraph <eol> with the word "tonight." <eob> And Richard Nixon, <eol> or more accurately, his speechwriter, <eob> a guy named William Safire, <eob> spent a lot of time <eol> thinking about language <eob> and making sure that his boss <eol> portrayed a rhetoric of honesty. <eob>
This project is shown <eol> as a series of monolithic sculptures. <eob> It's an outdoor series of light boxes. <eob>
And it's important to note <eol> that they're to scale, <eob> so if you stand 20 feet back <eol> and you can read between those two black lines, <eob> you have 20 / 20 vision. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is a portrait. <eol> And there's a lot of these. <eob>
There's a lot of ways <eol> to do this with data. <eob>
I started looking for a way <eob> to think about how I can do <eol> a more democratic form of portraiture, <eob> something that's more about <eol> my country and how it works. <eob>
Every 10 years, we make a census <eol> in the United States. <eob>
We literally count people, <eob> find out who lives where, <eol> what kind of jobs we've got, <eob> the language we speak at home. <eob>
And this is important stuff -- <eol> really important stuff. <eob>
But it doesn't really tell us who we are. <eob>
It doesn't tell us about our dreams <eol> and our aspirations. <eob>
And so in 2010, I decided <eol> to make my own census. <eob>
And I started looking for a corpus of data <eob> that had a lot of descriptions <eol> written by ordinary Americans. <eob>
And it turns out <eob> that there is such a corpus of data <eob> that's just sitting there for the taking. <eob> It's called online dating. <eob>
So in 2010, I joined 21 different <eol> online dating services, <eob> as a gay man, a straight man, <eol> a gay woman and a straight woman, <eob> in every zip code in America <eob> and downloaded about <eol> 19 million people's dating profiles -- <eob> about 20 percent of the adult population <eol> of the United States. <eob>
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. <eob>
This is going to become <eol> really freaking obvious. <eob>
Just go with me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So what I did was I sorted <eol> all this stuff by zip code. <eob>
And I looked at word analysis. <eob>
These are some dating profiles from 2010 <eob> with the word "lonely" highlighted. <eob>
If you look at these things <eol> topographically, <eob> if you imagine dark colors to light colors <eol> are more use of the word, <eob> you can see that Appalachia <eol> is a pretty lonely place. <eob>
You can also see <eol> that Nebraska ain't that funny. <eob>
This is the kinky map, <eol> so what this is showing you <eob> is that the women in Alaska <eol> need to get together <eob> with the men in southern New Mexico, <eob> and have a good time. <eob>
And I have this <eol> at a pretty granular level, <eob> so I can tell you that the men <eol> in the eastern half of Long Island <eob> are way more interested in being spanked <eob> than men in the western half <eol> of Long Island. <eob>
This will be your one takeaway <eol> from this whole conference. <eob>
You're going to remember <eol> that fact for, like, 30 years. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When you bring this down <eol> to a cartographic level, <eob> you can make maps and do the same trick <eol> I was doing with the eye charts. <eob>
You can replace the name <eol> of every city in the United States <eob> with the word people use more <eol> in that city than anywhere else. <eob>
If you've ever dated anyone <eol> from Seattle, this makes perfect sense. <eob>
You've got "pretty." <eol> You've got "heartbreak." <eob> You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette." <eob> They play in a band and they smoke. <eob>
And right above that you can see "email." <eob> That's Redmond, Washington, <eob> which is the headquarters <eol> of the Microsoft Corporation. <eob>
Some of these you can guess -- <eol> so, Los Angeles is "acting" <eob> and San Francisco is "gay." <eob> Some are a little bit more heartbreaking. <eob>
In Baton Rouge, they talk <eol> about being curvy; <eob> downstream in New Orleans, <eol> they still talk about the flood. <eob>
Folks in the American capital <eol> will say they're interesting. <eob> People in Baltimore, Maryland, <eol> will say they're afraid. <eob>
This is New Jersey. <eob>
I grew up somewhere <eol> between "annoying" and "cynical." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
And New York City's <eol> number one word is "now," <eob> as in, "Now I'm working as a waiter, <eol> but actually I'm an actor." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or, "Now I'm a professor of engineering <eol> at NYU, but actually I'm an artist." <eob> If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur." <eob> That's Syracuse. <eob>
The best place to eat <eol> in Syracuse, New York, <eob> is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint <eol> called Dinosaur Barbecue. <eob>
That's where you would <eol> take somebody on a date. <eob>
I live somewhere between "unconditional" <eol> and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan. <eob>
And this is gentrified North Brooklyn, <eob> so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous" <eol> and "hipsters" and "urbane." <eob> So that's maybe <eol> a more democratic portrait. <eob>
And the idea was, what if we made <eol> red-state and blue-state maps <eob> based on what we want to do <eol> on a Friday night? <eob>
This is a self-portrait. <eob> This is based on my email, <eob> about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years. <eob>
You can think of this <eol> as a quantified selfie. <eob>
So what I'm doing is running <eol> a physics equation <eob> based on my personal data. <eob>
You have to imagine everybody <eol> I've ever corresponded with. <eob>
It started out in the middle <eol> and it exploded with a big bang. <eob>
And everybody has gravity to one another, <eob> gravity based on how much <eol> they've been emailing, <eob> who they've been emailing with. <eob>
And it also does sentimental analysis, <eob> so if I say "I love you," <eol> you're heavier to me. <eob>
And you attract to my email <eol> addresses in the middle, <eob> which act like mainline stars. <eob>
And all the names are handwritten. <eob>
Sometimes you do this data <eol> and this work with real-time data <eob> to illuminate a specific problem <eol> in a specific city. <eob>
This is a Walther PPK 9mm <eol> semiautomatic handgun <eob> that was used in a shooting <eol> in the French Quarter of New Orleans <eob> about two years ago on Valentine's Day <eol> in an argument over parking. <eob>
Those are my cigarettes. <eob>
This is the house <eol> where the shooting took place. <eob>
This project involved <eol> a little bit of engineering. <eob> I've got a bike chain <eol> rigged up as a cam shaft, <eob> with a computer driving it. <eob>
That computer and the mechanism <eol> are buried in a box. <eob>
The gun's on top welded to a steel plate. <eob>
There's a wire going <eol> through to the trigger, <eob> and the computer in the box is online. <eob>
It's listening to the 911 feed <eol> of the New Orleans Police Department, <eob> so that anytime there's a shooting <eol> reported in New Orleans, <eob>
(Gunshot sound) <eob>
the gun fires. <eob> Now, there's a blank, <eol> so there's no bullet. <eob>
There's big light, big noise <eob> and most importantly, there's a casing. <eob>
There's about five shootings <eol> a day in New Orleans, <eob> so over the four months <eol> this piece was installed, <eob> the case filled up with bullets. <eob>
You guys know what this is -- <eol> you call this "data visualization." <eob> When you do it right, it's illuminating. <eob>
When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing. <eob>
It reduces people to numbers. <eob> So watch out. <eob>
One last piece for you. <eob>
I spent the last summer <eol> as the artist in residence <eob> for Times Square. <eob>
And Times Square in New York <eol> is literally the crossroads of the world. <eob>
One of the things <eol> people don't notice about it <eob> is it's the most Instagrammed <eol> place on Earth. <eob>
About every five seconds, <eol> someone commits a selfie <eob> in Times Square. <eob>
That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
These are some of them <eol> with their eyes centered. <eob>
Every civilization, <eob> will use the maximum level <eol> of technology available to make art. <eob> And it's the responsibility <eol> of the artist to ask questions <eob> about what that technology means <eob> and how it reflects our culture. <eob>
So I leave you with this: <eol> we're more than numbers. <eob> We're people, and we have <eol> dreams and ideas. <eob>
And reducing us to statistics <eol> is something that's done <eob> at our peril. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Hello. <eob> This is my first trip, <eob> first time in life I'm outside <eol> of the walls of Gaza. <eob>
I'm so happy to be here. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My ambition always was to be a pilot, <eol> to fly a plane, <eob> to feel free to fly the sky, <eol> to touch the sky. <eob>
But that didn't happen. <eob> Simply, I live in Gaza, <eol> there is no airport. <eob>
All borders are closed on every side. <eob>
We live in one of the biggest <eol> prisons in the world. <eob>
The only thing I can do <eol> is just to look up to the sky. <eob>
On some days, we are lucky <eol> if we have electricity <eob> for four or five hours. <eob>
When it's cold, we make a fire <eob> on the front or on the roof <eol> of our homes. <eob>
Sometimes we make food, too. <eob>
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything <eol> for journalists who come to my homeland <eob> to tell the stories about what's <eol> going on in Gaza. <eob>
Many mornings, I had to go <eol> to the border area <eob> to collect a journalist. <eob>
If anything should happen to the journalist, <eob> or if the journalist <eol> decides to cover a story <eob> the government doesn't want us to cover, <eob> bad things could happen. <eob>
Navigating through my country <eol> helping journalists, <eob> filmmakers, news crews, is my working life. <eob>
I believe my success comes <eol> from building a relationship <eob> not only with journalists <eol> and the news crews, <eob> but also with the communities <eol> in the Gaza Strip. <eob>
These communities who don't <eol> want their stories to be told, <eob> I never looked to them <eol> as stories or numbers. <eob>
But like me, they are human beings. <eob>
I have built up many relationships <eol> over 10 years. <eob> And guess what? <eob> This gives me the chance <eol> to get access to people, <eob> to stories that others can't. <eob>
In some certain situations, I feel, <eol> as a woman, I have more power. <eob>
Many male journalists in my society, <eob> they want to cover a story <eol> about drug addiction in my country. <eob> That problem started when the Gaza tunnel <eol> was being built. <eob>
With the siege on Gaza, <eob> tunnels brought people <eol> all the basic needs <eob> like food, building material, <eol> other stuff we needed. <eob> But not anymore, because <eol> the Egyptian side flooded them up with water <eob> and they are not working anymore. <eob>
Drugs were being smuggled, <eob> and many young people got addicted, too. <eob>
In the tradition of the Palestinian society, <eob> it's forbidden for men <eol> to enter the household. <eob>
So, no male journalists get the story. <eob> But I did. <eob>
I have a wonderful husband, <eob> a wonderful husband who supports me <eob> despite all the criticism <eol> he gets from the society. <eob>
He's at home now with my two kids, <eob> and I have another one <eol> that's growing in here. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I'm working, <eol> I call him every two hours, <eob> and he knows if he doesn't hear from me, <eob> he should call my contact, <eob> the one who gives me <eol> access to the story, <eob> which is the one who I trust. <eob>
One of the times in Gaza, <eob> during the kidnapping <eol> of the British journalist Alan Johnston, <eob> I was asked by an American magazine <eob> to set up a meeting with the kidnappers <eol> in Gaza, and I did. <eob>
The journalist covering the story and I <eob> were asked to meet outside of his hotel. <eob>
They came, they picked us up <eol> in a black van with black windows, <eob> they were wearing masks on that day. <eob>
And they drove us away, far away <eol> in the middle of a field. <eob>
They took our cell phones <eob> and we did the interview <eol> with the kidnapper outside in that field. <eob>
I was so scared that day, <eob> a day I will never forget. <eob>
So, why do I do what I do? <eob>
I do it because I believe if I didn't, <eob> a huge part of the story <eol> about Gaza will be missing. <eob>
There are some more stories <eol> I could tell you about my country. <eob>
And not all of them are bad. <eob>
I love my country, despite the terrible <eol> situation we live in -- <eob> siege, poverty, unemployment -- <eob> but there is life. <eob>
There are people who are dreamers <eol> and amazing people full of energy. <eob>
We have wonderful music, <eol> and a great music school. <eob>
We have parkour dancers <eol> who dance in the rubble of their homes. <eob>
And Gaza is the only place in the Arab world <eob> where Muslims and Christians live <eol> in strong brotherhood. <eob>
During the time of war, <eob> the hardest part for me <eol> is leaving the house early in the morning, <eob> leaving my children. <eob>
I take a picture of them everyday <eob> because I never know <eol> if I will make it back to them. <eob>
Being a fixer and a journalist <eol> is difficult and dangerous in Gaza. <eob>
But when I hear the sound of the shelling <eol> or the sound of the bombing, <eob> I just head straight toward it, <eob> because I want to be there first, <eob> because these stories should be told. <eob>
When my children were small and we heard <eol> the sound of the war, <eob> I used to tell them that they were fireworks. <eob>
Now they are older, they understand. <eob>
I do have terrible nightmares <eob> because of all that I witnessed <eol> during war times, <eob> especially these lifeless <eol> bodies of young children. <eob>
I still remember a little girl, <eol> her name is Hala. <eob>
She's the only survivor from her family. <eob>
Her picture will be with me forever. <eob>
I will never forget her. <eob>
I'm proud that I can stand here <eol> and be here today with you. <eob>
I'm proud that I can tell you stories, <eol> sad and happy, <eob> stories about my small corner <eol> of the world, Gaza. <eob>
I'm proud that I am the first female fixer <eol> working in Gaza. <eob>
And the funny thing is they call me Mr. <eol> Rambo in Gaza. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I hope one day, I will get the chance <eol> to tell the stories of all other women, <eob> all other amazing women <eol> I know in my country. <eob>
I hope that one day I can help <eol> other women in my country <eob> to be fixers like me. <eob>
And of course sometimes, <eol> I feel I can't do this work anymore, <eob> it's just too much for me. <eob>
But I remember these words: <eob> "Don't limit your challenge, <eol> but challenge your limit. <eob>
Don't allow others <eol> to stand in front of your dreams." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Will we do whatever it takes <eol> to tackle climate change? <eob>
I come at this question <eol> not as a green campaigner, <eob> in fact, I confess to be <eol> rather hopeless at recycling. <eob>
I come at it as a professional <eol> observer of financial policy making <eob> and someone that wonders <eol> how history will judge us. <eob>
One day, <eob> this ring that belonged to my grandfather <eob> will pass to my son, Charlie. <eob>
And I wonder what his generation <eob> and perhaps the one that follows <eob> will make of the two lives this ring <eol> has worked. <eob>
My grandfather was a coal miner. <eob>
In his time, <eob> burning fossil fuels for energy <eol> and for allowing economies to develop <eob> was accepted. <eob>
We know now that that is not the case <eob> because of the greenhouse gases <eol> that coal produces. <eob>
But today, <eob> I fear it's the industry in which I work <eol> that will be judged more harshly <eob> because of its impact on the climate -- <eob> more harshly than my grandfather's industry, even. <eob>
I work, of course, in the banking industry, <eob> which will be remembered <eol> for its crisis in 2008 -- <eob> a crisis that diverted the attention <eol> and finances of governments <eob> away from some really, <eol> really important promises, <eob> like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate <eol> Summit in 2009 <eob> to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year <eob> to help developing countries move away <eol> from burning fossil fuels <eob> and transition to using cleaner energy. <eob>
That promise is already in jeopardy. <eob>
And that's a real problem, <eob> because that transition to cleaner energy <eol> needs to happen <eob> sooner rather than later. <eob>
Firstly, <eob> because greenhouse gases, once released, <eob> stay in the atmosphere for decades. <eob>
And secondly, <eob> if a developing economy builds <eol> its power grid around fossil fuels today, <eob> it's going to be way more costly <eol> to change later on. <eob>
So for the climate, <eob> history may judge that <eol> the banking crisis happened <eob> at just the wrong time. <eob>
The story need not be this gloomy, though. <eob>
Three years ago, <eob> I argued that governments <eol> could use the tools <eob> deployed to save the financial system <eob> to meet other global challenges. <eob>
And these arguments are getting stronger, <eol> not weaker, with time. <eob>
Let's take a brief reminder <eol> of what those tools looked like. <eob>
When the financial crisis hit in 2008, <eob> the central banks <eol> of the US and UK <eob> began buying bonds issued <eol> by their own governments <eob> in a policy known <eol> as "quantitative easing." <eob> Depending on what happens <eol> to those bonds when they mature, <eob> this is money printing <eol> by another name. <eob>
And boy, did they print. <eob>
The US alone created four trillion <eol> dollars' worth of its own currency. <eob>
This was not done in isolation. <eob> In a remarkable act of cooperation, <eob> the 188 countries that make up the International <eol> Monetary Fund, the IMF, <eob> agreed to issue 250 billion <eol> dollars' worth of their own currency -- <eob> the Special Drawing Right -- <eob> to boost reserves around the world. <eob>
When the financial crisis moved to Europe, <eob> the European Central Bank <eol> President, Mario Draghi, <eob> promised "to do whatever it takes." <eob> And they did. <eob>
The Bank of Japan repeated those words -- <eol> that exact same commitment -- <eob> to do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy. <eob>
In both cases, <eob> "whatever it takes" meant <eol> trillions of dollars more <eob> in money-printing policies that continue today. <eob>
What this shows <eob> is that when faced <eol> with some global challenges, <eob> policy makers are able to act <eol> collectively, with urgency, <eob> and run the risks of unconventional policies <eol> like money printing. <eob>
So, let's go back <eol> to that original question: <eob> Can we print money for climate finance? <eob>
Three years ago, <eob> the idea of using money in this way <eol> was something of a taboo. <eob>
Once you break down and dismantle the idea <eob> that money is a finite resource, <eob> governments can quickly get overwhelmed <eol> by demands from their people <eob> to print more and more money <eol> for other causes: <eob> education, health care, welfare -- <eob> even defense. <eob>
And there are some truly terrible historical <eol> examples of money printing -- <eob> uncontrolled money printing -- <eob> leading to hyperinflation. <eob>
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930; <eob> Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008, <eob> when the prices of basic goods like bread <eol> are doubling every day. <eob>
But all of this is moving <eol> the public debate forward, <eob> so much so, that money printing <eol> for the people is now discussed openly <eob> in the financial media, <eol> and even in some political manifestos. <eob>
But it's important the debate <eol> doesn't stop here, <eob> with printing national currencies. <eob>
Because climate change <eol> is a shared global problem, <eob> there are some really compelling reasons <eob> why we should be printing <eol> that international currency <eob> that's issued by the IMF, <eob> to fund it. <eob>
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, <eob> is the IMF's electronic unit of account <eob> that governments use to transfer funds <eol> amongst each other. <eob>
Think of it as a peer-to-peer <eol> payment network, <eob> like Bitcoin, but for governments. <eob>
And it's truly global. <eob> Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas <eob> as part of their foreign exchange reserves. <eob>
These are national stores of wealth <eob> that countries keep to protect <eol> themselves against currency crises. <eob>
And that global nature is why, <eob> at the height of the financial <eol> crisis in 2009, <eob> the IMF issued <eol> those extra 250 billion dollars — <eob> because it served <eol> as a collective global action <eob> that safeguarded countries <eol> large and small in one fell swoop. <eob>
But here — <eob> here's the intriguing part. <eob> More than half of those extra SDRs <eol> that were printed in 2009 — <eob> 150 billion dollars' worth — <eob> went to developed market countries <eol> who, for the most part, <eob> have a modest need <eol> for these foreign exchange reserves, <eob> because they have flexible <eol> exchange rates. <eob>
So those extra reserves <eol> that were printed in 2009, <eob> in the end, for developed <eol> market countries at least, <eob> weren't really needed. <eob>
And they remain unused today. <eob>
So here's an idea. <eob>
As a first step, <eob> why don't we start spending <eol> those unused, <eob> those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009, <eob> to combat climate change? <eob>
They could, for example, <eob> be used to buy bonds issued <eol> by the UN's Green Climate Fund. <eob>
This was a fund created in 2009, <eob> following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. <eob> And it was designed to channel funds <eol> towards developing countries <eob> to meet their climate projects. <eob>
It's been one of the most successful <eol> funds of its type, <eob> raising almost 10 billion dollars. <eob>
But if we use those extra SDRs <eol> that were issued, <eob> it helps governments get back on track, <eob> to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year <eob> that was derailed <eol> by the financial crisis. <eob>
It could also -- <eob> it could also serve as a test case. <eob>
If the inflationary consequences <eol> of using SDRs in this way are benign, <eob> it could be used to justify <eob> the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years, <eob> again, with the commitment <eob> that developed-market countries <eol> would direct their share <eob> of the new reserves <eob> to the Green Climate Fund. <eob>
Printing international money <eol> in this way has several advantages <eob> over printing national currencies. <eob>
The first is it's really easy to argue <eob> that spending money to mitigate climate <eol> change benefits everyone. <eob>
No one section of society benefits <eol> from the printing press over another. <eob>
That problem of competing claims <eol> is mitigated. <eob>
It's also fair to say <eob> that because it takes so many countries <eol> to agree to issue these extra SDRs, <eob> it's highly unlikely that money <eol> printing would get out of control. <eob>
What you end up <eol> with is a collective, global action <eob> aimed -- and it's controlled global action -- <eob> aimed at a global good. <eob>
And, <eob> as we've learned with the money-printing schemes, <eob> whatever concerns we have <eol> can be allayed by rules. <eob>
So, for example, <eob> the issuance of these extra SDRs every five <eol> years could be capped, <eob> such that this international <eol> currency is never more than five percent <eob> of global foreign <eol> exchange reserves. <eob>
That's important because it would allay <eob> well, let's say, the ridiculous concerns <eol> that the US might have <eob> that the SDR could ever challenge <eol> the dollar's dominant role <eob> in international finance. <eob>
And in fact, <eob> I think the only thing that the SDR would likely <eol> steal from the dollar <eob> under this scheme <eob> is its nickname, the "greenback." <eob> Because even with that cap in place, <eob> the IMF could have followed up <eol> its issuance -- <eob> its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 -- <eob> with a further 200 billion dollars <eol> of SDRs in 2014. <eob>
to the Green Climate Fund. <eob> So hypothetically, <eob> that would mean that developed countries <eol> could have contributed <eob> up to 300 billion dollars' <eol> worth of SDRs <eob>
That's 30 times what it has today. <eob>
And you know, <eob> as spectacular as that sounds, <eob> it's only just beginning to look <eol> like "whatever it takes." <eob>
And just to think what amazing things <eol> could be done with that money, <eob> consider this: <eob> in 2009, <eob> Norway promised one billion dollars <eol> of its reserves to Brazil <eob> if they followed through on their goals <eol> on deforestation. <eob>
That program has since delivered <eol> a 70 percent reduction in deforestation <eob> in the past decade. <eob>
That's saving 3.2 billion tons <eol> of carbon dioxide emissions, <eob> which is the equivalent <eol> of taking all American cars off the roads <eob> for three whole years. <eob>
So what could we do <eob> with 300 other pay-for-performance <eol> climate projects like that, <eob> organized on a global scale? <eob>
We could take cars off <eol> the roads for a generation. <eob>
So, <eob> let's not quibble about whether we can afford <eol> to fund climate change. <eob>
The real question is: <eob> Do we care enough about future generations <eob> to take the very same policy risks <eol> we took to save the financial system? <eob>
After all, <eob> we could do it, <eob> we did do it <eob> and we are doing it today. <eob>
We must, must, must do <eol> "whatever it takes." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going <eol> to take you on a journey <eob> that is probably the biggest dream of humanity: <eob> to understand the code of life. <eob>
So for me, everything started many, <eol> many years ago <eob> when I met the first 3D printer. <eob>
The concept was fascinating. <eob>
A 3D printer needs three elements: <eob> a bit of information, <eol> some raw material, some energy, <eob> and it can produce any object <eol> that was not there before. <eob>
I was doing physics, <eol> I was coming back home <eob> and I realized that I actually <eol> always knew a 3D printer. <eob> And everyone does. <eob> It was my mom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My mom takes three elements: <eob> a bit of information, which is between <eol> my father and my mom in this case, <eob> raw elements and energy <eol> in the same media, that is food, <eob> and after several months, produces me. <eob> And I was not existent before. <eob>
So apart from the shock of my mom <eol> discovering that she was a 3D printer, <eob> I immediately got mesmerized by that piece, <eob> the first one, the information. <eob>
What amount of information does it take <eob> to build and assemble a human? <eob> Is it much? Is it little? <eob> How many thumb drives can you fill? <eob>
Well, I was studying physics <eol> at the beginning <eob> and I took this approximation <eol> of a human as a gigantic Lego piece. <eob>
So, imagine that the building blocks <eol> are little atoms <eob> and there is a hydrogen here, <eol> a carbon here, a nitrogen here. <eob>
So in the first approximation, <eob> if I can list the number of atoms <eol> that compose a human being, <eob> I can build it. <eob>
Now, you can run some numbers <eob> and that happens to be <eol> quite an astonishing number. <eob>
So the number of atoms, <eob> the file that I will save in my thumb drive <eol> to assemble a little baby, <eob> will actually fill an entire Titanic <eol> of thumb drives -- <eob> multiplied 2,000 times. <eob>
This is the miracle of life. <eob>
Every time you see from now <eol> on a pregnant lady, <eob> she's assembling the biggest amount of information <eob> that you will ever encounter. <eob>
Forget big data, forget <eol> anything you heard of. <eob>
This is the biggest amount <eol> of information that exists. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But nature, fortunately, <eol> is much smarter than a young physicist, <eob> and in four billion years, <eol> managed to pack this information <eob> in a small crystal we call DNA. <eob>
We met it for the first time in 1950 <eol> when Rosalind Franklin, <eob> an amazing scientist, a woman, <eob> took a picture of it. <eob>
But it took us more than 40 years <eol> to finally poke inside a human cell, <eob> take out this crystal, <eob> unroll it, and read it for the first time. <eob>
The code comes out <eol> to be a fairly simple alphabet, <eob> four letters: A, T, C and G. <eob> And to build a human, you need <eol> three billion of them. <eob> Three billion. <eob> How many are three billion? <eob>
It doesn't really make any sense <eol> as a number, right? <eob>
So I was thinking <eol> how I could explain myself better <eob> about how big and enormous this code is. <eob>
But there is -- I mean, <eol> I'm going to have some help, <eob> and the best person <eol> to help me introduce the code <eob> is actually the first man <eol> to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter. <eob>
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Not the man in the flesh, <eob> but for the first time in history, <eob> this is the genome <eol> of a specific human, <eob> printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter: <eob> 262,000 pages of information, <eob> 450 kilograms, shipped <eol> from the United States to Canada <eob> thanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything. <eob>
It was an amazing feat. <eob>
But this is the visual perception <eol> of what is the code of life. <eob>
And now, for the first time, <eol> I can do something fun. <eob>
I can actually poke inside it and read. <eob>
So let me take an interesting book ... <eol> like this one. <eob>
I have an annotation; <eol> it's a fairly big book. <eob>
So just to let you see <eol> what is the code of life. <eob>
Thousands and thousands and thousands <eob> and millions of letters. <eob>
And they apparently make sense. <eob>
Let's get to a specific part. <eob>
Let me read it to you: <eob>
To you it sounds like mute letters, <eob> but this sequence gives the color <eol> of the eyes to Craig. <eob>
I'll show you another part of the book. <eob>
This is actually a little more complicated. <eob>
Chromosome 14, book 132: <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As you might expect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"ATT, CTT, GATT." <eob>
This human is lucky, <eob> because if you miss <eol> just two letters in this position -- <eob> two letters of our three billion -- <eob> he will be condemned <eol> to a terrible disease: <eob> cystic fibrosis. <eob>
We have no cure for it, <eol> we don't know how to solve it, <eob> and it's just two letters of difference <eol> from what we are. <eob>
A wonderful book, a mighty book, <eob> a mighty book that helped me understand <eob> and show you something quite remarkable. <eob>
Every one of you -- <eol> what makes me, me and you, you -- <eob> is just about five million of these, <eob> half a book. <eob>
For the rest, <eob> we are all absolutely identical. <eob>
Five hundred pages is the miracle <eol> of life that you are. <eob>
The rest, we all share it. <eob>
So think about that again when we think <eol> that we are different. <eob>
This is the amount that we share. <eob>
So now that I have your attention, <eob> the next question is: <eob> How do I read it? <eob>
How do I make sense out of it? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters, <eob> Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself, <eob> decided to assemble a new company. <eob>
Human Longevity was born, <eob> with one mission: <eob> trying everything we can try <eob> and learning everything <eol> we can learn from these books, <eob> with one target -- <eob> making real the dream <eol> of personalized medicine, <eob> understanding what things <eol> should be done to have better health <eob> and what are the secrets in these books. <eob>
An amazing team, 40 data scientists <eol> and many, many more people, <eob> a pleasure to work with. <eob>
The concept is actually very simple. <eob>
We're going to use a technology <eol> called machine learning. <eob>
On one side, we have genomes -- <eol> thousands of them. <eob>
On the other side, we collected <eol> the biggest database of human beings: <eob> phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR -- <eol> everything you can think of. <eob>
Inside there, on these two opposite sides, <eob> there is the secret of translation. <eob>
And in the middle, we build a machine. <eob>
We build a machine and we train a machine -- <eob> well, not exactly <eol> one machine, many, many machines -- <eob> to try to understand and translate <eol> the genome in a phenotype. <eob>
What are those letters, <eol> and what do they do? <eob>
It's an approach <eol> that can be used for everything, <eob> but using it in genomics is particularly complicated. <eob>
Little by little we grew and <eol> we wanted to build different challenges. <eob>
We started from the beginning, <eol> from common traits. <eob>
Common traits are comfortable <eol> because they are common, <eob> everyone has them. <eob>
So we started to ask our questions: <eob> Can we predict height? <eob>
Can we read the books <eol> and predict your height? <eob>
Well, we actually can, <eob> with five centimeters of precision. <eob>
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle, <eob> but we still can, we get in the ballpark, <eol> eight kilograms of precision. <eob>
Can we predict eye color? <eob>
Yeah, we can. <eob> Eighty percent accuracy. <eob> Can we predict skin color? <eob>
Can we predict age? <eob>
We can, because apparently, <eol> the code changes during your life. <eob>
It gets shorter, you lose pieces, <eol> it gets insertions. <eob>
We read the signals, and we make a model. <eob>
Now, an interesting challenge: <eob> Can we predict a human face? <eob>
It's a little complicated, <eob> because a human face is scattered <eol> among millions of these letters. <eob>
And a human face is not <eol> a very well-defined object. <eob>
So, we had to build <eol> an entire tier of it <eob> to learn and teach a machine what a face is, <eob> and embed and compress it. <eob>
And if you're comfortable with machine learning, <eob> you understand what the challenge is here. <eob>
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years <eol> after we read the first sequence -- <eob> this October, we started to see <eol> some signals. <eob>
And it was a very emotional moment. <eob>
What you see here <eol> is a subject coming in our lab. <eob>
This is a face for us. <eob>
So we take the real face of a subject, <eol> we reduce the complexity, <eob> because not everything is in your face -- <eob> lots of features <eob> and defects and asymmetries <eol> come from your life. <eob>
We symmetrize the face, <eol> and we run our algorithm. <eob>
The results that I show you right now, <eob> this is the prediction <eol> we have from the blood. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Wait a second. <eob> In these seconds, your eyes are watching, <eol> left and right, left and right, <eob> and your brain wants those pictures <eol> to be identical. <eob>
So I ask you to do another exercise, <eol> to be honest. <eob> Please search for the differences, <eob> which are many. <eob>
The biggest amount of signal comes <eol> from gender, <eob> then there is age, BMI, the ethnicity <eol> component of a human. <eob>
And scaling up over that <eol> signal is much more complicated. <eob>
But what you see here, <eol> even in the differences, <eob> lets you understand <eol> that we are in the right ballpark, <eob> that we are getting closer. <eob> And it's already giving you some emotions. <eob>
This is another subject <eol> that comes in place, <eob> and this is a prediction. <eob>
A little smaller face, we didn't get <eol> the complete cranial structure, <eob> but still, it's in the ballpark. <eob>
This is a subject that comes in our lab, <eob> and this is the prediction. <eob>
So these people have never been seen <eol> in the training of the machine. <eob>
These are the so-called "held-out" set. <eob>
But these are people <eol> that you will probably never believe. <eob>
We're publishing everything <eol> in a scientific publication, <eob> you can read it. <eob>
But since we are onstage, <eol> Chris challenged me. <eob>
I probably exposed myself <eol> and tried to predict <eob> someone that you might recognize. <eob>
So, in this vial of blood -- <eol> and believe me, you have no idea <eob> what we had to do to have this blood now, here -- <eob> in this vial of blood <eol> is the amount of biological information <eob> that we need to do <eol> a full genome sequence. <eob>
We just need this amount. <eob>
We ran this sequence, <eol> and I'm going to do it with you. <eob>
And we start to layer up <eol> all the understanding we have. <eob>
In the vial of blood, <eol> we predicted he's a male. <eob>
And the subject is a male. <eob>
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm. <eob> The subject is a meter and 77 cm. <eob> So, we predicted that <eol> he's 76; the subject is 82. <eob>
We predict his age, 38. <eob>
The subject is 35. <eob>
We predict his eye color. <eob> Too dark. <eob> We predict his skin color. <eob>
We are almost there. <eob> That's his face. <eob>
Now, the reveal moment: <eob> the subject is this person. <eob>
And I did it intentionally. <eob>
I am a very particular <eol> and peculiar ethnicity. <eob>
Southern European, Italians -- <eol> they never fit in models. <eob>
And it's particular -- that ethnicity <eol> is a complex corner case for our model. <eob>
But there is another point. <eob>
So, one of the things that we use <eol> a lot to recognize people <eob> will never be written in the genome. <eob>
It's our free will, it's how I look. <eob>
Not my haircut in this case, <eol> but my beard cut. <eob>
So I'm going to show you, <eol> I'm going to, in this case, transfer it -- <eob> and this is nothing more <eol> than Photoshop, no modeling -- <eob> the beard on the subject. <eob>
And immediately, we get much, <eol> much better in the feeling. <eob>
So, why do we do this? <eob> We certainly don't do it <eol> for predicting height <eob> or taking a beautiful picture <eol> out of your blood. <eob>
We do it because the same technology <eol> and the same approach, <eob> the machine learning of this code, <eob> is helping us to understand how we work, <eob> how your body works, <eob> how your body ages, <eob> how disease generates in your body, <eob> how your cancer grows and develops, <eob> how drugs work <eob> and if they work on your body. <eob>
This is a huge challenge. <eob>
This is a challenge that we share <eob> with thousands of other <eol> researchers around the world. <eob>
It's called personalized medicine. <eob>
It's the ability to move <eol> from a statistical approach <eob> where you're a dot in the ocean, <eob> to a personalized approach, <eob> where we read all these books <eob> and we get an understanding <eol> of exactly how you are. <eob>
But it is a particularly complicated challenge, <eob> because of all these books, as of today, <eob> we just know probably two percent: <eob> four books of more than 175. <eob>
And this is not the topic of my talk, <eob> because we will learn more. <eob>
There are the best minds <eol> in the world on this topic. <eob>
The prediction will get better, <eob> the model will get more precise. <eob>
And the more we learn, <eob> the more we will be confronted <eol> with decisions <eob> that we never had to face <eol> before <eob> about life, <eob> about death, <eob> about parenting. <eob>
So, we are touching the very inner detail <eol> on how life works. <eob>
And it's a revolution <eol> that cannot be confined <eob> in the domain of science or technology. <eob>
This must be a global conversation. <eob>
We must start to think of the future <eol> we're building as a humanity. <eob>
We need to interact with creatives, <eol> with artists, with philosophers, <eob> with politicians. <eob>
Everyone is involved, <eob> because it's the future of our species. <eob>
Without fear, but with the understanding <eob> that the decisions <eol> that we make in the next year <eob> will change the course <eol> of history forever. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am holding something remarkably old. <eob> It is older than any human artifact, <eob> older than life on Earth, <eob> older than the continents <eol> and the oceans between them. <eob>
This was formed <eol> over four billion years ago <eob> in the earliest days of the solar system <eob> while the planets were still forming. <eob>
This rusty lump of nickel and iron <eol> may not appear special, <eob> but when it is cut open ... <eob> you can see that it is different <eol> from earthly metals. <eob>
This pattern reveals metallic crystals <eol> that can only form out in space <eob> where molten metal <eol> can cool extremely slowly, <eob> a few degrees every million years. <eob>
This was once part <eol> of a much larger object, <eob> one of millions left over <eol> after the planets formed. <eob>
We call these objects asteroids. <eob>
Asteroids are our oldest <eol> and most numerous cosmic neighbors. <eob>
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids <eol> orbiting around the Sun, <eob> shown in yellow, <eob> and swinging close to the Earth's orbit, <eob> shown in blue. <eob>
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids <eol> have been greatly exaggerated <eob> so you can see them clearly. <eob>
Teams of scientists across the globe <eol> are searching for these objects, <eob> discovering new ones every day, <eob> steadily mapping near-Earth space. <eob>
Much of this work is funded by NASA. <eob>
I think of the search for these asteroids <eol> as a giant public works project, <eob> but instead of building a highway, <eol> we're charting outer space, <eob> building an archive <eol> that will last for generations. <eob>
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids <eol> discovered just last year. <eob>
And these are all of the known <eol> near-Earth asteroids, <eob> which at last count was 13,733. <eob>
Each one has been imaged, cataloged <eob> and had its path <eol> around the Sun determined. <eob>
Although it varies <eol> from asteroid to asteroid, <eob> the paths of most asteroids <eol> can be predicted for dozens of years. <eob> And the paths of some asteroids can be <eol> predicted with incredible precision. <eob>
For example, scientists <eol> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory <eob> predicted where the asteroid Toutatis <eol> was going to be four years in advance <eob> to within 30 kilometers. <eob>
In those four years, <eob> Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers. <eob>
That's a fractional precision <eob> of 0.000000004. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the reason I have <eol> this beautiful asteroid fragment <eob> is because, like all neighbors, <eob> asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Three years ago today, <eob> a small asteroid exploded <eol> over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia. <eob>
That object was about 19 meters across, <eob> or about as big as a convenience store. <eob>
Objects of this size hit the Earth <eol> every 50 years or so. <eob>
66 million years ago, <eob> a much larger object hit the Earth, <eob> causing a massive extinction. <eob>
75 percent of plant <eol> and animal species were lost, <eob> including, sadly, the dinosaurs. <eob>
That object was <eol> about 10 kilometers across, <eob> and 10 kilometers is roughly <eol> the cruising altitude of a 747 jet. <eob>
So the next time you're in an airplane, <eob> snag a window seat, look out <eol> and imagine a rock so enormous <eob> that resting on the ground, <eob> it just grazes your wingtip. <eob>
It's so wide that it takes your plane <eol> one full minute to fly past it. <eob>
That's the size of the asteroid <eol> that hit the Earth. <eob>
It has only been within my lifetime <eob> that asteroids have been considered <eol> a credible threat to our planet. <eob>
And since then, there's been <eol> a focused effort underway <eob> to discover and catalog these objects. <eob>
I am lucky enough <eol> to be part of this effort. <eob>
I'm part of a team of scientists <eol> that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope. <eob>
Now, NEOWISE was not <eol> designed to find asteroids. <eob>
It was designed to orbit the earth <eol> and look far beyond our solar system <eob> to seek out the coldest stars <eol> and the most luminous galaxies. <eob>
And it did that very well <eol> for its designed lifetime of seven months. <eob>
But today, six years later, <eol> it's still going. <eob>
We've repurposed it <eol> to discover and study asteroids. <eob>
And although it's <eol> a wonderful little space robot, <eob> these days it's kind of like a used car. <eob>
The cryogen that used to refrigerate <eol> its sensors is long gone, <eob> so we joke that <eol> its air-conditioning is broken. <eob>
It's got 920 million miles <eol> on the odometer, <eob> but it still runs great <eob> and reliably takes a photograph <eol> of the sky every 11 seconds. <eob>
It's taken 23 photos <eol> since I began speaking to you. <eob>
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable <eob> is that it sees the sky <eol> in the thermal infrared. <eob>
That means that instead of seeing <eol> the sunlight that asteroids reflect, <eob> NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit. <eob>
This is a vital capability <eol> since some asteroids are as dark as coal <eob> and can be difficult or impossible <eol> to spot with other telescopes. <eob>
But all asteroids, light or dark, <eol> shine brightly for NEOWISE. <eob>
Astronomers are using <eol> every technique at their disposal <eob> to discover and study asteroids. <eob>
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached. <eob>
The community, together, discovered <eol> over 90 percent of asteroids <eob> bigger than one kilometer across -- <eob> objects capable <eol> of massive destruction to Earth. <eob>
But the job's not done yet. <eob>
An object 140 meters or bigger <eol> could decimate a medium-sized country. <eob>
So far, we've only found <eol> 25 percent of those. <eob>
We must keep searching the sky <eol> for near-Earth asteroids. <eob>
We are the only species <eol> able to understand calculus <eob> or build telescopes. <eob>
We know how to find these objects. <eob>
This is our responsibility. <eob>
If we found a hazardous asteroid <eol> with significant early warning, <eob> we could nudge it out of the way. <eob>
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes <eol> or volcanic eruptions, <eob> an asteroid impact <eol> can be precisely predicted <eob> and prevented. <eob>
What we need to do now <eol> is map near-Earth space. <eob>
We must keep searching the sky. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was three months pregnant with twins <eob> when my husband Ross and I went <eol> to my second sonogram. <eob>
I was 35 years old at the time, <eob> and I knew that that meant <eol> we had a higher risk <eob> of having a child with a birth defect. <eob>
So, Ross and I researched <eol> the standard birth defects, <eob> and we felt reasonably prepared. <eob>
Well, nothing would have prepared us <eob> for the bizarre diagnosis <eol> that we were about to face. <eob>
The doctor explained <eol> that one of our twins, Thomas, <eob> had a fatal birth defect <eol> called anencephaly. <eob>
This means that his brain <eol> was not formed correctly <eob> because part of his skull was missing. <eob>
Babies with this diagnosis <eol> typically die in utero <eob> or within a few minutes, hours or days of being born. <eob>
But the other twin, Callum, <eob> appeared to be healthy, <eol> as far as the doctor could tell, <eob> and these twins were identical, <eob> genetically identical. <eob>
So after a lot of questions about <eol> how this could have possibly happened, <eob> a selective reduction was mentioned, <eob> and while this procedure was not impossible, <eob> it posed some unique risks <eol> for the healthy twin and for me, <eob> so we decided to carry <eol> the pregnancy to term. <eob>
So there I was, three months pregnant, <eol> with two trimesters ahead of me, <eob> and I had to find a way to manage <eol> my blood pressure and my stress. <eob>
And it felt like having a roommate point <eol> a loaded gun at you for six months. <eob>
But I stared down the barrel <eol> of that gun for so long <eob> that I saw a light <eol> at the end of the tunnel. <eob>
While there was nothing we could do <eol> to prevent the tragedy, <eob> I wanted to find a way <eol> for Thomas's brief life <eob> to have some kind of positive impact. <eob>
So I asked my nurse about organ, <eol> eye and tissue donation. <eob>
She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, <eob> the Washington Regional Transplant Community. <eob>
WRTC explained to me <eob> that Thomas would probably be too small <eol> at birth to donate for transplant, <eob> and I was shocked: <eob> I didn't even know you <eol> could be rejected for that. <eob>
But they said that he would be <eol> a good candidate to donate for research. <eob>
This helped me see Thomas in a new light. <eob>
As opposed to just a victim <eol> of a disease, <eob> I started to see him as a possible key <eol> to unlock a medical mystery. <eob>
On March 23, 2010, <eob> the twins were born, <eol> and they were both born alive. <eob>
And just like the doctor said, <eob> Thomas was missing <eol> the top part of his skull, <eob> but he could nurse, <eob> drink from a bottle, <eob> cuddle and grab our fingers <eol> like a normal baby, <eob> and he slept in our arms. <eob>
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms <eob> surrounded by our family. <eob>
We called WRTC, who sent <eol> a van to our home <eob> and brought him to Children's National Medical Center. <eob>
A few hours later, we got a call to say <eol> that the recovery was a success, <eob> and Thomas's donations would be <eol> going to four different places. <eob>
His cord blood <eol> would go to Duke University. <eob>
His liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham. <eob>
His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute, <eob> which is part of Harvard Medical School, <eob> and his retinas would go to the University <eol> of Pennsylvania. <eob>
A few days later, we had a funeral <eol> with our immediate family, <eob> including baby Callum, <eob> and we basically closed <eol> this chapter in our lives. <eob>
But I did find myself wondering, <eol> what's happening now? <eob> What are the researchers learning? <eob>
And was it even worthwhile to donate? <eob>
WRTC invited Ross <eol> and I to a grief retreat, <eob> and we met about 15 other grieving families <eob> who had donated their loved <eol> one's organs for transplant. <eob>
Some of them had even received letters <eob> from the people who received <eol> their loved one's organs, <eob> saying thank you. <eob>
I learned that they could even meet each other <eob> if they'd both sign a waiver, <eob> almost like an open adoption. <eob>
And I was so excited, <eol> I thought maybe I could write a letter <eob> or I could get a letter <eol> and learn about what happened. <eob>
But I was disappointed to learn <eob> that this process only exists for people <eol> who donate for transplant. <eob>
So I was jealous. <eob>
I had transplant envy, I guess. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But over the years that followed, <eob> I learned a lot more about donation, <eob> and I even got a job in the field. <eob> And I came up with an idea. <eob>
I wrote a letter that started out, <eob> "Dear Researcher." <eob> I explained who I was, <eob> and I asked if they could tell me <eol> why they requested infant retinas <eob> in March of 2010, <eob> and I asked if my family could visit <eol> their lab. <eob>
I emailed it to the eye bank <eol> that arranged the donation, <eob> the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, <eob> and asked if they could send it <eol> to the right person. <eob>
They said that they had never done this before, <eob> and they couldn't guarantee a response, <eob> but they wouldn't be an obstacle, <eol> and they would deliver it. <eob>
Two days later, <eol> I got a response <eob> from Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University <eol> of Pennsylvania. <eob>
She thanked me for the donation, <eob> and she explained that she is <eol> studying retinoblastoma, <eob> which is a deadly cancer of the retina <eob> that affects children <eol> under the age of five, <eob> and she said that yes, we were invited <eol> to visit her lab. <eob>
So next we talked on the phone, <eob> and one of the first things <eol> she said to me <eob> was that she couldn't possibly <eol> imagine how we felt, <eob> and that Thomas had given <eol> the ultimate sacrifice, <eob> and that she seemed to feel <eol> indebted to us. <eob>
So I said, "Nothing against your study, <eob> but we didn't actually pick it. <eob>
We donated to the system, and the system <eol> chose your study. <eob>
I said, "And second of all, <eol> bad things happen to children every day, <eob> and if you didn't want these retinas, <eob> they would probably be buried <eol> in the ground right now. <eob>
So to be able to participate in your study <eob> gives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning. <eob>
So, never feel guilty <eol> about using this tissue." <eob> Next, she explained to me <eol> how rare it was. <eob>
She had placed a request <eol> for this tissue six years earlier <eob> with the National Disease Research Interchange. <eob>
She got only one sample of tissue <eol> that fit her criteria, <eob> and it was Thomas's. <eob>
Next, we arranged a date <eol> for me to come visit the lab, <eob> and we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday. <eob>
After we hung up, I emailed her <eol> some pictures of Thomas and Callum, <eob> and a few weeks later, <eol> we received this T-shirt in the mail. <eob>
A few months later, Ross, Callum <eol> and I piled in the car <eob> and we went for a road trip. <eob>
We met Arupa and her staff, <eob> and Arupa said that when I told her <eol> not to feel guilty, that it was a relief, <eob> and that she hadn't seen it <eol> from our perspective. <eob>
She also explained that Thomas <eol> had a secret code name. <eob>
The same way Henrietta <eol> Lacks is called HeLa, <eob> Thomas was called RES 360. <eob>
RES means research, <eob> and 360 means he was the 360th specimen <eob> over the course of about 10 years. <eob>
She also shared with us <eol> a unique document, <eob> and it was the shipping label <eob> that sent his retinas <eol> from DC to Philadelphia. <eob>
This shipping label is like an heirloom <eol> to us now. <eob>
It's the same way that a military <eol> medal or a wedding certificate might be. <eob>
Arupa also explained <eob> that she is using Thomas's retina <eol> and his RNA <eob> to try to inactivate the gene <eol> that causes tumor formation, <eob> and she even showed us some results <eol> that were based on RES 360. <eob>
Then she took us to the freezer <eob> and she showed us the two samples <eol> that she still has <eob> that are still labeled RES 360. <eob>
There's two little ones left. <eob>
She said she saved it <eob> because she doesn't know <eol> when she might get more. <eob>
After this, we went to the conference room <eob> and we relaxed and we had lunch together, <eob> and the lab staff presented Callum <eol> with a birthday gift. <eob>
It was a child's lab kit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And they also offered him <eol> an internship. <eob> So in closing, I have <eol> two simple messages today. <eob>
One is that most of us probably don't think <eol> about donating to research. <eob>
I know I didn't. <eob>
I think I'm a normal person. <eob>
But I did it. <eob>
It was a good experience, and I recommend it, <eob> and it brought my family <eol> a lot of peace. <eob>
And second is if you work <eol> with human tissue <eob> and you wonder about the donor <eol> and about the family, <eob> write them a letter. <eob>
Tell them you received it, tell them <eol> what you're working on, <eob> and invite them to visit your lab, <eob> because that visit may be <eol> even more gratifying for you <eob> than it is for them. <eob>
And I'd also like to ask you a favor. <eob>
If you're ever successful in arranging <eol> one of these visits, <eob> please tell me about it. <eob>
The other part of my family's story <eob> is that we ended up visiting <eol> all four facilities <eob> that received Thomas's donations. <eob>
And we met amazing people <eol> doing inspiring work. <eob>
The way I see it now <eol> is that Thomas got into Harvard, <eob> Duke and Penn -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And he has a job at Cytonet, <eob> and he has colleagues and he has coworkers <eob> who are in the top of their fields. <eob>
And they need him <eol> in order to do their job. <eob>
And a life that once seemed <eol> brief and insignificant <eob> revealed itself to be vital, <eol> everlasting and relevant. <eob>
And I only hope that my life <eol> can be as relevant. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon, <eob> which has meant different things <eol> at different times. <eob>
But all truly inspiring design projects <eol> have one thing in common: <eob> they began with a dream. <eob>
And the bolder the dream, <eob> the greater the design feat <eol> that will be required to achieve it. <eob>
And this is why the greatest designers <eol> are almost always <eob> the biggest dreamers and rebels <eol> and renegades. <eob>
This has been the case throughout history, <eob> all the way back to the year 300 BC, <eob> when a 13-year-old <eol> became the king <eob> of a remote, very poor and very small Asian country. <eob>
He dreamt of acquiring land, <eol> riches and power <eob> through military conquest. <eob>
And his design skills -- <eob> improbable though it sounds -- <eob> would be essential <eol> in enabling him to do so. <eob>
At the time, <eob> all weapons were made by hand <eol> to different specifications. <eob>
So if an archer ran out <eol> of arrows during a battle, <eob> they wouldn't necessarily be able <eol> to fire another archer's arrows <eob> from their bow. <eob>
This of course meant <eol> that they would be less effective in combat <eob> and very vulnerable, too. <eob>
Ying solved this problem <eob> by insisting that all bows and arrows <eol> were designed identically, <eob> so they were interchangeable. <eob>
And he did the same <eol> for daggers, axes, spears, shields <eob> and every other form of weaponry. <eob>
His formidably equipped <eol> army won batter after battle, <eob> and within 15 years, <eob> his tiny kingdom <eol> had succeeded in conquering <eob> all its larger, richer, <eol> more powerful neighbors, <eob> to found the mighty Chinese Empire. <eob>
Now, no one, of course, <eob> would have thought <eol> of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time -- <eob> why would they? <eob>
And yet he used design unknowingly <eol> and instinctively <eob> but with tremendous ingenuity <eob> to achieve his ends. <eob>
And so did another equally improbable, <eol> accidental designer, <eob> who was also not above using violence <eol> to get what he wanted. <eob>
This was Edward Teach, better known <eol> as the British pirate, Blackbeard. <eob>
This was the golden age of piracy, <eob> where pirates like Teach <eol> were terrorizing the high seas. <eob>
Colonial trade was flourishing, <eob> and piracy was highly profitable. <eob>
And the smarter pirates like him <eol> realized that to maximize their spoils, <eob> they needed to attack <eol> their enemies so brutally <eob> that they would surrender on sight. <eob>
So in other words, <eob> they could take the ships <eol> without wasting ammunition, <eob> or incurring casualties. <eob>
So Edward Teach redesigned himself <eol> as Blackbeard <eob> by playing the part of a merciless brute. <eob>
He wore heavy jackets and big hats <eol> to accentuate his height. <eob>
He grew the bushy black beard <eol> that obscured his face. <eob>
He slung braces of pistols <eol> on either shoulder. <eob>
He even attached matches <eol> to the brim of his hat and set them alight, <eob> so they sizzled menacingly <eol> whenever his ship was poised to attack. <eob>
And like many pirates of that era, <eob> he flew a flag that bore <eol> the macabre symbols <eob> of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones, <eob> because those motifs had signified <eol> death in so many cultures for centuries, <eob> that their meaning was instantly recognizable, <eob> even in the lawless, illiterate world <eol> of the high seas: <eob> surrender or you'll suffer. <eob>
So of course, all his sensible victims <eol> surrendered on sight. <eob>
Put like that, <eob> it's easy to see why Edward Teach <eol> and his fellow pirates <eob> could be seen as pioneers <eol> of modern communications design, <eob> and why their deadly symbol -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
there's more -- <eob> why their deadly symbol <eol> of the skull and crossbones <eob> was a precursor of today's logos, <eob> rather like the big red letters standing behind me, <eob> but of course with a different message. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yet design was also used <eol> to nobler ends <eob> by an equally brilliant and equally <eol> improbable designer, <eob> the 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale. <eob>
Her mission was to provide decent healthcare <eol> for everyone. <eob>
Nightingale was born into a rather grand, <eol> very wealthy British family, <eob> who were horrified <eol> when she volunteered to work in military hospitals <eob> during the Crimean War. <eob>
Once there, she swiftly realized <eob> that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there, <eob> in the filthy, fetid wards, <eob> than they were of battle wounds. <eob>
So she campaigned for cleaner, <eol> lighter, airier clinics <eob> to be designed and built. <eob>
Back in Britain, <eob> she mounted another campaign, <eob> this time for civilian hospitals, <eob> and insisted that the same design <eol> principles were applied to them. <eob>
The Nightingale ward, as it is called, <eob> dominated hospital design <eol> for decades to come, <eob> and elements of it <eol> are still used today. <eob>
But by then, <eob> design was seen as a tool <eol> of the Industrial Age. <eob>
It was formalized and professionalized, <eob> but it was restricted <eol> to specific roles <eob> and generally applied in pursuit <eol> of commercial goals <eob> rather than being used intuitively, <eob> as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done. <eob>
By the 20th century, <eob> this commercial ethos was so powerful, <eob> that any designers <eol> who deviated from it <eob> risked being seen <eol> as cranks or subversives. <eob>
Now among them is one <eol> of my great design heroes, <eob> the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy. <eob>
He was the Hungarian artist and designer <eob> whose experiments with the impact <eol> of technology on daily life <eob> were so powerful <eob> that they still influence <eol> the design of the digital images <eob> we see on our phone and computer screens. <eob>
He radicalized the Bauhaus <eol> Design School in 1920s Germany, <eob> and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him <eob> when he struggled to open <eol> a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later. <eob>
Moholy's ideas were as bold <eol> and incisive as ever, <eob> but his approach to design <eol> was too experimental, <eob> as was his insistence <eol> on seeing it, as he put it, <eob> as an attitude, not a profession <eol> to be in tune with the times. <eob>
And sadly, the same applied <eob> to another design maverick: <eol> Richard Buckminster Fuller. <eob>
He was yet another brilliant design visionary <eob> and design activist, <eob> who was completely committed <eol> to designing a sustainable society <eob> in such a forward-thinking way <eob> that he started talking about the importance <eol> of environmentalism <eob> in design in the 1920s. <eob>
Now he, despite his efforts, <eob> was routinely mocked as a crank <eol> by many in the design establishment, <eob> and admittedly, <eob> some of his experiments failed, <eob> like the flying car that never <eol> got off the ground. <eob>
And yet, the geodesic dome, <eob> his design formula to build an emergency shelter <eob> from scraps of wood, <eol> metal, plastic, <eob> bits of tree, old blankets, <eol> plastic sheeting -- <eob> just about anything <eol> that's available at the time -- <eob> is one of the greatest feats <eol> of humanitarian design, <eob> and has provided sorely needed refuge <eob> to many, many people in desperate <eol> circumstances <eob> ever since. <eob>
Now, it was the courage <eol> and verve of radical designers <eob> like Bucky and Moholy <eob> that drew me to design. <eob>
I began my career as a news journalist <eol> and foreign correspondent. <eob>
I wrote about politics, economics <eol> and corporate affairs, <eob> and I could have chosen to specialize <eol> in any of those fields. <eob>
But I picked design, <eob> because I believe it's one of the most powerful <eol> tools at our disposal <eob> to improve our quality of life. <eob>
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And greatly as I admire the achievements <eol> of professional designers, <eob> which have been extraordinary <eol> and immense, <eob> I also believe <eob> that design benefits hugely <eol> from the originality, <eob> the lateral thinking <eob> and the resourcefulness <eol> of its rebels and renegades. <eob>
And we're living at a remarkable <eol> moment in design, <eob> because this is a time when the two camps <eol> are coming closer together. <eob>
Because even very basic advances <eol> in digital technology <eob> have enabled them to operate <eol> increasingly independently, <eob> in or out of a commercial context, <eob> to pursue ever more ambitious <eol> and eclectic objectives. <eob>
So in theory, <eob> basic platforms like crowdfunding, <eol> cloud computing, social media <eob> are giving greater freedom <eol> to professional designers <eob> and giving more resources <eol> for the improvisational ones, <eob> and hopefully, <eob> a more receptive response <eol> to their ideas. <eob>
Now, some of my favorite examples <eol> of this are in Africa, <eob> where a new generation of designers <eob> are developing incredible Internet <eol> of Things technologies <eob> to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream <eol> of improving healthcare <eob> in countries where more people now <eol> have access to cell phones <eob> than to clean, running water. <eob>
And among them is Arthur Zang. <eob>
He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer <eob> who has a adapted a tablet <eol> computer into the Cardiopad, <eob> a mobile heart-monitoring device. <eob>
It can be used to monitor the hearts <eol> of patients in remote, rural areas. <eob>
The data is then sent <eol> on a cellular network <eob> to well-equipped hospitals <eol> hundreds of miles away <eob> for analysis. <eob>
And if any problems are spotted <eol> by the specialists there, <eob> a suitable course of treatment is recommended. <eob>
And this of course saves many patients <eob> from making long, arduous, <eol> expensive and often pointless journeys <eob> to those hospitals, <eob> and makes it much, much likelier <eob> that their hearts <eol> will actually be checked. <eob>
Arthur Zang started working <eol> on the Cardiopad eight years ago, <eob> in his final year at university. <eob>
But he failed to persuade any conventional sources <eob> to give him investment <eol> to get the project off the ground. <eob>
He posted the idea on Facebook, <eob> where a Cameroonian government <eol> official saw it <eob> and managed to secure a government <eol> grant for him. <eob>
He's now developing not only the Cardiopad, <eob> but other mobile medical devices <eol> to treat different conditions. <eob>
And he isn't alone, <eob> because there are many other inspiring <eol> and enterprising designers <eob> who are also pursuing extraordinary <eol> projects of their own. <eob>
And I'm going to finish by looking <eol> at just a few of them. <eob>
One is Peek Vision. <eob>
This is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya, <eob> who've developed an Internet <eol> of Things technology of their own, <eob> as a portable eye examination kit. <eob>
Then there's Gabriel Maher, <eob> who is developing a new design language <eob> to enable us to articulate the subtleties <eol> of our changing gender identities, <eob> without recourse to traditional stereotypes. <eob>
All of these designers <eol> and many more are pursuing their dreams, <eob> by the making the most of their newfound freedom, <eob> with the discipline of professional designers <eob> and the resourcefulness <eol> of rebels and renegades. <eob>
And we all stand to benefit. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So this is a talk about gene drives, <eob> but I'm going to start <eol> by telling you a brief story. <eob>
20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James <eob> got obsessed with the idea <eol> of making mosquitos <eob> that didn't transmit malaria. <eob>
It was a great idea, <eol> and pretty much a complete failure. <eob>
For one thing, it turned out <eol> to be really hard <eob> to make a malaria-resistant mosquito. <eob>
James managed it, finally, <eol> just a few years ago, <eob> by adding some genes <eol> that make it impossible <eob> for the malaria parasite to survive <eol> inside the mosquito. <eob>
But that just created another problem. <eob>
Now that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito, <eob> how do you get it to replace <eol> all the malaria-carrying mosquitos? <eob>
There are a couple options, <eob> but plan A was basically to breed up <eob> a bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos <eob> release them into the wild <eob> and hope that they pass on their genes. <eob>
The problem was that you'd have to release <eob> literally 10 times the number <eol> of native mosquitos to work. <eob>
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos, <eob> you release an extra 100,000. <eob>
As you might guess, <eob> this was not a very popular <eol> strategy with the villagers. <eob>
Then, last January, <eol> Anthony James got an email <eob> from a biologist named Ethan Bier. <eob>
Bier said that he and his grad <eol> student Valentino Gantz <eob> had stumbled on a tool <eol> that could not only guarantee <eob> that a particular genetic trait <eol> would be inherited, <eob> but that it would spread incredibly quickly. <eob>
If they were right, <eol> it would basically solve the problem <eob> that he and James had been working <eol> on for 20 years. <eob>
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos <eol> to carry the anti-malaria gene <eob> and also this new tool, a gene drive, <eob> which I'll explain in a minute. <eob>
Finally, they set it up so that any mosquitos <eob> that had inherited <eol> the anti-malaria gene <eob> wouldn't have the usual white eyes, <eol> but would instead have red eyes. <eob>
That was pretty much just for convenience <eob> so they could tell just at a glance <eol> which was which. <eob>
So they took their two anti-malarial, <eol> red-eyed mosquitos <eob> and put them in a box <eol> with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones, <eob> and let them breed. <eob>
In two generations, those had produced <eol> 3,800 grandchildren. <eob>
That is not the surprising part. <eob>
This is the surprising part: <eob> given that you started <eol> with just two red-eyed mosquitos <eob> and 30 white-eyed ones, <eob> you expect mostly white-eyed descendants. <eob>
Instead, when James opened the box, <eob> all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes. <eob>
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment, <eob> he became so excited that he was <eol> literally shouting into the phone. <eob>
That's because getting <eol> only red-eyed mosquitos <eob> violates a rule that is the absolute <eol> cornerstone of biology, <eob> Mendelian genetics. <eob>
I'll keep this quick, <eob> but <eob> Mendelian genetics <eob> says when a male and a female mate, <eob> their baby inherits half <eol> of its DNA from each parent. <eob>
So if our original mosquito was aa <eol> and our new mosquito is aB, <eob> where B is the anti-malarial gene, <eob> the babies should come out in four <eol> permutations: <eob> aa, aB, aa, Ba. <eob>
Instead, with the new gene drive, <eob> they all came out aB. <eob>
Biologically, <eol> that shouldn't even be possible. <eob>
So what happened? <eob> The first thing that happened <eob> was the arrival of a gene-editing tool <eol> known as CRISPR in 2012. <eob>
Many of you have probably heard <eol> about CRISPR, <eob> so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR <eol> is a tool that allows researchers <eob> to edit genes very precisely, <eol> easily and quickly. <eob>
It does this by harnessing a mechanism <eol> that already existed in bacteria. <eob>
Basically, there's a protein <eol> that acts like a scissors <eob> and cuts the DNA, <eob> and there's an RNA molecule <eol> that directs the scissors <eob> to any point on the genome <eol> you want. <eob>
The result is basically <eol> a word processor for genes. <eob>
You can take an entire gene <eol> out, put one in, <eob> or even edit just a single letter <eol> within a gene. <eob>
And you can do it in nearly any species. <eob>
OK, remember how I said that gene <eol> drives originally had two problems? <eob>
The first was that it was hard <eol> to engineer a mosquito <eob> to be malaria-resistant. <eob>
That's basically gone now, thanks <eol> to CRISPR. <eob>
But the other problem was logistical. <eob>
How do you get your trait to spread? <eob>
This is where it gets clever. <eob>
A couple years ago, a biologist <eol> at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt <eob> wondered what would happen <eob> if you made it so that CRISPR inserted <eol> not only your new gene <eob> but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting. <eob>
In other words, what if CRISPR <eol> also copied and pasted itself. <eob>
You'd end up with a perpetual motion <eol> machine for gene editing. <eob>
And that's exactly what happened. <eob>
This CRISPR gene drive <eol> that Esvelt created <eob> not only guarantees <eol> that a trait will get passed on, <eob> but if it's used in the germline cells, <eob> it will automatically copy and paste your new gene <eob> into both chromosomes <eol> of every single individual. <eob>
It's like a global <eol> search and replace, <eob> or in science terms, it makes a heterozygous <eol> trait homozygous. <eob>
So, what does this mean? <eob>
For one thing, it means <eol> we have a very powerful, <eob> but also somewhat alarming new tool. <eob>
Up until now, the fact that gene <eol> drives didn't work very well <eob> was actually kind of a relief. <eob>
Normally when we mess <eol> around with an organism's genes, <eob> we make that thing less evolutionarily fit. <eob>
So biologists can make all the mutant fruit <eol> flies they want <eob> without worrying about it. <eob>
If some escape, natural selection <eol> just takes care of them. <eob>
What's remarkable and powerful <eol> and frightening about gene drives <eob> is that that will no longer <eol> be true. <eob>
Assuming that your trait does not <eol> have a big evolutionary handicap, <eob> like a mosquito that can't fly, <eob> the CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly <eob> until it is in every single <eol> individual in the population. <eob>
Now, it isn't easy to make <eol> a gene drive that works that well, <eob> but James and Esvelt think <eol> that we can. <eob>
The good news is that this opens <eol> the door to some remarkable things. <eob>
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive <eob> in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes, <eob> the species that transmits malaria, <eob> researchers estimate that it would spread <eol> to the entire population in a year. <eob>
So in a year, you could virtually <eol> eliminate malaria. <eob>
In practice, we're still a few years out <eol> from being able to do that, <eob> but still, a 1,000 children <eol> a day die of malaria. <eob>
In a year, that number <eol> could be almost zero. <eob>
The same goes for dengue fever, <eol> chikungunya, yellow fever. <eob>
And it gets better. <eob> Say you want to get rid <eol> of an invasive species, <eob> like get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. <eob> All you have to do <eol> is release a gene drive <eob> that makes the fish produce <eol> only male offspring. <eob>
In a few generations, there'll be <eol> no females left, no more carp. <eob>
In theory, this means we could restore <eol> hundreds of native species <eob> that have been pushed to the brink. <eob>
OK, that's the good news, <eob> this is the bad news. <eob>
Gene drives are so effective <eob> that even an accidental release <eol> could change an entire species, <eob> and often very quickly. <eob>
Anthony James took good precautions. <eob>
He bred his mosquitos <eol> in a bio-containment lab <eob> and he also used a species <eol> that's not native to the US <eob> so that even if some did escape, <eob> they'd just die off, <eol> there'd be nothing for them to mate with. <eob>
But it's also true <eol> that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive <eob> accidentally got carried from the Great Lakes <eol> back to Asia, <eob> they could potentially wipe <eol> out the native Asian carp population. <eob>
And that's not so unlikely, given <eol> how connected our world is. <eob>
In fact, it's why we have <eol> an invasive species problem. <eob>
And that's fish. <eob>
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies, <eob> there's literally no way to contain them. <eob>
They cross borders <eol> and oceans all the time. <eob>
OK, the other piece of bad news <eob> is that a gene drive <eol> might not stay confined <eob> to what we call the target species. <eob>
That's because of gene flow, <eob> which is a fancy way of saying <eol> that neighboring species <eob> sometimes interbreed. <eob>
If that happens, it's possible <eol> a gene drive could cross over, <eob> like Asian carp could infect <eol> some other kind of carp. <eob>
That's not so bad if your drive <eol> just promotes a trait, like eye color. <eob>
In fact, there's a decent chance <eol> that we'll see <eob> a wave of very weird <eol> fruit flies in the near future. <eob>
But it could be a disaster <eob> if your drive is deigned <eol> to eliminate the species entirely. <eob>
The last worrisome thing <eol> is that the technology to do this, <eob> to genetically engineer an organism <eol> and include a gene drive, <eob> is something that basically <eol> any lab in the world can do. <eob>
An undergraduate can do it. <eob>
A talented high schooler <eol> with some equipment can do it. <eob>
Now, I'm guessing that this sounds <eol> terrifying. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Interestingly though, <eol> nearly every scientist I talk to <eob> seemed to think that gene drives <eol> were not actually that frightening or dangerous. <eob>
Partly because they believe <eol> that scientists will be <eob> very cautious and responsible <eol> about using them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So far, that's been true. <eob>
But gene drives also have <eol> some actual limitations. <eob>
So for one thing, they work only <eol> in sexually reproducing species. <eob>
So thank goodness, they can't be used <eol> to engineer viruses or bacteria. <eob>
Also, the trait spreads <eol> only with each successive generation. <eob>
So changing or eliminating a population <eob> is practical only if that species <eol> has a fast reproductive cycle, <eob> like insects or maybe small vertebrates <eol> like mice or fish. <eob>
In elephants or people, <eol> it would take centuries <eob> for a trait to spread widely <eol> enough to matter. <eob>
Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy <eol> to engineer a truly devastating trait. <eob>
Say you wanted to make a fruit fly <eob> that feeds on ordinary fruit <eol> instead of rotting fruit, <eob> with the aim of sabotaging <eol> American agriculture. <eob>
First, you'd have to figure out <eob> which genes control <eol> what the fly wants to eat, <eob> which is already a very long and complicated project. <eob>
Then you'd have to alter <eol> those genes to change the fly's behavior <eob> to whatever you'd want it to be, <eob> which is an even longer <eol> and more complicated project. <eob>
And it might not even work, <eob> because the genes that control <eol> behavior are complex. <eob>
So if you're a terrorist and have to choose <eob> between starting a grueling basic research program <eob> that will require years of meticulous lab work <eol> and still might not pan out, <eob> or just blowing stuff up? <eob> You'll probably choose the later. <eob>
This is especially true <eol> because at least in theory, <eob> it should be pretty easy to build <eol> what's called a reversal drive. <eob> That's one that basically overwrites <eol> the change made by the first gene drive. <eob>
So if you don't like <eol> the effects of a change, <eob> you can just release a second drive <eol> that will cancel it out, <eob> at least in theory. <eob>
OK, so where does this leave us? <eob>
We now have the ability <eol> to change entire species at will. <eob> Should we? <eob> Are we gods now? <eob>
I'm not sure I'd say that. <eob>
But I would say this: <eob> first, some very smart people <eob> are even now debating <eol> how to regulate gene drives. <eob>
At the same time, some other very smart people <eob> are working hard <eol> to create safeguards, <eob> like gene drives that self-regulate <eol> or peter out after a few generations. <eob> That's great. <eob> But this technology still requires <eol> a conversation. <eob>
And given the nature of gene drives, <eob> that conversation has to be global. <eob>
What if Kenya wants to use <eol> a drive but Tanzania doesn't? <eob>
Who decides whether to release <eol> a gene drive that can fly? <eob>
I don't have the answer to that question. <eob>
All we can do going forward, I think, <eob> is talk honestly about <eol> the risks and benefits <eob> and take responsibility <eol> for our choices. <eob>
By that I mean, not just the choice <eol> to use a gene drive, <eob> but also the choice not to use one. <eob>
Humans have a tendency to assume <eol> that the safest option <eob> is to preserve the status quo. <eob>
But that's not always the case. <eob>
Gene drives have risks, and those <eol> need to be discussed, <eob> but malaria exists now <eol> and kills 1,000 people a day. <eob>
To combat it, we spray pesticides <eol> that do grave damage to other species, <eob> including amphibians and birds. <eob>
So when you hear about gene <eol> drives in the coming months, <eob> and trust me, you will be hearing about them, <eob> remember that. <eob> It can be frightening to act, <eob> but sometimes, not acting is worse. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine that you invented a device <eob> that can record my memories, <eob> my dreams, my ideas, <eob> and transmit them to your brain. <eob>
That would be a game-changing <eol> technology, right? <eob>
But in fact, we already <eol> possess this device, <eob> and it's called human communication system <eob> and effective storytelling. <eob>
To understand how this device works, <eob> we have to look into our brains. <eob> And we have to formulate the question <eol> in a slightly different manner. <eob>
Now we have to ask <eob> how these neuron patterns in my brain <eob> that are associated with my memories <eol> and ideas <eob> are transmitted into your brains. <eob>
And we think there are two factors <eol> that enable us to communicate. <eob>
First, your brain is now <eol> physically coupled to the sound wave <eob> that I'm transmitting to your brain. <eob>
And second, we developed <eol> a common neural protocol <eob> that enabled us to communicate. <eob> So how do we know that? <eob> In my lab in Princeton, <eob> we bring people to the fMRI scanner <eol> and we scan their brains <eob> while they are either telling <eol> or listening to real-life stories. <eob>
And to give you a sense <eol> of the stimulus we are using, <eob> let me play 20 seconds <eol> from a story that we used, <eob> told by a very talented storyteller, <eob> Jim O'Grady. <eob> (Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story <eol> and I know it's good, <eob> and then I start to make it better — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> by adding an element of embellishment. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Reporters call this "making shit up." <eob>
And I kinda liked it." <eob> Uri Hasson: OK, so now <eol> let's look into your brain <eob> and see what's happening <eol> when you listen to these kinds of stories. <eob>
And let's start simple -- let's start <eol> with one listener and one brain area: <eob> the auditory cortex that processes <eol> the sounds that come from the ear. <eob>
And as you can see, <eol> in this particular brain area, <eob> the responses are going up and down <eol> as the story is unfolding. <eob>
Now we can take these responses <eob> and compare them to the responses <eol> in other listeners <eob> in the same brain area. <eob>
And we can ask: <eob> How similar are the responses <eol> across all listeners? <eob> So here you can see <eol> five listeners. <eob>
And we start to scan their brains <eol> before the story starts, <eob> when they're simply lying in the dark <eol> and waiting for the story to begin. <eob>
As you can see, <eob> the brain area is going up and down <eol> in each one of them, <eob> but the responses are very different, <eob> and not in sync. <eob>
However, immediately <eol> as the story is starting, <eob> something amazing is happening. <eob> (Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story <eol> and I know it's good, <eob> and then I start to make it -- <eob> UH: Suddenly, you can see <eol> that the responses in all of the subjects <eob> lock to the story, <eob> and now they are going up and down <eol> in a very similar way <eob> across all listeners. <eob>
And in fact, this is exactly <eol> what is happening now in your brains <eob> when you listen to my sound speaking. <eob>
We call this effect "neural entrainment." <eob> And to explain to you <eol> what is neural entrainment, <eob> let me first explain <eol> what is physical entrainment. <eob>
So, we'll look and see five metronomes. <eob>
Think of these five metronomes <eol> as five brains. <eob>
And similar to the listeners <eol> before the story starts, <eob> these metronomes are going to click, <eob> but they're going to click out of phase. <eob> (Clicking) <eob>
This rotation vibration <eol> is going through the wood <eob> and is going to couple <eol> all the metronomes together. <eob>
And now listen to the click. <eob> (Synchronized clicking) <eob> This is what you call <eol> physical entrainment. <eob>
Now let's go back to the brain and ask: <eob> What's driving this neural entrainment? <eob>
Is it simply the sounds <eol> that the speaker is producing? <eob>
Or maybe it's the words. <eob>
Or maybe it's the meaning <eol> that the speaker is trying to convey. <eob>
So to test it, we did <eol> the following experiment. <eob>
First, we took the story <eol> and played it backwards. <eob>
And that preserved many <eol> of the original auditory features, <eob> but removed the meaning. <eob>
And it sounds something like that. <eob> (Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) <eob> And we flashed colors in the two brains <eob> to indicate brain areas that respond <eol> very similarly across people. <eob>
And as you can see, <eob> this incoming sound induced entrainment <eol> or alignment in all of the brains <eob> in auditory cortices <eol> that process the sounds, <eob> but it didn't spread <eol> deeper into the brain. <eob>
Now we can take these sounds <eol> and build words out of it. <eob>
So if we take <eob> Jim O'Grady <eob> and scramble the words, <eob> we'll get a list of words. <eob> (Audio) JO:... an animal... <eol> assorted facts... and right on... pie man... potentially... my stories <eob>
UH: And you can see that these words <eol> start to induce alignment <eob> in early language areas, <eol> but not more than that. <eob> Now we can take the words <eol> and start to build sentences out of them. <eob> (Audio) JO: <eob> And they recommend against crossing that line. <eob>
He says: "Dear Jim, <eol> Good story. Nice details. <eob> Didn't she only know <eol> about him through me?" <eob>
UH: Now you can see <eol> that the responses in all the language areas <eob> that process the incoming language <eob> become aligned or similar <eob> across all listeners. <eob>
However, only when we use <eol> the full, engaging, coherent story <eob> do the responses spread <eol> deeper into the brain <eob> into higher-order areas, <eob> which include the frontal cortex <eol> and the parietal cortex, <eob> and make all of them <eol> respond very similarly. <eob>
And we believe that these responses <eol> in higher-order areas are induced <eob> or become similar across listeners <eob> because of the meaning <eol> conveyed by the speaker, <eob> and not by words or sound. <eob>
And if we are right, <eol> there's a strong prediction over here <eob> if I tell you the exact same ideas <eob> using two very different sets of words, <eob> your brain responses <eol> will still be similar. <eob>
And to test it, we did <eol> the following experiment in my lab. <eob>
We took the English story <eob> and translated it to Russian. <eob>
Now you have two different sounds <eol> and linguistic systems <eob> that convey the exact same meaning. <eob>
And you play the English story <eol> to the English listeners <eob> and the Russian story <eol> to the Russian listeners, <eob> and we can compare their responses <eol> across the groups. <eob>
And when we did that, we didn't see <eol> responses that are similar <eob> in auditory cortices in language, <eob> because the language <eol> and sound are very different. <eob>
However, you can see <eol> that the responses in high-order areas <eob> were still similar <eol> across these two groups. <eob>
We believe this is because they understood <eol> the story in a very similar way, <eob> as we confirmed, using a test <eol> after the story ended. <eob>
And we think that this alignment <eol> is necessary for communication. <eob>
For example, as you can tell, <eob> I am not a native English speaker. <eob>
I grew up with another language, <eob> and the same might be for many <eol> of you in the audience. <eob>
And still, we can communicate. <eob> How come? <eob> We think we can communicate <eol> because we have this common code <eob> that presents meaning. <eob>
So far, I've only talked about <eol> what's happening in the listener's brain, <eob> in your brain, when <eol> you're listening to talks. <eob>
But what's happening <eol> in the speaker's brain, in my brain, <eob> when I'm speaking to you? <eob>
To look in the speaker's brain, <eob> we asked the speaker <eol> to go into the scanner, <eob> we scan his brain <eob> and then compare his brain responses <eol> to the brain responses of the listeners <eob> listening to the story. <eob>
You have to remember that producing speech <eol> and comprehending speech <eob> are very different processes. <eob>
Here we're asking: How similar are they? <eob>
To our surprise, <eob> we saw that all these complex <eol> patterns within the listeners <eob> actually came from the speaker brain. <eob>
So production and comprehension <eol> rely on very similar processes. <eob>
And we also found <eob> the stronger the similarity <eol> between the listener's brain <eob> and the speaker's brain, <eob> the better the communication. <eob>
So I know that if you <eol> are completely confused now, <eob> and I do hope that this is not the case, <eob> your brain responses <eol> are very different than mine. <eob>
But I also know that if you really <eol> understand me now, <eob> then your brain ... and your brain <eol> ... and your brain <eob> are really similar to mine. <eob>
Now, let's take all <eol> this information together and ask: <eob> How can we use it to transmit <eol> a memory that I have <eob> from my brain to your brains? <eob>
So we did the following experiment. <eob> We let people watch, <eol> for the first time in their life, <eob> a TV episode from the BBC series <eol> "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains. <eob>
And then we asked them <eol> to go back to the scanner <eob> and tell the story to another person <eol> that never watched the movie. <eob> So let's be specific. <eob> Think about this exact scene, <eob> when Sherlock is entering <eol> the cab in London <eob> driven by the murderer he is looking for. <eob>
With me, as a viewer, <eob> there is a specific brain pattern <eol> in my brain when I watch it. <eob>
Now, the exact same pattern, <eol> I can reactivate in my brain again <eob> by telling the word: <eol> Sherlock, London, murderer. <eob>
And when I'm transmitting <eol> these words to your brains now, <eob> you have to reconstruct it in your mind. <eob>
In fact, we see that pattern <eol> emerging now in your brains. <eob>
And we were really surprised to see <eob> that the pattern you have <eol> now in your brains <eob> when I'm describing to you these scenes <eob> would be very similar to the pattern <eol> I had when I watched this movie <eob> a few months ago in the scanner. <eob>
This starts to tell you <eol> about the mechanism <eob> by which we can tell stories <eol> and transmit information. <eob>
Because, for example, <eob> now you're listening really hard <eol> and trying to understand what I'm saying. <eob> And I know that it's not easy. <eob> But I hope that at one point <eol> in the talk we clicked, and you got me. <eob>
And I think that in a few hours, <eol> a few days, a few months, <eob> you're going to meet someone at a party, <eob> and you're going to tell him <eol> about this lecture, <eob> and suddenly it will be as if <eol> he is standing now here with us. <eob>
Now you can see <eol> how we can take this mechanism <eob> and try to transmit memories <eol> and knowledge across people, <eob> which is wonderful, right? <eob>
But our ability to communicate <eol> relies on our ability <eob> to have common ground. <eob>
Because, for example, <eob> if I'm going to use the British synonym <eob> "hackney carriage" instead of "cab," <eob> I know that I'm going to be misaligned <eol> with most of you in the audience. <eob>
This alignment depends <eol> not only on our ability <eob> to understand the basic concept; <eob> it also depends on our ability to develop <eol> common ground and understanding <eob> and shared belief systems. <eob>
Because we know that in many cases, <eob> people understand the exact <eol> same story in very different ways. <eob>
So to test it in the lab, <eol> we did the following experiment. <eob>
We took a story by J.D. Salinger, <eob> in which a husband lost track <eol> of his wife in the middle of a party, <eob> and he's calling his best friend, asking, <eol> "Did you see my wife?" <eob> For half of the subjects, <eob> we said that the wife was having <eol> an affair with the best friend. <eob> For the other half, <eob> we said that the wife is loyal <eol> and the husband is very jealous. <eob>
This one sentence before the story started <eob> was enough to make the brain responses <eob> of all the people that believed <eol> the wife was having an affair <eob> be very similar in these high-order areas <eob> and different than the other group. <eob>
And if one sentence is enough <eol> to make your brain similar <eob> to people that think like you <eob> and very different than people <eol> that think differently than you, <eob> think how this effect is going <eol> to be amplified in real life, <eob> when we are all listening <eol> to the exact same news item <eob> after being exposed <eol> day after day after day <eob> to different media channels, <eol> like Fox News or The New York Times, <eob> that give us very different <eol> perspectives on reality. <eob>
So let me summarize. <eob> If everything worked as planned tonight, <eob> I used my ability to vocalize sound <eol> to be coupled to your brains. <eob>
And I used this coupling <eob> to transmit my brain patterns associated <eol> with my memories and ideas <eob> into your brains. <eob>
In this, I start to reveal <eol> the hidden neural mechanism <eob> by which we communicate. <eob>
And we know that in the future <eol> it will enable us to improve <eob> and facilitate communication. <eob>
But these studies also reveal <eob> that communication relies <eol> on a common ground. <eob>
And we have to be <eol> really worried as a society <eob> if we lose this common ground <eol> and our ability to speak with people <eob> that are slightly different than us <eob> because we let a few very strong <eol> media channels <eob> take control of the mic, <eob> and manipulate and control <eol> the way we all think. <eob>
And I'm not sure how to fix it <eol> because I'm only a scientist. <eob>
But maybe one way to do it <eob> is to go back to the more <eol> natural way of communication, <eob> which is a dialogue, <eob> in which it's not only me <eol> speaking to you now, <eob> but a more natural way of talking, <eob> in which I am speaking and I am listening, <eob> and together we are trying to come <eol> to a common ground and new ideas. <eob>
Because after all, <eob> the people we are coupled to <eol> define who we are. <eob>
And our desire to be coupled <eol> to another brain <eob> is something very basic <eol> that starts at a very early age. <eob>
So let me finish with an example <eol> from my own private life <eob> that I think is a good example <eol> of how coupling to other people <eob> is really going to define who we are. <eob>
This my son Jonathan at a very early age. <eob>
See how he developed <eol> a vocal game together with my wife, <eob> only from the desire and pure joy <eol> of being coupled to another human being. <eob> (Both vocalizing) <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Now, think how the ability of my son <eob> to be coupled to us <eol> and other people in his life <eob> is going to shape the man <eol> he is going to become. <eob>
And think how you change on a daily basis <eob> from the interaction and coupling <eol> to other people in your life. <eob>
So keep being coupled to other people. <eob>
Keep spreading your ideas, <eob> because the sum of all of us <eol> together, coupled, <eob> is greater than our parts. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
As a conceptual artist, <eob> I'm constantly looking for creative ways <eol> to spark challenging conversations. <eob>
I do this though painting, sculpture, <eol> video and performance. <eob>
But regardless of the format, <eob> two of my favorite materials <eol> are history and dialogue. <eob>
In 2007, I created "Lotus," <eob> a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter, <eob> 600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom. <eob>
In Buddhism, the lotus <eol> is a symbol for transcendence <eob> and for purity of mind and spirit. <eob>
But a closer look at this lotus <eob> reveals each petal to be the cross-section <eol> of a slave ship. <eob> This iconic diagram was taken <eol> from a British slaving manual <eob> and later used by abolitionists <eol> to show the atrocities of slavery. <eob>
In America, we don't like <eol> to talk about slavery, <eob> nor do we look at it <eol> as a global industry. <eob>
But by using this Buddhist symbol, <eob> I hope to universalize <eol> and transcend <eob> the history and trauma of black America <eob> and encourage discussions <eol> about our shared past. <eob>
To create "Lotus," we carved <eol> over 6,000 figures. <eob>
And this later led to a commission <eol> by the City of New York <eob> to create a 28-foot version in steel <eob> as a permanent installation <eol> at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, <eob> a school for black and latino students, <eob> the two groups most affected <eol> by this history. <eob>
The same two groups are very affected <eol> by a more recent phenomenon, <eob> but let me digress. <eob>
I've been collecting wooden African figures <eob> from tourist shops and flea <eol> markets around the world. <eob>
The authenticity and origin of them <eol> is completely debatable, <eob> but people believe these <eol> to be imbued with power, <eob> or even magic. <eob>
Only recently have I figured out <eol> how to use this in my own work. <eob>
(Gun shots) <eob>
Since 2012, the world <eol> has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin, <eob> Michael Brown, Eric Garner, <eol> Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice <eob> and literally countless <eol> other unarmed black citizens <eob> at the hands of the police, <eob> who frequently walk away <eol> with no punishment at all. <eob>
In consideration of these victims <eob> and the several times that even I, <eob> a law-abiding, Ivy League professor, <eob> have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police. <eob> I created this body of work <eol> simply entitled "BAM." <eob>
It was important to erase the identity <eol> of each of these figures, <eob> to make them all look the same <eol> and easier to disregard. <eob>
To do this, I dip them <eol> in a thick, brown wax <eob> before taking them to a shooting range <eob> where I re-sculpted them using bullets. <eob>
And it was fun, <eob> playing with big guns and high-speed <eol> video cameras. <eob>
But my reverence for these figures <eol> kept me from actually pulling the trigger, <eob> somehow feeling as if I would <eol> be shooting myself. <eob>
Finally, my cameraman, <eol> Raul, fired the shots. <eob>
I then took the fragments of these <eob> and created molds, <eol> and cast them first in wax, <eob> and finally in bronze <eol> like the image you see here, <eob> which bears the marks <eol> of its violent creation <eob> like battle wounds or scars. <eob>
When I showed this work <eol> recently in Miami, <eob> a woman told me she felt <eol> every gun shot to her soul. <eob>
But she also felt <eol> that these artworks <eob> memorialized the victims <eol> of these killings <eob> as well as other victims of racial violence <eol> throughout US history. <eob>
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger <eol> than just US history. <eob>
While showing in Berlin last year, <eob> a philosophy student asked me <eol> what prompted these recent killings. <eob>
I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard <eob> from the early 1900s <eob> and reminded him that these killings <eol> have been going on for over 500 years. <eob>
But it's only through questions like his <eob> and more thoughtful dialogue <eol> about history and race <eob> can we evolve as individuals and society. <eob>
I hope my artwork creates a safe space <eob> for this type of honest exchange <eob> and an opportunity for people <eol> to engage one another <eob> in real and necessary conversation. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I think about dreams, <eob> like many of you, <eob> I think about this picture. <eob>
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong <eob> step off the Lunar Module <eol> onto the surface of the Moon. <eob>
I had never seen anything like it before, <eob> and I've never seen anything <eol> like it since. <eob>
We got to the Moon for one simple reason: <eob> John Kennedy committed us to a deadline. <eob>
And in the absence of that deadline, <eob> we would still be dreaming about it. <eob>
Leonard Bernstein said two things <eol> are necessary for great achievement: <eob> a plan and not quite enough time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Deadlines and commitments <eob> are the great and fading lessons <eol> of Apollo. <eob>
And they are what give the word <eol> "moonshot" its meaning. <eob>
And our world is in desperate <eol> need of political leaders <eob> willing to set bold deadlines <eob> for the achievement <eol> of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again. <eob>
When I think about dreams, <eob> I think about the drag queens <eol> of LA and Stonewall <eob> and millions of other people risking everything <eob> to come out when that was really dangerous, <eob> and of this picture of the White House <eol> lit up in rainbow colors, <eob> yes -- <eob>
(Applause) — <eob>
celebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' <eol> right to marry. <eob>
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams <eol> I could never have imagined <eob> when I was 18 <eob> and figuring out that I was gay <eob> and feeling estranged <eol> from my country <eob> and my dreams because of it. <eob>
I think about this picture <eob> of my family <eob> that I never dreamed I could ever have — <eob>
(Applause) — <eob>
and of our children <eol> holding this headline <eob> I never dreamed could ever be printed <eol> about the Supreme Court ruling. <eob>
We need more of the courage <eol> of drag queens and astronauts. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But I want to talk about <eol> the need for us to dream <eob> in more than one dimension, <eob> because there was something <eol> about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8, <eob> and something about organizing <eol> that the rainbow colors over. <eob>
Of the 30 astronauts <eol> in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, <eob> only seven marriages survived. <eob>
Those iconic images of the astronauts <eol> bouncing on the Moon <eob> obscure the alcoholism <eol> and depression on Earth. <eob>
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, <eob> asked during the time of Apollo, <eob> "What can we gain by sailing to the moon <eob> if we are not able to cross the abyss <eol> that separates us from ourselves?" <eob> And what can we gain by the right <eol> to marry <eob> if we are not able to cross the acrimony <eob> and emotional distance that so often separates us from our love? <eob>
And not just in marriage. <eob>
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive, <eob> tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS <eob> and breast cancer and non-profit activism, <eob> all in the name of love. <eob>
Thomas Merton also wrote about wars <eol> among saints <eob> and that "there is a pervasive form <eol> of contemporary violence <eob> to which the idealist <eol> most easily succumbs: <eob> activism and overwork. <eob>
The frenzy of our activism neutralizes <eol> our work for peace. <eob>
It destroys our own inner capacity <eol> for peace." <eob> Too often our dreams become <eol> these compartmentalized fixations <eob> on some future <eob> that destroy our ability to be present <eol> for our lives right now. <eob>
Our dreams of a better life <eol> for some future humanity <eob> or some other humanity <eol> in another country <eob> alienate us from the beautiful human beings <eol> sitting next to us <eob> at this very moment. <eob>
Well, that's just the price <eol> of progress, we say. <eob>
You can go to the Moon <eob> or you can have stability <eol> in your family life. <eob>
And we can't conceive of dreaming <eol> in both dimensions at the same time. <eob>
And we don't set the bar much higher than stability <eob> when it comes to our emotional life. <eob>
Which is why our technology <eol> for talking to one another <eob> has gone vertical, <eob> our ability to listen <eol> and understand one another <eob> has gone nowhere. <eob>
Our access to information <eol> is through the roof, <eob> our access to joy, grounded. <eob>
But this idea, that our present <eol> and our future are mutually exclusive, <eob> that to fulfill our potential <eol> for doing we have to surrender <eob> our profound potential for being, <eob> that the number of transistors <eol> on a circuit can be doubled and doubled, <eob> but our capacity for compassion <eol> and humanity and serenity and love <eob> is somehow limited <eob> is a false and suffocating choice. <eob>
Now, I'm not suggesting <eob> simply the uninspiring idea <eol> of more work-life balance. <eob>
What good is it for me to spend <eol> more time with my kids at home <eob> if my mind is always somewhere else <eol> while I'm doing it? <eob>
I'm not even talking about mindfulness. <eob> Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool <eol> for improving productivity. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right? <eob>
I'm talking about dreaming <eob> as boldly in the dimension of our being <eob> as we do about industry and technology. <eob>
I'm talking about an audacious <eol> authenticity <eob> that allows us to cry <eol> with one another, <eob> a heroic humility that allows us <eol> to remove our masks and be real. <eob>
It is our inability to be with one another, <eob> our fear of crying with one another, <eol> that gives rise to so many <eob> of the problems we are frantically trying <eol> to solve in the first place, <eob> from Congressional gridlock <eol> to economic inhumanity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk <eol> called an Epoch B, <eob> a new epoch in which we become <eol> as excited about and curious about <eob> and scientific about the development <eol> of our humanity <eob> as we are about the development <eol> of our technology. <eob>
We should not shrink from this opportunity <eob> simply because we don't really understand it. <eob>
There was a time <eol> when we didn't understand space. <eob>
Or because we're more used <eol> to technology and activism. <eob>
That is the very definition <eol> of being stuck in a comfort zone. <eob>
We are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable <eol> technological achievement. <eob>
In 2016, it is the dimension <eol> of our being itself <eob> that cries out for its fair <eol> share of our imagination. <eob>
Now, we're all here to dream, <eob> but maybe if we're honest about it, <eob> each of us chasing our own dream. <eob>
You know, looking at the name tags <eol> to see who can help me with my dream, <eob> sometimes looking right through <eol> one another's humanity. <eob>
I can't be bothered with you right now. <eob>
I have an idea for saving the world. <eob> Right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Years ago, once upon a time, <eol> I had this beautiful company <eob> that created these long journeys <eol> for heroic civic engagement. <eob>
And we had this mantra: <eob> "Human. Kind. Be Both." <eob> And we encouraged people <eol> to experiment outrageously with kindness. <eob>
Like, "Go help everybody <eol> set up their tents." <eob> And there were a lot of tents. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Go buy everybody Popsicles." <eob> "Go help people fix <eol> their flat tires <eob> even though you know the dinner line <eol> is going to get longer." <eob>
And people really took us up on this, <eob> so much so that if you got <eol> a flat tire on the AIDS ride, <eob> you had trouble fixing it, <eol> because there were so many people there asking you <eob> if you needed help. <eob>
For a few days, for tens <eol> of thousands of people, <eob> we created these worlds <eob> that everybody said were the way <eol> they wish the world could always be. <eob>
What if we experimented with creating that kind of world <eob> these next few days? <eob>
And instead of going up to someone <eol> and asking them, "What do you do?" <eob> ask them, "So what are your dreams?" <eob> or "What are your broken dreams?" <eob> You know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober" <eob> or "I want to build a tree house with my kid." <eob> You know, instead of going up to the person <eol> everybody wants to meet, <eob> go up to the person who is all alone <eob> and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee. <eob>
I think what we fear most <eob> is that we will be denied the opportunity <eol> to fulfill our true potential, <eob> that we are born to dream <eob> and we might die without ever <eol> having the chance. <eob>
Imagine living in a world <eob> where we simply recognize that deep, <eol> existential fear in one another <eob> and love one another boldly because we know <eob> that to be human is to live with that fear. <eob>
It's time for us to dream <eol> in multiple dimensions simultaneously, <eob> and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things <eob> we can and will and must do <eob> lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be. <eob>
It's time we set foot <eol> into that dimension <eob> and came out about the fact <eol> that we have dreams there, too. <eob>
If the Moon could dream, <eob> I think that would be its dream for us. <eob>
It's an honor to be with you. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In the space that used to house <eol> one transistor, <eob> we can now fit one billion. <eob>
That made it so that a computer <eol> the size of an entire room <eob> now fits in your pocket. <eob>
You might say the future is small. <eob>
As an engineer, <eob> I'm inspired by this miniaturization <eol> revolution in computers. <eob>
As a physician, <eob> I wonder whether we could use it <eol> to reduce the number of lives lost <eob> due to one of the fastest-growing <eol> diseases on Earth: <eob> cancer. <eob>
Now when I say that, <eob> what most people hear me say <eol> is that we're working on curing <eob> cancer. <eob> And we are. <eob> But it turns out <eob> that there's an incredible <eol> opportunity to save lives <eob> through the early detection and prevention of cancer. <eob>
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths <eol> due to cancer are fully preventable <eob> using methods <eol> that we already have in hand today. <eob>
Things like vaccination, timely screening <eob> and of course, stopping smoking. <eob>
But even with the best tools <eol> and technologies that we have today, <eob> some tumors can't be detected <eob> until 10 years after <eol> they've started growing, <eob> when they are 50 million cancer cells strong. <eob>
What if we had better technologies <eob> to detect some of these more deadly <eol> cancers sooner, <eob> when they could be removed, <eob> when they were just getting started? <eob>
Let me tell you about how miniaturization <eol> might get us there. <eob>
This is a microscope in a typical lab <eob> that a pathologist would use <eol> for looking at a tissue specimen, <eob> like a biopsy or a pap smear. <eob>
This $7,000 microscope <eob> would be used by somebody <eol> with years of specialized training <eob> to spot cancer cells. <eob>
This is an image from a colleague of mine <eol> at Rice University, <eob> Rebecca Richards-Kortum. <eob>
What she and her team have done <eol> is miniaturize that whole microscope <eob> into this $10 part, <eob> and it fits on the end <eol> of an optical fiber. <eob>
Now what that means is instead <eol> of taking a sample from a patient <eob> and sending it to the microscope, <eob> you can bring the microscope <eol> to the patient. <eob>
And then, instead of requiring <eol> a specialist to look at the images, <eob> you can train the computer to score <eol> normal versus cancerous cells. <eob>
Now this is important, <eob> because what they found <eol> working in rural communities, <eob> is that even when they have <eol> a mobile screening van <eob> that can go out into the community <eol> and perform exams <eob> and collect samples <eob> and send them to the central <eol> hospital for analysis, <eob> that days later, <eob> women get a call with an abnormal test result <eob> and they're asked to come in. <eob>
Fully half of them don't turn up because <eol> they can't afford the trip. <eob>
With the integrated microscope <eol> and computer analysis, <eob> Rebecca and her colleagues <eol> have been able to create a van <eob> that has both a diagnostic <eol> setup and a treatment setup. <eob>
And what that means <eol> is that they can do a diagnosis <eob> and perform therapy on the spot, <eob> so no one is lost to follow up. <eob>
That's just one example <eol> of how miniaturization can save lives. <eob>
Now as engineers, <eob> we think of this <eol> as straight-up miniaturization. <eob>
You took a big thing <eol> and you made it little. <eob>
But what I told you before about computers <eob> was that they transformed our lives <eob> when they became small enough <eol> for us to take them everywhere. <eob>
So what is the transformational equivalent <eol> like that in medicine? <eob>
Well, what if you had a detector <eob> that was so small <eol> that it could circulate in your body, <eob> find the tumor all by itself <eob> and send a signal to the outside world? <eob>
It sounds a little bit <eol> like science fiction. <eob>
But actually, nanotechnology allows us <eol> to do just that. <eob>
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink <eol> the parts that make up the detector <eob> from the width of a human hair, <eob> which is 100 microns, <eob> to a thousand times smaller, <eob> which is 100 nanometers. <eob>
And that has profound implications. <eob>
It turns out that materials <eol> actually change their properties <eob> at the nanoscale. <eob>
You take a common material like gold, <eob> and you grind it into dust, <eol> into gold nanoparticles, <eob> and it changes from looking gold <eol> to looking red. <eob>
If you take a more exotic material <eol> like cadmium selenide -- <eob> forms a big, black crystal -- <eob> if you make nanocrystals out of this material <eob> and you put it in a liquid, <eob> and you shine light on it, <eob> they glow. <eob>
And <eob> they glow <eob> blue, green, yellow, orange, red, <eob> depending only on their size. <eob> It's wild! Can you imagine an object <eol> like that in the macro world? <eob>
It would be like all the denim jeans <eol> in your closet are all made of cotton, <eob> but they are different colors <eob> depending only on their size. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So as a physician, <eob> what's just as interesting to me <eob> is that it's not just the color of materials <eob> that changes <eob> at the nanoscale; <eob> the way they travel in your body also changes. <eob>
And this is the kind of observation <eol> that we're going to use <eob> to make a better cancer detector. <eob>
So let me show you what I mean. <eob> This is a blood vessel in the body. <eob>
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor. <eob>
We're going to inject nanoparticles <eol> into the blood vessel <eob> and watch how they travel <eol> from the bloodstream into the tumor. <eob>
Now it turns out that the blood <eol> vessels of many tumors are leaky, <eob> and so nanoparticles can leak out <eol> from the bloodstream into the tumor. <eob>
Whether they leak out depends <eol> on their size. <eob>
So in this image, <eob> the smaller, hundred-nanometer, <eol> blue nanoparticles are leaking out, <eob> and the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles <eob> are stuck in the bloodstream. <eob>
So that means as an engineer, <eob> depending on how big or small <eol> I make a material, <eob> I can change where it goes in your body. <eob>
In my lab, we recently made <eol> a cancer nanodetector <eob> that is so small that it could travel <eol> into the body and look for tumors. <eob>
We designed it to listen for tumor invasion: <eob> the orchestra of chemical signals <eol> that tumors need to make to spread. <eob>
For a tumor to break out of the tissue <eol> that it's born in, <eob> it has to make chemicals called enzymes <eob> to chew through the scaffolding of tissues. <eob>
We designed these nanoparticles <eol> to be activated by these enzymes. <eob>
One enzyme can activate a thousand of these <eol> chemical reactions in an hour. <eob>
Now in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio <eob> a form of amplification, <eob> and it makes something ultrasensitive. <eob>
So we've made an ultrasensitive <eol> cancer detector. <eob>
OK, but how do I get this <eol> activated signal to the outside world, <eob> where I can act on it? <eob>
For this, we're going to use <eol> one more piece of nanoscale biology, <eob> and that has to do with the kidney. <eob>
The kidney is a filter. <eob>
Its job is to filter out the blood <eol> and put waste into the urine. <eob>
It turns out that what the kidney filters <eob> is also dependent on size. <eob>
So in this image, <eob> what you can see <eob> is that everything smaller <eol> than five nanometers <eob> is going from the blood, <eol> through the kidney, into the urine, <eob> and everything else that's bigger <eol> is retained. <eob>
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector, <eob> I inject it in the bloodstream, <eob> it can leak into the tumor <eol> where it's activated by tumor enzymes <eob> to release a small signal <eob> that is small enough to be filtered out <eol> of the kidney <eob> and put into the urine, <eob> I have a signal in the outside world <eol> that I can detect. <eob>
OK, but there's one more problem. <eob>
This is a tiny little signal, <eob> so how do I detect it? <eob>
Well, the signal is just a molecule. <eob>
They're molecules <eol> that we designed as engineers. <eob>
They're completely synthetic, <eol> and we can design them <eob> so they are compatible <eol> with our tool of choice. <eob>
If we want to use a really <eol> sensitive, fancy instrument <eob> called a mass spectrometer, <eob> then we make a molecule <eol> with a unique mass. <eob>
Or maybe we want make something <eol> that's more inexpensive and portable. <eob>
Then we make molecules <eol> that we can trap on paper, <eob> like a pregnancy test. <eob>
In fact, there's a whole world <eol> of paper tests <eob> that are becoming available <eol> in a field called paper diagnostics. <eob>
Alright, where are we going with this? <eob> What I'm going to tell you next, <eob> as a lifelong researcher, <eob> represents a dream of mine. <eob>
I can't say that's it's a promise; <eob> it's a dream. <eob>
But I think we all have to have dreams <eol> to keep us pushing forward, <eob> even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers. <eob>
I'm going to tell you what I hope <eol> will happen with my technology, <eob> that my team and I will put <eol> our hearts and souls <eob> into making a reality. <eob>
OK, here goes. <eob>
I dream that one day, <eob> instead of going into an expensive <eol> screening facility <eob> to get a colonoscopy, <eob> or a mammogram, <eob> or a pap smear, <eob> that you could get a shot, <eob> wait an hour, <eob> and do a urine test <eol> on a paper strip. <eob>
I imagine that this could even happen <eob> without the need for steady electricity, <eob> or a medical professional in the room. <eob>
Maybe they could be far away <eob> and connected only by the image <eol> on a smartphone. <eob>
Now I know this sounds like a dream, <eob> but in the lab we already have <eol> this working in mice, <eob> where it works better than existing methods <eob> for the detection of lung, colon and ovarian <eob> cancer. <eob>
And I hope that what this means <eob> is that one day we can detect tumors in patients <eob> sooner than 10 years <eol> after they've started growing, <eob> in all walks of life, <eob> all around the globe, <eob> and that this would lead <eol> to earlier treatments, <eob> and that we could save more <eol> lives than we can today, <eob> with early detection. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Do I look real to you? <eob> Hope so. <eob> I have no idea if you're seeing this, <eob> but I'm just going to look ahead <eol> and trust that you're there. <eob>
I've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me <eob> so I don't walk past it and look <eol> like I'm floating in midair. <eob>
Right now I'm standing <eob> in the open air, <eob> on a beach under a palm tree, <eob> in the exact spot where your stage <eol> used to be. <eob>
I have 12 minutes with you. <eob>
I set a limit. <eob>
My wife Navid once said <eob> that infinite possibility <eol> is a creator's worst enemy. <eob>
For example, this dress: <eol> I'd asked her to design something <eob> that a priest might have worn <eol> in 23rd-century Cairo. <eob>
But we only had three days to make it, <eob> and the only fabric we had <eob> was an old duvet cover <eol> that another resident left behind. <eob>
But she did it, and it's perfect. <eob>
And she looked at it and said, <eob> "Proof of concept -- <eol> creation needs constraint." <eob> So with these 12 minutes, <eob> I'm going to tell you <eol> about my greatest discovery. <eob>
For my whole life, my obsession <eol> has been eternal life, <eob> as I know it is so many of yours. <eob>
You may be happy to know <eol> that your research will pay off. <eob>
I am 318 years old. <eob>
The average human lifespan <eol> is now 432 years, <eob> and my work has been to extend <eol> the human lifespan indefinitely. <eob>
And I've never questioned <eol> that someday, <eob> we'll reach a point where <eol> we'll be content. <eob>
But the opposite keeps happening: <eob> the longer we live, <eol> the longer we want to live, <eob> the less we want to die. <eob>
Who can blame us? <eob> The universe is so big. <eob>
There won't ever not be more to see. <eob>
Just yesterday, <eob> I was reading about how <eol> you can take out a boat on Europa <eob> and sail from island to island <eol> all over the planet, <eob> and some of the islands <eol> have villages that you can stay and visit <eob> and sleep under the shadow <eol> of Jupiter. <eob>
And then there's this other island <eol> where there's just one songwriter <eob> who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean. <eob>
And then there are others <eol> where there's no one <eob> and there never has been, <eob> and so you go just for the pleasure <eol> of touching your foot to sand <eob> that no foot has ever touched before. <eob>
You could spend 400 years doing just that. <eob>
Right now the Moon is rising <eol> in the Northeast. <eob>
I can see the cities <eol> on it with my naked eye. <eob>
They're connected like nerve clusters: <eob> Mariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator. <eob>
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility. <eob>
That's where Navid and I met. <eob>
We were both artists downtown. <eob>
The day we met, we were passing <eol> each other in Azadi Square, <eob> and we bumped shoulders. <eob>
And I turned to apologize <eob> and she, without saying hello <eol> or introducing herself or anything, <eob> said, "Well, why do you think <eol> we didn't just pass through each other?" <eob> And first of all, I thought, <eol> "Who the hell are you?" <eob> But second, the question annoyed me, <eob> because the answer is so simple. <eob>
I said, "We didn't pass through each other <eob> because elementary particles have mass <eob> and because the space between elementary particles <eob> is filled with the binding energy <eol> that also has the properties of mass, <eob> and we've known that for 800 years." <eob> She must have been in one of those moods <eob> where she likes to mess with strangers. <eob>
Or maybe she was just flirting with me, <eob> because she looked at me and said, <eol> "I thought you'd say that. <eob>
Think deeper." <eob> And then she took off her belt, <eob> this belt that I'm wearing now, <eob> and she said, <eob> "Our universe is built <eol> so that particles have mass. <eob>
Without that basic constraint, <eob> we'd have just passed right <eol> through each other at the speed of light <eob> and never even known." <eob>
And that's how our romance began. <eob>
Navid and I <eob> never ran out of things <eol> to talk about. <eob> Never. <eob> It was incredible. <eob> It was like we were both heroes climbing up <eol> into a mountain range together <eob> and we kept arriving at new vistas, <eob> and these new, perfect constellations of words <eob> would come out of us to describe them. <eob>
And we'd forget them <eol> as soon as we made them, <eob> and throw them over our shoulder <eol> and go on to the next thing, on and up. <eob>
Or one time, Navid said that our talk <eol> was like we were always making bread, <eob> and that we were always adding <eol> in a little more flour <eob> and a little more water, <eob> and folding it in and turning it over <eob> and never getting around to baking it. <eob>
If my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch. <eob>
She had a genius for it. <eob>
All of her work revolved around it. <eob>
My body was like a canvas for her, <eob> and she would draw her fingertip <eol> down over my face so slowly <eob> that I couldn't feel it moving. <eob>
And she was obsessed with the exact moment <eob> when I would stop being able to tell <eol> the difference between her body and mine. <eob>
Or she would just lie across me <eol> and dig her shoulder into mine <eob> and say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?" <eob> I'd say, "I don't know!" <eob> And she always had a facetious answer <eol> for her facetious question, <eob> but the answer I remember today is, <eob> "It feels good <eob> because the universe chose its constraints, <eob> and we are its art." <eob>
It's always funny what you think <eol> the future is going to be like <eob> versus what it turns out to be. <eob>
In your time, scientists thought <eol> humans could freeze themselves <eob> and wake up in the future. <eob>
And they did — but then they died. <eob>
In your time, scientists thought <eol> humans could replace organs <eob> and extend life for hundreds of years. <eob>
And they did, <eob> but eventually, they died anyway. <eob>
In your time, Earth is the only <eol> place people live. <eob>
In my time, Earth is the place <eol> people come to die. <eob>
So when Navid started to show the signs, <eob> our friends assumed I would do <eol> what everyone does, <eob> which is say goodbye and send her to Earth, <eob> so that none of us would have to look at her <eob> or be around her or think <eol> about her and her ... <eob> failure to keep living. <eob>
More than anything, <eob> they didn't want to be around <eol> her actual physical body. <eob>
They kept referring to it <eol> as "declining," <eob> even though she herself was fascinated by it, <eob> the changes it was going through, <eob> following the rules of its nature day <eol> by day, independent of her will. <eob>
I did send Navid to Earth. <eob>
But I came with her. <eob>
I remember a friend of ours, <eol> just before we left, said, <eob> "I just think it's arrogant, <eob> like the rules don't apply to you, <eol> like you think your love is that special." <eob> But I did. <eob>
So, even here on Earth, <eob> I kept working on how to extend life. <eob>
It didn't occur to me <eob> that there could be any other response. <eob>
I kept going back to that thing <eol> that Navid said to me <eob> that day in Azadi Square, <eob> that without that basic constraint -- <eob> a universe that granted mass to matter -- <eob> we would not exist. <eob>
That's one rule. <eob>
Another rule is that all mass <eol> is subject to entropy. <eob>
And there is no way to be <eol> in this universe without mass. <eob> I know. I tried everything. <eob> I tried creating a photon box <eol> where the Higgs field was altered. <eob>
I tried recording all subatomic movements <eol> in my body <eob> and replaying them on closed loop. <eob> Nothing worked. <eob>
But my final innovation was to create <eol> a coil dimension <eob> with the boundaries of a body <eol> in which time moved infinitely slower, <eob> but whose projection would appear <eol> to move in normal time. <eob>
That body would then appear <eol> in our universe as a hologram -- <eob> here but not here. <eob>
When I realized I'd done it, <eob> I ran to her room, <eob> so happy to tell her <eol> I'd done it, <eob> moving through space <eol> almost normally to all eyes, <eob> even to my own, <eob> and went to lie down next to her, <eob> and forgot, and fell right through her. <eob>
I'd found a way to eternal life, <eob> at the expense of the one thing Navid loved most, <eob> which was to touch and be touched. <eob>
And she threw me out. <eob>
I still got to watch, though. <eob>
Humans live 400 years now, <eob> and we still die. <eob>
And when death comes, <eob> the dying still pick at their bedsheets, <eob> and their arms break out <eol> in blue and violet blooms on the insides, <eob> and their breaths get further and further apart, <eob> like they're falling asleep. <eob>
I've always thought that <eob> what gives a life meaning is adventure. <eob>
And death is just a problem <eob> we haven't discovered the solution to yet. <eob>
But maybe a life <eol> has meaning only because it ends. <eob>
Maybe that's the paradox: <eob> constraints don't constrain, <eol> they allow perfect freedom. <eob>
(Sighs) <eob>
There was a thunderstorm here this morning. <eob>
There is another forecast for tonight, <eob> but for now the sky is clear. <eob>
I can't feel the wind here, <eob> but I just asked one of the caretakers <eol> who passed by what it felt like, <eob> and she said <eob> it felt warm, like melted butter. <eob>
An answer worthy of my wife. <eob>
I have to find my way back to the flesh. <eob>
Until then, I take up no space <eol> but the space you give me. <eob>
Today, I am going to show you <eob> how this tablet and this virtual-reality <eol> headset that I'm wearing <eob> are going to completely revolutionize <eol> science education. <eob>
And I'm also going to show you <eob> how it can make any science teacher <eol> more than twice as effective. <eob>
But before I show you <eol> how all of this is possible, <eob> let's talk briefly about <eol> why improving the quality of science education <eob> is so vitally important. <eob>
If you think about it, <eob> the world is growing incredibly fast. <eob>
And with that growth comes <eol> a whole list of growing challenges, <eob> challenges such as dealing <eol> with global warming, <eob> solving starvation and water shortages <eob> and curing diseases, <eob> to name just a few. <eob>
And who, exactly, is going to help us <eol> solve all of these great challenges? <eob>
Well, to a very last degree, <eol> it is these young students. <eob>
This is the next generation <eol> of young, bright scientists. <eob>
And in many ways, we all rely on them <eob> for coming up with new, great innovations <eob> to help us solve <eol> all these challenges ahead of us. <eob>
And so a couple of years back, <eob> my cofounder and I were teaching <eol> university students just like these, <eob> only the students we were teaching <eol> looked a little bit more like this here. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And yes, this is really the reality out there <eob> in way too many universities <eol> around the world: <eob> students that are bored, disengaged <eob> and sometimes not even sure <eol> why they're learning about a topic <eob> in the first place. <eob>
So we started looking around <eol> for new, innovative teaching methods, <eob> but what we found was quite disappointing. <eob>
We saw that books <eol> were being turned into e-books, <eob> blackboards were being turned <eol> into YouTube videos <eob> and lecture hall monologues <eol> were being turned into MOOCs -- <eob> massive online open courses. <eob>
And if you think about it, <eob> all we're really doing here <eol> is taking the same content <eob> and the same format, <eob> and bringing it out to more students -- <eob> which is great, don't get me wrong, <eol> that is really great -- <eob> but the teaching method is still more or less the same, <eob> no real innovation there. <eob>
So we started looking elsewhere. <eob>
What we found was that flight simulators <eol> had been proven over and over again <eob> to be far more effective <eob> when used in combination <eol> with real, in-flight training to train the pilots. <eob>
And so we thought to ourselves: <eob> Why not just apply that to science? <eob>
Why not build a virtual <eol> laboratory simulator? <eob>
Well, we did it. <eob>
We basically set out to create <eob> a fully simulated, one-to-one, <eol> virtual reality laboratory simulator, <eob> where the students could perform experiments <eob> with mathematical equations <eob> that would simulate what would happen <eol> in a real-world lab. <eob>
But not just simple simulations -- <eob> we would also create advanced simulations <eob> with top universities like MIT, <eob> to bring out cutting-edge cancer research <eol> to these students. <eob>
And suddenly, the universities <eol> could save millions of dollars <eob> by letting the students <eol> perform virtual experiments <eob> before they go into the real laboratory. <eob>
And not only that; now, <eol> they could also understand -- <eob> even on a molecular level <eol> inside the machine -- <eob> what is happening to the machines. <eob>
And then they could suddenly perform <eob> dangerous experiments in the labs as well. <eob>
For instance also here, <eob> learning about salmonella <eol> bacteria, which is an important topic <eob> that many schools cannot teach <eol> for good safety reasons. <eob>
And we, of course, quiz the students <eob> and then give the teachers <eol> a full dashboard, <eob> so they fully understand <eol> where the students are at. <eob>
But we didn't stop there, <eob> because we had seen just how important meaning is <eob> for the students' <eol> engagement in the class. <eob>
So we brought in game designers <eob> to create fun and engaging stories. <eob>
For instance, here in this case, <eob> where the students have to solve <eol> a mysterious CSI murder case <eob> using their core science skills. <eob>
And the feedback we got <eol> when we launched all of this <eob> was quite overwhelmingly positive. <eob>
Here we have 300 students, <eob> all passionately solving CSI murder cases <eob> while learning core science skills. <eob>
And what I love the most about this <eob> is really when the students <eol> come up to me sometimes afterwards, <eob> all surprised and a little confused, <eob> and say, "I just spent two hours <eol> in this virtual lab, <eob> and ... and I didn't check Facebook." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's how engaging and immersive <eol> this really is for the students. <eob>
And so, to investigate <eol> whether this really worked, <eob> a learning psychologist <eol> did a study with 160 students — <eob> that was from Stanford University <eol> and Technical University of Denmark. <eob>
And what they did is split <eol> the students into two groups. <eob>
One group would only use <eol> the virtual laboratory simulations, <eob> the other group would only use <eol> traditional teaching methods, <eob> and they had the same amount of time. <eob>
Then, interestingly, <eob> they gave the students a test <eol> before and after the experiment, <eob> so they could clearly measure <eol> the learning impact of the students. <eob>
And what they found <eob> was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase <eol> in the learning effectiveness <eob> when using virtual laboratories <eol> over traditional teaching methods. <eob>
But even more interestingly, <eob> the second part of this study investigated <eob> what the teacher's impact <eol> was on the learning. <eob>
And what they found <eob> was that when you combined <eol> the virtual laboratories <eob> with teacher-led coaching and mentoring, <eob> then we saw a total 101 percent <eol> increase in the learning effectiveness, <eob> which effectively doubles the science <eol> teacher's impact <eob> with the same amount of time spent. <eob>
So a couple of months back, <eob> we started asking ourselves -- <eob> we have a wonderful team <eol> now of learning psychologists <eob> and teachers and scientists <eol> and game developers -- <eob> and we started asking ourselves: <eob> How can we keep ourselves to our promise <eob> of constantly reimagining education? <eob>
And today, I am really excited <eol> to be presenting what we came up with <eob> and have been working <eol> incredibly hard to create. <eob>
I will explain briefly what this is. <eob>
Basically, I take my mobile phone -- <eob> most students already <eol> have these, smartphones -- <eob> and I plug it into this virtual-reality <eol> headset, a low-cost headset. <eob>
And now what I can effectively do is, <eob> I can literally step <eol> into this virtual world. <eob>
We'll have some of you in the audience <eol> also get to try this, <eob> because it is really something <eol> that you have to try <eob> to fully feel how immersive it really is. <eob>
It literally feels like I just stepped <eol> inside this virtual lab. <eob>
Do you see me up on the screen? <eob>
Audience: Yes. <eob>
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome. <eob>
So basically, I have just turned my mobile phone <eob> into a fully simulated, <eol> million-dollar Ivy League laboratory <eob> with all this amazing equipment <eol> that I can interact with. <eob>
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette <eol> and do experiments with it. <eob>
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR <eol> and -- oh, look there, <eob> I have my next-generation <eol> sequencing machine, <eob> and there I even have my electron microscope. <eob>
I mean, who's carrying around an electron <eol> microscope in their pocket? <eob>
And here I have my machine, <eob> I can do different experiments <eol> on the machine. <eob>
And over here I have the door, <eob> I can go into other experiments, <eob> I can perform in the laboratories. <eob>
And here, I have my learning tablet. <eob>
This is an intelligent tablet <eob> that allows me to read <eol> about relevant theory. <eob>
As you can see, I can interact with it. <eob>
I can watch videos and see content <eol> that is relevant <eob> to the experiment <eol> that I'm performing right now. <eob>
Then over here, I have Marie. <eob>
She is my teacher -- my lab assistant -- <eob> and what she does is guides me <eol> through this whole laboratory. <eob>
And very soon, <eob> the teachers will be able <eol> to literally teleport themselves <eob> into this virtual world <eol> that I'm in right now <eob> and help me, guide me, <eol> through this whole experiment. <eob>
And now before I finalize this, <eob> I want to show you <eol> an even cooler thing, I think -- <eob> something you cannot even do <eol> in real laboratories. <eob>
This is a PCR machine. <eob>
I'm now going to start this experiment. <eob>
And what I just did is <eol> literally shrunk myself a million times <eob> into the size of a molecule -- <eob> and it really feels like it, <eol> you have to try this. <eob>
So now it feels like <eol> I'm standing inside the machine <eob> and I'm seeing all the DNA, <eol> and I see the molecules. <eob>
I see the polymerase <eol> and the enzymes and so forth. <eob>
And I can see how in this case, <eob> DNA is being replicated <eol> millions of times, <eob> just like it's happening <eol> inside your body right now. <eob>
And I can really feel and understand <eol> how all of this works. <eob>
Now, I hope that gives you a little bit <eol> of a sense <eob> of the possibilities <eol> in these new teaching methods. <eob>
And I want to also emphasize <eob> that everything you just saw <eol> also works on iPads and laptops <eob> without the headsets. <eob>
I say that for a very important reason. <eob>
In order for us <eol> to really empower and inspire <eob> the next generation of scientists, <eob> we really need teachers <eol> to drive the adoption <eob> of new technologies in the classroom. <eob>
And so in many ways, <eob> I believe that the next big, <eol> quantum leap in science education <eob> lies no longer with the technology, <eob> but rather with the teachers' decision <eob> to push forward and adopt these technologies <eob> inside the classrooms. <eob>
And so it is our hope that more universities <eol> and schools and teachers <eob> will collaborate with technology companies <eob> to realize this full potential. <eob>
And so, <eob> lastly, I'd like to leave you <eol> with a little story <eob> that really inspires me. <eob>
And that is the story of Jack Andraka. <eob>
Some of you might already know him. <eob>
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking <eol> low-cost test for pancreatic cancer <eob> at the age 15. <eob>
And when Jack shares his story of how <eol> he did this huge breakthrough, <eob> he also explains that one thing <eol> almost prevented him <eob> from making this breakthrough. <eob>
And that was that he did not have <eol> access to real laboratories, <eob> because he was too inexperienced <eob> to be allowed in. <eob>
Now, imagine if we could bring <eob> Ivy League, million-dollar <eol> virtual laboratories <eob> out to all these students <eol> just like Jack, <eob> all over the world, <eob> and give them the latest, greatest, <eol> most fancy machines you can imagine <eob> that would quite literally make <eol> any scientist in here <eob> jump up and down out of pure excitement. <eob>
And then imagine how <eol> that would empower and inspire <eob> a whole new generation <eol> of young and bright scientists, <eob> ready to innovate and change the world. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hi. <eob> Let me ask the audience a question: <eob> Did you ever lie as a child? <eob>
If you did, could you please raise your hand? <eob> Wow! This is the most honest group <eol> of people I've ever met. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So for the last 20 years, <eob> I've been studying how children <eol> learn to tell lies. <eob>
And today, I'm going to share with you <eob> some of the discoveries we have made. <eob>
But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story <eol> from Mr. Richard Messina, <eob> who is my friend and an elementary <eol> school principal. <eob>
He got a phone call one day. <eob>
The caller says, <eob> "Mr. Messina, my son Johnny <eol> will not come to school today <eob> because he's sick." <eob>
Mr. Messina asks, <eob> "Who am I speaking to, please?" <eob>
And the caller says, <eob> "I am my father." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this story -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
sums up very nicely three common <eol> beliefs we have <eob> about children and lying. <eob>
One, children only come to tell lies <eob> after entering elementary school. <eob>
Two, children are poor liars. <eob>
We adults can easily detect their lies. <eob>
And three, if children lie <eol> at a very young age, <eob> there must be some character <eol> flaws with them, <eob> and they are going to become pathological liars for life. <eob>
Well, it turns out <eob> all of the three beliefs are wrong. <eob>
We have been playing guessing games <eob> with children all over the world. <eob> Here is an example. <eob> So in this game, we asked children <eol> to guess the numbers on the cards. <eob>
And we tell them if they win the game, <eob> they are going to get a big prize. <eob>
But in the middle of the game, <eob> we make an excuse and leave the room. <eob>
And before we leave the room, <eob> we tell them not to peek at the cards. <eob>
Of course, <eob> we have hidden cameras in the room <eob> to watch their every move. <eob>
Because the desire to win <eol> the game is so strong, <eob> more than 90 percent of children <eol> will peek <eob> as soon as we leave the room. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The crucial question is: <eob> When we return and ask the children <eob> whether or not they have peeked, <eob> will the children who peeked confess <eob> or lie about their transgression? <eob>
We found that regardless of gender, <eol> country, religion, <eob> at two years of age, <eob> 30 percent lie, <eob> 70 percent tell the truth <eol> about their transgression. <eob>
At three years of age, <eob> 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth. <eob>
At four years of age, <eob> more than 80 percent lie. <eob>
And after four years of age, <eob> most children lie. <eob>
So as you can see, <eob> lying is really a typical <eol> part of development. <eob>
And some children begin to tell lies <eob> as young as two years of age. <eob>
So now, let's take a closer look <eol> at the younger children. <eob>
Why do some but not all young <eol> children lie? <eob>
In cooking, you need good ingredients <eob> to cook good food. <eob>
And good lying requires two key <eol> ingredients. <eob>
The first key ingredient <eol> is theory of mind, <eob> or the mind-reading ability. <eob>
Mind reading is the ability to know <eob> that different people have different <eol> knowledge about the situation <eob> and the ability to differentiate <eol> between what I know <eob> and what you know. <eob>
Mind reading is important for lying <eob> because the basis of lying is that I know <eob> you don't know <eob> what I know. <eob>
Therefore, I can lie to you. <eob>
The second key ingredient <eol> for good lying is self-control. <eob>
It is the ability to control your speech, <eol> your facial expression <eob> and your body language, <eob> so that you can tell <eol> a convincing lie. <eob>
And we found that those young children <eob> who have more advanced mind-reading <eol> and self-control abilities <eob> tell lies earlier <eob> and are more sophisticated liars. <eob>
As it turns out, these two abilities <eol> are also essential for all of us <eob> to function well in our society. <eob>
In fact, deficits in mind-reading <eol> and self-control abilities <eob> are associated with serious developmental problems, <eob> such as ADHD and autism. <eob>
So if you discover your two-year-old <eol> is telling his or her first lie, <eob> instead of being alarmed, <eob> you should celebrate -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
because it signals <eol> that your child has arrived at a new milestone <eob> of typical development. <eob>
Now, are children poor liars? <eob> Do you think you can easily <eol> detect their lies? <eob>
Would you like to give it a try? <eob> Yes? OK. <eob> So I'm going to show you two videos. <eob>
In the videos, <eob> the children are going to respond <eol> to a researcher's question, <eob> "Did you peek?" <eob> So try to tell me <eob> which child is lying <eob> and which child is telling the truth. <eob>
Here's child number one. <eob> Are you ready? <eob>
(Video) Adult: <eob> Did you peek? <eob> Child: No. <eob>
Kang Lee: And this is child number two. <eob>
(Video) Adult: <eob> Did you peek? <eob> Child: No. <eob>
KL: OK, if you think <eol> child number one is lying, <eob> please raise your hand. <eob>
And if you think <eob> child number two is lying, <eob> please raise your hand. <eob>
OK, so as a matter of fact, <eob> child number one is telling the truth, <eob> child number two is lying. <eob>
Looks like many of you are terrible <eol> detectors of children's lies. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, we have played similar <eol> kinds of games <eob> with many, <eol> many adults from all walks of life. <eob>
And we show them many videos. <eob>
In half of the videos, the children lied. <eob>
In the other half of the videos, <eol> the children told the truth. <eob>
And let's find out <eol> how these adults performed. <eob>
Because there are as many liars <eol> as truth tellers, <eob> if you guess randomly, <eob> there's a 50 percent chance <eol> you're going to get it right. <eob>
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent, <eob> it means you are a terrible detector <eol> of children's lies. <eob>
So let's start with undergrads <eol> and law school students, <eob> who typically have limited <eol> experience with children. <eob>
No, they cannot detect children's lies. <eob>
Their performance is around chance. <eob>
Now how about social workers <eol> and child-protection lawyers, <eob> who work with children on a daily basis? <eob>
Can they detect children's lies? <eob> No, they cannot. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What about judges, <eob> customs officers <eob> and police officers, <eob> who deal with liars on a daily basis? <eob>
Can they detect children's lies? <eob>
No, they cannot. <eob>
What about parents? <eob> Can parents detect other children's lies? <eob>
No, they cannot. <eob> What about, can parents <eol> detect their own children's lies? <eob> No, they cannot. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
So now you may ask <eob> why children's lies <eol> are so difficult to detect. <eob>
Let me illustrate this <eol> with my own son, Nathan. <eob>
This is his facial expression <eob> when he lies. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So when children lie, <eob> their facial expression <eol> is typically neutral. <eob>
However, behind this neutral expression, <eob> the child is actually experiencing <eol> a lot of emotions, <eob> such as fear, guilt, shame <eob> and maybe a little bit of liar's delight. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Unfortunately, such emotions <eol> are either fleeting or hidden. <eob>
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us. <eob>
So in the last five years, <eob> we have been trying to figure out a way <eol> to reveal these hidden emotions. <eob>
Then we made a discovery. <eob>
We know that underneath our facial skin, <eob> there's a rich network of blood vessels. <eob>
When we experience different emotions, <eob> our facial blood flow changes subtly. <eob>
And these changes are regulated <eol> by the autonomic system <eob> that is beyond our conscious control. <eob>
By looking at facial blood flow changes, <eob> we can reveal people's hidden emotions. <eob>
Unfortunately, such emotion-related <eol> facial blood flow changes <eob> are too subtle to detect <eol> by our naked eye. <eob>
So to help us reveal people's facial emotions, <eob> we have developed a new imaging technology <eob> we call "transdermal optical imaging." <eob>
To do so, we use a regular video camera <eol> to record people <eob> when they experience various hidden emotions. <eob>
And then, using our image processing technology, <eob> we can extract transdermal images <eol> of facial blood flow changes. <eob>
By looking at transdermal video images, <eob> now we can easily see <eob> facial blood flow changes associated <eol> with the various hidden emotions. <eob>
And using this technology, <eob> we can now reveal the hidden <eol> emotions associated with lying, <eob> and therefore detect people's lies. <eob>
We can do so noninvasively, <eob> remotely, inexpensively, <eob> with an accuracy at about 85 percent, <eob> which is far better than chance level. <eob>
And in addition, we discovered <eol> a Pinocchio effect. <eob>
No, not this Pinocchio effect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is the real Pinocchio effect. <eob>
When people lie, <eob> the facial blood flow <eol> on the cheeks decreases, <eob> and the facial blood flow <eol> on the nose increases. <eob>
Of course, <eob> lying is not the only situation <eob> that will evoke our hidden emotions. <eob>
So then we asked ourselves, <eob> in addition to detecting lies, <eob> how can our technology be used? <eob>
One application is in education. <eob>
For example, using this technology, <eol> we can help this mathematics teacher <eob> to identify the student in his classroom <eob> who may experience high anxiety about the topic <eol> he's teaching <eob> so that he can help him. <eob>
And also we can use this in health care. <eob>
For example, every day I Skype my parents, <eob> who live thousands of miles away. <eob>
And using this technology, <eob> I can not only find out <eol> what's going on in their lives <eob> but also simultaneously <eol> monitor their heart rate, their stress level, <eob> their mood and whether or not <eol> they are experiencing pain. <eob>
And perhaps in the future, <eob> their risks for heart attack <eol> or hypertension. <eob>
And you may ask: <eob> Can we use this also to reveal <eol> politicians' emotions? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
For example, during a debate. <eob>
Well, the answer is yes. <eob>
Using TV footage, <eob> we could detect the politicians' heart rate, <eob> mood and stress, <eob> and perhaps in the future, <eol> whether or not they are lying to us. <eob>
We can also use this <eol> in marketing research, <eob> for example, to find out <eob> whether or not people like certain <eol> consumer products. <eob>
We can even use it in dating. <eob>
So for example, <eob> if your date is smiling at you, <eob> this technology can help you to determine <eob> whether she actually likes you <eob> or she is just trying to be nice to you. <eob>
And in this case, <eob> she is just trying to be nice to you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So transdermal optical imaging technology <eob> is at a very early stage of development. <eob>
Many new applications will come <eol> about that we don't know today. <eob>
However, one thing I know for sure <eob> is that lying will never be <eol> the same again. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I've got a confession. <eob>
I love looking through people's garbage. <eob>
Now, it's not some creepy thing. <eob>
I'm usually just looking for old electronics, <eob> stuff I can take to my workshop and hack. <eob>
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives. <eob>
Each one's got three different motors, <eob> so now you can build things that move. <eob>
There's switches so you can turn <eol> things on and off. <eob>
There's even a freaking laser, <eob> so you can make a cool robot <eol> into an awesome robot. <eob>
Now, I've built a lot of stuff <eol> out of garbage, <eob> and some of these things <eol> have even been kind of useful. <eob>
But here's the thing, <eob> for me, garbage <eol> is just a chance to play, <eob> to be creative and build things <eol> to amuse myself. <eob>
This is what I love doing, so I just made it <eol> part of my day job. <eob>
I lead a university-based biological research lab, <eob> where we value curiosity <eol> and exploration above all else. <eob>
We aren't focused on any particular problem, <eob> and we're not trying to solve <eol> any particular disease. <eob>
This is just a place where people can come <eob> and ask fascinating questions <eol> and find answers. <eob>
And I realized a long time ago <eob> that if I challenge people <eol> to build the equipment they need <eob> out of the garbage I find, <eob> it's a great way to foster creativity. <eob>
And what happened <eob> was that artists <eol> and scientists from around the world <eob> started coming to my lab. <eob>
And it's not just because <eol> we value unconventional ideas, <eob> it's because we test <eol> and validate them <eob> with scientific rigor. <eob>
So one day I was hacking something, <eol> I was taking it apart, <eob> and I had this sudden idea: <eob> Could I treat biology like hardware? <eob>
Could I dismantle a biological system, <eob> mix and match the parts <eob> and then put it back together <eol> in some new and creative way? <eob>
My lab started working on this, <eob> and I want to show you the result. <eob>
Can any of you guys tell me <eol> what fruit this is? <eob>
Audience: Apple! <eob>
Andrew Pelling: That's right -- <eol> it's an apple. <eob>
Now, I actually want you to notice as well <eob> that this is a lot redder <eol> than most apples. <eob>
And that's because we grew <eol> human cells into it. <eob>
We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple, <eob> removed all the apple cells and DNA <eob> and then implanted human cells. <eob>
And what we're left with <eol> after removing all the apple cells <eob> is this cellulose scaffold. <eob>
This is the stuff that gives plants <eol> their shape and texture. <eob>
And these little holes that you can see, <eob> this is where all the apple <eol> cells used to be. <eob>
So then we come along, <eob> we implant some mammalian cells <eol> that you can see in blue. <eob>
What happens is, these guys start multiplying <eob> and they fill up this entire scaffold. <eob>
As weird as this is, <eob> it's actually really reminiscent <eol> of how our own tissues are organized. <eob>
And we found in our pre-clinical work <eob> that you can implant these <eol> scaffolds into the body, <eob> and the body will send in cells and a blood supply <eob> and actually keep these things alive. <eob>
This is the point when people <eol> started asking me, <eob> "Andrew, can you make <eol> body parts out of apples?" <eob> And I'm like, "You've come to the right place." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I actually brought this up with my wife. <eob>
She's a musical instrument maker, <eob> and she does a lot of wood carving <eol> for a living. <eob>
So I asked her, <eob> "Could you, like, <eol> literally carve some ears <eob> out of an apple for us?" <eob> And she did. <eob>
So I took her ears to the lab. <eob>
We then started preparing them. <eob>
Yeah, I know. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's a good lab, man. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then we grew cells on them. <eob>
And this is the result. <eob>
Listen, my lab is not in <eol> the ear-manufacturing business. <eob>
People have actually been working <eol> on this for decades. <eob>
Here's the issue: <eob> commercial scaffolds can be <eol> really expensive and problematic, <eob> because they're sourced from proprietary products, <eob> animals or cadavers. <eob>
We used an apple and it cost pennies. <eob>
What's also really cool here <eob> is it's not that hard <eol> to make these things. <eob>
The equipment you need <eol> can be built from garbage, <eob> and the key processing step <eol> only requires soap and water. <eob>
So what we did was put all the instructions <eol> online as open source. <eob>
And then we founded a mission-driven company, <eob> and we're developing <eol> kits to make it easier <eob> for anyone with a sink <eol> and a soldering iron <eob> to make these things at home. <eob>
What I'm really curious about <eol> is if one day, <eob> it will be possible to repair, <eol> rebuild and augment our own bodies <eob> with stuff we make in the kitchen. <eob>
Speaking of kitchens, <eob> here's some asparagus. <eob>
They're tasty, and they make <eol> your pee smell funny. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I was in my kitchen, <eol> and I was noticing <eob> that when you look down the stalks <eol> of these asparagus, <eob> what you can see are all these tiny little vessels. <eob>
And when we image them in the lab, <eob> you can see how the cellulose forms <eol> these structures. <eob>
This image reminds me of two things: <eob> our blood vessels <eob> and the structure and organization <eol> of our nerves and spinal cord. <eob>
So here's the question: <eob> Can we grow axons <eol> and neurons down these channels? <eob>
Because if we can, <eob> then maybe we can use asparagus <eol> to form new connections <eob> between the ends of damaged <eol> and severed nerves. <eob>
Or maybe even a spinal cord. <eob>
Don't get me wrong -- <eob> this is exceptionally challenging <eob> and really hard work to do, <eob> and we are not the only ones <eol> working on this. <eob>
But we are the only ones using asparagus. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right now, we've got really <eol> promising pilot data. <eob>
And we're working with tissue engineers <eob> and neurosurgeons <eob> to find out what's actually possible. <eob>
So listen, all of the work <eol> I've shown you, <eob> the stuff that I've built <eol> that's all around me on this stage <eob> and the other projects my lab <eol> is involved in <eob> are all a direct result of me <eol> playing with your garbage. <eob>
Play -- play is a key part <eol> of my scientific practice. <eob>
It's how I train my mind <eol> to be unconventional and to be creative <eob> and to decide to make human apple ears. <eob>
So, the next time any of you <eol> are looking at some old, <eob> broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology, <eob> I want you to think of me. <eob>
Because I want it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Seriously, please find <eol> any way to get in touch with me, <eob> and let's see what we can build. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
By raising your hand, <eob> how many of you know <eol> at least one person on the screen? <eob>
Wow, it's almost a full house. <eob>
It's true, they are very famous <eol> in their fields. <eob>
And do you know what <eol> all of them have in common? <eob>
They all died of pancreatic cancer. <eob>
However, although it's very, <eol> very sad this news, <eob> it's also thanks to their personal stories <eob> that we have raised awareness <eol> of how lethal this disease can be. <eob>
It's become the third cause <eol> of cancer deaths, <eob> and only eight percent of the patients <eol> will survive beyond five years. <eob>
That's a very tiny number, <eob> especially if you compare it <eol> with breast cancer, <eob> where the survival rate <eol> is almost 90 percent. <eob>
So it doesn't really come as a surprise <eob> that being diagnosed <eol> with pancreatic cancer <eob> means facing an almost <eol> certain death sentence. <eob>
What's shocking, though, <eol> is that in the last 40 years, <eob> this number hasn't changed a bit, <eob> while much more progress has been made <eob> with other types of tumors. <eob>
So how can we make pancreatic cancer <eol> treatment more effective? <eob>
As a biomedical entrepreneur, <eob> I like to work on problems <eol> that seem impossible, <eob> understanding their limitations <eob> and trying to find new, <eol> innovative solutions <eob> that can change their outcome. <eob>
The first piece of bad news <eol> with pancreatic cancer <eob> is that your pancreas is in the middle <eol> of your belly, literally. <eob> It's depicted in orange on the screen. <eob>
But you can barely see it <eob> until I remove all the other <eol> organs in front. <eob>
It's also surrounded <eol> by many other vital organs, <eob> like the liver, the stomach, <eol> the bile duct. <eob>
And the ability of the tumor <eol> to grow into those organs <eob> is the reason why pancreatic cancer <eob> is one of the most painful tumor types. <eob>
The hard-to-reach location <eol> also prevents the doctor <eob> from surgically removing it, <eob> as is routinely done <eol> for breast cancer, for example. <eob>
So all of these reasons leave <eol> chemotherapy as the only option <eob> for the pancreatic cancer patient. <eob>
This brings us to the second <eol> piece of bad news. <eob>
Pancreatic cancer tumors have <eol> very few blood vessels. <eob>
Why should we care <eol> about the blood vessel of a tumor? <eob>
Let's think for a second <eol> how chemotherapy works. <eob>
The drug is injected in the vein <eob> and it navigates throughout the body <eol> until it reaches the tumor site. <eob>
It's like driving on a highway, <eol> trying to reach a destination. <eob>
But what if your destination <eol> doesn't have an exit on the highway? <eob>
You will never get there. <eob>
And that's exactly the same problem <eob> for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer. <eob>
The drugs navigate <eol> throughout all of your body. <eob>
They will reach healthy organs, <eob> resulting in high toxic effect <eol> for the patients overall, <eob> but very little will go to the tumor. <eob>
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited. <eob>
To me, it seems very counterintuitive <eol> to have a whole-body treatment <eob> to target a specific organ. <eob>
However, in the last 40 years, <eob> a lot of money, research <eol> and effort have gone towards <eob> finding new, powerful drugs <eol> to treat pancreatic cancer, <eob> but nothing has been done <eol> in changing the way <eob> we deliver them to the patient. <eob>
So after two pieces of bad news, <eob> I'm going to give you <eol> good news, hopefully. <eob>
With a collaborator at MIT <eob> and the Massachusetts <eol> General Hospital in Boston, <eob> we have revolutionized <eol> the way we treat cancer <eob> by making localized <eol> drug delivery a reality. <eob>
We are basically parachuting you <eol> on top of your destination, <eob> avoiding your having to drive <eol> all around the highway. <eob>
We have embedded the drug <eol> into devices that look like this one. <eob>
They are flexible enough <eol> that they can be folded <eob> to fit into the catheter, <eob> so the doctor can implant it <eol> directly on top of the tumor <eob> with minimally invasive surgery. <eob>
But they are solid enough <eol> that once they are positioned <eob> on top of the tumor, <eob> they will act as a cage. <eob>
They will actually <eol> physically prevent the tumor <eob> from entering other organs, <eob> controlling the metastasis. <eob>
The devices are also biodegradable. <eob>
That means that once in the body, <eob> they start dissolving, <eob> delivering the drug only locally, <eol> slowly and more effectively <eob> than what is done with the current <eol> whole-body treatment. <eob>
In pre-clinical study, <eol> we have demonstrated <eob> that this localized approach <eob> is able to improve by 12 times <eol> the response to treatment. <eob>
So we took a drug that is already known <eob> and by just delivering it locally <eol> where it's needed the most, <eob> we allow a response <eol> that is 12 times more powerful, <eob> reducing the systemic toxic effect. <eob>
We are working relentlessly to bring <eol> this technology to the next level. <eob> We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing <eob> and the animal model required <eol> prior to asking the FDA for approval <eob> for clinical trials. <eob>
Currently, the majority of patients <eol> will die from pancreatic cancer. <eob>
We are hoping that one day, <eob> we can reduce their pain, <eol> extend their life <eob> and potentially make pancreatic cancer <eob> a curable disease. <eob>
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug, <eob> we don't only make it <eol> more powerful and less toxic, <eob> we are also opening the door <eol> to finding new innovative solutions <eob> for almost all other impossible problems <eob> in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years <eob> before I realized that <eol> I really had a problem. <eob>
There was something really wrong with me. <eob>
This was about a year before 9 / 11, and America <eol> wasn't at war yet. <eob>
We weren't talking about PTSD. <eob>
We were not yet talking <eol> about the effect of trauma and war <eob> on the human psyche. <eob>
I'd been in Afghanistan <eol> for a couple of months <eob> with the Northern Alliance as they <eol> were fighting the Taliban. <eob>
And at that point the Taliban <eol> had an air force, <eob> they had fighter planes, <eol> they had tanks, they had artillery, <eob> and we really got hammered pretty badly <eol> a couple of times. <eob>
We saw some very ugly things. <eob>
But I didn't really think it affected me. <eob>
I didn't think much about it. <eob>
I came home to New York, where I live. <eob>
Then one day I went down into the subway, <eob> and for the first time in my life, <eob> I knew real fear. <eob>
I had a massive panic attack. <eob>
I was way more scared <eol> than I had ever been in Afghanistan. <eob>
Everything I was looking at seemed <eol> like it was going to kill me, <eob> but I couldn't explain why. <eob>
The trains were going too fast. <eob>
There were too many people. <eob>
The lights were too bright. <eob>
Everything was too loud, <eol> everything was moving too quickly. <eob>
I backed up against a support column <eol> and just waited for it. <eob>
When I couldn't take it any longer, <eol> I ran out of the subway station <eob> and walked wherever I was going. <eob>
Later, I found out that what I had <eol> was short-term PTSD: <eob> post-traumatic stress disorder. <eob>
We evolved as animals, as primates, <eol> to survive periods of danger, <eob> and if your life has been in danger, <eob> you want to react to unfamiliar noises. <eob>
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily. <eob>
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks <eob> of the thing that could kill you. <eob>
You want to be angry because it makes <eol> you predisposed to fight, <eob> or depressed, because it keeps you out <eol> of circulation a little bit. <eob> Keeps you safe. <eob> It's not very pleasant, <eol> but it's better than getting eaten. <eob>
Most people recover from <eol> that pretty quickly. <eob>
It takes a few weeks, a few months. <eob>
I kept having panic attacks, <eol> but they eventually went away. <eob>
I had no idea it was connected <eol> to the war that I'd seen. <eob>
I just thought I was going crazy, <eob> and then I thought, well, now <eol> I'm not going crazy anymore. <eob>
About 20 percent of people, however, <eob> wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD. <eob>
They are not adapted to temporary danger. <eob>
They are maladapted for everyday life, <eob> unless they get help. <eob>
We know that the people <eol> who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD <eob> are people who were abused <eol> as children, <eob> who suffered trauma as children, <eob> people who have low education levels, <eob> people who have psychiatric disorders in their family. <eob>
If you served in Vietnam <eob> and your brother is schizophrenic, <eob> you're way more likely to get <eol> long-term PTSD from Vietnam. <eob>
So I started to study this as a journalist, <eob> and I realized that there was something <eol> really strange going on. <eob>
The numbers seemed to be going <eol> in the wrong direction. <eob>
Every war that we have fought as a country, <eob> starting with the Civil War, <eob> the intensity of the combat <eol> has gone down. <eob>
As a result, the casualty rates <eol> have gone down. <eob>
But disability rates have gone up. <eob>
They should be going <eol> in the same direction, <eob> but they're going in different directions. <eob>
The recent wars in Iraq <eol> and Afghanistan have produced, thank God, <eob> a casualty rate about one third of what it <eol> was in Vietnam. <eob>
But they've also created -- <eob> they've also produced three times <eol> the disability rates. <eob>
Around 10 percent of the US military <eol> is actively engaged in combat, <eob> 10 percent or under. <eob>
They're shooting at people, killing people, <eob> getting shot at, seeing their friends get killed. <eob>
It's incredibly traumatic. <eob>
But it's only about 10 percent <eol> of our military. <eob>
But about half of our military <eol> has filed <eob> for some kind of PTSD compensation <eol> from the government. <eob>
And suicide doesn't even fit into <eol> this in a very logical way. <eob>
We've all heard the tragic statistic <eol> of 22 vets a day, on average, <eob> in this country, killing themselves. <eob>
Most people don't realize <eob> that the majority of those suicides <eol> are veterans of the Vietnam War, <eob> that generation, <eob> and their decision to take their own lives <eol> actually might not be related <eob> to the war they fought 50 years earlier. <eob>
In fact, there's no statistical <eol> connection between combat and suicide. <eob>
If you're in the military <eol> and you're in a lot of combat, <eob> you're no more likely to kill yourself <eol> than if you weren't. <eob>
In fact, one study found <eob> that if you deploy <eol> to Iraq or Afghanistan, <eob> you're actually slightly less likely <eol> to commit suicide later. <eob>
I studied anthropology in college. <eob>
I did my fieldwork <eol> on the Navajo reservation. <eob>
I wrote a thesis <eol> on Navajo long-distance runners. <eob>
And recently, while I was <eol> researching PTSD, <eob> I had this thought. <eob>
I thought back to the work <eol> I did when I was young, <eob> and I thought, I bet <eol> the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche -- <eob> I mean, these are very warlike nations -- <eob> I bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do. <eob>
When their warriors came back <eol> from fighting the US military <eob> or fighting each other, <eob> I bet they pretty much just slipped <eol> right back into tribal life. <eob>
And maybe what determines <eob> the rate of long-term PTSD <eob> isn't what happened out there, <eob> but the kind of society you come back to. <eob>
And maybe if you come back <eol> to a close, cohesive, tribal society, <eob> you can get over trauma pretty quickly. <eob>
And if you come back <eol> to an alienating, modern society, <eob> you might remain traumatized <eol> your entire life. <eob>
In other words, maybe the problem <eol> isn't them, the vets; <eob> maybe the problem is us. <eob>
Certainly, modern society is hard <eob> on the human psyche <eob> by every metric that we have. <eob>
As wealth goes up in a society, <eob> the suicide rate goes up instead of down. <eob>
If you live in modern society, <eob> you're up to eight times more likely <eob> to suffer from depression <eol> in your lifetime <eob> than if you live <eol> in a poor, agrarian society. <eob>
Modern society has probably produced <eol> the highest rates of suicide <eob> and depression and anxiety <eol> and loneliness and child abuse <eob> ever in human history. <eob>
I saw one study <eob> that compared women in Nigeria, <eob> one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt <eob> and poorest countries in Africa, <eob> to women in North America. <eob>
And the highest rates of depression <eol> were urban women in North America. <eob>
That was also the wealthiest group. <eob>
So let's go back to the US military. <eob> Ten percent are in combat. <eob>
Around 50 percent have filed <eol> for PTSD compensation. <eob>
So about 40 percent of veterans really <eol> were not traumatized overseas <eob> but have come home to discover <eol> they are dangerously alienated <eob> and depressed. <eob>
So what is happening with them? <eob>
What's going on with those people, <eob> the phantom 40 percent <eol> that are troubled but don't understand why? <eob>
Maybe it's this: <eob> maybe they had an experience <eol> of sort of tribal closeness <eob> in their unit when they were overseas. <eob>
They were eating together, sleeping together, <eob> doing tasks and missions together. <eob>
They were trusting each other <eol> with their lives. <eob>
And then they come home <eob> and they have to give all that up <eob> and they're coming back to a society, <eol> a modern society, <eob> which is hard on people <eol> who weren't even in the military. <eob>
It's just hard on everybody. <eob>
And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD. <eob>
But for a lot of these people, <eob> maybe it's not trauma. <eob>
I mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized <eob> and the ones who are have <eol> to be treated for that. <eob>
But a lot of them -- <eob> maybe what's bothering them <eol> is actually a kind of alienation. <eob>
I mean, maybe we just have the wrong <eol> word for some of it, <eob> and just changing our language, <eol> our understanding, <eob> would help a little bit. <eob> "Post-deployment alienation disorder." <eob> Maybe even just calling it that <eol> for some of these people <eob> would allow them to stop imagining <eob> trying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen <eob> in order to explain a feeling <eol> that really is happening. <eob>
And in fact, it's an extremely <eol> dangerous feeling. <eob> That alienation and depression <eol> can lead to suicide. <eob>
These people are in danger. <eob>
It's very important to understand why. <eob>
The Israeli military has a PTSD rate <eol> of around one percent. <eob>
The theory is that everyone in Israel <eol> is supposed to serve in the military. <eob>
When soldiers come back from the front line, <eob> they're not going from a military environment <eol> to a civilian environment. <eob>
They're coming back to a community <eol> where everyone understands <eob> about the military. <eob>
Everyone's been in it <eol> or is going to be in it. <eob>
Everyone understands the situation <eol> they're all in. <eob>
It's as if they're all in one big tribe. <eob>
We know that if you take a lab rat <eob> and traumatize it and put it <eol> in a cage by itself, <eob> you can maintain its trauma symptoms <eol> almost indefinitely. <eob>
And if you take that same lab rat <eol> and put it in a cage with other rats, <eob> after a couple of weeks, <eol> it's pretty much OK. <eob>
After 9 / 11, <eob> the murder rate in New York City <eol> went down by 40 percent. <eob>
The suicide rate went down. <eob>
The violent crime rate in New York <eol> went down after 9 / 11. <eob>
Even combat veterans of previous wars <eol> who suffered from PTSD <eob> said that their symptoms <eol> went down after 9 / 11 happened. <eob>
The reason is that if you traumatize <eol> an entire society, <eob> we don't fall apart <eol> and turn on one another. <eob> We come together. We unify. <eob> Basically, we tribalize, <eob> and that process of unifying <eol> feels so good and is so good for us, <eob> that it even helps people <eob> who are struggling <eol> with mental health issues. <eob>
During the blitz in London, <eob> admissions to psychiatric wards <eol> went down during the bombings. <eob>
For a while, that was the kind of country <eob> that American soldiers came back <eol> to -- a unified country. <eob>
We were sticking together. <eob>
We were trying to understand <eol> the threat against us. <eob>
We were trying to help ourselves <eol> and the world. <eob>
But that's changed. <eob>
Now, American soldiers, <eob> American veterans are coming back <eol> to a country that is so bitterly divided <eob> that the two political parties <eol> are literally accusing each other <eob> of treason, of being <eol> an enemy of the state, <eob> of trying to undermine the security <eol> and the welfare of their own country. <eob>
The gap between rich and poor <eol> is the biggest it's ever been. <eob> It's just getting worse. <eob> Race relations are terrible. <eob>
There are demonstrations <eol> and even riots in the streets <eob> because of racial injustice. <eob>
And veterans know that any tribe <eol> that treated itself that way -- in fact, <eob> any platoon that treated itself <eol> that way -- would never survive. <eob>
We've gotten used to it. <eob>
Veterans have gone away and are coming back <eob> and seeing their own country <eol> with fresh eyes. <eob>
And they see what's going on. <eob>
This is the country they fought for. <eob>
No wonder they're depressed. <eob>
No wonder they're scared. <eob>
Sometimes, we ask ourselves <eol> if we can save the vets. <eob>
I think the real question <eol> is if we can save ourselves. <eob>
If we can, <eob> I think the vets are going to be fine. <eob>
It's time for this country to unite, <eob> if only to help the men and women <eol> who fought to protect us. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to talk about sex for money. <eob>
I'm not like most of the people <eol> you'll have heard speaking <eob> about prostitution before. <eob>
I'm not a police officer <eol> or a social worker. <eob>
I'm not an academic, <eol> a journalist or a politician. <eob>
And as you'll probably have <eol> picked up from Maryam's blurb, <eob> I'm not a nun, either. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Most of those people would tell you <eol> that selling sex is degrading; <eob> that no one would ever choose to do it; <eob> that it's dangerous; <eol> women get abused and killed. <eob>
In fact, most of those people would say, <eob> "There should be a law against it!" <eob> Maybe that sounds reasonable to you. <eob>
It sounded reasonable to me <eol> until the closing months of 2009, <eob> when I was working two dead-end, <eol> minimum-wage jobs. <eob>
Every month my wages would just <eol> replenish my overdraft. <eob>
I was exhausted and my life <eol> was going nowhere. <eob>
Like many others before me, <eob> I decided sex for money <eol> was a better option. <eob>
Now don't get me wrong -- <eob> I would have loved <eol> to have won the lottery instead. <eob>
But it wasn't going <eol> to happen anytime soon, <eob> and my rent needed paying. <eob>
So I signed up for my first <eol> shift in a brothel. <eob>
In the years that have passed, <eob> I've had a lot of time to think. <eob>
I've reconsidered the ideas <eol> I once had about prostitution. <eob>
I've given a lot of thought to consent <eob> and the nature of work under capitalism. <eob>
I've thought about gender inequality <eob> and the sexual and reproductive <eol> labor of women. <eob>
I've experienced exploitation <eol> and violence at work. <eob>
I've thought about what's needed <eob> to protect other sex workers <eol> from these things. <eob>
Maybe you've thought about them, too. <eob>
In this talk, <eob> I'll take you through <eol> the four main legal approaches <eob> applied to sex work throughout the world, <eob> and explain why they don't work; <eob> why prohibiting the sex industry <eol> actually exacerbates every harm <eob> that sex workers are vulnerable to. <eob>
Then I'm going tell you about what we, <eol> as sex workers, actually want. <eob>
The first approach <eol> is full criminalization. <eob>
Half the world, <eob> including Russia, South Africa <eol> and most of the US, <eob> regulates sex work by criminalizing <eol> everyone involved. <eob>
So that's seller, buyer and third parties. <eob>
Lawmakers in these countries <eol> apparently hope <eob> that the fear of getting arrested <eol> will deter people from selling sex. <eob>
But if you're forced to choose <eol> between obeying the law <eob> and feeding yourself or your family, <eob> you're going to do the work anyway, <eob> and take the risk. <eob>
Criminalization is a trap. <eob> It's hard to get a conventional job <eol> when you have a criminal record. <eob>
Potential employers won't hire you. <eob>
Assuming you still need money, <eob> you'll stay in the more flexible, <eol> informal economy. <eob>
The law forces you to keep selling sex, <eob> which is the exact opposite <eol> of its intended effect. <eob>
Being criminalized leaves you exposed <eol> to mistreatment by the state itself. <eob>
In many places you may be coerced <eol> into paying a bribe <eob> or even into having sex <eol> with a police officer <eob> to avoid arrest. <eob>
Police and prison guards <eol> in Cambodia, for example, <eob> have been documented <eol> subjecting sex workers <eob> to what can only be described as torture: <eob> threats at gunpoint, <eob> beatings, electric shocks, rape <eob> and denial of food. <eob>
Another worrying thing: <eob> if you're selling sex in places <eol> like Kenya, South Africa or New York, <eob> a police officer can arrest you <eol> if you're caught carrying condoms, <eob> because condoms can legally be used <eol> as evidence that you're selling sex. <eob>
Obviously, this increases HIV risk. <eob>
Imagine knowing if you're busted <eol> carrying condoms, <eob> it'll be used against you. <eob>
It's a pretty strong incentive <eol> to leave them at home, right? <eob>
Sex workers working in these places <eol> are forced to make a tough choice <eob> between risking arrest <eol> or having risky sex. <eob> What would you choose? <eob> Would you pack condoms to go to work? <eob>
How about if you're worried <eob> the police officer would rape you <eol> when he got you in the van? <eob>
The second approach to regulating <eol> sex work seen in these countries <eob> is partial criminalization, <eob> where the buying and selling <eol> of sex are legal, <eob> but surrounding activities, <eob> like brothel-keeping or soliciting <eol> on the street, are banned. <eob>
Laws like these -- <eob> we have them in the UK and in France -- <eob> essentially say to us sex workers, <eob> "Hey, we don't mind you selling sex, <eob> just make sure it's done <eol> behind closed doors <eob> and all alone." <eob> And brothel-keeping, by the way, <eob> is defined as just two or more <eol> sex workers working together. <eob>
Making that illegal means <eol> that many of us work alone, <eob> which obviously makes us <eol> vulnerable to violent offenders. <eob>
But we're also vulnerable <eob> if we choose to break the law <eol> by working together. <eob>
A couple of years ago, <eob> a friend of mine was nervous <eol> after she was attacked at work, <eob> so I said that she could see her clients <eol> from my place for a while. <eob>
During that time, <eob> we had another guy turn nasty. <eob>
I told the guy to leave <eol> or I'd call the police. <eob>
And he looked at the two of us and said, <eob> "You girls can't call the cops. <eob>
You're working together, <eol> this place is illegal." <eob> He was right. <eob>
He eventually left <eol> without getting physically violent, <eob> but the knowledge <eol> that we were breaking the law <eob> empowered that man to threaten us. <eob>
He felt confident he'd get away with it. <eob>
The prohibition of street prostitution <eol> also causes more harm <eob> than it prevents. <eob>
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested, <eob> street workers take risks <eol> to avoid detection, <eob> and that means working alone <eob> or in isolated locations <eol> like dark forests <eob> where they're vulnerable to attack. <eob>
If you're caught selling sex outdoors, <eob> you pay a fine. <eob>
How do you pay that fine <eol> without going back to the streets? <eob>
It was the need for money <eol> that saw you in the streets <eob> in the first place. <eob>
And so the fines stack up, <eob> and you're caught in a vicious cycle <eob> of selling sex to pay the fines you <eol> got for selling sex. <eob>
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa <eol> who worked in Redbridge, East London. <eob>
The street workers on her patch <eol> would normally wait for clients in groups <eob> for safety in numbers <eob> and to warn each other about how <eol> to avoid dangerous guys. <eob>
But during a police crackdown <eol> on sex workers and their clients, <eob> she was forced to work alone <eol> to avoid being arrested. <eob>
She was stabbed to death <eol> in the early hours of October 29, 2013. <eob>
She had been working later than usual <eob> to try to pay off a fine <eol> she had received for soliciting. <eob>
So if criminalizing <eol> sex workers hurts them, <eob> why not just criminalize <eol> the people who buy sex? <eob>
This is the aim of the third approach <eob> I want to talk about -- <eob> the Swedish or Nordic <eol> model of sex-work law. <eob>
The idea behind this law <eob> is that selling sex <eol> is intrinsically harmful <eob> and so you're, in fact, helping <eol> sex workers by removing the option. <eob>
Despite growing support <eob> for what's often described <eol> as the "end demand" approach, <eob> there's no evidence that it works. <eob>
There's just as much prostitution <eol> in Sweden as there was before. <eob> Why might that be? <eob> It's because people selling sex <eob> often don't have other options for income. <eob>
If you need that money, <eob> the only effect that a drop <eol> in business is going have <eob> is to force you to lower your prices <eob> or offer more risky sexual services. <eob>
If you need to find more clients, <eob> you might seek the help of a manager. <eob>
So you see, rather than putting a stop <eob> to what's often descried as pimping, <eob> a law like this actually gives oxygen <eob> to potentially abusive third parties. <eob>
To keep safe in my work, <eob> I try not to take bookings from someone <eob> who calls me from a withheld number. <eob>
If it's a home or a hotel visit, <eob> I try to get a full name and details. <eob>
If I worked under the Swedish model, <eob> a client would be too scared <eol> to give me that information. <eob>
I might have no other choice <eob> but to accept a booking <eol> from a man who is untraceable <eob> if he later turns out to be violent. <eob>
If you need their money, <eob> you need to protect <eol> your clients from the police. <eob>
If you work outdoors, <eob> that means working alone <eol> or in isolated locations, <eob> just as if you were criminalized yourself. <eob>
It might mean getting into cars quicker, <eob> less negotiating time <eol> means snap decisions. <eob>
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous? <eob>
Can you afford to take the risk? <eob>
Can you afford not to? <eob>
Something I'm often hearing is, <eob> "Prostitution would be fine <eob> if we made it legal and regulated it." <eob> We call that approach legalization, <eob> and it's used by countries <eol> like the Netherlands, Germany <eob> and Nevada in the US. <eob>
But it's not a great <eol> model for human rights. <eob>
And in state-controlled prostitution, <eob> commercial sex can only happen <eob> in certain legally-designated <eol> areas or venues, <eob> and sex workers are made to comply <eol> with special restrictions, <eob> like registration <eol> and forced health checks. <eob>
Regulation sounds great on paper, <eob> but politicians deliberately make <eol> regulation around the sex industry <eob> expensive and difficult to comply with. <eob>
It creates a two-tiered system: <eol> legal and illegal work. <eob>
We sometimes call it <eol> "backdoor criminalization." <eob> Rich, well-connected brothel owners <eol> can comply with the regulations, <eob> but more marginalized people <eol> find those hoops <eob> impossible to jump through. <eob>
And even if it's possible in principle, <eob> getting a license or proper venue <eol> takes time and costs money. <eob>
It's not going to be an option <eob> for someone who's desperate <eol> and needs money tonight. <eob>
They might be a refugee <eol> or fleeing domestic abuse. <eob>
In this two-tiered system, <eob> the most vulnerable people <eol> are forced to work illegally, <eob> so they're still exposed to all <eol> the dangers of criminalization <eob> I mentioned earlier. <eob>
So. <eob> It's looking like all attempts to control <eob> or prevent sex work from happening <eob> makes things more dangerous <eol> for people selling sex. <eob>
Fear of law enforcement makes them <eol> work alone in isolated locations, <eob> and allows clients and even cops <eob> to get abusive in the knowledge <eol> they'll get away with it. <eob>
Fines and criminal records force <eol> people to keep selling sex, <eob> rather than enabling them to stop. <eob>
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers <eol> to take dangerous risks <eob> and into the arms <eol> of potentially abusive managers. <eob>
These laws also reinforce stigma <eol> and hatred against sex workers. <eob>
When France temporarily brought in <eol> the Swedish model two years ago, <eob> ordinary citizens took it as a cue <eob> to start carrying out vigilante attacks <eob> against people working on the street. <eob>
In Sweden, opinion surveys show <eob> that significantly more people want <eol> sex workers to be arrested now <eob> than before the law was brought in. <eob>
If prohibition is this harmful, <eob> you might ask, why it so popular? <eob>
Firstly, sex work is and always <eol> has been a survival strategy <eob> for all kinds of unpopular <eol> minority groups: <eob> people of color, <eob> migrants, <eob> people with disabilities, <eob> LGBTQ people, <eob> particularly trans women. <eob>
These are the groups most heavily profiled <eob> and punished through prohibitionist law. <eob>
I don't think this is an accident. <eob>
These laws have political support <eob> precisely because they target people <eob> that voters don't want <eol> to see or know about. <eob>
Why else might people support prohibition? <eob>
Well, lots of people have <eol> understandable fears about trafficking. <eob>
Folks think that foreign women <eol> kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery <eob> can be saved by shutting <eol> a whole industry down. <eob> So let's talk about trafficking. <eob> Forced labor does occur <eol> in many industries, <eob> especially those where the workers <eol> are migrants or otherwise vulnerable, <eob> and this needs to be addressed. <eob>
But it's best addressed with legislation <eol> targeting those specific abuses, <eob> not an entire industry. <eob>
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants <eob> drowned while picking cockles <eol> in Morecambe Bay in 2004, <eob> there were no calls to outlaw <eol> the entire seafood industry <eob> to save trafficking victims. <eob>
The solution is clearly to give <eol> workers more legal protections, <eob> allowing them to resist abuse <eob> and report it to authorities <eol> without fear of arrest. <eob>
The way the term trafficking <eol> is thrown around <eob> implies that all undocumented <eol> migration into prostitution is forced. <eob>
In fact, many migrants <eol> have made a decision, <eob> out of economic need, <eob> to place themselves into the hands <eol> of people smugglers. <eob>
Many do this with the full knowledge <eob> that they'll be selling sex <eol> when they reach their destination. <eob>
And yes, it can often be the case <eob> that these people smugglers <eol> demand exorbitant fees, <eob> coerce migrants into work <eol> they don't want to do <eob> and abuse them when they're vulnerable. <eob>
That's true of prostitution, <eob> but it's also true of agricultural work, <eob> hospitality work and domestic work. <eob>
Ultimately, nobody wants <eol> to be forced to do any kind of work, <eob> but that's a risk many migrants <eol> are willing to take, <eob> because of what they're leaving behind. <eob>
If people were allowed to migrate legally <eob> they wouldn't have to place their lives <eol> into the hands of people smugglers. <eob>
The problems arise <eob> from the criminalization of migration, <eob> just as they do from the criminalization <eob> of sex work itself. <eob>
This is a lesson of history. <eob>
If you try to prohibit something <eol> that people want or need to do, <eob> whether that's drinking alcohol <eol> or crossing borders <eob> or getting an abortion <eob> or selling sex, <eob> you create more problems than you solve. <eob>
Prohibition barely makes a difference <eob> to the amount of people <eol> actually doing those things. <eob>
But it makes a huge difference <eob> as to whether or not <eol> they're safe when they do them. <eob>
Why else might people support prohibition? <eob>
As a feminist, I know <eol> that the sex industry is a site <eob> of deeply entrenched social inequality. <eob>
It's a fact that most buyers of sex <eol> are men with money, <eob> and most sellers are women without. <eob>
You can agree with all that -- I do -- <eob> and still think prohibition <eol> is a terrible policy. <eob>
In a better, more equal world, <eob> maybe there would be far fewer <eol> people selling sex to survive, <eob> but you can't simply legislate <eol> a better world into existence. <eob>
If someone needs to sell sex <eol> because they're poor <eob> or because they're homeless <eob> or because they're undocumented <eol> and they can't find legal work, <eob> taking away that option <eol> doesn't make them any less poor <eob> or house them <eob> or change their immigration status. <eob>
People worry that selling <eol> sex is degrading. <eob>
Ask yourself: is it more degrading <eol> than going hungry <eob> or seeing your children go hungry? <eob>
There's no call to ban rich people <eol> from hiring nannies <eob> or getting manicures, <eob> even though most of the people <eol> doing that labor are poor, migrant women. <eob>
It's the fact of poor migrant women <eol> selling sex specifically <eob> that has some feminists uncomfortable. <eob>
And I can understand <eob> why the sex industry provokes <eol> strong feelings. <eob>
People have all kinds <eol> of complicated feelings <eob> when it comes to sex. <eob>
But we can't make policy <eol> on the basis of mere feelings, <eob> especially not over <eol> the heads of the people <eob> actually effected by those policies. <eob>
If we get fixated on <eol> the abolition of sex work, <eob> we end up worrying more <eol> about a particular manifestation <eob> of gender inequality, <eob> rather than about the underlying causes. <eob>
People get really hung up on the question, <eob> "Well, would you want <eol> your daughter doing it?" <eob> That's the wrong question. <eob>
Instead, imagine she is doing it. <eob>
How safe is she at work tonight? <eob>
Why isn't she safer? <eob>
So we've looked at full criminalization, <eob> partial criminalization, <eol> the Swedish or Nordic Model <eob> and legalization, <eob> and how they all cause harm. <eob>
Something I never hear asked is: <eob> "What do sex workers want?" <eob> After all, we're the ones <eol> most affected by these laws. <eob>
New Zealand decriminalized <eol> sex work in 2003. <eob>
It's crucial to remember <eob> that decriminalization and legalization <eol> are not the same thing. <eob>
Decriminalization means <eol> the removal of laws <eob> that punitively target the sex industry, <eob> instead treating sex work <eol> much like any other kind of work. <eob>
In New Zealand, people <eol> can work together for safety, <eob> and employers of sex workers <eol> are accountable to the state. <eob>
A sex worker can refuse <eol> to see a client at any time, <eob> for any reason, <eob> and 96 percent of street workers <eob> report that they feel the law <eol> protects their rights. <eob>
New Zealand hasn't actually <eol> seen an increase <eob> in the amount of people doing sex work, <eob> but decriminalizing it <eol> has made it a lot safer. <eob>
But the lesson from New Zealand <eob> isn't just that its particular <eol> legislation is good, <eob> but that crucially, <eob> it was written in collaboration <eol> with sex workers; <eob> namely, the New Zealand <eol> Prostitutes' Collective. <eob>
When it came to making sex work safer, <eob> they were ready to hear it straight <eol> from sex workers themselves. <eob>
Here in the UK, <eob> I'm part of sex worker-led groups <eol> like the Sex Worker Open University <eob> and the English Collective of Prostitutes. <eob>
And we form part of a global movement <eob> demanding decriminalization <eol> and self-determination. <eob>
The universal symbol of our movement <eol> is the red umbrella. <eob>
We're supported in our demands <eol> by global bodies like UNAIDS, <eob> the World Health Organization <eob> and Amnesty International. <eob>
But we need more allies. <eob>
If you care about gender equality <eob> or poverty or migration or public health, <eob> then sex worker rights matter to you. <eob>
Make space for us in your movements. <eob>
That means not only listening <eol> to sex workers when we speak <eob> but amplifying our voices. <eob>
Resist those who silence us, <eob> those who say that a prostitute <eol> is either too victimized, <eob> too damaged to know <eol> what's best for herself, <eob> or else too privileged <eob> and too removed from real hardship, <eob> not representative of the millions <eol> of voiceless victims. <eob>
This distinction between victim <eol> and empowered is imaginary. <eob>
It exists purely to discredit sex workers <eob> and make it easy to ignore us. <eob>
No doubt many of you work for a living. <eob>
Well, sex work is work, too. <eob>
Just like you, <eob> some of us like our jobs, <eob> some of us hate them. <eob>
Ultimately, most of us <eol> have mixed feelings. <eob>
But how we feel about our work <eob> isn't the point. <eob>
And how others feel <eol> about our work certainly isn't. <eob>
What's important is that we have <eol> the right to work safely <eob> and on our own terms. <eob>
Sex workers are real people. <eob>
We've had complicated experiences <eob> and complicated responses <eol> to those experiences. <eob>
But our demands are not complicated. <eob>
You can ask expensive <eol> escorts in New York City, <eob> brothel workers in Cambodia, <eol> street workers in South Africa <eob> and every girl on the roster <eol> at my old job in Soho, <eob> and they will all tell you the same thing. <eob>
You can speak to millions of sex workers <eob> and countless sex work-led organizations. <eob>
We want full decriminalization <eol> and labor rights as workers. <eob>
I'm just one sex worker <eol> on the stage today, <eob> but I'm bringing a message <eol> from all over the world. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So this is James Risen. <eob> You may know him as the Pulitzer <eol> Prize-winning reporter <eob> for The New York Times. <eob>
Long before anybody knew Edward <eol> Snowden's name, <eob> Risen wrote a book in which <eol> he famously exposed <eob> that the NSA was illegally wiretapping <eol> the phone calls of Americans. <eob>
But it's another chapter in that book <eob> that may have an even more lasting impact. <eob>
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation <eob> in which the CIA quite literally <eol> handed over blueprints <eob> of a nuclear bomb to Iran. <eob>
If that sounds crazy, go read it. <eob>
It's an incredible story. <eob>
But you know who didn't like that chapter? <eob> The US government. <eob> For nearly a decade afterwards, <eob> Risen was the subject of a US government <eol> investigation <eob> in which prosecutors demanded that he testify <eob> against one of his alleged sources. <eob>
And along the way, he became the face <eol> for the US government's recent pattern <eob> of prosecuting whistleblowers <eol> and spying on journalists. <eob>
You see, under the First Amendment, <eob> the press has the right to publish <eol> secret information in the public interest. <eob>
But it's impossible to exercise <eol> that right if the media can't also gather that news <eob> and protect the identities <eol> of the brave men and women <eob> who get it to them. <eob>
So when the government came knocking, <eob> Risen did what many brave <eol> reporters have done before him: <eob> he refused <eob> and said he'd rather go to jail. <eob>
So from 2007 to 2015, <eob> Risen lived under the specter <eol> of going to federal prison. <eob>
That is, until just days before the trial, <eol> when a curious thing happened. <eob>
Suddenly, after years of claiming <eol> it was vital to their case, <eob> the government dropped <eol> their demands to Risen altogether. <eob>
It turns out, in the age <eol> of electronic surveillance, <eob> there are very few places reporters <eol> and sources can hide. <eob>
And instead of trying and failing <eol> to have Risen testify, <eob> they could have his digital trail testify against him instead. <eob>
So completely in secret and without his consent, <eob> prosecutors got Risen's phone records. <eob>
They got his email records, <eol> his financial and banking information, <eob> his credit reports, <eob> even travel records with a list <eol> of flights he had taken. <eob>
And it was among this information <eol> that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, <eob> Risen's alleged source <eol> and CIA whistleblower. <eob>
Sadly, this is only one case of many. <eob>
President Obama ran on a promise <eol> to protect whistleblowers, <eob> and instead, his Justice Department <eol> has prosecuted more <eob> than all other administrations combined. <eob>
Now, you can see <eol> how this could be a problem, <eob> especially because the government <eol> considers so much of what it does secret. <eob>
Since 9 / 11, virtually every important <eol> story about national security <eob> has been the result <eol> of a whistleblower coming to a journalist. <eob>
So we risk seeing the press <eol> unable to do their job <eob> that the First Amendment <eol> is supposed to protect <eob> because of the government's expanded ability <eol> to spy on everyone. <eob>
But just as technology <eol> has allowed the government <eob> to circumvent reporters' rights, <eob> the press can also use technology <eob> to protect their sources <eol> even better than before. <eob>
And they can start from the moment <eol> they begin speaking with them, <eob> rather than on the witness <eol> stand after the fact. <eob>
Communications software now exists <eob> that wasn't available when Risen <eol> was writing his book, <eob> and is much more surveillance-resistant <eol> than regular emails or phone calls. <eob>
For example, one such tool <eol> is SecureDrop, <eob> an open-source whistleblower submission system <eob> that was originally created <eol> by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, <eob> and is now developed <eol> at the non-profit where I work, <eob> Freedom of the Press Foundation. <eob>
Instead of sending an email, <eob> you go to a news organization's website, <eob> like this one here on The Washington Post. <eob>
From there, you can upload <eol> a document or send information <eob> much like you would on <eol> any other contact form. <eob>
It'll then be encrypted <eol> and stored on a server <eob> that only the news organization <eol> has access to. <eob>
So the government can no longer <eol> secretly demand the information, <eob> and much of the information they would demand <eob> wouldn't be available <eol> in the first place. <eob>
SecureDrop, though, is really <eol> only a small part of the puzzle <eob> for protecting press freedom <eol> in the 21st century. <eob>
Unfortunately, governments all over the world <eob> are constantly developing <eol> new spying techniques <eob> that put us all at risk. <eob>
And it's up to us going forward <eol> to make sure <eob> that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, <eob> like Edward Snowden, <eol> who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing. <eob>
It's just as vital that we protect <eol> the next veteran's health care whistleblower <eob> alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, <eob> or the next environmental worker <eob> sounding the alarm <eol> about Flint's dirty water, <eob> or a Wall Street insider <eob> warning us of the next financial crisis. <eob>
After all, these tools weren't <eol> just built to help the brave men and women <eob> who expose crimes, <eob> but are meant to protect all of our rights <eol> under the Constitution. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I know TED is about a lot <eol> of things that are big, <eob> but I want to talk to you <eol> about something very small. <eob>
So small, it's a single word. <eob>
The word is "misfit." <eob> It's one of my favorite words, <eol> because it's so literal. <eob>
I mean, it's a person <eol> who sort of missed fitting in. <eob>
Or a person who fits in badly. <eob> Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted <eob> to new situations and environments." <eob> I'm a card-carrying misfit. <eob>
And I'm here for the other <eol> misfits in the room, <eob> because I'm never the only one. <eob>
I'm going to tell you a misfit story. <eob>
Somewhere in my early 30s, <eob> the dream of becoming a writer <eol> came right to my doorstep. <eob>
Actually, it came to my mailbox <eob> in the form of a letter <eol> that said I'd won a giant literary prize <eob> for a short story I had written. <eob>
The short story was about my life <eol> as a competitive swimmer <eob> and about my crappy home life, <eob> and a little bit about how grief <eol> and loss can make you insane. <eob>
The prize was a trip to New York City <eol> to meet big-time editors and agents <eob> and other authors. <eob>
So kind of it was the wannabe <eol> writer's dream, right? <eob>
You know what I did the day <eol> the letter came to my house? <eob>
Because I'm me, <eob> I put the letter <eol> on my kitchen table, <eob> I poured myself a giant glass of vodka <eob> with ice and lime, <eob> and I sat there in my underwear <eol> for an entire day, <eob> just staring at the letter. <eob>
I was thinking about all the ways <eol> I'd already screwed my life up. <eob>
Who the hell was I to go to New York City <eob> and pretend to be a writer? <eob> Who was I? <eob>
I'll tell you. <eob> I was a misfit. <eob>
Like legions of other children, <eob> I came from an abusive household <eob> that I narrowly escaped with my life. <eob>
I already had two epically failed marriages <eol> underneath my belt. <eob>
I'd flunked out of college <eol> not once but twice <eob> and maybe even a third time <eol> that I'm not going to tell you about. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I'd done an episode <eol> of rehab for drug use. <eob>
And I'd had two lovely <eol> staycations in jail. <eob> So I'm on the right stage. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the real reason, I think, <eob> I was a misfit, <eob> is that my daughter died <eol> the day she was born, <eob> and I hadn't figured out <eol> how to live with that story yet. <eob>
After my daughter died <eol> I also spent a long time homeless, <eob> living under an overpass <eob> in a kind of profound state <eol> of zombie grief and loss <eob> that some of us encounter along the way. <eob>
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough. <eob>
You know, homeless people are some <eol> of our most heroic misfits, <eob> because they start out as us. <eob>
So you see, I'd missed fitting in <eol> to just about every category out there: <eob> daughter, wife, mother, scholar. <eob>
And the dream of being a writer <eob> was really kind of like a small, <eol> sad stone in my throat. <eob>
It was pretty much in spite of myself <eol> that I got on that plane <eob> and flew to New York City, <eob> where the writers are. <eob>
Fellow misfits, I can almost see <eol> your heads glowing. <eob>
I can pick you out of a room. <eob>
At first, you would've loved it. <eob>
You got to choose the three famous writers <eol> you wanted to meet, <eob> and these guys went and found them for you. <eob>
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel, <eob> where you got to drink Scotch late in the night <eob> with cool, smart, swank people. <eob>
And you got to pretend you were cool <eol> and smart and swank, too. <eob>
And you got to meet a bunch <eol> of editors and authors and agents <eob> at very, very fancy lunches <eol> and dinners. <eob> Ask me how fancy. <eob>
Audience: How fancy? <eob>
Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: <eol> I stole three linen napkins -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
from three different restaurants. <eob> And I shoved a menu down my pants. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I just wanted some keepsakes so <eol> that when I got home, <eob> I could believe it had really happened to me. <eob> You know? <eob>
The three writers I wanted to meet <eob> were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman <eol> and Peggy Phelan. <eob>
These were not famous, <eol> best-selling authors, <eob> but to me, they were women-writer titans. <eob>
Carole Maso wrote the book that later <eol> became my art bible. <eob>
Lynne Tillman gave me permission to believe <eob> that there was a chance my stories <eol> could be part of the world. <eob>
And Peggy Phelan reminded me <eob> that maybe my brains <eol> could be more important than my boobs. <eob>
They weren't mainstream women writers, <eob> but they were cutting a path <eol> through the mainstream <eob> with their body stories, <eob> I like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon. <eob>
It nearly killed me with joy <eob> to hang out with these three <eol> over-50-year-old women writers. <eob>
And the reason it nearly <eol> killed me with joy <eob> is that I'd never known a joy like that. <eob>
I'd never been in a room like that. <eob>
My mother never went to college. <eob>
And my creative career to that point <eob> was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing. <eob>
So kind of in those first nights <eol> in New York I wanted to die there. <eob>
I was just like, "Kill me now. <eol> I'm good. This is beautiful." <eob> Some of you in the room <eol> will understand what happened next. <eob>
First, they took me to the offices of Farrar, <eol> Straus and Giroux. <eob>
Farrar, Straus and Giroux was like <eol> my mega-dream press. <eob>
I mean, T.S. Eliot <eol> and Flannery O'Connor were published there. <eob>
The main editor guy sat me down <eol> and talked to me for a long time, <eob> trying to convince me <eol> I had a book in me <eob> about my life as a swimmer. <eob>
You know, <eob> like a memoir. <eob>
The whole time he was talking to me, <eob> I sat there smiling and nodding <eol> like a numb idiot, <eob> with my arms crossed over my chest, <eob> while nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat. <eob>
So in the end, he patted me on the shoulder <eob> like a swim coach might. <eob>
And he wished me luck <eob> and he gave me some free books <eob> and he showed me out the door. <eob>
Next, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton, <eob> where I was pretty sure <eol> I'd be escorted from the building <eob> just for wearing Doc Martens. <eob>
But that didn't happen. <eob> Being at the Norton offices <eob> felt like reaching up into the night <eol> sky and touching the moon <eob> while the stars stitched your name <eol> across the cosmos. <eob>
I mean, that's how big a deal <eol> it was to me. <eob> You get it? <eob> Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith, <eob> leaned over right in my face <eol> with these beady, bright, fierce eyes <eob> and said, "Well, send me something <eol> then, immediately!" <eob> See, now most people, especially TED people, <eob> would have run to the mailbox, right? <eob>
It took me over a decade to even imagine <eob> putting something in an envelope <eol> and licking a stamp. <eob>
On the last night, <eob> I gave a big reading <eol> at the National Poetry Club. <eob>
And at the end of the reading, <eob> Katharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & amp; Picard Literary Agency, <eob> walked straight up to me and shook my hand <eob> and offered me representation, like, on the spot. <eob>
I stood there and I kind of went deaf. <eob>
Has this ever happened to you? <eob>
And I almost started crying <eob> because all the people in the room <eol> were dressed so beautifully, <eob> and all that came out of my mouth was: <eob> "I don't know. <eob>
I have to think about it. <eob> "And she said," OK, then, "and walked away. <eob>
All those open hands out to me, that small, <eol> sad stone in my throat ... <eob>
You see, I'm trying to tell you <eol> something about people like me. <eob> Misfit people -- we don't always know <eol> how to hope or say yes <eob> or choose the big thing, <eob> even when it's right in front of us. <eob>
It's a shame we carry. <eob>
It's the shame of wanting something good. <eob> It's the shame of feeling something good. <eob>
It's the shame of not really believing <eol> we deserve to be in the room <eob> with the people we admire. <eob>
If I could, I'd go back <eol> and I'd coach myself. <eob>
I'd be exactly like those <eol> over-50-year-old women who helped me. <eob>
I'd teach myself how to want things, <eob> how to stand up, how to ask for them. <eob>
I'd say, "You! Yeah, you! <eol> You belong in the room, too." <eob> The radiance falls on all of us, <eob> and we are nothing without each other. <eob>
Instead, I flew back to Oregon, <eob> and as I watched the evergreens <eol> and rain come back into view, <eob> I just drank many tiny bottles <eol> of airplane "feel sorry for yourself." <eob> I thought about how, if I was a writer, <eol> I was some kind of misfit writer. <eob>
What I'm saying is, <eob> I flew back to Oregon <eol> without a book deal, <eob> without an agent, <eob> and with only a headful <eol> and heart-ful of memories <eob> of having sat so near <eob> the beautiful writers. <eob>
Memory was the only prize <eol> I allowed myself. <eob>
And yet, at home in the dark, <eob> back in my underwear, <eob> I could still hear their voices. <eob>
They said, "Don't listen to anyone <eol> who tries to get you to shut up <eob> or change your story." <eob> They said, "Give voice to the story <eol> only you know how to tell." <eob> They said, "Sometimes <eol> telling the story <eob> is the thing that saves your life." <eob>
Now I am, as you can see, <eol> the woman over 50. <eob> And I'm a writer. <eob> And I'm a mother. <eob>
And I became a teacher. <eob>
Guess who my favorite students are. <eob>
Although it didn't happen the day <eob> that dream letter <eol> came through my mailbox, <eob> I did write a memoir, <eob> called "The Chronology of Water." <eob> In it are the stories of how many times <eol> I've had to reinvent a self <eob> from the ruins of my choices, <eob> the stories of how my seeming failures <eol> were really just weird-ass portals <eob> to something beautiful. <eob>
All I had to do was give voice to the story. <eob>
There's a myth in most cultures <eol> about following your dreams. <eob>
It's called the hero's journey. <eob>
But I prefer a different myth, <eob> that's slightly to the side of that <eob> or underneath it. <eob>
It's called the misfit's myth. <eob>
And it goes like this: <eob> even at the moment of your failure, <eob> right then, you are beautiful. <eob>
You don't know it yet, <eob> but you have the ability <eol> to reinvent yourself <eob> endlessly. <eob>
That's your beauty. <eob>
You can be a drunk, <eob> you can be a survivor <eol> of abuse, <eob> you can be an ex-con, <eob> you can be a homeless person, <eob> you can lose all your money <eol> or your job or your husband <eob> or your wife, <eol> or the worst thing of all, <eob> a child. <eob> You can even lose your marbles. <eob> You can be standing dead center in the middle <eol> of your failure <eob> and still, I'm only here to tell you, <eob> you are so beautiful. <eob>
Your story deserves to be heard, <eob> because you, you rare <eol> and phenomenal misfit, <eob> you new species, <eob> are the only one in the room <eob> who can tell the story <eob> the way only you would. <eob>
And I'd be listening. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
We have historical records that allow us <eol> to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, <eob> how they lived, <eob> how they fought ... <eob> but how did they think? <eob>
One natural idea is <eol> that the deepest aspects of human thought -- <eob> our ability to imagine, <eob> to be conscious, <eob> to dream -- <eob> have always been the same. <eob>
Another possibility <eob> is that the social transformations <eol> that have shaped our culture <eob> may have also changed <eol> the structural columns of human thought. <eob>
We may all have different opinions about this. <eob>
Actually, it's a long-standing <eol> philosophical debate. <eob>
But is this question <eol> even amenable to science? <eob>
Here I'd like to propose <eob> that in the same way we can reconstruct <eol> how the ancient Greek cities looked <eob> just based on a few bricks, <eob> that the writings of a culture <eol> are the archaeological records, <eob> the fossils, of human thought. <eob>
And in fact, <eob> doing some form of psychological analysis <eob> of some of the most ancient books <eol> of human culture, <eob> Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild <eol> and radical hypothesis: <eob> that only 3,000 years ago, <eob> humans were what today we would call schizophrenics. <eob>
And he made this claim <eob> based on the fact that the first humans <eol> described in these books <eob> behaved consistently, <eob> in different traditions and in <eol> different places of the world, <eob> as if they were hearing <eol> and obeying voices <eob> that they perceived as coming from the Gods, <eob> or from the muses ... <eob> what today we would call hallucinations. <eob>
And only then, as time went on, <eob> they began to recognize <eol> that they were the creators, <eob> the owners of these inner voices. <eob>
And with this, they gained introspection: <eob> the ability to think <eol> about their own thoughts. <eob>
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, <eob> at least in the way we perceive it today, <eob> where we feel that we are the pilots <eol> of our own existence -- <eob> is a quite recent cultural development. <eob>
And this theory is quite spectacular, <eob> but it has an obvious problem <eob> which is that it's built <eol> on just a few and very specific examples. <eob>
So the question is whether the theory <eob> that introspection built up in human history <eol> only about 3,000 years ago <eob> can be examined in a quantitative <eol> and objective manner. <eob>
And the problem of how to go <eol> about this is quite obvious. <eob>
It's not like Plato woke up one day <eol> and then he wrote, <eob> "Hello, I'm Plato, <eob> and as of today, I have <eol> a fully introspective consciousness." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And this tells us actually <eol> what is the essence of the problem. <eob>
We need to find the emergence <eol> of a concept that's never said. <eob>
The word introspection <eol> does not appear a single time <eob> in the books we want to analyze. <eob>
So our way to solve this is <eol> to build the space of words. <eob>
This is a huge space <eol> that contains all words <eob> in such a way that the distance <eol> between any two of them <eob> is indicative of how closely <eol> related they are. <eob>
So for instance, <eob> you want the words "dog" and "cat" <eol> to be very close together, <eob> but the words "grapefruit" <eol> and "logarithm" to be very far away. <eob> And this has to be true <eol> for any two words within the space. <eob>
And there are different ways <eol> that we can construct the space of words. <eob>
One is just asking the experts, <eob> a bit like we do with dictionaries. <eob>
Another possibility <eob> is following the simple assumption <eol> that when two words are related, <eob> they tend to appear <eol> in the same sentences, <eob> in the same paragraphs, <eob> in the same documents, <eob> more often than would be expected <eol> just by pure chance. <eob>
And this simple hypothesis, <eob> this simple method, <eob> with some computational tricks <eob> that have to do with the fact <eob> that this is a very complex <eol> and high-dimensional space, <eob> turns out to be quite effective. <eob>
And just to give you a flavor <eol> of how well this works, <eob> this is the result we get <eol> when we analyze this for some familiar words. <eob>
And you can see first <eob> that words automatically <eol> organize into semantic neighborhoods. <eob>
So you get the fruits, the body parts, <eob> the computer parts, <eol> the scientific terms and so on. <eob>
The algorithm also identifies <eol> that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. <eob>
So for instance, <eob> you can see that the scientific terms <eol> break down into two subcategories <eob> of the astronomic and the physics terms. <eob>
And then there are very fine things. <eob>
For instance, the word astronomy, <eob> which seems a bit bizarre where it is, <eob> is actually exactly where it should be, <eob> between what it is, <eob> an actual science, <eob> and between what it describes, <eob> the astronomical terms. <eob>
And we could go on and on with this. <eob>
Actually, if you stare <eol> at this for a while, <eob> and you just build random trajectories, <eob> you will see that it actually feels a bit <eol> like doing poetry. <eob>
And this is because, in a way, <eob> walking in this space <eol> is like walking in the mind. <eob>
And the last thing <eob> is that this algorithm also identifies <eol> what are our intuitions, <eob> of which words should lead <eol> in the neighborhood of introspection. <eob>
So for instance, <eob> words such as "self," "guilt," <eol> "reason," "emotion," <eob> are very close to "introspection," <eob> but other words, <eob> such as "red," "football," "candle," "banana," <eob> are just very far away. <eob>
And so once we've built the space, <eob> the question of the history <eol> of introspection, <eob> or of the history of any concept <eob> which before could seem abstract <eol> and somehow vague, <eob> becomes concrete -- <eob> becomes amenable to quantitative science. <eob>
All that we have to do <eol> is take the books, <eob> we digitize them, <eob> and we take this stream <eol> of words as a trajectory <eob> and project them into the space, <eob> and then we ask whether this trajectory <eol> spends significant time <eob> circling closely to the concept <eol> of introspection. <eob>
And with this, <eob> we could analyze the history <eol> of introspection <eob> in the ancient Greek tradition, <eob> for which we have the best available <eol> written record. <eob>
So what we did is we took all the books -- <eob> we just ordered them by time -- <eob> for each book we take the words <eob> and we project them to the space, <eob> and then we ask for each word <eol> how close it is to introspection, <eob> and we just average that. <eob>
And then we ask whether, <eol> as time goes on and on, <eob> these books get closer, <eol> and closer and closer <eob> to the concept of introspection. <eob>
And this is exactly what happens <eob> in the ancient Greek tradition. <eob>
to the concept of introspection. <eob> So you can see that for the oldest books <eol> in the Homeric tradition, <eob> there is a small increase <eol> with books getting closer to introspection. <eob> But about four centuries <eol> before Christ, <eob> this starts ramping up very rapidly <eol> to an almost five-fold increase <eob> of books getting closer, and closer and closer <eob>
And one of the nice things about this <eob> is that now we can ask <eob> whether this is also true <eol> in a different, independent tradition. <eob>
So we just ran this same analysis <eol> on the Judeo-Christian tradition, <eob> and we got virtually the same pattern. <eob>
Again, you see a small increase <eol> for the oldest books in the Old Testament, <eob> and then it increases much more rapidly <eob> in the new books <eol> of the New Testament. <eob>
And then we get the peak of introspection <eob> in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," <eob> about four centuries after Christ. <eob>
And this was very important, <eob> because Saint Augustine <eol> had been recognized by scholars, <eob> philologists, historians, <eob> as one of the founders <eol> of introspection. <eob>
Actually, some believe him to be <eol> the father of modern psychology. <eob>
So our algorithm, <eob> which has the virtue <eol> of being quantitative, <eob> of being objective, <eob> and of course of being extremely fast -- <eob> it just runs in a fraction of a second -- <eob> can capture some of the most important <eol> conclusions <eob> of this long tradition of investigation. <eob>
And this is in a way one <eol> of the beauties of science, <eob> which is that now this idea <eol> can be translated <eob> and generalized to a whole lot <eol> of different domains. <eob>
So in the same way that we asked <eol> about the past of human consciousness, <eob> maybe the most challenging question <eol> we can pose to ourselves <eob> is whether this can tell us something <eol> about the future of our own consciousness. <eob>
To put it more precisely, <eob> whether the words we say today <eob> can tell us something of where our minds <eol> will be in a few days, <eob> in a few months <eob> or a few years from now. <eob>
And in the same way many of us <eol> are now wearing sensors <eob> that detect our heart rate, <eob> our respiration, <eob> our genes, <eob> on the hopes that this may help us <eol> prevent diseases, <eob> we can ask whether monitoring <eol> and analyzing the words we speak, <eob> we tweet, we email, we write, <eob> can tell us ahead of time <eol> whether something may go wrong with our minds. <eob>
And with Guillermo Cecchi, <eob> who has been my brother in this adventure, <eob> we took on this task. <eob>
And we did so by analyzing the recorded <eol> speech of 34 young people <eob> who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia. <eob>
And so what we did is, <eol> we measured speech at day one, <eob> and then we asked whether the properties <eol> of the speech could predict, <eob> within a window of almost three years, <eob> the future development of psychosis. <eob>
But despite our hopes, <eob> we got failure after failure. <eob>
There was just not enough information <eol> in semantics <eob> to predict the future organization <eol> of the mind. <eob>
It was good enough <eob> to distinguish between a group <eol> of schizophrenics and a control group, <eob> a bit like we had done <eol> for the ancient texts, <eob> but not to predict the future <eol> onset of psychosis. <eob>
But then we realized <eob> that maybe the most important <eol> thing was not so much what they were saying, <eob> but how they were saying it. <eob>
More specifically, <eob> it was not in which semantic neighborhoods <eol> the words were, <eob> but how far and fast they jumped <eob> from one semantic neighborhood <eol> to the other one. <eob>
And so we came up with this measure, <eob> which we termed semantic coherence, <eob> which essentially measures the persistence <eol> of speech within one semantic topic, <eob> within one semantic category. <eob>
And it turned out to be <eol> that for this group of 34 people, <eob> the algorithm based on semantic <eol> coherence could predict, <eob> with 100 percent accuracy, <eob> who developed psychosis and who will not. <eob>
And this was something <eol> that could not be achieved -- <eob> not even close -- <eob> with all the other existing clinical measures. <eob>
And I remember vividly, while I was working on this, <eob> I was sitting at my computer <eob> and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- <eob> Polo had been my first student <eol> back in Buenos Aires, <eob> and at the time he was living in New York. <eob>
And there was something in this tweets -- <eob> I could not tell exactly <eol> what because nothing was said explicitly -- <eob> but I got this strong hunch, <eob> this strong intuition, <eol> that something was going wrong. <eob>
So I picked up the phone, <eol> and I called Polo, <eob> and in fact he was not feeling well. <eob>
And this simple fact, <eob> that reading in between the lines, <eob> I could sense, through words, his feelings, <eob> was a simple, but very effective way to help. <eob>
What I tell you today <eob> is that we're getting close to understanding <eob> how we can convert this intuition <eol> that we all have, <eob> that we all share, <eob> into an algorithm. <eob>
And in doing so, <eob> we may be seeing in the future <eol> a very different form of mental health, <eob> based on objective, quantitative <eol> and automated analysis <eob> of the words we write, <eob> of the words we say. <eob>
I consider it my life's mission <eob> to convey the urgency <eol> of climate change through my work. <eob>
I've traveled north to the Arctic <eol> to the capture the unfolding story <eob> of polar melt, <eob> and south to the Equator to document <eol> the subsequent rising seas. <eob>
Most recently, I visited <eol> the icy coast of Greenland <eob> and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, <eob> connecting two seemingly disparate <eol> but equally endangered <eob> parts of our planet. <eob>
My drawings explore moments <eol> of transition, turbulence <eob> and tranquility in the landscape, <eob> allowing viewers to emotionally connect <eob> with a place you might never <eol> have the chance to visit. <eob>
I choose to convey the beauty <eol> as opposed to the devastation. <eob>
If you can experience the sublimity <eol> of these landscapes, <eob> perhaps you'll be inspired <eol> to protect and preserve them. <eob>
Behavioral psychology tells us <eol> that we take action <eob> and make decisions based <eol> on our emotions above all else. <eob>
And studies have shown <eol> that art impacts our emotions <eob> more effectively than a scary news report. <eob>
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers <eob> as early as 2020. <eob>
And sea levels are likely to rise <eol> between two and ten feet <eob> by century's end. <eob>
I have dedicated my career <eol> to illuminating these projections <eob> with an accessible medium, <eob> one that moves us in a way <eol> that statistics may not. <eob>
My process begins <eol> with traveling to the places <eob> at the forefront of climate change. <eob>
On-site, I take thousands of photographs. <eob>
Back in the studio, <eob> I work from both my memory <eol> of the experience and the photographs <eob> to create very large-scale compositions, <eob> sometimes over 10 feet wide. <eob>
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry <eol> like charcoal, but colors. <eob>
I consider my work drawings <eol> but others call them painting. <eob>
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to <eol> as a "finger painter." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I don't use any tools <eob> and I have always used <eol> my fingers and palms <eob> to manipulate the pigment on the paper. <eob>
Drawing is a form of meditation for me. <eob> It quiets my mind. <eob> I don't perceive what I'm drawing <eob> as ice or water. <eob>
Instead, the image is stripped down <eob> to its most basic form of color and shape. <eob>
Once the piece is complete, <eob> I can finally experience <eol> the composition as a whole, <eob> as an iceberg floating <eol> through glassy water, <eob> or a wave cresting with foam. <eob>
On average, a piece this size <eol> takes me about, <eob> as you can see, 10 seconds. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Really, more like 200 hours, <eol> 250 hours for something that size. <eob>
But I've been drawing ever since <eol> I could hold a crayon, really. <eob>
My mom was an artist, and growing up, <eob> we always had art supplies <eol> all over the house. <eob>
My mother's love of photography <eob> propelled her to the most <eol> remote regions of the earth, <eob> and my family and I were fortunate enough <eob> to join and support her <eol> on these adventures. <eob>
We rode camels in Northern Africa <eob> and mushed on dog sleds <eol> near the North Pole. <eob>
In August of 2012, <eol> I led my first expedition, <eob> taking a group of artists and scholars <eol> up the northwest coast of Greenland. <eob>
My mother was originally <eol> supposed to lead this trip. <eob>
She and I were in the early <eol> stages of planning, <eob> as we had intended to go together, <eob> when she fell victim to a brain tumor. <eob>
The cancer quickly took over <eol> her body and mind, <eob> and she passed away six months later. <eob>
During the months of her illness, though, <eob> her dedication to the expedition <eol> never wavered, and I made a promise <eob> to carry out her final journey. <eob>
My mother's passion for the Arctic <eob> echoed through my experience in Greenland, <eob> and I felt the power <eob> and the fragility of the landscape. <eob>
The sheer size of the icebergs <eob> is humbling. <eob>
The ice fields are alive <eol> with movement and sound <eob> in a way that I never expected. <eob>
I expanded the scale of my compositions <eob> to give you that same sense of awe <eol> that I experienced. <eob>
Yet, while the grandeur <eol> of the ice is evident, <eob> so, too, is its vulnerability. <eob>
From our boat, <eob> I could see the ice sweating <eol> under the unseasonably warm sun. <eob>
We had a chance to visit <eol> many of the Inuit communities in Greenland <eob> that now face huge challenges. <eob>
The locals spoke to me <eol> of vast areas of sea ice <eob> that are no longer <eol> freezing over as they once did. <eob>
And without ice, their hunting <eol> and harvesting grounds <eob> are severely diminished, <eob> threatening their way <eol> of life and survival. <eob>
The melting glaciers in Greenland <eob> are one of the largest <eol> contributing factors to rising sea levels, <eob> which have already begun to drown <eob> some of our world's lowest-lying islands. <eob>
One year after my trip to Greenland, <eol> I visited the Maldives, <eob> the lowest and flattest country <eol> in the entire world. <eob>
While I was there, I collected <eol> images and inspiration <eob> for a new body of work: <eob> drawings of waves lapping <eol> on the coast of a nation <eob> that could be entirely underwater <eol> within this century. <eob>
Devastating events happen every day <eob> on scales both global and personal. <eob>
When I was in Greenland, <eob> I scattered my mother's ashes <eol> amidst the melting ice. <eob>
Now she remains a part <eol> of the landscape she loved so much, <eob> even as it, too, passes <eol> and takes on new form. <eob>
Among the many gifts my mother gave me <eob> was the ability to focus on the positive, <eob> rather than the negative. <eob>
My drawings celebrate the beauty <eol> of what we all stand to lose. <eob>
I hope they can serve as records <eol> of sublime landscapes in flux, <eob> documenting the transition <eol> and inspiring our global community <eob> to take action for the future. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
What do you see? <eob> Most of you see a barbershop, <eob> but I see an opportunity: <eob> an opportunity for health, <eob> an opportunity for health equity. <eob>
For black men, the barbershop <eol> is not just a place <eob> where you get your hair cut <eol> or your beard trimmed. <eob>
No, it's much more than that. <eob>
Historically, the barbershop <eol> has been a safe haven for black men. <eob>
It's a place where we go for friendship, <eob> solidarity and solace. <eob>
It's a place where we go <eol> to get away from the stress <eob> of the grind of work <eob> and sometimes home life. <eob>
It's a place <eol> where we don't have to worry <eob> about how we're being perceived <eol> by the outside world. <eob>
It's a place where <eol> we don't feel threatened, <eob> or threatening. <eob>
It's a place of loyalty and trust. <eob>
For that reason, <eob> it's one of the few places <eol> where we can fearlessly be ourselves <eob> and just ... talk. <eob>
The talk, the shop talk, <eol> the conversation, <eob> that is the essence of the black barbershop. <eob>
I can remember going to the barbershop <eol> with my dad as a kid. <eob>
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop <eol> every other Saturday. <eob>
And like clockwork, the same group <eol> of men would be there <eob> every time we went, <eob> either waiting on their favorite barber <eob> or just soaking up the atmosphere. <eob>
every time we went, <eob> I can remember the jovial greeting <eol> that warmly welcomed us <eob>
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad. <eob>
He's a local pastor, <eol> and they treated him like a celebrity. <eob>
"Hey young fella, how you doing?" <eob> they would say to me, <eob> making me feel just as special. <eob>
I remember the range <eol> of the conversations was immense. <eob>
The men would talk <eol> about politics and sports and music <eob> and world news, national news, <eob> neighborhood news. <eob>
There was some talk about women <eob> and what it was like to be <eol> a black man in America. <eob>
But many times <eol> they also talked about health. <eob>
The conversations about health were lengthy and deep. <eob>
The men often recounted <eol> their doctor's recommendations <eob> to cut salt in their diet <eob> or to eat less fried foods <eob> or to stop smoking <eob> or to reduce stress. <eob>
They talked about the different ways <eol> you could reduce stress, <eob> like simplifying one's love life -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
all ways to treat high blood pressure. <eob>
There's a lot of talk about high blood <eol> pressure in the barbershop. <eob>
That's because almost 40 percent <eol> of black men have it. <eob>
That means that almost <eol> every single black man <eob> either has high blood pressure <eob> or knows a black man who has it. <eob>
Sometimes, those conversations <eol> in the barbershop <eob> would be about what happens <eol> when high blood pressure <eob> is not adequately addressed. <eob>
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? <eob>
He had a stroke. " <eob>
"Did you hear about Eddie? <eob>
He died last week. <eob> Massive heart attack. <eob> He was 50. <eob> " <eob>
More black men die from high blood pressure <eol> than from anything else, <eob> even though decades of medical wisdom <eol> and science have demonstrated <eob> that death from high blood pressure <eol> can be prevented <eob> with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. <eob>
So why is high blood pressure so <eol> differentially deadly for black men? <eob>
Because too often, high blood pressure <eol> is either untreated <eob> or under-treated in black men, <eob> in part because of our lower engagement <eol> with the primary healthcare system. <eob>
Black men, in particular those <eol> with high blood pressure, <eob> are less likely to have <eol> a primary care doctor <eob> than other groups. <eob>
But why? <eob> Some of our earliest research <eol> on black men's health <eob> revealed that for many, <eol> the doctor's office is associated with fear, <eob> mistrust, <eob> disrespect, <eob> and unnecessary unpleasantness. <eob>
The doctor's office is only a place <eol> that you go when you don't feel well. <eob>
And when you do go, <eol> you might wait for hours <eob> only to get the run-around <eob> and to be evaluated by a stoic <eol> figure in a white coat <eob> who only has 10 minutes <eol> to give you <eob> and who doesn't value the talk. <eob>
So it's no wonder that some men <eol> don't want to be bothered <eob> and skip going to the doctor altogether, <eob> especially if they feel fine. <eob>
But herein lies the problem. <eob>
You can feel just fine <eob> while high blood pressure ravages <eol> your most vital organs. <eob>
This is Denny Moe, <eob> owner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem. <eob>
I've been lucky enough <eol> to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years. <eob>
He said to me once, <eob> "Hey Doc, you know, <eob> lots of black men trust their barbers <eol> more than they trust their doctors." <eob>
This was stunning to me, <eob> at first, <eob> but not so much when you think about it. <eob>
Black men have been <eol> with their current barbers <eob> on average as long as I've been with Denny, <eob> about eight years. <eob>
And black men see their barbers <eol> about every two weeks. <eob>
Not only do you trust your barber <eol> with your look and with your style, <eob> but you also trust him with your secrets <eol> and sometimes your life. <eob>
Denny, like many barbers, <eol> is more than just an artist, <eob> a businessman and confidant. <eob>
He's a leader and a passionate advocate <eol> for the well-being of his community. <eob>
The very first time I walked <eol> into Denny Moe's shop, <eob> he wasn't just cutting hair. <eob>
He was also orchestrating a voter <eol> registration drive <eob> to give a voice to his customers <eol> and his community. <eob>
With this kind of activism, <eob> and community investment <eol> that typifies the black barbershop, <eob> of course the barbershop <eol> is a perfect place <eob> to talk about high blood pressure <eol> and other health concerns in the community. <eob>
First, the barbershop <eol> is not a medical setting, <eob> and so it doesn't have all the negative <eol> psychological baggage <eob> that comes along with that. <eob>
When you're in a barbershop, <eob> you're in your territory, <eol> and you're among friends <eob> who share your history, <eob> your struggle and your health risks. <eob>
Second, because the barbershop <eol> is a place of connection, <eob> loyalty and trust, <eob> it's a place where you're more open <eol> to have a conversation about health <eob> and especially about high <eol> blood pressure. <eob>
After all, <eob> conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements <eol> of great shop talk: <eob> stress and high blood pressure, <eob> food and high blood pressure, <eob> relationships and high blood pressure, <eob> and yes, what it's like to be <eol> a black man in America <eob> and high blood pressure. <eob>
But you can do more than just talk <eol> about high blood pressure <eob> in the barbershop. <eob>
You can concretely take action. <eob>
Here we have an opportunity <eol> to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world <eob> and empower communities to address <eol> the health inequities <eob> that uniquely affect it. <eob>
When high blood pressure screening <eol> expanded from clinics and hospitals <eob> to communities in the 1960s <eol> and '70s, <eob> black physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders <eol> in Baltimore <eob> and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans <eob> were at the forefront of bringing health promotion <eol> to community hubs <eob> in urban black neighborhoods. <eob>
These pioneers paved the way <eol> for my professional journey <eob> with barbershops and health, <eob> which began in Chicago in medical school. <eob>
The very first research project <eol> that I worked on as a medical student <eob> was to help design healthcare interventions <eob> that would appeal to black men. <eob>
We conducted about a dozen focus groups <eob> with a broad cross-section of black men, <eob> and we learned that for them, <eob> being healthy was as much about being perceived <eol> as healthy <eob> as it was about feeling healthy, <eob> and that feeling good went hand <eol> in hand with looking good. <eob>
This work led to the development <eol> of Project Brotherhood, <eob> a community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker <eob> that provided tailored healthcare <eol> to black men. <eob>
Part of this tailored care <eob> involved having a barber on the premises <eob> to reward the men who came for needed healthcare <eob> with a free haircut, <eob> to let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked <eob> as well as how they felt, <eob> and that what was important <eol> to them was also important to us. <eob>
But while there's only one Project Brotherhood, <eob> there are thousands of black barbershops <eob> where the intersection of health and haircuts <eol> can be cultivated. <eob>
The next stop on my journey <eol> was Dallas, Texas, <eob> where we learned that barbers <eol> were not only willing <eob> but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate <eob> in delivering needed health services <eol> to improve the health of their customers <eob> and their community. <eob>
We teamed up with an amazing <eol> cadre of black barbers <eob> and taught them how to measure <eol> blood pressure <eob> and how to counsel their customers <eob> and refer them to doctors <eob> to help manage high blood pressure. <eob>
The barbers were not only willing to do it <eob> but they were damn good at it. <eob>
Over a three-year period, <eob> the barbers measured thousands <eol> of blood pressures <eob> resulting in hundreds of black <eol> men being referred to doctors <eob> for medical care of their high blood pressure. <eob>
These barber-doctor partnerships <eob> resulted in a 20 percent increase <eol> in the number of men <eob> who were able to achieve <eol> target blood pressure levels <eob> and a three-point drop, on average, <eob> in the blood pressure of each participant. <eob>
If we were to extrapolate <eol> that three point drop <eob> to every single black man with <eol> high blood pressure in America, <eob> we would prevent 800 heart attacks, <eol> 500 strokes and 900 deaths <eob> from high blood pressure <eob> in just one year. <eob>
And our experience with barbershops <eol> has been no different in New York City, <eob> where my journey has currently led me. <eob>
With an incredible team <eol> of diverse research assistants, <eob> community health workers and volunteers, <eob> we've been able to partner <eol> with over 200 barbershops <eob> and other trusted community venues <eob> to reach over 7,000 older black men. <eob>
And we've offered high blood pressure <eol> screening and counseling <eob> to each and every one of them. <eob>
Thanks to Denny Moe <eob> and the myriad other barbers <eol> and community leaders <eob> who shared the vision <eol> of opportunity and empowerment <eob> to make a difference in their communities, <eob> we've been able to not <eol> only lower blood pressure <eob> in our participants, <eob> but we've also been able to impact <eol> other health indicators. <eob>
So what do you see? <eob> What is your barbershop? <eob>
Where is that place for you <eob> where people who are affected <eol> by a unique problem <eob> can meet a unique solution? <eob>
When you find that place, <eol> see the opportunity. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was a Marine <eob> with 1 / 1 Weapons Company, <eob> 81's platoon, <eob> out in Camp Pendleton, California. <eob> Oorah! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I joined a few months after September 11, <eob> feeling like I think most people <eol> in the country did at the time, <eob> filled with a sense <eol> of patriotism and retribution <eob> and the desire to do something -- <eob> that, coupled with that fact <eol> that I wasn't doing anything. <eob>
I was 17, just graduated <eol> from high school that past summer, <eob> living in the back room <eol> of my parents' house paying rent, <eob> in the small town I was raised in <eol> in Northern Indiana, <eob> called Mishawaka. <eob>
I can spell that later <eol> for people who are interested -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Mishawaka is many good things <eol> but cultural hub of the world it is not, <eob> so my only exposure to theater and film <eob> was limited to the plays <eol> I did in high school <eob> and Blockbuster Video, <eol> may she rest in peace. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was serious enough about acting <eob> that I auditioned for Juilliard <eol> when I was a senior in high school, <eob> didn't get in, <eob> determined college wasn't for me <eol> and applied nowhere else, <eob> which was a genius move. <eob>
I also did that Hail Mary <eol> LA acting odyssey <eob> that I always heard stories about, <eob> of actors moving to LA <eol> with, like, seven dollars <eob> and finding work and successful careers. <eob>
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas, <eol> before my car broke down. <eob>
I spent all my money repairing it, <eob> finally made it to Santa Monica -- <eob> not even LA -- <eob> stayed for 48 hours wandering <eol> the beach, basically, <eob> got in my car, drove home, <eob> thus ending my acting career, so -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Seventeen, Mishawaka ... <eob> parents' house, paying rent, <eol> selling vacuums ... <eob> telemarketing, <eob> cutting grass at the local <eol> 4-H fairgrounds. <eob>
This was my world <eol> going into September, 2001. <eob>
So after the 11th, <eob> and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, <eob> and just being pissed off in general — at myself, <eob> my parents, the government; <eob> not having confidence, <eol> not having a respectable job, <eob> my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove <eol> to California and back — <eob> I joined the Marine Corps and loved it. <eob>
I loved being a Marine. <eob>
It's one of the things I'm most proud <eol> of having done in my life. <eob>
Firing weapons was cool, <eob> driving and detonating <eol> expensive things was great. <eob>
But I found I loved <eol> the Marine Corps the most <eob> for the thing I was looking <eol> for the least when I joined, <eob> which was the people: <eob> these weird dudes -- <eol> a motley crew of characters <eob> from a cross section <eol> of the United States -- <eob> that on the surface I had <eol> nothing in common with. <eob>
And over time, <eob> all the political and personal bravado <eob> that led me to the military dissolved, <eob> and for me, the Marine Corps <eol> became synonymous with my friends. <eob>
And then, a few years into my service <eob> and months away from deploying to Iraq, <eob> I dislocated my sternum <eol> in a mountain-biking accident, <eob> and had to be medically separated. <eob>
Those never in the military <eol> may find this hard to understand, <eob> but being told I wasn't getting deployed <eol> to Iraq or Afghanistan <eob> was very devastating for me. <eob>
I have a very clear image of leaving <eol> the base hospital on a stretcher <eob> and my entire platoon is waiting <eol> outside to see if I was OK. <eob>
And then, suddenly, <eol> I was a civilian again. <eob>
I knew I wanted to give <eol> acting another shot, <eob> because -- again, this is me -- <eob> I thought all civilian problems <eol> are small compared to the military. <eob>
I mean, what can you really <eol> bitch about now, you know? <eob> "It's hot. <eob>
Someone should turn <eol> on the air conditioner." <eob> "This coffee line is too long." <eob> I was a Marine, <eob> I knew how to survive. <eob>
I'd go to New York and become an actor. <eob>
If things didn't work out, <eob> I'd live in Central Park <eol> and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I re-auditioned for Juilliard <eol> and this time I was lucky, <eob> I got in. <eob>
But I was surprised <eol> by how complex the transition was <eob> from military to civilian. <eob>
And I was relatively healthy; I can't <eol> imagine going through that process <eob> on top of a mental or physical injury. <eob>
But regardless, it was difficult. <eob>
In part, because I was in acting school -- <eob> I couldn't justify going <eol> to voice and speech class, <eob> throwing imaginary balls of energy <eol> at the back of the room, <eob> doing acting exercises <eol> where I gave birth to myself -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
while my friends were serving <eol> without me overseas. <eob>
But also, because I didn't <eol> know how to apply the things <eob> I learned in the military <eol> to a civilian context. <eob> I mean that both practically <eol> and emotionally. <eob>
Practically, I had to get a job. <eob>
And I was an Infantry Marine, <eob> where you're shooting machine guns <eol> and firing mortars. <eob>
There's not a lot of places you can <eol> put those skills in the civilian world. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning. <eob>
In the military, everything has meaning. <eob>
Everything you do <eol> is either steeped in tradition <eob> or has a practical purpose. <eob>
You can't smoke in the field <eob> because you don't want <eol> to give away your position. <eob>
You don't touch your face -- <eol> you have to maintain <eob> a personal level of health and hygiene. <eob>
You face this way when "Colors" plays, <eob> out of respect for people <eol> who went before you. <eob>
Walk this way, talk this way <eol> because of this. <eob>
Your uniform is maintained to the inch. <eob>
How diligently you followed <eol> those rules spoke volumes <eob> about the kind of Marine you were. <eob>
Your rank said something <eol> about your history <eob> and the respect you had earned. <eob>
In the civilian world there's no rank. <eob>
Here you're just another body, <eob> and I felt like I constantly had <eol> to prove my worth all over again. <eob>
And the respect civilians were giving me <eol> while I was in uniform <eob> didn't exist when I was out of it. <eob>
There didn't seem to be a ... <eob> a sense of community, <eob> whereas in the military, <eol> I felt this sense of community. <eob>
How often in the civilian world <eob> are you put in a life-or-death situation <eol> with your closest friends <eob> and they constantly demonstrate <eol> that they're not going to abandon you? <eob>
And meanwhile, at acting school ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was really, for the first time, <eob> discovering playwrights <eol> and characters and plays <eob> that had nothing to do with the military, <eob> but were somehow describing <eol> my military experience <eob> in a way that before <eol> to me was indescribable. <eob>
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive <eob> as I was able to put words <eol> to feelings for the first time <eob> and realizing what <eol> a valuable tool that was. <eob>
And when I was reflecting <eol> on my time in the military, <eob> I wasn't first thinking <eol> on the stereotypical drills <eob> and discipline and pain of it; <eob> but rather, the small, <eol> intimate human moments, <eob> moments of great feeling: <eob> friends going AWOL <eol> because they missed their families, <eob> friends getting divorced, <eob> grieving together, celebrating together, <eob> all within the backdrop of the military. <eob>
I saw my friends battling <eol> these circumstances, <eob> and I watched the anxiety <eol> it produced in them and me, <eob> not being able to express <eol> our feelings about it. <eob>
The military and theater communities <eol> are actually very similar. <eob> You have a group of people <eol> trying to accomplish a mission <eob> greater than themselves; <eol> it's not about you. <eob>
You have a role, you have to know <eol> your role within that team. <eob>
Every team has a leader or director; <eob> sometimes they're smart, <eol> sometimes they're not. <eob>
You're forced to be intimate <eol> with complete strangers <eob> in a short amount of time; <eob> the self-discipline, the self-maintenance. <eob>
I thought, how great would it be <eol> to create a space <eob> that combined these two seemingly <eol> dissimilar communities, <eob> that brought entertainment <eol> to a group of people <eob> that, considering their occupation, <eob> could handle something <eol> a bit more thought-provoking <eob> than the typical mandatory-fun events <eob> that I remember being <eol> "volun-told" to go to in the military -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
all well-intended but slightly <eol> offensive events, <eob> like "Win a Date with a San Diego <eol> Chargers Cheerleader," <eob> where you answer a question <eol> about pop culture, <eob> and if you get it right you win a date, <eob> which was a chaperoned walk <eol> around the parade deck <eob> with this already married, <eol> pregnant cheerleader -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nothing against cheerleaders, <eol> I love cheerleaders. <eob>
The point is more, how great would it <eol> be to have theater presented <eob> through characters that were accessible <eol> without being condescending. <eob>
So we started this nonprofit <eol> called Arts in the Armed Forces, <eob> where we tried to do that, <eob> tried to join these two seemingly <eol> dissimilar communities. <eob>
We pick a play or select monologues <eol> from contemporary American plays <eob> that are diverse in age and race <eol> like a military audience is, <eob> grab a group of incredible <eol> theater-trained actors, <eob> arm them with incredible material, <eob> keep production value <eol> as minimal as possible -- <eob> no sets, no costumes, <eol> no lights, just reading it -- <eob> to throw all the emphasis on the language <eob> and to show that theater can <eol> be created at any setting. <eob>
It's a powerful thing, <eob> getting in a room with complete strangers <eob> and reminding ourselves of our humanity, <eob> and that self-expression <eol> is just as valuable a tool <eob> as a rifle on your shoulder. <eob>
And for an organization like the military, <eob> that prides itself on having <eol> acronyms for acronyms, <eob> you can get lost in the sauce <eob> when it comes to explaining <eol> a collective experience. <eob>
And I can think of no better community <eob> to arm with a new means of self-expression <eob> than those protecting our country. <eob>
We've gone all over <eol> the United States and the world, <eob> from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, <eob> to Camp Pendleton, <eol> to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, <eob> to USAG Bavaria, <eob> on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York. <eob>
And for the performing artists we bring, <eob> it's a window into a culture <eob> they otherwise would not <eol> have had exposure to. <eob>
And for the military, it's the exact same. <eob>
And in doing this for the past six years, <eob> I'm always reminded <eol> that acting is many things. <eob>
It's a craft, it's a political act, <eol> it's a business, it's -- <eob> whatever adjective <eol> is most applicable to you. <eob>
But it's also a service. <eob>
I didn't get to finish mine, <eob> so whenever I get to be of service <eob> to this ultimate service industry, <eol> the military, for me, again -- <eob> there's not many things better than that. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're going to be doing a piece <eol> from Marco Ramirez, <eob> called "I am not Batman." <eob> An incredible actor <eol> and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez, <eob> is going to be reading, <eob> and Matt Johnson, <eol> who I just met a couple hours ago. <eob>
They're doing it together <eol> for the first time, <eob> so we'll see how it goes. <eob>
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night <eob> and the sky is glowing <eol> like mad, radioactive red. <eob>
And if you squint, <eol> you can maybe see the moon <eob> through a thick layer of cigarette smoke <eol> and airplane exhaust <eob> that covers the whole city, <eob> like a mosquito net <eol> that won't let the angels in. <eob>
(Drum beat) <eob>
And if you look up high enough, <eob> you can see me standing <eol> on the edge of an 87-story building. <eob>
And up there, a place for gargoyles <eol> and broken clock towers <eob> that have stayed still and dead <eol> for maybe like 100 years, <eob> up there is me. <eob>
(Beat) <eob>
And I'm frickin' Batman. <eob>
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs <eob> and frickin' bat caves, like, for real. <eob>
And all it takes is a broom closet <eob> or a back room or a fire escape, <eob> and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone. <eob>
And my navy blue polo shirt, <eob> the one that looks kinda good on me <eol> but has that hole on it near the butt <eob> from when it got snagged <eol> on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's <eob> but it isn't even a big deal <eol> because I tuck that part in <eob> and it's, like, all good. <eob>
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too! <eob>
And I get like, like ... transformational. <eob>
(Beat) <eob>
And nobody pulls out a belt <eol> and whips Batman for talkin' back. <eob>
(Beat) <eob>
Or for not talkin' back. <eob>
And nobody calls Batman simple <eob> or stupid <eob> or skinny. <eob>
And nobody fires Batman's brother <eol> from the Eastern Taxi Company <eob> 'cause they was making cutbacks, neither. <eob> 'Cause they got nothing but respect. <eob>
And not like afraid-respect, <eob> just, like, respect-respect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
'Cause nobody's afraid of you. <eob> 'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm. <eob>
(Beat) <eob>
Ever. (Double beat) <eob>
'Cause all Batman really wants <eol> to do is save people <eob> and maybe pay abuela's bills one day <eob> and die happy. <eob>
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh -- and kill the Joker. <eob>
(Drum roll) <eob>
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone. <eob>
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin' <eob> like a eagle <eob> or like a -- <eob> no, yeah, like a eagle. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And my cape is flapping in the wind <eol> cause it's frickin' long <eob> and my pointy ears are on, <eob> and that mask that covers like half <eol> my face is on, too, <eob> and I got, like, bulletproof stuff <eol> all in my chest so no one can hurt me. <eob>
And nobody -- nobody! -- <eob> is gonna come between Batman ... <eob> and justice. <eob>
(Drums) <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
From where I am, <eob> I can hear everything. <eob>
(Silence) <eob>
Somewhere in the city, <eob> there's a old lady picking <eol> Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can <eob> and she's putting a piece <eol> of sesame chicken someone spit out <eob> into her own mouth. <eob>
And somewhere there's a doctor <eol> with a wack haircut in a black lab coat <eob> trying to find a cure for the diseases <eob> that are gonna make us <eol> all extinct for real one day. <eob>
And somewhere there's a man, <eob> a man in a janitor's uniform, <eob> stumbling home drunk and dizzy <eob> after spending half his paycheck <eol> on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer, <eob> and the other half on a four-hour visit <eol> to some lady's house <eob> on a street where the lights <eol> have all been shot out <eob> by people who'd rather do <eol> what they do in this city in the dark. <eob>
And half a block away from janitor man, <eob> there's a group of good-for-nothings <eol> who don't know no better, <eob> waiting for janitor man <eol> with rusted bicycle chains <eob> and imitation Louisville Sluggers, <eob> and if they don't find a cent on him, <eob> which they won't, <eob> they'll just pound at him till the muscles <eol> in their arms start burning, <eob> till there's no more teeth to crack out. <eob>
But they don't count on me. <eob>
They don't count on no Dark Knight, <eob> with a stomach full of grocery-store <eol> brand macaroni and cheese <eob> and cut-up Vienna sausages. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
'Cause they'd rather believe <eol> I don't exist. <eob>
And from 87 stories up, I can hear <eol> one of the good-for-nothings say, <eob> "Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that, <eob> just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!" <eob> And I see janitor man mumble something <eol> in drunk language and turn pale, <eob> and from 87 stories up, <eob> I can hear his stomach trying <eol> to hurl its way out his Dickies. <eob>
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast <eob> and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!" <eob> And I throw a batarang <eol> at the one naked lightbulb. <eob>
(Cymbal) <eob>
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker! <eob>
Who just turned out the lights?" <eob>
"What's that over there?" <eol> "What?" <eob>
"Gimme me what you got, old man!" <eob>
"Did anybody hear that?" <eob> "Hear what? There ain't nothing. <eol> No, really -- there ain't no bat!" <eob>
But then ... <eob> one out of the three good-for-nothings <eol> gets it to the head -- pow! <eob>
And number two swings blindly <eol> into the dark cape before him, <eob> but before his fist hits anything, <eob> I grab a trash can lid and -- <eob> right in the gut! <eob>
And number one comes <eol> back with the jump kick, <eob> but I know judo karate, too, <eol> so I'm like -- <eob>
(Drums) <eob>
Twice! <eob>
(Drums) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But before I can do any more damage, <eob> suddenly we all hear a "click-click." <eob> And suddenly everything gets quiet. <eob>
And the one good-for-nothing left standing <eob> grips a handgun and aims it straight up, <eob> like he's holding Jesus hostage, <eob> like he's threatening maybe <eol> to blow a hole in the moon. <eob>
And the good-for-nothing <eol> who got it to the head, <eob> who tried to jump-kick me, <eob> and the other good-for-nothing <eol> who got it in the gut, <eob> is both scrambling back away <eol> from the dark figure before 'em. <eob>
And the drunk man, the janitor man, <eob> is huddled in a corner, <eol> praying to Saint Anthony <eob> 'cause that's the only one <eol> he could remember. <eob>
(Double beat) <eob> And there's me: <eob> eyes glowing white, <eob> cape blowing softly in the wind. <eob>
(Beat) <eob> Bulletproof chest heaving, <eob> my heart beating right through it <eol> in a Morse code for: <eob> "Fuck with me <eob> just once <eob> come on <eob> just try." <eob>
And the one good-for-nothing left standing <eob> the one with the handgun -- <eob> yeah, he laughs. <eob>
And he lowers his arm. <eob>
And he points it at me <eob> and gives the moon a break. <eob>
And he aims it right <eol> between my pointy ears, <eob> like goal posts and he's special teams. <eob>
And janitor man is still <eol> calling Saint Anthony, <eob> but he ain't pickin' up. <eob>
And for a second, <eob> it seems like ... <eob> maybe I'm gonna lose. <eob>
Nah! <eob>
(Drums) <eob>
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka! <eob>
"Don't kill me, man!" <eob>
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash! <eob>
Skin meets acid: <eol> "Ahhhhhhh!" <eob>
And he's on the floor <eob> and I'm standing over him <eob> and I got the gun in my hands now <eob> and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em <eol> 'cause I'm Batman. <eob>
And, asterisk: <eob> Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents <eol> got iced by guns a long time ago. <eob>
But for just a second, <eob> my eyes glow white, <eob> and I hold this thing <eob> for I could speak to the good-for-nothing <eob> in a language he maybe understands. <eob> Click-click! <eob>
(Beat) <eob>
And the good-for-nothings <eol> become good-for-disappearing <eob> into whatever toxic waste, chemical <eol> sludge shithole they crawled out of. <eob>
And it's just me and janitor man. <eob>
And I pick him up, <eob> and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume <eol> off his forehead. <eob>
And he begs me not to hurt him <eob> and I grab him tight <eol> by his janitor-man shirt collar, <eob> and I pull him to my face <eob> and he's taller than me <eol> but the cape helps, <eob> so he listens when I look him <eol> straight in the eyes. <eob>
And I say two words to him: <eob> "Go home." <eob>
And he does, <eob> checking behind his shoulder <eol> every 10 feet. <eob>
And I swoosh from building <eol> to building on his way there <eob> 'cause I know where he lives. <eob>
And I watch his hands tremble <eol> as he pulls out his key chain <eob> and opens the door to his building. <eob>
And I'm back in bed <eob> before he even walks in <eol> through the front door. <eob>
And I hear him turn on the faucet <eob> and pour himself a glass <eol> of warm tap water. <eob>
And he puts the glass back in the sink. <eob>
And I hear his footsteps. <eob>
And they get slower <eol> as they get to my room. <eob>
And he creaks my door open, <eol> like, mad-slow. <eob>
And he takes a step in, <eob> which he never does. <eob>
(Beat) <eob> And he's staring off into nowhere, <eob> his face, the color <eol> of sidewalks in summer. <eob>
And I act like I'm just waking up <eob> and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?" <eob> And janitor man says nothing to me. <eob>
But I see in the dark, <eob> I see his arms go limp <eob> and his head turns back, like, towards me. <eob>
And he lifts it for I can see his face, <eob> for I could see his eyes. <eob>
And his cheeks is drippin', <eol> but not with sweat. <eob>
And he just stands there breathing, <eob> like he remembers my <eob> eyes glowing white, <eob> like he remembers my bulletproof chest, <eob> like he remembers he's my pop. <eob>
And for a long time I don't say nothin'. <eob>
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob. <eob>
And he ain't looking my way, <eob> but I hear him mumble two words to me: <eob> "I'm sorry." <eob>
And I lean over, and I open <eol> my window just a crack. <eob>
If you look up high enough, <eob> you could see me. <eob>
And from where I am -- <eob>
I could hear everything. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
OK, first, some introductions. <eob>
My mom, Jennie, took this picture. <eob>
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle. <eob>
And on his left, my sisters: <eob> Mary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie. <eob>
John Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin <eol> Michael's on his right. <eob>
And in the pale-blue windbreaker, <eob> Susan Diane. Me. <eob> I loved growing up in a big family. <eob>
And one of my favorite things <eol> was picking names. <eob>
But by the time child <eol> number seven came along, <eob> we had nearly run out of middle names. <eob>
It was a long deliberation <eob> before we finally settled <eol> on Jennifer Bridget. <eob>
Every parent in this audience <eob> knows the joy and excitement <eob> of picking a new baby's name. <eob>
And I was excited and thrilled <eob> to help my mom in that special <eol> ceremonial moment. <eob>
But it's not like that everywhere. <eob>
I travel a lot and I see a lot. <eob>
But it took me by surprise to learn <eob> in an area of Ethiopia, <eob> parents delay picking the names <eol> for their new babies <eob> by a month or more. <eob> Why delay? <eob> Why not take advantage <eol> of this special ceremonial time? <eob>
Well, they delay because they're afraid. <eob>
They're afraid their baby will die. <eob>
And this loss might be a little more <eol> bearable without a name. <eob>
A face without a name might help them feel <eob> just a little less attached. <eob>
So here we are in one part of the world -- <eob> a time of joy, excitement, dreaming <eol> of the future of that child -- <eob> while in another world, <eob> parents are filled with dread, <eob> not daring to dream <eol> of a future for their child <eob> beyond a few precious weeks. <eob> How can that be? <eob> How can it be that 2.6 million babies <eob> die around the world <eob> before they're even one month old? <eob> 2.6 million. <eob> That's the population <eol> of Vancouver. <eob>
And the shocking thing is: <eob> Why? <eob>
In too many cases, we simply don't know. <eob>
Now, I remember recently <eol> seeing an updated pie chart. <eob>
And the pie chart was labeled, <eob> "Causes of death <eol> in children under five worldwide." <eob> And there was a pretty big section <eol> of that pie chart, about 40 percent -- <eob> 40 percent was labeled "neonatal." <eob> Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death. <eob>
Neonatal is simply an adjective, <eob> an adjective that means <eol> that the child is less than one month old. <eob>
For me, "neonatal" said: <eol> "We have no idea." <eob>
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor. <eob> I want to fix things. <eob>
But you can't fix what you can't define. <eob>
So our first step in restoring <eol> the dreams of those parents <eob> is to answer the question: <eob> Why are babies dying? <eob>
So today, I want to talk <eol> about a new approach, <eob> an approach that I feel <eob> will not only help us know <eol> why babies are dying, <eob> but is beginning to completely transform <eob> the whole field of global health. <eob>
It's called "Precision Public Health." <eob>
For me, precision medicine comes <eol> from a very special place. <eob>
I trained as a cancer doctor, <eol> an oncologist. <eob>
I got into it because I wanted <eol> to help people feel better. <eob>
But too often my treatments <eol> made them feel worse. <eob>
I still remember young women <eol> being driven to my clinic <eob> by their moms -- <eob> adults, who had to be helped into my exam room <eol> by their mothers. <eob>
They were so weak <eob> from the treatment I had given them. <eob>
But at the time, in those front <eol> lines in the war on cancer, <eob> we had few tools. <eob>
And the tools we did have <eol> couldn't differentiate <eob> between the cancer cells <eol> that we wanted to hit hard <eob> and those healthy cells <eol> that we wanted to preserve. <eob>
And so the side effects <eol> that you're all very familiar with -- <eob> hair loss, being sick to your stomach, <eob> having a suppressed immune system, <eol> so infection was a constant threat -- <eob> were always surrounding us. <eob>
And then I moved <eol> to the biotechnology industry. <eob>
And I got to work on a new approach <eol> for breast cancer patients <eob> that could do a better job <eol> of telling the healthy cells <eob> from the unhealthy or cancer cells. <eob>
It's a drug called Herceptin. <eob>
And what Herceptin allowed us to do <eob> is to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer, <eob> at the time, the scariest <eol> form of breast cancer. <eob>
And that precision <eol> let us hit hard the cancer cells, <eob> while sparing and being more gentle <eol> on the normal cells. <eob> A huge breakthrough. <eob> It felt like a miracle, <eob> so much so that today, <eob> we're harnessing all those tools -- <eob> big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more -- <eob> to tackle a broad variety of diseases. <eob>
That's allowing us to target individuals <eob> with the right remedies at the right time. <eob>
Precision medicine revolutionized <eol> cancer therapy. <eob> Everything changed. <eob> And I want everything to change again. <eob>
So I've been asking myself: <eob> Why should we limit <eob> this smarter, more precise, better way <eol> to tackle diseases <eob> to the rich world? <eob> Now, don't misunderstand me -- <eob> I'm not talking about bringing <eol> expensive medicines like Herceptin <eob> to the developing world, <eob> although I'd actually kind of like that. <eob>
What I am talking about <eob> is moving from this precise <eol> targeting for individuals <eob> to tackle public health problems <eob> in populations. <eob>
Now, OK, I know probably <eol> you're thinking, "She's crazy. <eob>
You can't do that. <eob>
That's too ambitious. <eob> "But here's the thing: <eob> we're already doing this in a limited way, <eob> and it's already starting to make <eol> a big difference. <eob>
So here's what's happening. <eob>
Now, I told you I trained <eol> as a cancer doctor. <eob>
But like many, many doctors who trained <eol> in San Francisco in the '80s, <eob> I also trained as an AIDS doctor. <eob>
It was a terrible time. <eob>
AIDS was a death sentence. <eob>
All my patients died. <eob>
Now, things are better, <eob> but HIV / AIDS remains <eol> a terrible global challenge. <eob>
Worldwide, about 17 million women <eol> are living with HIV. <eob>
We know that when these women <eol> become pregnant, <eob> they can transfer the virus <eol> to their baby. <eob>
We also know in the absence of therapy, <eob> half those babies <eol> will not survive until the age of two. <eob>
But we know that antiretroviral therapy <eol> can virtually guarantee <eob> that she will not transmit <eol> the virus to the baby. <eob>
So what do we do? <eob>
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach, <eol> kind of like that blast of chemo, <eob> would mean we test and treat every <eol> pregnant woman in the world. <eob>
That would do the job. <eob>
But it's just not practical. <eob>
So instead, we target those areas <eol> where HIV rates are the highest. <eob>
We know in certain countries <eol> in sub-Saharan Africa <eob> we can test and treat pregnant women <eol> where rates are highest. <eob>
This precision approach <eol> to a public health problem <eob> has cut by nearly half <eob> HIV transmission from mothers to baby <eob> in the last five years. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Screening pregnant women <eol> in certain areas in the developing world <eob> is a powerful example <eob> of how precision public health <eol> can change things on a big scale. <eob>
So... <eob> How do we do that? <eob>
We can do that because we know. <eob>
We know who to target, <eob> what to target, <eob> where to target and how to target. <eob>
And that, for me, are the important <eol> elements of precision public health: <eob> who, what, where and how. <eob>
But let's go back to the <eob> 2.6 million <eob> babies <eob> who die before they're one month old. <eob>
Here's the problem: we just don't know. <eob>
It may seem unbelievable, <eob> but the way we figure out <eol> the causes of infant mortality <eob> in those countries with the highest <eol> infant mortality <eob> is a conversation with mom. <eob>
A health worker asks a mom <eol> who has just lost her child, <eob> "Was the baby vomiting? <eob>
Did they have a fever? <eob> "And that conversation <eol> may take place <eob> as long as three months <eol> after the baby has died. <eob>
Now, put yourself in the shoes <eol> of that mom. <eob>
It's a heartbreaking, <eol> excruciating conversation. <eob>
And even worse -- it's not that helpful, <eob> because we might know there <eol> was a fever or vomiting, <eob> but we don't know why. <eob>
So in the absence of knowing <eol> that knowledge, <eob> we cannot prevent that mom, that family, <eob> or other families in that community <eob> from suffering the same tragedy. <eob>
But what if we applied <eol> a precision public health approach? <eob>
Let's say, for example, <eob> we find out in certain areas of Africa <eob> that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection <eob> transferred from the mother to the baby, <eob> known as Group B streptococcus. <eob> In the absence of treatment, mom <eol> has a seven times higher chance <eob> that her next baby will die. <eob>
Once we define the problem, <eol> we can prevent that death <eob> with something as cheap <eol> and safe as penicillin. <eob>
We can do that because then we'll know. <eob>
And that's the point: <eob> once we know, we can bring <eol> the right interventions <eob> to the right population in the right places <eob> to save lives. <eob>
With this approach, <eol> and with these interventions <eob> and others like them, <eob> I have no doubt <eob> that a precision public health approach <eob> can help our world <eol> achieve our 15-year goal. <eob>
And that would translate <eol> into a million babies' lives saved <eob> every single year. <eob>
One million babies <eob> every single year. <eob>
And why would we stop there? <eob>
A much more powerful <eol> approach to public health -- <eob> imagine what might be possible. <eob>
Why couldn't we more effectively <eol> tackle malnutrition? <eob>
Why wouldn't we prevent <eol> cervical cancer in women? <eob>
And why not eradicate malaria? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yes, clap for that! <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, you know, I live in two <eol> different worlds, <eob> one world populated by scientists, <eob> and another world populated <eol> by public health professionals. <eob>
The promise of precision public health <eob> is to bring these two worlds together. <eob>
But you know, we all live in two worlds: <eob> the rich world and the poor world. <eob>
And what I'm most excited <eol> about about precision public health <eob> is bridging these two worlds. <eob>
Every day in the rich world, <eob> we're bringing incredible talent <eol> and tools -- <eob> everything at our disposal -- <eob> to precisely target diseases <eol> in ways I never imagined <eob> would be possible. <eob>
Surely, we can tap into <eol> that kind of talent and tools <eob> to stop babies dying in the poor world. <eob>
If we did, <eob> then every parent would have the confidence <eob> to name their child the moment <eol> that child is born, <eob> daring to dream that that child's life <eol> will be measured in decades, <eob> not days. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you very much. Good evening. <eob>
Some of you may have noticed <eol> that my last name is Nutt. <eob>
And if you did, <eol> you are forgiven for wondering <eob> how a Nutt managed <eol> to end up in a war zone. <eob>
I actually was offered, right out <eol> of medical school, and accepted <eob> a volunteer contract to work <eol> with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia, <eob> that was worth one dollar. <eob>
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar <eob> in the event that the UN needed <eol> to issue an evacuation order, <eob> so that I would be covered. <eob>
I was, after all, heading into one <eol> of the world's most dangerous places. <eob>
And by now, some of you <eol> may be asking yourselves, <eob> and I just want to reassure you, <eob> that I did get half the money up front. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But you see, this is how, <eol> with 50 cents in my pocket, <eob> I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia. <eob>
Journalists called it the "city of death." <eob> And they called it the city of death <eob> because 300,000 people <eol> had lost their lives there -- <eob> 300,000 people, <eob> mostly as a result <eol> of war-related famine and disease. <eob>
I was part of a team that was tasked <eol> with trying to figure out <eob> how best to respond <eol> to this humanitarian catastrophe. <eob>
It was right on the heels <eol> of the Rwandan genocide, <eob> and aid money to the region was drying up. <eob>
Many aid organizations, unfortunately, <eob> had been forced to close their doors. <eob>
And so the question that I was asked <eol> to specifically help answer, <eob> which is one that aid workers <eol> ask themselves in war zones the world over, <eob> is: What the hell do we do now? <eob> You know, the security environment <eol> in Somalia at that moment in time — <eob> and nothing has really changed too much — <eob> can best be described <eol> as "Mad Max" by way of "A Clockwork Orange." <eob>
And I remember very distinctly <eol> a couple of days after my arrival, <eob> I went up to a feeding clinic. <eob>
There were dozens of women <eol> who were standing in line, <eob> and they were clutching <eol> their infants very close. <eob>
About 20 minutes into <eol> this conversation I was having <eob> with this one young woman, <eob> I leaned forward <eob> and tried to put my finger <eol> in the palm of her baby's hand. <eob>
And when I did this, <eob> I discovered that her baby <eol> was already in rigor. <eob>
She was stiff, <eob> and her little, lifeless hand <eol> was curled into itself. <eob>
She had died hours before <eob> of malnutrition and dehydration. <eob>
I later learned <eol> that as her baby was dying, <eob> this young woman had <eol> been held for two days <eob> by some teenage boys who were armed <eol> with Kalashnikov rifles, <eob> and they were trying <eol> to shake her down for more money, <eob> money she very clearly did not have. <eob>
And this is a scene that I have confronted <eob> in war zones the world over; <eob> places where kids, some as young <eol> as eight -- they are this big -- <eob> and those kids, they have <eol> never been to school. <eob> But they have fought and they have killed <eol> with automatic rifles. <eob>
Is this just the way the world is? <eob>
Some will you tell you <eol> that war is unavoidably human. <eob>
After all, it is as old <eol> as existence itself. <eob>
We say never again, and yet it happens <eol> again and again and again. <eob>
But I will tell you that I have seen <eol> the absolute worst <eob> of what we as human beings <eol> are capable of doing to one another, <eob> and yet I still believe <eol> a different outcome is possible. <eob> Do you want to know why? <eob>
Because over 20 years of doing this work, <eob> going in and out of war zones <eol> around the world, <eob> I have come to understand <eob> that there are aspects of this problem <eob> that we, all of us, as people <eol> occupying this shared space, <eob> that we can change -- <eob> not through force or coercion or invasion, <eob> but by simply looking at all <eol> of the options available to us <eob> and choosing the ones that favor <eol> peace at the expense of war, <eob> instead of war at the expense of peace. <eob>
How so? <eob> Well, I want you to consider this: <eob> there are at least 800 million <eol> small arms and light weapons <eob> in circulation in the world today. <eob>
The vast majority of civilians, <eol> like that young baby, <eob> who are dying in war zones <eol> around the world, <eob> are dying at the hands <eol> of various armed groups <eob> who rely on a near-infinite supply <eol> of cheap, easy and efficient weapons <eob> to rape, threaten, intimidate <eol> and brutalize those civilians <eob> at every turn. <eob> How cheap? <eob> Well, in some parts of the world, <eob> you can buy an AK-47 <eol> for as little as 10 dollars. <eob>
In many places in which I have worked, <eob> it is easier to get access <eol> to an automatic rifle <eob> than it is to get access <eol> to clean drinking water. <eob>
And so now the important part: <eob> Can anything be done about this? <eob>
To answer that question, <eob> let's take a look <eol> at this map of the world. <eob>
And now, let's add in all of the countries <eol> that are currently at war, <eob> and the number of people <eol> who have either died <eob> or have been displaced <eol> as a result of that violence. <eob>
It is a staggering number -- <eob> more than 40 million people. <eob>
But you will also notice <eol> something else about this map. <eob>
You will notice <eol> that most of those countries <eob> are in the Global South. <eob>
Now, let's look at the countries <eob> that are the world's top 20 exporters <eol> of small arms in the world. <eob> And what do we notice? <eob> Well, you see them in green. <eob>
You will notice that those are mostly <eol> countries in the Global North, <eob> primarily Western countries. <eob>
What does this tell us? <eob>
This tells us that most of the people <eol> who are dying in war <eob> are living in poor countries, <eob> and yet most of the people <eol> who are profiting from war <eob> are living in rich countries -- <eol> people like you and me. <eob>
And then what if we go <eol> beyond small arms for a second. <eob>
What if we look at all weapons <eol> in circulation in the world? <eob>
Who does the biggest business? <eob>
Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons <eob> come from none other <eol> than the five permanent members <eob> of the United Nations Security Council, <eob> plus Germany. <eob>
It's shocking, isn't it? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Now, some of you might be saying <eol> at this moment in time, <eob> "Oh yeah, but OK, <eol> hang on a second there ... Nutt." <eob>
Grade school was spectacular for me. <eob> It was, really, a wonderful experience. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But you might be saying to yourselves, <eob> You know, all of these weapons <eol> in war zones -- they're not a cause, <eob> but an effect of the violence <eol> that plagues them <eob> each and every single day. <eob>
You know, places like Iraq <eol> and Afghanistan, <eob> where they need these weapons <eol> to be able to maintain law and order, <eob> promote peace and security, <eol> to combat terror groups -- <eob> surely this is a good thing. <eob>
Let's take a look at that assumption <eol> for just one moment, <eob> because you see there has been <eol> a boom in the small-arms trade <eob> since the start of the War on Terror. <eob>
In fact, it is a business <eol> that has grown threefold <eob> over the past 15 years. <eob>
And now let's compare that <eol> to the number of people <eob> who have directly died <eol> in armed conflict around the world <eob> in that same period. <eob> What do you notice? <eob> Well, you notice that, in fact, <eol> that also goes up <eob> roughly three- to fourfold. <eob>
They basically go up <eol> and end at the same point. <eob>
Now, we can have a circular argument here <eob> about whether this increase <eol> in fatalities is a response <eob> to the increase of small arms, <eol> or the other way around. <eob>
But here's what we should <eol> really take away from this. <eob>
What we should take away from this <eob> is that this is a relationship <eol> worth scrutinizing, <eob> especially when you consider <eol> that small arms that were shipped to Iraq <eob> for use by the Iraqi Army, <eob> or to Syria for so-called <eol> moderate opposition fighters, <eob> that those arms, many of them, <eol> are now in the hands of ISIS; <eob> or when you consider that arms <eol> that were shipped to Libya <eob> are now actively drifting <eol> across the Sahel, <eob> and ending up with groups <eol> like Boko Haram and al Qaeda <eob> and other militant groups. <eob>
And therein lies the problem. <eob>
Because, you see, <eob> small arms anywhere <eol> are a menace everywhere, <eob> because their first stop <eol> is rarely their last. <eob>
Spending on war per person per year <eob> now amounts to about 249 dollars -- <eob> 249 dollars per person, <eob> which is roughly 12 times <eol> what we spend on foreign aid, <eob> money that is used to educate <eol> and vaccinate children <eob> and combat malnutrition <eol> in the Global South. <eob>
But we can shift that balance. <eob> How do we do this? <eob>
Well, it is essentially a problem <eol> of both supply and demand, <eob> so we can tackle it from both sides. <eob>
On the supply side, <eob> we can push our governments <eob> to adopt international arms <eol> transparency mechanisms <eob> like the Arms Trade Treaty, <eob> which makes it so that rich countries <eol> have to be more accountable <eob> for where their arms are going <eob> and what their arms might be used for. <eob>
Here in the United States, <eob> the largest arms-exporting country <eol> in the world by far, <eob> President Obama has rightly signed <eol> the Arms Trade Treaty, <eob> but none of it takes effect, <eol> it isn't binding, <eob> until it is approved <eol> and ratified by the Senate. <eob>
This is where we need <eol> to make our voices heard. <eob>
You know, the curbing of small arms -- <eob> it's not going to solve <eol> the problem of war. <eob>
Increased control mechanisms <eol> won't solve that problem. <eob>
But it's an important step <eol> in the right direction. <eob>
And it's up to all of us <eol> who live in those rich countries <eob> to make change here. <eob>
What about on the demand side? <eob>
You know, there are generations <eol> around the world <eob> who are being lost to war. <eob>
It is possible to disrupt <eol> that cycle of violence <eob> with investments in education, <eol> in strengthening the rule of law <eob> and in economic development, <eol> especially for women. <eob>
I have personally seen <eob> just how incredibly powerful <eol> those kinds of efforts can be <eob> around the world. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> they take time, <eob> which means for you as individuals, <eol> if you want to give, <eob> please, by all means do it. <eob>
But know that how you give <eol> is just as important <eob> as how much you give. <eob>
Regular contributions <eol> like monthly contributions <eob> are a far more effective way of giving, <eob> because they allow <eol> humanitarian organizations <eob> to properly plan and be invested <eol> over the long term, <eob> and to be present in the lives of families <eol> who have been affected by war, <eob> wars that many of us, frankly, <eol> all too quickly forget. <eob>
When I first got on that plane <eol> for Somalia as a young doctor, <eob> I had no idea what it meant <eol> to live with war. <eob>
But I can tell you that I know <eol> what it means now. <eob>
And I know what it means <eob> to lie in bed in the pitch-black night <eob> and listen to that haunting <eol> "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!" <eob> of automatic gunfire, <eob> and wonder with absolute dread <eob> how many minutes I have left <eol> until it will be right on top of me. <eob>
I can tell you that it is a terrifying <eol> and agonizing fear, <eob> one that millions of people <eob> around the world <eob> are forced to confront <eob> each and every single day, <eob> especially children. <eob>
Over the years of doing this work, <eob> unfortunately, war has killed <eol> far too many people close to me. <eob>
And on at least a couple of occasions, <eob> war has very nearly killed me as well. <eob>
But I firmly believe, <eob> which is why I get up and do <eol> what I do every single day, <eob> that we can make different choices here. <eob>
Because you see, <eob> war is ours, <eob> as human beings. <eob>
We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it. <eob>
We are therefore <eol> not powerless to solve it. <eob>
On the contrary, <eob> we are the only ones who can. <eob>
Thank you very much, and I want <eol> to wish you the greatest success. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman <eol> doesn't need much of an introduction, <eob> but TED's audience is global, <eob> it's diverse, <eob> so I've been tasked <eol> with starting with his bio, <eob> which could easily take up <eol> the entire 18 minutes. <eob>
So instead we're going to do 93 years <eol> in 93 seconds or less. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You were born in New Hampshire. <eob>
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut. <eob>
EH: New Haven, Connecticut. <eob>
NL: There goes seven more seconds. <eob>
EH: Nailed it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut. <eob>
Your father was a con man -- <eol> I got that right. <eob>
He was taken away to prison <eol> when you were nine years old. <eob>
You flew 52 missions <eol> as a fighter pilot in World War II. <eob> You came back to -- <eob>
NL: Radio operator. <eob>
EH: You came to LA <eol> to break into Hollywood, <eob> first in publicity, then in TV. <eob>
You had no training as a writer, formally, <eob> but you hustled your way in. <eob>
Your breakthrough, your debut, <eob> was a little show <eol> called "All in the Family." <eob> You followed that up with a string of hits <eob> that to this day is unmatched <eol> in Hollywood: <eob> "Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times," <eob> "The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time," <eob> "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," <eob> to name literally a fraction of them. <eob>
Not only are they all commercially -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Not only are they all commercially successful, <eob> but many of them push our culture forward <eob> by giving the underrepresented <eol> members of society <eob> their first prime-time voice. <eob>
You have seven shows <eol> in the top 10 at one time. <eob>
At one point, <eob> you aggregate an audience <eol> of 120 million people per week <eob> watching your content. <eob>
That's more than the audience <eol> for Super Bowl 50, <eob> which happens once a year. <eob>
NL: Holy shit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
EH: And we're not even <eol> to the holy shit part. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> You land yourself <eol> on Richard Nixon's enemies list -- <eob> he had one. <eob>
That's an applause line, too. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame <eol> on the first day that it exists. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Then came the movies. <eob> "Fried Green Tomatoes," <eob> "The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me," <eob> "This Is Spinal Tap." <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Then you wipe the slate clean, <eob> start a third act as a political activist <eol> focusing on protecting the First Amendment <eob> and the separation of church and state. <eob>
You start People For The American Way. <eob> You buy the Declaration of Independence <eob> and give it back to the people. <eob>
You stay active in both <eol> entertainment and politics <eob> until the ripe old of age of 93, <eob> when you write a book <eob> and make a documentary <eol> about your life story. <eob>
And after all that, <eob> they finally think <eol> you're ready for a TED Talk. <eob>
NL: I love being here. <eob>
And I love you for agreeing to do this. <eob>
EH: Thank you for asking. <eob>
It's my honor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So here's my first question. <eob> Was your mother proud of you? <eob> NL: My mother ... <eob> what a place to start. <eob>
Let me put it this way — <eob> when I came back from the war, <eob> she showed me the letters <eol> that I had written her from overseas, <eob> and they were absolute love letters. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> This really sums up my mother. <eob>
They were love letters, <eob> as if I had written them to -- <eob> they were love letters. <eob>
A year later I asked my mother <eol> if I could have them, <eob> because I'd like to keep them <eol> all the years of my life ... <eob> She had thrown them away. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's my mother. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The best way I can sum it up <eol> in more recent times is -- <eob> this is also more recent times -- <eob> a number of years ago, <eob> when they started the Hall of Fame <eol> to which you referred. <eob>
It was a Sunday morning, <eob> when I got a call from the fellow <eol> who ran the TV Academy of Arts & amp; Sciences. <eob>
He was calling me to tell me <eol> they had met all day yesterday <eob> and he was confidentially telling me <eol> they were going to start a hall of fame <eob> and these were the inductees. <eob>
I started to say "Richard Nixon," <eob> because Richard Nixon — <eob>
EH: I don't think he was on their list. <eob>
NL: William Paley, who started CBS, <eob> David Sarnoff, who started NBC, <eob> Edward R. Murrow, <eob> the greatest of the foreign <eol> correspondents, <eob> Paddy Chayefsky -- <eob> I think the best writer <eol> that ever came out of television -- <eob> Milton Berle, Lucille Ball <eob> and me. <eob>
EH: Not bad. <eob>
NL: I call my mother <eol> immediately in Hartford, Connecticut. <eob> "Mom, this is what's happened, <eob> they're starting a hall of fame." <eob> I tell her the list of names and me, <eob> and she says, <eob> "Listen, if that's what they <eol> want to do, who am I to say?" <eob>
That's my Ma. <eob> I think it earns that kind of a laugh <eob> because everybody has a piece <eol> of that mother. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother <eol> is born, right there. <eob>
So your father also played <eol> a large role in your life, <eob> mostly by his absence. <eob>
NL: Yeah. <eob>
EH: Tell us what happened <eol> when you were nine years old. <eob>
NL: He was flying to Oklahoma <eob> with three guys that my mother said, <eob> "I don't want you to have <eol> anything to do with them, <eob> I don't trust those men." <eob> That's when I heard, <eob> maybe not for the first time, <eob> "Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going." <eob> And he went. <eob>
It turns out he was picking up <eol> some fake bonds, <eob> which he was flying <eol> across the country to sell. <eob>
But the fact that he was going <eol> to Oklahoma in a plane, <eob> and he was going to bring me <eol> back a 10-gallon hat, <eob> just like Ken Maynard, <eol> my favorite cowboy wore. <eob>
You know, this was a few years <eol> after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic. <eob>
I mean, it was exotic <eol> that my father was going there. <eob>
But when he came back, <eob> they arrested him as he got off the plane. <eob>
That night newspapers <eol> were all over the house, <eob> my father was with his hat <eol> in front of his face, <eob> manacled to a detective. <eob>
And my mother was selling the furniture, <eol> because we were leaving -- <eob> she didn't want to stay <eol> in that state of shame, <eob> in Chelsea, Massachusetts. <eob>
And selling the furniture -- <eob> the house was loaded with people. <eob>
And in the middle of all of that, <eob> some strange horse's ass put <eol> his hand on my shoulder and said, <eob> "Well, you're the man <eol> of the house now." <eob> I'm crying, and this asshole says, <eol> "You're the man of the house now." <eob> And I think that was the moment <eob> I began to understand the foolishness <eol> of the human condition. <eob>
So... <eob> it took a lot of years to look back at it <eol> and feel it was a benefit. <eob> But — <eob>
EH: It's interesting <eol> you call it a benefit. <eob>
NL: Benefit in that it gave <eol> me that springboard. <eob>
I mean that I could think <eob> how foolish it was to say <eol> to this crying nine-year-old boy, <eob> "You're the man of the house now." <eob> And then I was crying, and then he said, <eob> "And men of the house don't cry." <eob> And I ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So... <eob> I look back, and I think <eob> that's when I learned the foolishness <eol> of the human condition, <eob> and it's been that gift that I've used. <eob>
EH: So you have a father who's absent, <eob> you have a mother for whom <eol> apparently nothing is good enough. <eob> Do you think that starting out as a kid <eol> who maybe never felt heard <eob> started you down a journey <eob> that ended with you being an adult <eob> with a weekly audience <eol> of 120 million people? <eob>
NL: I love the way you put that question, <eob> because I guess <eol> I've spent my life wanting -- <eob> if anything, wanting to be heard. <eob>
I think -- <eob> It's a simple answer, yes, <eob> that was what sparked -- <eob> well, there were other things, too. <eob>
When my father was away, <eob> I was fooling with a crystal radio set <eol> that we had made together, <eob> and I caught a signal that turned out <eol> to be Father Coughlin. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, somebody laughed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But not funny, <eob> this was a horse's -- <eob> another horse's ass -- <eob> who was very vocal <eol> about hating the New Deal <eob> and Roosevelt and Jews. <eob>
The first time I ran into an understanding <eob> that there were people <eol> in this world that hated me <eob> because I was born to Jewish parents. <eob>
And that had an enormous <eol> effect on my life. <eob>
EH: So you had a childhood <eob> with little in the way <eol> of strong male role models, <eob> except for your grandfather. <eob> Tell us about him. <eob>
NL: Oh, my grandfather. <eob>
Well here's the way I always <eol> talked about that grandfather. <eob>
There were parades, <eob> lots of parades when I was a kid. <eob> There were parades on Veteran's Day -- <eob> there wasn't a President's Day. <eob>
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday, <eob> George Washington's birthday <eob> and Flag Day ... <eob> And lots of little parades. <eob>
My grandfather used to take me <eob> and we'd stand on the street corner, <eob> he'd hold my hand, <eob> and I'd look up and I'd see a tear <eol> running down his eye. <eob>
And he meant a great deal to me. <eob>
And he used to write presidents <eol> of the United States. <eob>
Every letter started, <eob> "My dearest, darling Mr. President," <eob> and he'd tell him something <eol> wonderful about what he did. <eob>
But when he disagreed <eol> with the President, he also wrote, <eob> "My dearest, darling Mr. President, <eob> Didn't I tell you last week...?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And I would run down the stairs every now and then <eob> and pick up the mail. <eob>
We were three flights up, <eob> 74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut. <eob>
And I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, <eol> "Shya C. called at this address." <eob> And that's the story <eol> I have told about my grandfather — <eob>
EH: They wrote him back <eol> on the envelopes -- <eob>
NL: They wrote back. <eob>
But I have shown them myself, <eob> going way back to Phil Donahue <eol> and others before him, <eob> literally dozens of interviews <eol> in which I told that story. <eob>
This will be the second time I have said <eol> the whole story was a lie. <eob>
The truth was my grandfather <eol> took me to parades, <eob> we had lots of those. <eob>
The truth is a tear came down his eye. <eob>
The truth is he would write <eol> an occasional letter, <eob> and I did pick up those little envelopes. <eob>
But <eob> "My dearest <eol> darling Mr. President," <eob> all the rest of it, <eob> is a story I borrowed <eol> from a good friend <eob> whose grandfather was that grandfather <eol> who wrote those letters. <eob>
And, I mean, I stole Arthur <eol> Marshall's grandfather <eob> and made him my own. <eob> Always. <eob>
When I started to write my memoir -- <eob> "Even this --" <eob> How about that? <eob> "Even This I Get to Experience." <eob> When I started to write the memoir <eob> and I started to think about it, <eob> and then I -- <eob> I -- <eob> I did a reasonable amount of crying, <eob> and I realized how much <eol> I needed the father. <eob>
So much so that I appropriated <eol> Arthur Marshall's grandfather. <eob>
So much so, the word "father" — <eob> I have six kids by the way. <eob>
My favorite role in life. <eob>
It and husband to my wife Lyn. <eob>
But I stole the man's identity <eol> because I needed the father. <eob>
Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit <eob> and come out on the other side, <eob> and I forgive my father -- <eob> the best thing I -- <eob> the worst thing I -- <eob> The word I'd like to use about him <eol> and think about him is -- <eob> he was a rascal. <eob>
The fact that he lied <eol> and stole and cheated <eob> and went to prison ... <eob> I submerge that in the word "rascal." <eob>
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs <eol> borrow and professionals steal. <eob>
NL: I'm a pro. <eob>
EH: You're a pro. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that quote is widely <eol> attributed to John Lennon, <eob> but it turns out <eol> he stole it from T.S. Eliot. <eob>
So you're in good company. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EH: I want to talk about your work. <eob>
Obviously the impact of your work <eol> has been written about <eob> and I'm sure you've heard <eol> about it all your life: <eob> what it meant to people, <eob> what it meant to our culture, <eob> you heard the applause when I just <eol> named the names of the shows, <eob> you raised half the people <eol> in the room through your work. <eob>
But have there ever been any stories <eol> about the impact of your work <eob> that surprised you? <eob>
NL: Oh, god -- <eob> surprised me and delighted me <eol> from head to toe. <eob>
There was "An Evening with Norman Lear" <eol> within the last year <eob> that a group of hip-hop impresarios, <eob> performers and the Academy put together. <eob>
The subtext of "An Evening with ..." <eob> was: What do a 92-year-old Jew -- <eob> then 92 -- <eob> and the world of hip-hop have in common? <eob>
Russell Simmons <eol> was among seven on the stage. <eob>
And when he talked about the shows, <eob> he wasn't talking about the Hollywood, <eob> George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons," <eob> or the show that was a number five show. <eob>
He was talking about a simple <eol> thing that made a big -- <eob>
EH: Impact on him? <eob>
NL: An impact on him -- <eob> I was hesitating over the word, "change." <eob> It's hard for me to imagine, <eob> you know, changing somebody's life, <eob> but that's the way he put it. <eob>
He saw George Jefferson <eol> write a check on "The Jeffersons," <eob> and he never knew that a black man <eol> could write a check. <eob>
And he says it just <eol> impacted his life so -- <eob> it changed his life. <eob>
And when I hear things like that -- <eob> little things -- <eob> because I know that there isn't <eol> anybody in this audience <eob> that wasn't likely responsible today for <eol> some little thing they did for somebody, <eob> whether it's as little as a smile <eol> or an unexpected "Hello," <eob> that's how little this thing was. <eob>
It could have been the dresser of the set <eob> who put the checkbook on the thing, <eob> and George had nothing to do while he was speaking, <eol> so he wrote it, <eob> I don't know. <eob> But — <eob>
EH: So in addition to the long list <eol> I shared in the beginning, <eob> I should have also mentioned <eol> that you invented hip-hop. <eob>
NL: Well ... <eob>
EH: I want to talk about — <eob>
NL: Well, then do it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment, <eob> but you've also built a life of meaning. <eob>
And all of us strive to do <eol> both of those things -- <eob> not all of us manage to. <eob>
But even those of us who do manage <eol> to accomplish both of those, <eob> very rarely do we figure out <eol> how to do them together. <eob>
You managed to push culture <eol> forward through your art <eob> while also achieving world-beating <eol> commercial success. <eob>
How did you do both? <eob>
NL: Here's where my mind goes <eol> when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished. <eob>
This planet is one of a billion, <eob> they tell us, <eob> in a universe <eol> of which there are billions -- <eob> billions of universes, <eob> billions of planets ... <eob> which we're trying to save <eob> and it requires saving. <eob>
But... <eob> anything I may have accomplished is — <eob> my sister once asked me what she does <eol> about something <eob> that was going on <eol> in Newington, Connecticut. <eob>
And I said, "Write your alderman <eol> or your mayor or something." <eob> She said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, <eol> I'm Claire Lear." <eob> And that was the first time <eol> I said what I'm saying, <eob> I said, "Claire. With everything you think <eol> about what I may have done <eob> and everything you've done," — <eob> she never left Newington — <eob> "can you get your fingers close enough <eob> when you consider the size of the planet and so forth, <eob> to measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?" <eob> So... <eob> I am convinced we're all responsible <eob> for doing as much as I may have accomplished. <eob>
And I understand what you're saying — <eob>
EH: It's an articulate deflection -- <eob>
NL: But you have to really buy into <eol> the size and scope <eob> of the creator's enterprise, here. <eob>
EH: But here on this planet <eol> you have really mattered. <eob>
NL: I'm a son of a gun. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
EH: So I have one more question for you. <eob>
How old do you feel? <eob>
NL: I am the peer <eol> of whoever I'm talking to. <eob>
EH: Well, I feel 93. <eob>
NL: We out of here? <eob>
EH: Well, I feel 93 <eob> years old, <eob> but I hope to one day feel as young as <eol> the person I'm sitting across from. <eob>
Ladies and gentlemen, <eob> the incomparable Norman Lear. <eob>
NL: Thank you. <eob>
I'm driven by pure passion <eob> to create photographs that tell stories. <eob>
Photography can be described <eol> as the recording of a single moment <eob> frozen within a fraction of time. <eob>
Each moment or photograph <eol> represents a tangible piece <eob> of our memories as time passes. <eob>
But what if you could capture more <eol> than one moment in a photograph? <eob>
What if a photograph <eol> could actually collapse time, <eob> compressing the best moments <eol> of the day and the night <eob> seamlessly into one single image? <eob>
I've created a concept <eol> called "Day to Night" <eob> and I believe it's going to change <eob> the way you look at the world. <eob>
I know it has for me. <eob>
My process begins <eol> by photographing iconic locations, <eob> places that are part of what I call <eol> our collective memory. <eob>
I photograph from a fixed vantage point, <eol> and I never move. <eob>
I capture the fleeting moments <eol> of humanity and light as time passes. <eob>
Photographing for anywhere <eol> from 15 to 30 hours <eob> and shooting over 1,500 images, <eob> I then choose the best moments <eol> of the day and night. <eob>
Using time as a guide, <eob> I seamlessly blend those best <eol> moments into one single photograph, <eob> visualizing our conscious journey with time. <eob>
I can take you to Paris <eob> for a view from the Tournelle Bridge. <eob>
And I can show you the early morning rowers <eob> along the River Seine. <eob>
And simultaneously, <eob> I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night. <eob>
And in between, I can show you <eol> the romance of the City of Light. <eob>
I am essentially a street photographer <eol> from 50 feet in the air, <eob> and every single thing you see <eol> in this photograph <eob> actually happened on this day. <eob>
Day to Night is a global project, <eob> and my work has always been about history. <eob>
I'm fascinated by the concept of going <eol> to a place like Venice <eob> and actually seeing it <eol> during a specific event. <eob>
And I decided I wanted to see <eol> the historical Regata, <eob> an event that's actually been taking <eol> place since 1498. <eob>
The boats and the costumes <eol> look exactly as they did then. <eob>
And an important element that I really <eol> want you guys to understand is: <eob> this is not a timelapse, <eob> this is me photographing <eol> throughout the day and the night. <eob>
I am a relentless collector <eol> of magical moments. <eob>
And the thing that drives me <eol> is the fear of just missing one of them. <eob>
The entire concept came about in 1996. <eob>
LIFE Magazine commissioned me <eol> to create a panoramic photograph <eob> of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet. <eob>
I got to the set and realized: <eol> it's a square. <eob>
So the only way I could actually create <eol> a panoramic was to shoot a collage <eob> of 250 single images. <eob>
So I had DiCaprio <eol> and Claire Danes embracing. <eob>
And as I pan my camera to the right, <eob> I noticed there was a mirror on the wall <eob> and I saw they were actually <eol> reflecting in it. <eob>
And for that one moment, that one image <eob> I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss <eob> for this one picture?" <eob> And then I came back <eol> to my studio in New York, <eob> and I hand-glued these 250 images together <eob> and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool! <eob>
I'm changing time in a photograph." <eob> And that concept actually stayed <eol> with me for 13 years <eob> until technology finally has <eol> caught up to my dreams. <eob>
This is an image I created <eol> of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night. <eob>
And I'm going to show you a little video <eob> that gives you an idea <eol> of what it's like being with me <eob> when I do these pictures. <eob>
To start with, you have to understand <eol> that to get views like this, <eob> most of my time is spent up high, <eol> and I'm usually in a cherry picker <eob> or a crane. <eob>
So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, <eol> non-stop <eob> capturing the entire day unfold. <eob>
One of the things <eol> that's great is I love to people-watch. <eob>
And trust me when I tell you, <eob> this is the greatest seat <eol> in the house to have. <eob>
But this is really how I go <eol> about creating these photographs. <eob>
So once I decide on my view <eol> and the location, <eob> I have to decide where day begins <eol> and night ends. <eob>
And that's what I call the time vector. <eob>
Einstein described time as a fabric. <eob>
Think of the surface of a trampoline: <eob> it warps and stretches with gravity. <eob>
I see time as a fabric as well, <eob> except I take that fabric <eol> and flatten it, compress it into single plane. <eob>
One of the unique aspects <eol> of this work is also, <eob> if you look at all my pictures, <eob> the time vector changes: <eob> sometimes I'll go left to right, <eob> sometimes front to back, <eol> up or down, even diagonally. <eob>
I am exploring the space-time continuum <eob> within a two-dimensional still photograph. <eob>
Now <eob> when I do these pictures, <eob> it's literally like a real-time puzzle <eol> going on in my mind. <eob>
I build a photograph based on time, <eob> and this is what I call the master plate. <eob>
This can take us several months <eol> to complete. <eob>
The fun thing about this work is <eob> I have absolutely zero control <eol> when I get up there <eob> on any given day and capture photographs. <eob>
So I never know who's going <eol> to be in the picture, <eob> if it's going to be a great sunrise <eol> or sunset -- no control. <eob> It's at the end of the process, <eob> if I've had a really great day <eol> and everything remained the same, <eob> that I then decide who's in and who's out, <eob> and it's all based on time. <eob>
I'll take those best moments <eol> that I pick over a month of editing <eob> and they get seamlessly blended <eol> into the master plate. <eob>
I'm compressing the day and night <eob> as I saw it, <eob> creating a unique harmony <eol> between these two very discordant worlds. <eob>
Painting has always been a really <eol> important influence in all my work <eob> and I've always been a huge fan <eol> of Albert Bierstadt, <eob> the great Hudson River School painter. <eob>
He inspired a recent series <eol> that I did on the National Parks. <eob>
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley. <eob>
So this is the photograph <eol> I created of Yosemite. <eob>
This is actually the cover story <eol> of the 2016 January issue <eob> of National Geographic. <eob>
I photographed for over 30 hours <eol> in this picture. <eob>
I was literally on the side of a cliff, <eob> capturing the stars <eol> and the moonlight as it transitions, <eob> the moonlight lighting El Capitan. <eob>
And I also captured this transition <eol> of time throughout the landscape. <eob>
The best part is obviously seeing <eol> the magical moments of humanity <eob> as time changed -- <eob> from day into night. <eob>
And on a personal note, <eob> I actually had a photocopy <eol> of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket. <eob>
And when that sun started <eol> to rise in the valley, <eob> I started to literally shake <eol> with excitement <eob> because I looked at the painting <eol> and I go, <eob> "Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting <eob> 100 years earlier." <eob>
Day to Night is about all the things, <eob> it's like a compilation <eol> of all the things I love <eob> about the medium <eol> of photography. <eob>
It's about landscape, <eob> it's about street photography, <eob> it's about color, <eol> it's about architecture, <eob> perspective, scale -- and, especially, history. <eob>
This is one of the most historical <eol> moments <eob> I've been able to photograph, <eob> the 2013 Presidential Inauguration <eol> of Barack Obama. <eob>
And if you look closely in this picture, <eob> you can actually see time changing <eob> in those large television sets. <eob>
You can see Michelle <eol> waiting with the children, <eob> the president now greets the crowd, <eob> he takes his oath, <eob> and now he's speaking to the people. <eob>
There's so many challenging aspects <eol> when I create photographs like this. <eob>
For this particular photograph, <eob> I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air <eob> and it was not very stable. <eob>
So every time my assistant <eol> and I shifted our weight, <eob> our horizon line shifted. <eob>
So for every picture you see, <eob> and there were about 1,800 in this picture, <eob> we both had to tape our feet into position <eob> every time I clicked the shutter. <eob> I've learned so many extraordinary things <eol> doing this work. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I think the two most important <eol> are patience <eob> and the power of observation. <eob>
When you photograph <eol> a city like New York from above, <eob> I discovered that those people in cars <eob> that I sort of live with everyday, <eob> they don't look like people <eol> in cars anymore. <eob>
They feel like a giant school of fish, <eob> it was a form of emergent behavior. <eob>
And when people describe <eol> the energy of New York, <eob> I think this photograph begins to really capture that. <eob>
When you look closer in my work, <eob> you can see there's stories going on. <eob>
You realize that Times Square is a canyon, <eob> it's shadow and it's sunlight. <eob>
So I decided, in this photograph, <eol> I would checkerboard time. <eob>
So wherever the shadows are, it's night <eob> and wherever the sun is, <eol> it's actually day. <eob>
Time is this extraordinary thing <eob> that we never can really <eol> wrap our heads around. <eob>
But in a very unique and special way, <eob> I believe these photographs <eol> begin to put a face on time. <eob>
They embody a new metaphysical visual reality. <eob>
When you spend 15 hours <eol> looking at a place, <eob> you're going to see <eol> things a little differently <eob> than if you or I walked up with our camera, <eob> took a picture, and then walked away. <eob>
This was a perfect example. <eob>
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie." <eob> I watched over 15 hours <eob> all these people not even look <eol> at Sacré-Coeur. <eob>
They were more interested <eol> in using it as a backdrop. <eob>
They would walk up, take a picture, <eob> and then walk away. <eob>
And I found this to be <eol> an absolutely extraordinary example, <eob> a powerful disconnect between what we think <eol> the human experience is <eob> versus what the human experience <eol> is evolving into. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> The act of sharing <eol> has suddenly become more important <eob> than the experience itself. <eob>
And finally, my most recent image, <eob> which has such a special <eol> meaning for me personally: <eob> this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. <eob>
And this is photographed <eol> in the middle of the Seronera, <eob> this is not a reserve. <eob>
I went specifically during the peak migration <eob> to hopefully capture <eol> the most diverse range of animals. <eob>
Unfortunately, when we got there, <eob> there was a drought going on <eol> during the peak migration, <eob> a five-week drought. <eob> So all the animals <eol> were drawn to the water. <eob>
I found this one watering hole, <eob> and felt if everything remained <eol> the same way it was behaving, <eob> I had a real opportunity <eol> to capture something unique. <eob>
We spent three days studying it, <eob> and nothing could have prepared me <eob> for what I witnessed during our shoot day. <eob>
I photographed for 26 hours <eob> in a sealed crocodile blind, <eol> 18 feet in the air. <eob>
What I witnessed was unimaginable. <eob>
Frankly, it was Biblical. <eob>
We saw, for 26 hours, <eob> all these competitive species share <eol> a single resource called water. <eob>
The same resource <eol> that humanity is supposed to have wars over <eob> during the next 50 years. <eob>
The animals never even grunted <eol> at each other. <eob>
They seem to understand <eol> something that we humans don't. <eob> That this precious resource called water <eob> is something we all have to share. <eob>
When I created this picture, <eob> I realized that Day to Night <eol> is really a new way of seeing, <eob> compressing time, <eob> exploring the space-time continuum <eol> within a photograph. <eob>
As technology evolves along with photography, <eob> photographs will not only communicate <eol> a deeper meaning of time and memory, <eob> but they will compose a new narrative <eol> of untold stories, <eob> creating a timeless window <eol> into our world. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What is it that French people do better <eol> than all the others? <eob>
If you would take polls, <eob> the top three answers might be: <eob> love, wine and whining. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Maybe. <eob> But let me suggest a fourth one: <eob> mathematics. <eob>
Did you know that Paris <eol> has more mathematicians <eob> than any other city in the world? <eob>
And more streets <eol> with mathematicians' names, too. <eob>
And if you look at the statistics <eol> of the Fields Medal, <eob> often called the Nobel Prize <eol> for mathematics, <eob> and always awarded to mathematicians <eol> below the age of 40, <eob> you will find that France <eol> has more Fields medalists per inhabitant <eob> than any other country. <eob>
What is it that we find so sexy in math? <eob>
After all, it seems to be dull <eol> and abstract, <eob> just numbers and computations <eol> and rules to apply. <eob>
Mathematics may be abstract, <eob> but it's not dull <eob> and it's not about computing. <eob>
It is about reasoning <eob> and proving our core activity. <eob>
It is about imagination, <eob> the talent which we most praise. <eob>
It is about finding the truth. <eob>
There's nothing like the feeling <eol> which invades you <eob> when after months of hard thinking, <eob> you finally understand the right reasoning <eol> to solve your problem. <eob>
The great mathematician André <eol> Weil likened this -- <eob> no kidding -- <eob> to sexual pleasure. <eob>
But noted that this feeling <eol> can last for hours, or even days. <eob>
The reward may be big. <eob>
Hidden mathematical truths <eol> permeate our whole physical world. <eob>
They are inaccessible to our senses <eob> but can be seen <eol> through mathematical lenses. <eob>
Close your eyes for moment <eob> and think of what is occurring <eol> right now around you. <eob>
Invisible particles from the air <eol> around are bumping on you <eob> by the billions <eol> and billions at each second, <eob> all in complete chaos. <eob>
And still, <eob> their statistics can be accurately <eol> predicted by mathematical physics. <eob>
And open your eyes now <eob> to the statistics of the velocities of these particles. <eob>
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve, <eob> or the Law of Errors -- <eob> of deviations with respect <eol> to the mean behavior. <eob>
This curve tells about the statistics <eol> of velocities of particles <eob> in the same way as a demographic curve <eob> would tell about the statistics <eol> of ages of individuals. <eob>
It's one of the most important <eol> curves ever. <eob>
It keeps on occurring again and again, <eob> from many theories and many experiments, <eob> as a great example of the universality <eob> which is so dear to us mathematicians. <eob>
Of this curve, <eob> the famous scientist <eol> Francis Galton said, <eob> "It would have been deified <eol> by the Greeks if they had known it. <eob> It is the supreme law of unreason." <eob> And there's no better way <eol> to materialize that supreme goddess than Galton's Board. <eob>
Inside this board <eol> are narrow tunnels <eob> through which tiny balls <eol> will fall down randomly, <eob> going right or left, or left, etc. <eob> All in complete randomness and chaos. <eob>
Let's see what happens <eol> when we look at all these random trajectories together. <eob>
(Board shaking) <eob>
This is a bit of a sport, <eob> because we need to resolve <eol> some traffic jams in there. <eob> Aha. <eob> We think that randomness is going <eol> to play me a trick on stage. <eob>
There it is. <eob> Our supreme goddess of unreason. <eob> the Gauss Curve, <eob> trapped here inside this transparent box <eol> as Dream in "The Sandman" comics. <eob>
For you I have shown it, <eob> but to my students I explain <eol> why it could not be any other curve. <eob>
And this is touching the mystery <eol> of that goddess, <eob> replacing a beautiful coincidence <eol> by a beautiful explanation. <eob>
All of science is like this. <eob>
And beautiful mathematical explanations <eol> are not only for our pleasure. <eob>
They also change our vision of the world. <eob>
For instance, <eob> Einstein, <eob> Perrin, <eob> Smoluchowski, <eob> they used the mathematical analysis <eol> of random trajectories <eob> and <eob> the Gauss Curve <eob> to explain and prove that our world <eol> is made of atoms. <eob>
It was not the first time <eob> that mathematics was revolutionizing <eol> our view of the world. <eob>
More than 2,000 years ago, <eob> at the time of the ancient Greeks, <eob> it already occurred. <eob>
In those days, <eob> only a small fraction of the world <eol> had been explored, <eob> and the Earth might have seemed infinite. <eob>
But clever Eratosthenes, <eob> using mathematics, <eob> was able to measure the Earth <eol> with an amazing accuracy of two percent. <eob>
Here's another example. <eob> In 1673, Jean Richer noticed <eob> that a pendulum swings slightly slower <eol> in Cayenne than in Paris. <eob>
From this observation alone, and clever mathematics, <eob> Newton rightly deduced <eob> that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles, <eob> like 0.3 percent -- <eob> so tiny that you wouldn't even notice it <eol> on the real view of the Earth. <eob>
These stories show that mathematics <eob> is able to make us go out of our intuition <eob> measure the Earth which seems infinite, <eob> see atoms which are invisible <eob> or detect an imperceptible <eol> variation of shape. <eob>
And if there is just one thing <eol> that you should take home from this talk, <eob> it is this: <eob> mathematics allows us <eol> to go beyond the intuition <eob> and explore territories <eol> which do not fit within our grasp. <eob>
Here's a modern example <eol> you will all relate to: <eob> searching the Internet. <eob>
The World Wide Web, <eob> more than one billion web pages -- <eob> do you want to go through them all? <eob>
Computing power helps, <eob> but it would be useless <eol> without the mathematical modeling <eob> to find the information hidden in the data. <eob>
Let's work out a baby problem. <eob> Imagine that you're a detective <eol> working on a crime case, <eob> and there are many people <eol> who have their version of the facts. <eob>
Who do you want to interview first? <eob>
Sensible answer: <eob> prime witnesses. <eob>
You see, <eob> suppose that there is person <eol> number seven, <eob> tells you a story, <eob> but when you ask where he got if from, <eob> he points to person number three as a source. <eob>
And maybe person number three, in turn, <eob> points at person number one <eol> as the primary source. <eob>
Now number one is a prime witness, <eob> so I definitely want to interview him -- <eol> priority. <eob>
And from the graph <eob> we also see that person number four <eol> is a prime witness. <eob>
And maybe I even want <eol> to interview him first, <eob> because there are more people <eol> who refer to him. <eob>
OK, that was easy, <eob> but now what about if you have a big bunch <eol> of people who will testify? <eob>
And this graph, <eob> I may think of it as all people who testify <eol> in a complicated crime case, <eob> but it may just as well be web pages <eol> pointing to each other, <eob> referring to each other for contents. <eob>
Which ones are the most authoritative? <eob> Not so clear. <eob>
Enter PageRank, <eob> one of the early cornerstones of Google. <eob>
This algorithm uses <eol> the laws of mathematical randomness <eob> to determine automatically <eol> the most relevant web pages, <eob> in the same way as we used randomness <eol> in the Galton Board experiment. <eob>
So let's send into this graph <eob> a bunch of tiny, digital marbles <eob> and let them go randomly <eol> through the graph. <eob>
Each time they arrive at some site, <eob> they will go out through some link <eol> chosen at random to the next one. <eob> And again, and again, and again. <eob>
And with small, growing piles, <eob> we'll keep the record <eol> of how many times each site has been visited <eob> by these digital marbles. <eob>
Here we go. <eob> Randomness, randomness. <eob> And from time to time, <eob> also let's make jumps completely randomly <eol> to increase the fun. <eob>
And look at this: <eob> from the chaos will emerge the solution. <eob>
The highest piles <eol> correspond to those sites <eob> which somehow are better connected <eol> than the others, <eob> more pointed at than the others. <eob>
And here we see clearly <eob> which are the web pages <eol> we want to first try. <eob>
Once again, <eob> the solution emerges from the randomness. <eob>
Of course, since that time, <eob> Google has come up with much <eol> more sophisticated algorithms, <eob> but already this was beautiful. <eob>
And still, <eob> just one problem in a million. <eob>
With the advent of digital area, <eob> more and more problems lend themselves <eol> to mathematical analysis, <eob> making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one, <eob> to the extent that a few years ago, <eob> it was ranked number one <eol> among hundreds of jobs <eob> in a study about the best <eol> and worst jobs <eob> published by the Wall Street Journal in 2009. <eob>
Mathematician -- <eob> best job in the world. <eob>
That's because of the applications: <eob> communication theory, <eob> information theory, <eob> game theory, <eob> compressed sensing, <eob> machine learning, <eob> graph analysis, <eob> harmonic analysis. <eob>
And why not stochastic processes, <eob> linear programming, <eob> or fluid simulation? <eob>
Each of these fields have monster <eol> industrial applications. <eob>
And through them, <eob> there is big money in <eob> mathematics. <eob>
And let me concede <eob> that when it comes to making <eol> money from the math, <eob> the Americans are by a long shot the world champions, <eob> with clever, emblematic billionaires <eol> and amazing, giant companies, <eob> all resting, ultimately, on good algorithm. <eob>
Now with all this beauty, usefulness <eol> and wealth, <eob> mathematics does look more sexy. <eob>
But don't you think <eob> that the life a mathematical <eol> researcher is an easy one. <eob>
It is filled with perplexity, <eob> frustration, <eob> a desperate fight for understanding. <eob>
Let me evoke for you <eob> one of the most striking days <eol> in my mathematician's life. <eob>
Or should I say, <eob> one of the most striking nights. <eob>
At that time, <eob> I was staying at the Institute <eol> for Advanced Studies in Princeton -- <eob> for many years, the home of Albert Einstein <eob> and arguably the most holy place <eol> for mathematical research in the world. <eob>
And that night I was working <eol> and working on an elusive proof, <eob> which was incomplete. <eob>
It was all about understanding <eob> the paradoxical stability <eol> property of plasmas, <eob> which are a crowd <eol> of electrons. <eob>
In the perfect world of plasma, <eob> there are no collisions <eob> and no friction to provide <eol> the stability like we are used to. <eob>
But still, <eob> if you slightly perturb <eol> a plasma equilibrium, <eob> you will find that the resulting electric field <eob> spontaneously vanishes, <eob> or damps out, <eob> as if by some mysterious <eol> friction force. <eob>
This paradoxical effect, <eob> called the Landau damping, <eob> is one of the most important <eol> in plasma physics, <eob> and it was discovered <eol> through mathematical ideas. <eob>
But still, <eob> a full mathematical understanding <eol> of this phenomenon was missing. <eob>
And together with my former student <eol> and main collaborator Clément Mouhot, <eob> in Paris at the time, <eob> we had been working for months <eol> and months on such a proof. <eob>
Actually, <eob> I had already announced <eol> by mistake that we could solve it. <eob>
But the truth is, <eob> the proof was just not working. <eob>
In spite of more than 100 pages <eol> of complicated, mathematical arguments, <eob> and a bunch discoveries, <eob> and huge calculation, <eob> it was not working. <eob>
And that night in Princeton, <eob> a certain gap in the chain <eol> of arguments was driving me crazy. <eob>
I was putting in there all my energy <eol> and experience and tricks, <eob> and still nothing was working. <eob> 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., <eob> not working. <eob>
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits. <eob>
Then a few hours later, <eob> waking up and go, <eob> "Ah, it's time to get <eol> the kids to school --" <eob> What is this? <eob>
There was this voice in my head, I swear. <eob> "Take the second term to the other side, <eob> Fourier transform and invert in L2." <eob>
Damn it, <eob> that was the start of the solution! <eob>
You see, <eob> I thought I had taken some rest, <eob> but really my brain <eol> had continued to work on it. <eob>
In those moments, <eob> you don't think of your career <eol> or your colleagues, <eob> it's just a complete battle <eol> between the problem and you. <eob>
That being said, <eob> it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work. <eob>
And after we completed our huge analysis <eol> of the Landau damping, <eob> I was lucky enough <eob> to get the most coveted Fields Medal <eob> from the hands of the President of India, <eob> in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 -- <eob> an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream, <eob> a day that I will remember <eol> until I live. <eob>
What do you think, <eob> on such an occasion? <eob> Pride, yes? <eob> And gratitude to the many collaborators <eol> who made this possible. <eob>
And because it was a collective adventure, <eob> you need to share it, not just <eol> with your collaborators. <eob>
I believe that everybody can appreciate <eol> the thrill of mathematical research, <eob> and share the passionate stories <eol> of humans and ideas behind it. <eob>
And I've been working with my staff <eol> at Institut Henri Poincaré, <eob> together with partners and artists <eol> of mathematical communication worldwide, <eob> so that we can found our own, <eol> very special museum of mathematics there. <eob>
So in a few years, <eob> when you come to Paris, <eob> after tasting the great, crispy baguette <eol> and macaroon, <eob> please come and visit us <eol> at Institut Henri Poincaré, <eob> and share the mathematical dream with us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The world is filled with incredible objects <eob> and rich cultural heritage. <eob>
And when we get access to them, <eob> we are blown away, <eol> we fall in love. <eob> But most of the time, <eob> the world's population <eol> is living without real access to arts and culture. <eob>
What might the connections be when <eol> we start exploring our heritage, <eob> the beautiful locations <eol> and the art in this world? <eob>
Before we get started in this presentation, <eob> I just want to take care <eol> of a few housekeeping points. <eob>
First, I am no expert in art or culture. <eob>
I fell into this by mistake, <eol> but I'm loving it. <eob>
Secondly, all of what I'm going to show you <eob> belongs to the amazing museums, <eol> archives and foundations <eob> that we partner with. <eob>
None of this belongs to Google. <eob>
And finally, what you see behind me <eob> is available right now <eol> on your mobile phones, <eob> on your laptops. <eob>
This is our current platform, <eol> where you can explore <eob> thousands of museums <eol> and objects at your fingertips, <eob> in extremely high-definition detail. <eob>
The diversity of the content <eol> is what's amazing. <eob>
If we just had European paintings, <eob> if we just had modern art, <eob> I think it gets a bit boring. <eob>
For example, this month, <eol> we launched the "Black History" channel <eob> with 82 curated exhibitions, <eob> which talk about arts and culture <eol> in that community. <eob>
We also have some amazing objects from Japan, <eob> centered around craftsmanship, <eol> called "Made in Japan." <eob> And one of my favorite exhibitions, <eob> which actually is the idea of my talk, <eob> is -- I didn't expect to become <eol> a fan of Japanese dolls. <eob>
But I am, thanks to this exhibition, <eob> that has really taught me <eol> about the craftsmanship <eob> behind the soul of a Japanese doll. <eob>
Trust me, it's very exciting. <eob>
Take my word for it. <eob>
So, moving on swiftly. <eob> One quick thing I wanted to showcase <eol> in this platform, <eob> which you can share with your kids <eol> and your friends right now, <eob> is you can travel to all these amazing <eol> institutions virtually, as well. <eob>
One of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York, <eob> where you can get a taste <eol> of what it might feel like <eob> to actually be there. <eob>
You can go to the ground floor <eob> and obviously, most of you, <eol> I assume, have been there. <eob>
And you can see the architectural <eol> masterpiece that it is. <eob>
But imagine this accessibility <eol> for a kid in Bombay <eob> who's studying architecture, <eob> who hasn't had a chance to go <eol> to The Guggenheim as yet. <eob>
You can obviously look <eol> at objects in the Guggenheim Museum, <eob> you can obviously get into them <eol> and so on and so forth. <eob>
There's a lot of information here. <eob>
But this is not the purpose <eol> of my talk today. <eob>
This exists right now. <eob>
What we now have are the building blocks <eol> to a very exciting future, <eob> when it comes to arts and culture <eob> and accessibility to arts and culture. <eob>
So I am joined today onstage <eol> by my good friend and artist in residence <eob> at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne, <eob> who is the professor of interactive design <eob> at ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland. <eob>
What Cyril and our team <eol> of engineers have been doing <eob> is trying to find these connections <eol> and visualize a few of these. <eob>
So I'm going to go quite quick now. <eob>
This object you see behind me -- <eol> oh, just clarification: <eob> Always, seeing the real thing is better. <eob>
In case people think I'm trying <eol> to replicate the real thing. <eob> So, moving on. <eob> This object you see behind me <eol> is the Venus of Berekhat Ram. <eob>
It's one of the oldest objects <eol> in the world, <eob> found in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago, <eob> and currently residing at the Israel <eol> Museum in Jerusalem. <eob>
It is also one of the oldest objects <eol> on our platform. <eob>
So let's zoom. <eob> We start from this one object. <eob>
What if we zoomed out <eob> and actually tried to experience <eol> our own cultural big bang? <eob>
What might that look like? <eob>
This is what we deal with <eol> on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute -- <eob> over six million cultural artifacts curated <eol> and given to us by institutions, <eob> to actually make these connections. <eob>
You can travel through time, <eob> you can understand more about our society <eol> through these. <eob>
You can look at it <eol> from the perspective of our planet, <eob> and try to see how it might look <eol> without borders, <eob> if we just organized art and culture. <eob>
We can also then plot it by time, <eob> which obviously, for the data <eol> geek in me, is very fascinating. <eob>
You can spend hours <eol> looking at every decade <eob> and the contributions <eol> in that decade and in those years <eob> for art, history and cultures. <eob>
We would love to spend hours <eol> showing you each and every decade, <eob> but we don't have the time right now. <eob>
So you can go on your phone <eol> and actually do it yourself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But if you don't mind and can hold <eol> your applause till later, <eob> I don't want to run out of time, <eob> because I want to show you <eol> a lot of cool stuff. <eob>
So, just very quickly: <eob> you can move on from here <eol> to another very interesting idea. <eob>
Beyond the pretty picture, <eob> beyond the nice visualization, <eob> what is the purpose, how is this useful? <eob>
This next idea comes <eol> from discussions with curators <eob> that we've been having at museums, <eob> who, by the way, <eol> I've fallen in love with, <eob> because they dedicate their whole life <eol> to try to tell these stories. <eob>
One of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like <eob> if you could create <eol> a virtual curator's table <eob> where all these six million objects <eob> are displayed in a way for us <eol> to look at the connections between them?" <eob> You can spend a lot of time, trust me, <eol> looking at different objects <eob> and understanding where they come from. <eob>
It's a crazy Matrix experience. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just moving on, <eob> let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh, <eob> who is very well-represented <eol> on this platform. <eob>
Thanks to the diversity <eol> of the institutions we have, <eob> we have over 211 high-definition, <eol> amazing artworks by this artist, <eob> now organized in one beautiful view. <eob>
And as it resolves, <eol> and as Cyril goes deeper, <eob> you can see all the self-portraits, <eob> you can see still life. <eob>
But I just wanted to highlight <eol> one very quick example, <eob> which is very timely: <eob> "The Bedroom." <eob> This is an artwork <eol> where three copies exist -- <eob> one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, <eob> one at the Orsay in Paris <eob> and one at the Art Institute of Chicago, <eob> which, actually, currently is hosting a reunion <eob> of all three artworks physically, <eob> I think only for the second time ever. <eob>
But, it is united digitally and virtually <eol> for anybody to look at <eob> in a very different way, <eob> and you won't get pushed <eol> in the line in the crowd. <eob>
So let's take you and let's travel <eol> through <eob> "The Bedroom" <eob> very quickly, <eob> so you can experience what we are doing <eol> for every single object. <eob>
We want the image to speak <eol> as much as it can <eob> on a digital platform. <eob>
And all you need is an internet <eol> connection and a computer <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly. <eob>
I'm sorry, this is all live, <eob> so you have to give Cyril a little bit of -- <eob> and this is available <eol> for every object: <eob> modern art, contemporary art, Renaissance -- <eol> you name it, <eob> even sculpture. <eob>
Sometimes, you don't know <eol> what can attract you <eob> to an artwork or to a museum <eol> or to a cultural discovery. <eob>
So for me, personally, <eol> it was quite a challenge <eob> because when I decided <eol> to make this my full-time job at Google, <eob> my mother was not very supportive. <eob>
I love my mother, <eob> but she thought I was wasting <eol> my life with this museum stuff. <eob>
And for her, a museum is what you do <eol> when you go on vacation <eob> and you tick-mark and it's over, right? <eob>
And it took around four and a half years <eob> for me to convince my lovely Indian mother <eob> that actually, this is worthwhile. <eob>
And the way I did it was, I realized one day <eol> that she loves gold. <eob>
So I started showing her all objects <eol> that have the material gold in them. <eob>
And the first thing my mom asks me is, <eob> "How can we buy these?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And obviously, my salary <eol> is not that high, <eob> so I was like, "We can't actually <eol> do that, mom. <eob> But you can explore them virtually." <eob> And so now my mom — every time I meet her, she asks me, <eob> "Any more gold, any more silver in your project? <eob>
Can you show me? <eob> "And that's the idea <eol> I'm trying to illustrate. <eob>
It does not matter how you get in, <eob> as long as you get in. <eob>
Once you get in, you're hooked. <eob>
Moving on from here very quickly, <eob> there is kind of a playful idea, actually, <eob> to illustrate the point of access, <eob> and I'm going to go quite quickly <eol> on this one. <eob>
We all know that seeing the artwork <eol> in person is amazing. <eob>
But we also know that most of us <eol> can't do it, <eob> and the ones that can afford to do it, <eol> it's complicated. <eob>
So -- Cyril, can we load up our art <eol> trip, what do we call it? <eob>
We don't have a good name for this. <eob>
But essentially, we have around <eol> 1,000 amazing institutions, <eob> 68 countries. <eob> But let's start with Rembrandt. <eob> We might have time <eol> for only one example. <eob>
But thanks to the diversity, <eob> we've got around 500 amazing <eol> Rembrandt object artworks <eob> from 46 institutions <eol> and 17 countries. <eob>
Let's say that on your next vacation, <eob> you want to go see <eol> every single one of them. <eob>
That is your itinerary, <eob> you will probably travel <eol> 53,000 kilometers, <eob> visit around, I think, 46 institutions, <eob> and just FYI, <eol> you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But remember, it's art, <eob> so you can justify it, <eol> perhaps, in some way. <eob>
Moving on swiftly from here, <eob> is something a little bit more <eol> technical and more interesting. <eob>
All that we've shown you so far <eol> uses metadata to make the connections. <eob>
But obviously we have something cool nowadays <eob> that everyone likes to talk <eol> about, which is machine learning. <eob>
So what we thought is, let's strip <eol> out all the metadata, <eob> let's look at what machine learning can do <eob> based purely on visual recognition <eol> of this entire collection. <eob>
What we ended up with <eol> is this very interesting map, <eob> these clusters that have no reference <eol> point information, <eob> but has just used visuals <eol> to cluster things together. <eob>
Each cluster is an art to us <eol> by itself of discovery. <eob>
But one of the clusters we want <eol> to show you very quickly <eob> is this amazing cluster of portraits <eob> that we found from museums <eol> around the world. <eob>
If you could zoom in a little bit <eol> more, Cyril. <eob>
Just to show you, you can just travel <eol> through portraits. <eob>
And essentially, you can do nature, <eol> you can do horses <eob> and clusters galore. <eob>
When we saw all these portraits, <eob> we were like, "Hey, can we do <eol> something fun for kids, <eob> or can we do something playful <eob> to get people interested in portraits?" <eob> Because I haven't really seen <eob> young kids really excited <eol> to go to a portrait gallery. <eob>
I wanted to try to figure something out. <eob>
So we created something <eol> called the portrait matcher. <eob>
It's quite self-explanatory, <eob> so I'm just going to let Cyril show <eol> his beautiful face. <eob>
And essentially what's happening <eol> is, with the movement of his head, <eob> we are matching different portraits <eol> around the world from museums. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I don't know about you, <eob> but I've shown it to my nephew and sister, <eob> and the reaction is just phenomenal. <eob>
All they ask me is, <eol> "When can we go see this?" <eob> And by the way, if we're nice, <eob> maybe, Cyril, you can smile <eol> and find a happy one? <eob> Oh, perfect. <eob> By the way, this is not rehearsed. <eob> Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow. <eob> OK, let's move on; otherwise, <eol> this will just take the whole time. <eob>
So, art and culture <eol> can be fun also, right? <eob>
For our last quick experiment -- <eob> we call all of these "experiments" -- <eob> our last quick experiment comes back <eol> to machine learning. <eob>
We show you clusters, visual clusters, <eob> but what if we could ask the machine <eol> to also name these clusters? <eob>
What if it could automatically tag them, <eol> using no actual metadata? <eob>
So what we have is this <eol> kind of explorer, <eob> where we have managed <eol> to match, I think, around 4,000 labels. <eob>
And we haven't really done anything <eol> special here, <eob> just fed the collection. <eob>
And we found interesting categories. <eob>
We can start with horses, <eol> a very straightforward category. <eob>
You would expect to see <eol> that the machine has put <eob> images of horses, right? <eob>
And it has, but you also notice, <eol> right over there, <eob> that it has a very abstract image <eob> that it has still managed to recognize <eol> and cluster as horses. <eob>
We also have an amazing head <eol> in terms of a horse. <eob>
And each one has the tags <eol> as to why it got categorized in this. <eob>
So let's move to another one <eol> which I found very funny and interesting, <eob> because I don't understand <eol> how this category came up. <eob>
It's called "Lady in Waiting." <eob> If, Cyril, you do it very quickly, <eob> you will see that we have <eol> these amazing images <eob> of ladies, I guess, in waiting <eol> or posing. <eob>
I don't really understand it. <eob>
But I've been trying to ask <eol> my museum contacts, <eob> you know, "What is this? <eob>
What's going on here? <eob> "And it's fascinating. <eob>
Coming back to gold very quickly, <eob> I wanted to search for gold <eob> and see how the machine <eol> tagged all the gold. <eob>
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold. <eob>
We are living in popular times. <eob>
It tags it as "bling-bling." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm being hard on Cyril, <eol> because I'm moving too fast. <eob>
Essentially, here you have <eol> all the bling-bling <eob> of the world's museums organized for you. <eob>
And finally, to end this talk <eol> and these experiments, <eob> what I hope you feel after this <eol> talk is happiness and emotion. <eob>
And what would we see <eol> when we see happiness? <eob>
If we actually look at all the objects <eob> that have been tagged under "happiness," <eob> you would expect happiness, I guess. <eob>
But there was one that came up <eol> that was very fascinating and interesting, <eob> which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland, <eob> our friend and artist in residence as well, <eob> called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain." <eob> I don't know why the machine feels <eol> like it misses its pre-Internet brain <eob> and it's been tagged here, <eob> but it's a very interesting thought. <eob>
I sometimes do miss <eol> my pre-Internet brain, <eob> but not when it comes to exploring <eol> arts and culture online. <eob>
So take out your phones, <eol> take out your computers, <eob> go visit museums. <eob>
And just a quick call-out <eol> to all the amazing archivists, <eob> historians, curators, <eob> who are sitting in museums, <eol> preserving all this culture. <eob> And the least we can do is get <eol> our daily dose of art and culture <eob> for ourselves and our kids. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever been asked <eol> by your Chinese friend, <eob> "What is your zodiac sign?" <eob> Don't think they are making small talk. <eob>
If you say, "I'm a Monkey," <eob> they immediately know <eob> you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way <eol> of asking your age. <eob>
By revealing your zodiac sign, <eol> you are also being evaluated. <eob>
Judgments are being made <eol> about your fortune or misfortune, <eob> your personality, career prospects <eob> and how you will do in a given year. <eob>
If you share you and your partner's animal signs, <eob> they will paint a picture in <eol> their mind about your private life. <eob>
Maybe you don't believe <eol> in the Chinese zodiac. <eob>
As a quarter of the world population <eol> is influenced by it, <eob> you'd be wise to do something about that. <eob>
So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly? <eob>
Most Westerners think <eol> of Greco-Roman zodiac, <eob> the signs divided into 12 months. <eob>
The Chinese zodiac is different. <eob>
It's a 12-year cycle <eol> labeled with animals, <eob> starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, <eob> and has no association with constellations. <eob>
For example, if you were born <eol> in 1975, you are a Rabbit. <eob>
Can you see your zodiac sign there? <eob>
Our Chinese ancestors constructed <eol> a very complicated theoretical framework <eob> based on yin and yang, <eol> the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. <eob>
Over thousands of years, <eob> this popular culture <eol> has affected people's major decisions, <eob> such as naming, marriage, <eol> giving birth and attitude towards each other. <eob>
And some of the implications <eol> are quite amazing. <eob>
The Chinese believe certain animals <eol> get on better than the others. <eob>
So parents choose specific years <eol> to give birth to babies, <eob> because they believe the team effort <eol> by the right combination of animals <eob> can give prosperity to families. <eob>
We even refer to the zodiac <eol> when entering into romantic relations. <eob>
I'm a Pig; I should have <eol> perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. <eob>
Chinese people believe <eol> some animals are natural enemies. <eob>
As a Pig, I need to be <eol> careful with a Snake. <eob>
Raise your hand if you are a Snake. <eob> Let's have a chat later. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> We believe some animals <eol> are luckier than the others, <eob> such as the Dragon. <eob>
Unlike the Western tradition, <eob> the Chinese Dragon is a symbol <eol> for power, strength and wealth. <eob>
It's everyone's dream <eol> to have a Dragon baby. <eob>
Jack Ma's parents <eol> must have been very proud. <eob>
And they are not the only ones. <eob>
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon, <eob> the birthrate in China, <eol> Hong Kong and Taiwan <eob> increased by five percent. <eob>
That means another one million more babies. <eob>
With a traditional preference <eol> to baby boys, <eob> the boy-girl ratio <eol> that year was 120 to 100. <eob>
When those Dragon boys grow up, <eob> they will face much more severe <eol> competition in love and job markets. <eob>
According to the BBC and the Chinese <eol> government's press release, <eob> January 2015 saw a peak <eol> of Cesarean sections. <eob> Why? <eob> That was the last month for the <eol> Year of the Horse. <eob>
It's not because they like <eol> horses so much, <eob> it's because they try to avoid <eol> having unlucky Goat babies. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. <eob>
Those are Goat babies. <eob>
They don't look like losers to me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Tiger is another undesirable animal, <eob> due to its volatile temperament. <eob>
Many Chinese regions saw <eol> a sharp decline of birthrate <eob> during those years. <eob>
Perhaps one should consider <eol> zodiac in reverse, <eob> as those Tiger and Goat babies <eol> will face much less competition. <eob>
Maybe they are the lucky ones. <eob>
I went through the Forbes <eol> top 300 richest people in the world, <eob> and it's interesting to see <eob> the most undesirable two animals, <eol> the Goat and Tiger, <eob> are at the top of the chart, <eob> even higher than the Dragon. <eob>
So maybe we should consider, <eob> maybe it's much better <eol> to have less competition. <eob>
One last but interesting point: <eob> many Chinese people make <eol> their investment decisions <eob> based on the zodiac sign index. <eob>
Although the belief and tradition <eol> of the zodiac sign <eob> has been over thousands of years, <eob> the trend of using it <eol> in making major decisions <eob> did not really happen <eol> until the past few decades. <eob>
Our ancestors were very busy <eol> surviving poverty, drought, <eob> famine, riot, disease and civil war. <eob>
And finally, Chinese people <eol> have the time, wealth and technology <eob> to create an ideal life <eol> they've always wanted. <eob>
The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people <eob> has caused the fluctuation <eol> in economics and demand on everything, <eob> from health care and education <eol> to property and consumer goods. <eob>
As China plays such an important role <eol> in the global economy and geopolitics, <eob> the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions <eob> end up impacting everyone <eol> around the world. <eob>
Are there any Monkeys here? <eob>
2016 is the Year of the Monkey. <eob>
Monkeys are clever, curious, creative <eol> and mischievous. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female, <eob> like all of you. <eob>
And I'm also a social justice comedian, <eob> something that I insist is an actual job. <eob>
To explain what that is, let me tell you <eol> how I got here. <eob>
I've performed all over the country. <eob>
And let me tell you, America <eol> is majestic, right? <eob>
It's got breathtaking nature, <eob> waffle houses <eob> and diabetes as far as the eye can see. <eob>
It is really something. <eob>
Now, the American population <eol> can be broken up <eob> into three main categories: <eob> there's mostly wonderful people, <eob> haters <eob> and Florida. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Besides Florida, the most troubling <eol> category here are the Haters. <eob>
They are a minority, <eob> but they overcompensate <eol> by being extra loud. <eob>
They have the Napoleon complex <eol> of demographics, <eob> and yes, some of the men do wear heels. <eob>
As a social justice comedian, <eob> it's my goal to convert <eol> these haters, <eob> because they hate a lot of things, <eol> which leads to negative outcomes, <eob> like racism, violence and Ted Nugent. <eob>
This is not an exhaustive list; <eob> I'm probably missing 3-7 items. <eob>
But the point is, <eob> we have to reckon with the haters. <eob>
But there's variance within this group <eob> and it's not efficient <eol> to go after all of them, right? <eob>
So what I've done is created <eol> a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters. <eob>
I basically took all of the haters, <eob> I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist, <eob> and this is what I found. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
First off, we have the trolls. <eob>
These are your garden-variety <eol> digital haters. <eob>
They're the people who quit their jobs <eob> so they can post on YouTube <eol> videos all day long. <eob>
There's also the drive-by haters. <eob>
Now, these people will be at a stoplight, <eob> they'll wait for the light to turn green <eob> and when it does, they yell, <eol> "Go back to your own country!" <eob> Now back in the day, <eol> they would've actually gotten out of their cars <eob> and hated you to your face. <eob>
But they just don't make them like they used to -- <eob> which is another sign <eol> of the decline in America. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The next category <eob> is the mission-oriented-bigot- <eol> whose-group-affiliation- <eob> gives-them-cover-for-hating hater. <eob>
These guys like to hate <eol> via a seemingly nice organization, <eob> like a church or a nonprofit, <eob> and they oftentimes like to speak <eol> in an old-timey voice. <eob>
But the group I'm most interested <eol> in is the swing hater. <eob>
The swing hater is sister <eol> to the swing voter -- <eob> they just can't decide! <eob>
They're like ideological sluts <eob> who move from hating to not hating. <eob>
And they do it because <eol> they don't have enough information. <eob>
This is the group I like to target <eol> with social justice comedy. <eob> Why comedy? <eob> Because on a scale of comedy to brochure, <eob> the average American prefers comedy, <eol> as you can see from this graph. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Comedy is very popular. <eob> And by the way, <eob> this is a mathematically accurate graph, <eob> generated from fake numbers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, the question is: <eob> Why does social justice comedy work? <eob>
Because, first off, it makes you laugh. <eob>
And when you're laughing, you enter <eol> into a state of openness. <eob>
And in that moment of openness, <eob> a good social justice comedian <eol> can stick in a whole bunch of information, <eob> and if they're really skilled, <eob> a rectal exam. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here are some ground rules <eol> for social justice comedy: <eob> first off, it's not partisan. <eob>
This isn't political comedy, <eol> this is about justice, <eob> and no one is against justice. <eob>
Two, it's inviting and warm, <eob> it makes you feel like you're sitting <eol> inside of a burrito. <eob>
Three, it's funny but sneaky, <eob> like you could be hearing <eol> an interesting treatise <eob> on income inequality, <eob> that's encased <eol> in a really sophisticated poop joke. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's how I see social justice comedy <eol> working. <eob>
A few years ago, I rounded up <eol> a bunch of Muslim-American comedians -- <eob> in a non-violent way -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And we went around the country <eob> to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia -- <eob> places where they love the Muzzies -- <eob> and we did stand-up shows. <eob>
We called the tour <eol> "The Muslims Are Coming!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We turned this into a movie, <eob> and then after the movie came out, <eob> a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars <eob> on an anti-Muslim poster campaign <eob> with the MTA -- that's the New York City subway system. <eob>
Now, the posters were truly offensive, <eob> not to mentioned poorly designed -- <eob> I mean, if you're going to be bigoted, <eob> you might as well use a better font. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we decided, why not launch <eol> our own poster campaign <eob> that says nice things about Muslims, <eob> while promoting the movie. <eob>
So myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah <eob> decided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign. <eob>
We raised the money, worked with the MTA <eol> for over 5 months, <eob> got the posters approved, <eob> and two days after they <eol> were supposed to go up, <eob> the MTA decided to ban <eol> the posters, <eob> citing political content. <eob>
Let's take a look at a couple <eol> of those posters. <eob> Here's one. <eob> Facts about Muslims: <eob> Muslims invented <eol> the concept of a hospital. <eob> OK. <eob> Fact: Grown-up Muslims <eol> can do more push-ups than baby Muslims. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Let's take a look at another one. <eob> The ugly truth about Muslims: <eob> they have great frittata recipes. <eob>
Now clearly, frittatas are considered <eol> political by the MTA. <eob>
Either that, or the mere mention <eol> of Muslims in a positive light <eob> was considered political -- <eol> but it isn't. <eob>
It's about justice. <eob>
So we decided to change <eob> our fighting-bigortry- <eol> with-delightful-posters campaign <eob> and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So basically, what I'm saying <eol> is a couple of dirt-bag comedians <eob> took on a major New York City agency <eob> and the comedians won. <eob>
(Applause and cheers) <eob>
Thank you. <eob> Victory was a very weird feeling. <eob>
I was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel <eol> like all the time? <eob> 'Cause this is amazing!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's another example. <eob> I'm asked everywhere I go: <eol> "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?" <eob> We do. But OK, I'll take the bait. <eob>
They generally appear <eol> as single-panel cartoons, <eob> "I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people <eol> who never fill the paper tray!" <eob> The point of the website <eol> is that it denounces terrorism <eob> while recognizing that <eol> it's ridiculous <eob> that we have to constantly denounce terrorism. <eob>
But if bigotry isn't your thing, <eob> social justice comedy <eol> is useful for all sorts of issues. <eob>
For example, myself and fellow <eol> comedian Lee Camp <eob> went to the Cayman Islands <eol> to investigate offshore banking. <eob>
Now, the United States loses something <eol> like 300 billion dollars a year <eob> in these offshore tax havens. <eob>
Not to brag, <eob> but at the end of every month, <eob> I have something like 5-15 dollars <eol> in disposable income. <eob>
So we walked into these banks <eol> in the Cayman Islands <eob> and asked if we could open up a bank account <eob> with eight dollars and 27 cents. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The bank managers <eob> would indulge us for 30-45 seconds <eol> before calling security. <eob>
Security would come out, <eol> brandish their weapons, <eob> and then we would squeal <eol> with fear and run away, <eob> because -- and this is the last rule <eol> of social justice comedy -- <eob> sometimes it makes you want <eol> to take a dump in your pants. <eob>
Most of my work is meant to be fun. <eob>
It's meant to generate <eol> a connection and laughter. <eob>
But yes, sometimes I get run off <eol> the grounds by security. <eob>
Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail. <eob>
Sometimes I get voice mails saying <eol> that if I continue telling my jokes, <eob> they'll kill me and they'll kill my family. <eob>
And those death threats <eol> are definitely not funny. <eob>
But despite the occasional danger, <eob> I still think that social justice comedy <eol> is one of our best weapons. <eob>
I mean, we've tried a lot of approaches <eol> to social justice, <eob> like war and competitive ice dancing. <eob>
But still, a lot of things <eol> are still kind of awful. <eob>
So I think it's time we try <eol> and tell a really good poop joke. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I've been living in rural East Africa <eol> for about 10 years, <eob> and I want to share a field perspective <eol> with you on global poverty. <eob>
I believe that the greatest <eol> failure of the human race <eob> is the fact that we've left more <eol> than one billion of our members behind. <eob>
Hungry, extreme poverty: <eob> these often seem like gigantic, <eol> insurmountable problems, <eob> too big to solve. <eob>
But as a field practitioner, <eob> I believe these are actually <eol> very solvable problems <eob> if we just take the right strategies. <eob>
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker, <eob> and he taught us that <eol> if we lean on the right levers, <eob> we can move the world. <eob>
In the fight against extreme poverty, <eol> I believe there are three powerful levers <eob> that we can lean on. <eob>
This talk is all about those levers, <eol> and why they make poverty <eob> a winnable fight in our lifetimes. <eob>
What is extreme poverty? <eob> When I first moved to rural East Africa, <eob> I stayed overnight with a farm family. <eob>
They were wonderful people. <eob>
They invited me into their home. <eob>
We sang songs together <eob> and ate a simple dinner. <eob>
They gave me a blanket <eol> to sleep on the floor. <eob>
In the morning, however, <eol> there was nothing to eat. <eob>
And then at lunchtime, <eol> I watched with an increasingly sick feeling <eob> as the eldest girl in the family cooked <eol> porridge as a substitute for lunch. <eob>
For that meal, <eol> every child drank one cup to survive. <eob>
And I cannot tell you <eol> how ashamed I felt <eob> when they handed one of those cups to me, <eob> and I knew I had to accept <eol> their hospitality. <eob>
Children need food not only to survive <eol> but also to grow physically and mentally. <eob>
Every day they fail to eat, <eol> they lose a little bit of their future. <eob>
Amongst the extreme poor, <eol> one in three children <eob> are permanently stunted <eol> from a lifetime of not eating enough. <eob>
When that's combined <eol> with poor access to health care, <eob> one in 10 extremely poor children <eol> die before they reach age five. <eob>
And only one quarter <eol> of children complete high school <eob> because they lack school fees. <eob>
Hunger and extreme poverty <eol> curb human potential in every possible way. <eob>
We see ourselves as a thinking, <eol> feeling and moral human race, <eob> but until we solve these problems <eol> for all of our members, <eob> we fail that standard, <eob> because every person <eol> on this planet matters. <eob> This child matters. <eob> These children matter. <eob> This girl matters. <eob>
You know, we see things like this, <eob> and we're upset by them, <eob> but they seem like such big problems. <eob>
We don't know how <eol> to take effective action. <eob>
But remember our friend Archimedes. <eob>
Global poverty has powerful levers. <eob>
It's a problem like any other. <eob>
I live and work in the field, <eol> and as a practitioner, <eob> I believe these are very solvable problems. <eob>
So for the next 10 minutes, <eob> let's not be sad <eol> about the state of the world. <eob> Let's engage our brains. <eob> Let's engage our collective passion <eol> for problem-solving <eob> and figure out what those levers are. <eob>
Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers. <eob>
Think about how extraordinary this is. <eob>
If this picture represents <eol> the world's poor, <eob> then more than half engage <eol> in farming as a major source of income. <eob>
This gets me really excited. <eob>
All of these people, one profession. <eob>
Think how powerful this is. <eob>
When farmers become more productive, <eol> then more than half the world's poor <eob> earn more money <eol> and climb out of poverty. <eob>
And it gets better. <eob>
The product of farming is, <eol> of course, food. <eob>
So when farmers become <eol> more productive, they earn more food, <eob> and they don't just help themselves, <eob> but they help to feed healthy communities <eol> and thriving economies. <eob>
And when farmers become more productive, <eol> they reduce environmental pressure. <eob>
We only have two ways we can feed the world: <eob> we can either make our existing <eol> farmland a lot more productive, <eob> or we can clear cut forest and savannah <eol> to make more farmland, <eob> which would be environmentally disastrous. <eob>
Farmers are basically a really important <eol> leverage point. <eob>
When farmers become more productive, <eob> they earn more income, <eol> they climb out of poverty, <eob> they feed their communities <eol> and they reduce environmental land pressure. <eob>
Farmers stand at the center of the world. <eob>
And not a farmer like this one, <eob> but rather this lady. <eob>
Most of the farmers I know <eol> are actually women. <eob>
Look at the strength <eol> and the will radiating from this woman. <eob>
She is physically strong, mentally tough, <eob> and she will do whatever it takes <eol> to earn a better life for her children. <eob>
If we're going to put the future <eol> of humanity in one person's hands, <eob> then I'm really glad it's her. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's just one problem: <eob> many smallholder farmers lack access <eol> to basic tools and knowledge. <eob>
Currently, they take a little bit <eol> of saved food grain from the prior year, <eob> they plant it in the ground and they till it <eol> with a manual hand hoe. <eob>
These are tools and techniques <eol> that date to the Bronze Age, <eob> and it's why many farmers <eol> are still very poor. <eob>
But good news, again. <eob>
Lever number two: <eob> humanity actually solved the problem <eol> of agricultural poverty a century ago. <eob>
Let me walk you through the three <eol> most basic factors in farming. <eob>
First, hybrid seed is created <eol> when you cross two seeds together. <eob>
If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety <eob> together with a drought-resistant variety, <eob> you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits <eol> from both of its parents. <eob>
Next, conventional fertilizer, <eol> if used responsibly, <eob> is environmentally sustainable. <eob>
If you micro-dose just <eol> a pinch of fertilizer <eob> to a plant that's taller than I am, <eob> you unlock enormous yield gain. <eob>
These are known as farm inputs. <eob>
Farm inputs need to be combined <eol> with good practice. <eob>
When you space your seeds <eol> and plant with massive amounts of compost, <eob> farmers multiply their harvests. <eob>
These proven tools and practices <eol> have more than tripled <eob> agricultural productivity in every major region of the world, <eob> moving mass numbers of people <eol> out of poverty. <eob>
We just haven't finished delivering these things <eol> to everybody just yet, <eob> particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. <eob>
So overall, this is amazing news. <eob>
Humanity actually solved <eol> agricultural poverty a century ago, <eob> in theory. <eob>
We just haven't delivered these things <eol> to everybody just yet. <eob>
In this century, the reason <eol> that people remain poor <eob> is because maybe they live <eol> in remote places. <eob>
They lack access to these things. <eob>
Therefore, ending poverty <eol> is simply a matter <eob> of delivering proven goods <eol> and services to people. <eob>
We don't need more genius types right now. <eob>
The humble delivery guy is going to end <eol> global poverty in our lifetime. <eob>
So these are the three levers, <eob> and the most powerful lever <eol> is simply delivery. <eob>
Wherever the world's companies, <eol> governments and nonprofits <eob> set up delivery networks <eol> for life-improving goods, <eob> we eliminate poverty. <eob>
OK, so that sounds really nice <eob> in theory, <eob> but what about in practice? <eob>
What do these delivery networks look like? <eob>
I want to share the concrete example <eol> that I know best, <eob> my organization, One Acre Fund. <eob>
We only serve the farmer, <eob> and our job is to provide her with the tools <eol> that she needs to succeed. <eob>
We start off by delivering farm inputs <eol> to really rural places. <eob>
Now, this may appear <eol> initially very challenging, <eob> but it's pretty possible. Let me show you. <eob>
We buy farm inputs with the combined <eol> power of our farmer network, <eob> and store it in 20 warehouses like this. <eob>
Then, during input delivery, <eol> we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks <eob> and send them out to where farmers <eol> are waiting in the field. <eob>
They then get their individual orders <eol> and walk it home to their farms. <eob>
It's kind of like Amazon <eol> for rural farmers. <eob>
Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, <eol> a way to pay. <eob>
Farmers pay us little by little over time, <eol> covering most of our expenses. <eob>
And then we surround all that <eol> with training. <eob>
Our rural field officers deliver practical, <eol> hands-on training <eob> to farmers in the field <eob> every two weeks. <eob>
Wherever we deliver our services, <eol> farmers use these tools <eob> to climb out of poverty. <eob>
This is a farmer in our program, Consolata. <eob>
Look at the pride on her face. <eob>
She has achieved a modest prosperity <eol> that I believe is the human right <eob> of every hardworking person on the planet. <eob>
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving <eol> about 400,000 farmers like Consolata. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The key to doing <eol> this is scalable delivery. <eob>
In any given area, <eol> we hire a rural field officer <eob> who delivers our services <eol> to 200 farmers, on average, <eob> with more than 1,000 people <eol> living in those families. <eob>
Today, we have 2,000 <eol> of these rural field officers <eob> growing very quickly. <eob>
This is our delivery army, <eob> and we're just one organization. <eob>
There are many companies, governments <eol> and nonprofits <eob> that have delivery armies <eol> just like this. <eob>
And I believe we stand at a moment in time <eob> where collectively, we are capable <eol> of delivering farm services to all farmers. <eob>
Let me show you how possible this is. <eob>
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa, <eob> with a map of the United States for scale. <eob>
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because <eol> this is a huge delivery territory. <eob> It's very challenging. <eob>
But we analyzed every 50-mile <eol> by 50-mile block on the continent, <eob> and we found that half of farmers <eol> live in just these shaded regions. <eob>
That's a remarkably small area overall. <eob>
If you were to lay these boxes <eol> next to each other <eob> within a map of the United States, <eob> they would only cover <eol> the Eastern United States. <eob>
You can order pizza <eol> anywhere in this territory <eob> and it'll arrive to your house <eol> hot, fresh and delicious. <eob>
If America can deliver pizza <eol> to an area of this size, <eob> then Africa's companies, <eol> governments and non-profits <eob> can deliver farm services <eol> to all of her farmers. <eob> This is possible. <eob>
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing <eol> beyond just farming. <eob>
In every field of human development, <eob> humanity has already invented <eol> effective tools to end poverty. <eob>
We just need to deliver them. <eob>
So again, in every area <eol> of human development, <eob> super-smart people a long time ago <eol> invented inexpensive, <eob> highly effective tools. <eob>
Humanity is armed to the teeth <eob> with simple, effective solutions to poverty. <eob>
We just need to deliver <eol> these to a pretty small area. <eob>
Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, <eob> remember that rural poverty <eol> is concentrated in these blue shaded areas. <eob>
Urban poverty is even more concentrated, <eol> in these green little dots. <eob>
Again, using a map <eol> of the United States for scale, <eob> this is what I would call <eol> a highly achievable delivery zone. <eob>
In fact, for the first time in human history, <eob> we have a vast amount of delivery <eol> infrastructure available to us. <eob>
The world's companies, governments <eol> and non-profits <eob> have delivery armies <eol> that are fully capable <eob> of covering this relatively small area. <eob>
We just lack the will. <eob>
If we are willing, <eob> every one of us has a role to play. <eob>
We first need more people <eol> to pursue careers in human development, <eob> especially if you live in a developing nation. <eob>
We need more front line health workers, <eol> teachers, farmer trainers, <eob> sales agents for life-improving goods. <eob>
These are the delivery people <eol> that dedicate their careers <eob> to improving the lives of others. <eob>
But we also need a lot of support roles. <eob>
These are roles available <eol> at just my organization alone, <eob> and we're just one out of many. <eob>
This may surprise you, but no matter <eol> what your technical specialty, <eob> there is a role for you in this fight. <eob>
And no matter how logistically <eol> possible it is to end poverty, <eob> we need a lot more resources. <eob>
This is our number one constraint. <eob>
For private investors, we need <eol> a big expansion of venture capital, <eob> private equity, working capital, <eol> available in emerging markets. <eob>
But there are also limits <eol> to what private business can accomplish. <eob>
Private businesses often struggle <eol> to profitably serve the extreme poor, <eob> so philanthropy still has <eol> a major role to play. <eob>
Anybody can give, <eol> but we need more leadership. <eob>
We need more visionary philanthropists <eob> and global leaders <eol> who will take problems in human development <eob> and lead humanity to wipe <eol> them off the face of the planet. <eob>
If you're interested in these ideas, <eol> check out this website. <eob>
We need more leaders. <eob> Humanity has put people on the moon. <eob>
We've invented supercomputers <eol> that fit into our pockets <eob> and connect us with anybody on the planet. <eob>
We've run marathons <eol> at a five-minute mile pace. <eob> We are an exceptional people. <eob> But we've left more than one billion <eol> of our members behind. <eob>
Until every girl like this <eol> one has an opportunity <eob> to earn her full human potential, <eob> we have failed to become <eol> a truly moral and just human race. <eob>
Logistically speaking, <eol> it's incredibly possible <eob> to end extreme poverty. <eob>
We just need to deliver <eol> proven goods and services <eob> to everybody. <eob>
If we have the will, <eob> every one of us has a role to play. <eob>
Let's deploy our time, our careers, <eob> our collective wealth. <eob>
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty <eob> in this lifetime. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today 40 million Americans are indebted <eol> for their passage to the new economy. <eob>
Too poor to pay their way through college, <eob> they now owe lenders <eol> more than one trillion US dollars. <eob>
They do find what jobs they can get <eob> to pay off a debt <eol> that is secured on their person. <eob>
In America, <eob> even a bankrupt gambler <eol> gets a second chance. <eob>
But it is nearly impossible <eob> for an American to get discharged <eol> their student loan debts. <eob>
Once upon a time in America, <eob> going to college did not mean <eol> graduating with debt. <eob>
My friend Paul's father <eol> graduated from Colorado State University <eob> on the GI Bill. <eob>
For his generation, <eob> higher education was free or almost free, <eob> because it was thought of <eol> as a public good. <eob> Not anymore. <eob> When Paul also graduated <eol> from Colorado State University, <eob> he paid for his English degree <eol> by working part-time. <eob>
Not anymore. <eob> 30 years ago, <eob> higher education tuition <eol> was affordable, reasonable, <eob> and what debts you accumulated, <eol> you paid off by graduation date. <eob> Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps, <eob> but with one difference: <eob> when she graduated five years ago, <eob> it was with a whopping debt. <eob>
Students like Kate have to take on a loan <eob> because the cost of higher education <eol> has become unaffordable <eob> for many if not most American families. <eob> But so what? <eob> Getting into debt to buy <eol> an expensive education <eob> is not all bad if you could pay it off <eob> with the increased income <eol> that you earned from it. <eob>
But that's where the rubber <eol> meets the road. <eob>
Even a college grad <eol> earned 10 percent more in 2001 <eob> than she did in 2013. <eob>
So... <eob> tuition costs up, <eob> public funding down, <eob> family incomes diminished, <eob> personal incomes weak. <eob>
Is it any wonder that more <eol> than a quarter of those who must <eob> cannot make their student loan payments? <eob>
The worst of times <eol> can be the best of times, <eob> because certain truths flash up <eol> in ways that you can't ignore. <eob>
I want to speak of three of them today. <eob>
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas <eob> make it abundantly obvious <eob> that higher education <eol> is a consumer product you can buy. <eob>
All of us talk about education <eol> just as the economists do now, <eob> as an investment that you make <eol> to improve the human stock <eob> by training them for work. <eob>
As an investment you make <eol> to sort and classify people <eob> so that employers <eol> can hire them more easily. <eob>
The U.S. News & amp; World Report ranks colleges <eob> just as the consumer report rates <eol> washing machines. <eob>
The language is peppered with barbarisms. <eob>
Teachers are called "service providers," <eob> students are called "consumers." <eob> Sociology and Shakespeare <eol> and soccer and science, <eob> all of these are "content." <eob>
Student debt is profitable. <eob> Only not on you. <eob>
Your debt fattens the profit <eol> of the student loan industry. <eob>
The two 800-pound gorillas of which -- <eob> Sallie Mae and Navient -- <eob> posted last year a combined profit <eol> of 1.2 billion dollars. <eob>
And just like home mortgages, <eob> student loans can be bundled <eol> and packaged and sliced and diced, <eob> and sold on Wall Street. <eob>
And colleges and universities <eob> that invest in these securitized loans <eob> profit twice. <eob>
Once from your tuition, <eob> and then again from the interest on debt. <eob>
With all that money to be made, <eob> are we surprised that some <eol> in the higher education business <eob> have begun to engage in false advertising, <eob> in bait and switch ... <eob> in exploiting the very ignorance <eol> that they pretend to educate? <eob>
Third: <eob> diplomas are a brand. <eob>
Many years ago my teacher wrote, <eob> "When students are treated as consumers, <eob> they're made prisoners <eol> of addiction and envy." <eob> Just as consumers can be sold and resold <eol> upgraded versions of an iPhone, <eob> so also people can be sold <eol> more and more education. <eob>
College is the new high school, <eob> we already say that. <eob>
But why stop there? <eob>
People can be upsold <eol> on certifications and recertifications, <eob> master's degrees, doctoral degrees. <eob>
Higher education is also marketed <eol> as a status object. <eob>
Buy a degree, <eob> much like you do a Lexus <eol> of a Louis Vuitton bag, <eob> to distinguish yourself from others. <eob>
So you can be the object <eol> of envy of others. <eob>
Diplomas are a brand. <eob>
But these truths are often times <eol> hidden by a very noisy sales pitch. <eob>
There is not a day that goes by <eob> without some policy guy <eol> on television telling us, <eob> "A college degree is absolutely essential <eob> to get on that up escalator <eol> to a middle-class life." <eob> And the usual evidence offered <eol> is the college premium: <eob> a college grad who makes on average <eol> 56 percent more than a high school grad. <eob>
Let's look at that number more carefully, <eob> because on the face of it, <eob> it seems to belie the stories we all hear <eob> about college grads <eol> working as baristas and cashiers. <eob>
Of 100 people who enroll <eol> in any form of post-secondary education, <eob> 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, <eob> for a number of reasons, <eol> including financial. <eob>
Of the 55 that do graduate, <eob> two will remain unemployed, <eob> and another 18 are underemployed. <eob>
So, college grads earn more <eol> than high school grads, <eob> but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition <eob> and the lost wages while at college? <eob>
Now even economists admit <eob> going to college pays off <eol> for only those who complete it. <eob>
But that's only because high school wages <eol> have been cut to the bone, <eob> for decades now. <eob>
For decades, <eob> workers with a high school degree <eob> have been denied a fair share <eol> of what they have produced. <eob>
And had they received as they should have, <eob> then going to college would have been <eol> a bad investment for many. <eob> College premium? <eob> I think it's a high school discount. <eob>
Two out of three people who enroll <eol> are not going to find an adequate job. <eob>
And the future, for them, <eol> doesn't look particularly promising -- <eob> in fact, it's downright bleak. <eob>
And it is they who are going to suffer <eob> the most punishing forms of student debt. <eob>
And it is they, <eob> curiously and sadly, <eob> who are marketed most loudly <eol> about this college premium thing. <eob>
That's not just cynical marketing, <eob> that's cruel. <eob>
So what do we do? <eob> What if students and parents treated <eol> higher education as a consumer product? <eob>
Everybody else seems to. <eob>
Then, like any other consumer product, <eob> you would demand to know <eol> what you're paying for. <eob>
When you buy medicines, <eob> you get a list of side effects. <eob>
When you buy a higher educational product, <eob> you should have a warning label <eob> that allows consumers to choose, <eob> make informed choices. <eob>
When you buy a car, <eob> it tells you how many <eol> miles per gallon to expect. <eob>
Who knows what to expect <eob> from a degree say, in Canadian Studies. <eob>
There is such a thing, by the way. <eob>
What if there was an app for that? <eob>
One that linked up the cost of a major <eol> to the expected income. <eob>
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT. <eob>
One of you make this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Discover your reality. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There are three advantages, <eob> three benefits to Income-Based Tuition. <eob>
Any user can figure out <eob> how much money he or she will make <eol> from a given college and major. <eob>
Such informed users <eob> are unlikely to fall victim <eol> to the huckster's ploy, <eob> to the sales pitch. <eob>
But also to choose wisely. <eob>
Why would anybody pay more for college <eob> than let's say, 15 percent <eol> of the additional income they earn? <eob>
There's a second benefit <eol> to Income-Based Tuition. <eob>
By tying the cost to the income, <eob> college administrators would be forced <eol> to manage costs better, <eob> to find innovative ways to do so. <eob>
For instance, <eob> all of you students here pay roughly <eol> the same tuition for every major. <eob>
That is manifestly unfair, <eol> and should change. <eob>
An engineering student uses more resources <eob> and facilities and labs and faculty <eob> than a philosophy student. <eob>
But the philosophy student, <eol> as a consequence, <eob> is subsidizing the engineering student. <eob>
Who then, by the way, <eol> goes on and earns more money. <eob>
Why should two people <eol> buy the same product, <eob> pay the same, <eob> but one person receive <eol> half or a third of the service. <eob>
In fact, college grads, some majors, <eob> pay 25 percent of their income <eol> servicing their student debt, <eob> while others pay five percent. <eob>
That kind if inequity would end <eol> when majors are priced more correctly. <eob>
Now of course, all this data -- <eob> and one of you is going to do this, right? <eob>
All this data has to be well designed, <eob> maybe audited by public accounting firms <eob> to avoid statistical lies. <eob>
We know about statistics, right? <eob>
But be that as it may, <eob> the third and biggest benefit <eol> of Income-Based Tuition, <eob> is it would free Americans from the fear <eol> and the fact of financial ruin <eob> because they bought a defective product. <eob>
Perhaps, in time, <eob> young and old Americans may rediscover, <eob> as the gentleman said earlier, <eob> their curiosity, their love of learning -- <eob> begin to study what they love, <eob> love what they study, <eob> follow their passion ... <eob> getting stimulated by their intelligence, <eob> follow paths of inquiry <eol> that they really want to. <eob>
After all, it was Eric and Kevin, <eob> two years ago, <eob> just exactly these kinds of young men, <eob> who prompted me and worked with me, <eob> and still do, <eob> in the study of indebted <eol> students in America. <eob>
Thank you for your attention. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
War has been a part of my life <eol> since I can remember. <eob>
I was born in Afghanistan, <eol> just six months after the Soviets invaded, <eob> and even though I was too young <eol> to understand what was happening, <eob> I had a deep sense of the suffering <eol> and the fear around me. <eob>
Those early experiences had a major impact <eol> on how I now think about war and conflict. <eob>
I learned that when people <eol> have a fundamental issue at stake, <eob> for most of them, <eob> giving in is not an option. <eob>
For these types conflicts -- <eob> when people's rights are violated, <eob> when their countries are occupied, <eob> when they're oppressed and humiliated -- <eob> they need a powerful way <eol> to resist and to fight back. <eob>
Which means that no matter how destructive <eol> and terrible violence is, <eob> if people see it <eol> as their only choice, <eob> they will use it. <eob>
Most of us are concerned with the level <eol> of violence in the world. <eob>
But we're not going to end war <eob> by telling people that <eol> violence is morally wrong. <eob>
Instead, we must offer them a tool <eob> that's at least as powerful <eol> and as effective as violence. <eob>
This is the work I do. <eob> For the past 13 years, <eob> I've been teaching people <eob> in some of the most difficult situations <eol> around the world <eob> how they can use nonviolent struggle <eol> to conduct conflict. <eob>
Most people associate this type of action <eol> with Gandhi and Martin Luther King. <eob>
But people have been using nonviolent action <eol> for thousands of years. <eob>
In fact, most of the rights <eol> that we have today in this country -- <eob> as women, <eob> as minorities, <eob> as workers, <eob> as people of different sexual orientations <eob> and citizens concerned <eol> with the environment -- <eob> these rights weren't <eol> handed to us. <eob>
They were won by people <eol> who fought for them <eob> and who sacrificed for them. <eob>
But because we haven't learned <eol> from this history, <eob> nonviolent struggle as a technique <eol> is widely misunderstood. <eob>
I met recently with a group <eol> of Ethiopian activists, <eob> and they told me something <eol> that I hear a lot. <eob>
They said they'd already <eol> tried nonviolent action, <eob> and it hadn't worked. <eob>
Years ago they held a protest. <eob>
The government arrested everyone, <eol> and that was the end of that. <eob>
The idea that nonviolent struggle <eol> is equivalent to street protests <eob> is a real problem. <eob>
Because although protests can be a great way <eol> to show that people want change, <eob> on their own, they don't actually create change -- <eob> at least change that is fundamental. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Powerful opponents are not going <eol> to give people what they want <eob> just because they asked nicely ... <eob> or even not so nicely. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nonviolent struggle works <eol> by destroying an opponent, <eob> not physically, <eob> but by identifying the institutions <eol> that an opponent needs to survive, <eob> and then denying them <eol> those sources of power. <eob>
Nonviolent activists <eol> can neutralize the military <eob> by causing soldiers to defect. <eob>
They can disrupt the economy <eol> through strikes and boycotts. <eob>
And they can challenge government propaganda <eob> by creating alternative media. <eob>
There are a variety of methods <eol> that can be used to do this. <eob>
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp, <eob> has identified 198 methods <eol> of nonviolent action. <eob>
And protest is only one. <eob>
Let me give you a recent example. <eob>
Until a few months ago, <eob> Guatemala was ruled by corrupt <eol> former military officials <eob> with ties to organized crime. <eob>
People were generally aware of this, <eob> but most of them felt powerless <eol> to do anything about it — <eob> until one group of citizens, <eol> just 12 regular people, <eob> put out a call on Facebook <eol> to their friends <eob> to meet in the central plaza, <eol> holding signs with a message: <eob> "Renuncia YA" — <eob> resign already. <eob>
To their surprise, <eob> 30,000 people showed up. <eob>
They stayed there for months <eol> as protests spread throughout the country. <eob>
At one point, <eob> the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs <eol> to various government buildings <eob> with a message: <eob> "If you don't have the huevos" -- <eob> the balls -- <eob> "to stop corrupt candidates <eol> from running for office, <eob> you can borrow ours." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
President Molina responded <eob> by vowing that he would never step down. <eob>
And the activists realized <eol> that they couldn't just keep protesting <eob> and ask the president to resign. <eob>
They needed to leave him no choice. <eob>
So they organized a general strike, <eob> in which people throughout the country <eol> refused to work. <eob>
In Guatemala City alone, <eob> over 400 businesses and schools <eol> shut their doors. <eob>
Meanwhile, <eob> farmers throughout the country <eol> blocked major roads. <eob>
Within five days, <eob> the president, <eob> along with dozens of other <eol> government officials, <eob> resigned already. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I've been greatly inspired <eob> by the creativity and bravery <eol> of people using nonviolent action <eob> in nearly every country in the world. <eob>
For example, <eob> recently a group of activists in Uganda <eob> released a crate of pigs in the streets. <eob>
You can see here that the police <eol> are confused about what to do with them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The pigs were painted <eol> the color of the ruling party. <eob>
One pig was even wearing a hat, <eob> a hat that people recognized. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Activists around the world <eol> are getting better at grabbing headlines, <eob> but these isolated actions do very little <eob> if they're not part of a larger strategy. <eob>
A general wouldn't march <eol> his troops into battle <eob> unless he had a plan to win the war. <eob>
Yet this is how most of the world's <eol> nonviolent movements operate. <eob>
Nonviolent struggle <eol> is just as complex as military warfare, <eob> if not more. <eob>
Its participants must be well-trained <eol> and have clear objectives, <eob> and its leaders must have a strategy <eol> of how to achieve those objectives. <eob>
The technique of war <eol> has been developed over thousands of years <eob> with massive resources <eob> and some of our best minds <eol> dedicated to understanding <eob> and improving how it works. <eob>
Meanwhile, <eob> nonviolent struggle <eol> is rarely systematically studied, <eob> and even though the number is growing, <eob> there are still only a few dozen people <eol> in the world who are teaching it. <eob>
This is dangerous, <eob> because we now know that our old approaches <eol> of dealing with conflict <eob> are not adequate for the new challenges <eol> that we're facing. <eob>
The US government recently admitted <eob> that it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS. <eob>
But what most people don't know <eob> is that people have stood up <eol> to ISIS using nonviolent action. <eob>
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014, <eob> they announced that they were putting <eol> in place a new public school curriculum, <eob> based on their own extremist ideology. <eob>
But on the first day of school, <eob> not a single child showed up. <eob>
Parents simply refused to send them. <eob>
They told journalists <eol> they would rather homeschool their children <eob> than to have them brainwashed. <eob>
This is an example <eol> of just one act of defiance <eob> in just one city. <eob>
But what if it was coordinated <eob> with the dozens of other acts <eol> of nonviolent resistance <eob> that have taken place against ISIS? <eob>
What if the parents' boycott was part <eol> of a larger strategy <eob> to identify and cut off the resources <eol> that ISIS needs to function; <eob> the skilled labor needed to produce food; <eob> the engineers needed to extract <eol> and refine oil; <eob> the media infrastructure <eol> and communications networks <eob> and transportation systems, <eob> and the local businesses <eol> that ISIS relies on? <eob>
It may be difficult <eol> to imagine defeating ISIS <eob> with action that is nonviolent. <eob>
But it's time we challenge <eol> the way we think about conflict <eob> and the choices we have in facing it. <eob>
Here's an idea worth spreading: <eob> let's learn more about where nonviolent <eol> action has worked <eob> and how we can make it more powerful, <eob> just like we do with other systems <eol> and technologies <eob> that are constantly being refined <eol> to better meet human needs. <eob>
It may be that we can improve nonviolent action <eob> to a point where it is increasingly <eol> used in place of war. <eob>
Violence as a tool <eol> of conflict could then be abandoned <eob> in the same way that bows and arrows were, <eob> because we have replaced them <eol> with weapons that are more effective. <eob>
With human innovation, we can make <eol> nonviolent struggle more powerful <eob> than the newest and latest <eol> technologies of war. <eob>
The greatest hope for humanity <eol> lies not in condemning violence <eob> but in making violence obsolete. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What does it mean to spend our time well? <eob>
I spend a lot of my time <eob> thinking about how to spend my time. <eob>
Probably too much -- <eol> I probably obsess over it. <eob>
My friends think I do. <eob>
But I feel like I kind of have <eol> to, because these days, <eob> it feels like little bits of my time <eol> kind of slip away from me, <eob> and when that happens, it feels <eol> like parts of my life are slipping away. <eob>
Specifically, <eob> it feels like little bits of my time <eol> get slipped away <eob> to various things like this, <eob> like technology -- I check things. <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob> If this email shows up -- <eob> how many of you have gotten <eol> an email like this, right? <eob>
I've been tagged in a photo. <eob>
When this appears, <eob> I can't help but click on it right now. <eob> Right? Because, like, <eol> what if it's a bad photo? <eob>
So I have to click it right now. <eob>
But I'm not just going <eol> to click "See photo," <eob> what I'm actually going to do <eol> is spend the next 20 minutes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the worst part is that I know <eol> this is what's going to happen, <eob> and even knowing <eol> that's what's going to happen <eob> doesn't stop me from doing it <eol> again the next time. <eob>
Or I find myself in a situation like this, <eob> where I check my email <eol> and I pull down to refresh, <eob> But the thing is that 60 seconds later, <eob> I'll pull down to refresh again. <eob>
Why am I doing this? <eob> This doesn't make any sense. <eob>
But I'll give you a hint <eol> why this is happening. <eob>
What do you think <eol> makes more money in the United States <eob> than movies, game parks <eol> and baseball combined? <eob> Slot machines. <eob> How can slot machines make all this money <eob> when we play with such <eol> small amounts of money? <eob>
We play with coins. <eob>
How is this possible? <eob>
Well, the thing is ... <eob> my phone is a slot machine. <eob>
Every time I check my phone, <eob> I'm playing the slot machine to see, <eob> what am I going to get? <eob> What am I going to get? <eob>
Every time I check my email, <eob> I'm playing the slot machine, <eob> saying, <eob> "What am I going to get?" <eob> Every time I scroll a news feed, <eob> I'm playing the slot machine to see, <eob> what am I going to get <eob> next? <eob>
And the thing is that, <eob> again, knowing exactly how this works -- <eol> and I'm a designer, <eob> I know exactly how the psychology <eol> of this works, <eob> I know exactly what's going on -- <eob> but it doesn't leave me with any choice, <eob> I still just get sucked into it. <eob>
So what are we going to do? <eob> Because it leaves us with <eol> this all-or-nothing relationship <eob> with technology, right? <eob>
You're either on, <eob> and you're connected <eol> and distracted all the time, <eob> or you're off, <eob> but then you're wondering, <eob> am I missing something important? <eob>
In other words, you're either distracted <eob> or you have fear of missing out. <eob> Right? <eob>
So we need to restore choice. <eob>
We want to have a relationship <eol> with technology <eob> that gives us back choice <eol> about how we spend time with it, <eob> and we're going to need <eol> help from designers, <eob> because knowing this stuff doesn't help. <eob>
We're going to need design help. <eob>
So what would that look like? <eob>
So let's take an example that we all face: <eob> chat -- text messaging. <eob>
So let's say there's two people. <eob>
Nancy's on the left and she's working <eol> on a document, <eob> and John's on the right. <eob>
And John suddenly remembers, <eob> "I need to ask Nancy <eol> for that document before I forget." <eob> So when he sends her that message, <eob> it blows away her attention. <eob>
That's what we're doing all the time, <eol> bulldozing each other's attention, <eob> left and right. <eob>
And there's serious cost to this, <eob> because every time <eol> we interrupt each other, <eob> it takes us about 23 minutes, on average, <eob> to refocus our attention. <eob>
We actually cycle through two different projects <eob> before we come back to the original thing <eol> we were doing. <eob>
This is Gloria Mark's research <eol> combined with Microsoft research, <eob> that showed this. <eob>
And her research also shows <eol> that it actually trains bad habits. <eob>
The more interruptions <eol> we get externally, <eob> it's conditioning and training us <eol> to interrupt ourselves. <eob>
We actually self-interrupt <eol> every three-and-a-half minutes. <eob>
This is crazy. <eob> So how do we fix this? <eob> Because Nancy and John are in this <eol> all-or-nothing relationship. <eob>
Nancy might want to disconnect, <eob> but then she'd be worried: <eob> What if I'm missing something important? <eob>
Design can fix this problem. <eob>
Let's say you have <eol> Nancy again on the left, <eob> John on the right. <eob>
And John remembers, "I need to send <eol> Nancy that document." <eob> Except this time, <eob> Nancy can mark that she's focused. <eob>
Let's say she drags a slider and says, <eob> "I want to be focused for 30 minutes," <eob> so -- bam -- she's focused. <eob>
Now when John wants to message her, <eob> he can get the thought <eol> off of his mind -- <eob> because he has a need, he has this thought, <eob> and he needs to dump it out <eol> before he forgets. <eob>
Except this time, <eob> it holds the messages so that Nancy <eol> can still focus, <eob> but John can get the thought <eol> off of his mind. <eob>
But this only works <eol> if one last thing is true, <eob> which is that Nancy needs to know <eol> that if something is truly important, <eob> John can still interrupt. <eob>
But instead of having constant accidental <eol> or mindless interruptions, <eob> we're now only creating conscious interruptions, <eob>
So we're doing two things here. <eob>
We're creating a new choice <eol> for both Nancy and John, <eob> But there's a second, subtle thing <eol> we're doing here, too. <eob> And it's that we're changing the question <eol> we're answering. <eob>
Instead of the goal of chat being: <eob> "Let's design it so it's easy <eol> to send a message" -- <eob> that's the goal of chat, <eob> it should be really easy <eol> to send a message to someone -- <eob> we change the goal to something <eol> deeper and a human value, <eob> which is: "Let's create <eol> the highest possible quality communication <eob> in a relationship between two people. <eob>
So we upgraded the goal. <eob> Now, do designers <eol> actually care about this? <eob>
Do we want to have conversations <eol> about what these deeper human goals are? <eob>
Well, I'll tell you one story. <eob>
A little over a year ago, <eob> I got to help organize a meeting <eob> between some of technology's <eol> leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh. <eob>
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international <eol> spokesperson for mindfulness meditation. <eob>
And it was the most amazing meeting. <eob>
You have to imagine -- picture a room -- <eob> on one side of the room, <eol> you have a bunch of tech geeks; <eob> on the other side of the room, <eob> you have a bunch of long brown <eol> robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks. <eob>
And the questions were <eol> about the deepest human values, <eob> like what does the future <eol> of technology look like <eob> when you're designing <eol> for the deepest questions <eob> and the deepest human values? <eob>
And our conversation centered <eol> on listening more deeply <eob> to what those values might be. <eob>
He joked in our conversation <eob> that what if, instead of a spell check, <eob> you had a compassion check, <eob> meaning, you might highlight a word <eol> that might be accidentally abrasive -- <eob> perceived as abrasive by someone else. <eob>
So does this kind of conversation <eol> happen in the real world, <eob> not just in these design meetings? <eob>
Well, the answer is yes, <eob> and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing. <eob>
If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website <eob> that matches people who are looking <eol> for a place to stay <eob> with a free couch, from someone <eol> who's trying to offer it. <eob>
So, great service -- <eob> what would their design goal be? <eob>
What are you designing <eol> for if you work at Couchsurfing? <eob>
Right? <eob> Well, you would think <eol> it's to match guests with hosts. <eob> That's a pretty good goal. <eob>
But that would kind of be like our goal <eol> with messaging before, <eob> where we're just trying <eol> to deliver a message. <eob>
So what's the deeper, human goal? <eob>
Well, they set their goal <eob> as the need to create lasting, <eol> positive experiences and relationships <eob> between people who've never met before. <eob>
And the most amazing thing <eol> about this was in 2007, <eob> they introduced a way to measure this, <eob> which is incredible. <eob> I'll tell you how it works. <eob> For every design goal you have, <eob> you have to have a corresponding measurement <eob> to know how you're doing -- <eob> a way of measuring success. <eob>
So what they do is, <eob> let's say you take two people who meet up, <eob> and they take the number of days <eol> those two people spent together, <eob> and then they estimate how many hours <eol> were in those days -- <eob> how many hours did those two people spend together? <eob>
And then after they spend <eol> that time together, <eob> they ask both of them: <eob> How positive was your experience? <eob>
Did you have a good experience <eol> with this person that you met? <eob>
And they subtract <eol> from those positive hours <eob> the amount of time people <eol> spent on the website, <eob> because that's a cost to people's lives. <eob>
Why should we value that as success? <eob>
And what you were left with <eob> is something they refer to <eol> as "net orchestrated conviviality," <eob> or, really, just a net "Good Times" created. <eob>
The net hours that would have <eol> never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed. <eob>
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be <eol> to come to work every day <eob> and measure your success <eob> in the actual net new contribution <eol> of hours in people's lives <eob> that are positive, <eol> that would have never existed <eob> if you didn't do what you were <eol> about to do at work today? <eob>
Can you imagine a whole world <eol> that worked this way? <eob>
Can you imagine a social network that -- <eob> let's say you care about cooking, <eob> and it measured its success in terms <eol> of cooking nights organized <eob> and the cooking articles <eol> that you were glad you read, <eob> and subtracted from that the articles <eol> you weren't glad you read <eob> or the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like? <eob>
Imagine a professional social network <eob> that, instead of measuring <eol> its success in terms of connections created <eob> or messages sent, <eob> instead measured its success in terms <eol> of the job offers that people got <eob> that they were excited to get. <eob>
And subtracted <eob> the amount of time people <eol> spent on the website. <eob>
Or imagine dating services, <eob> like maybe Tinder or something, <eob> where instead of measuring <eol> the number of swipes <eob> left and right <eob> people did, <eob> which is how they measure success today, <eob> instead measured the deep, romantic, <eol> fulfilling connections people created. <eob>
Whatever that was for them, by the way. <eob>
But can you imagine <eol> a whole world that worked this way, <eob> that was helping you spend <eol> your time well? <eob>
Now to do this you also need a new system, <eob> because you're probably thinking, <eob> today's Internet economy -- <eob> today's economy in general -- <eob> is measured in time spent. <eob>
The more users you have, <eob> the more usage you have, <eob> the more time people spend, <eob> that's how we measure success. <eob>
But we've solved this problem before. <eob>
We solved it with organic, <eob> when we said we need to value <eol> things a different way. <eob>
We said this is a different kind of food. <eob>
So we can't compare it <eol> just based on price; <eob> this is a different category of food. <eob>
We solved it with Leed Certification, <eob> where we said this is a different kind of building <eob> that stood for different values <eol> of environmental sustainability. <eob>
What if we had something <eol> like that for technology? <eob>
What if we had something <eol> whose entire purpose and goal <eob> was to help create net new positive <eol> contributions to human life? <eob>
And what if we could value <eol> it a different way, <eob> so it would actually work? <eob>
Imagine you gave this different <eol> premium shelf space on app stores. <eob> Imagine you had web browsers <eol> that helped route you <eob> to these kinds of design products. <eob>
Can you imagine how exciting it would be <eol> to live and create that world? <eob>
We can create this world today. <eob>
Company leaders, all you have to do -- <eob> only you can prioritize a new metric, <eob> which is your metric for net positive <eol> contribution to human life. <eob> And have an honest conversation about that. <eob> Maybe you're not doing so well to start with, <eob> but let's start that conversation. <eob>
Designers, you can redefine success; <eol> you can redefine design. <eob>
Arguably, you have more power <eol> than many people in your organization <eob> to create the choices that all <eol> of us live by. <eob>
Maybe like in medicine, <eob> where we have a Hippocratic oath <eob> to recognize the responsibility <eol> and this higher value <eob> that we have to treat patients. <eob> What if designers had something like that, <eob> in terms of this new <eol> kind of design? <eob>
And users, for all of us -- <eob> we can demand technology <eol> that works this way. <eob>
Now it may seem hard, <eob> but McDonald's didn't have salads <eol> until the consumer demand was there. <eob>
Walmart didn't have organic food <eol> until the consumer demand was there. <eob>
We have to demand this <eol> new kind of technology. <eob>
And we can do that. <eob>
And doing that <eob> would amount to shifting <eol> from a world that's driven and run <eob> entirely on time spent, <eob> to world that's driven <eol> by time well spent. <eob>
I want to live in this world, <eob> and I want this conversation to happen. <eob>
Let's start that conversation now. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So we all have our own biases. <eob>
For example, some of us tend to think <eob> that it's very difficult <eol> to transform failing government systems. <eob>
When we think of government systems, <eob> we tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways, <eob> and perhaps, the leadership is just <eol> too bureaucratic <eob> to be able to change things. <eob>
Well, today, I want to challenge <eol> that theory. <eob>
I want to tell you a story <eol> of a very large government system <eob> that has not only put itself <eol> on the path of reform <eob> but has also shown fairly spectacular results <eob> in less than three years. <eob>
This is what a classroom in a public school <eol> in India looks like. <eob>
There are 1 million such schools in India. <eob>
And even for me, who's lived <eol> in India all her life, <eob> walking into one of these schools <eol> is fairly heartbreaking. <eob>
By the time kids are 11, <eob> 50 percent of them have fallen <eol> so far behind in their education <eob> that they have no hope to recover. <eob>
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition, <eob> they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence. <eob>
These are things that you and <eol> I would expect an 8-year-old <eob> to be able to do. <eob>
By the time kids are 13 or 14, <eob> they tend to drop out of schools. <eob>
In India, public schools <eol> not only offer free education -- <eob> they offer free textbooks, <eol> free workbooks, free meals, <eob> sometimes even cash scholarships. <eob>
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today <eob> are choosing to pull <eol> their children out of public schools <eob> and pay out of their pockets <eol> to put them in private schools. <eob>
As a comparison, in a far <eol> richer country, the US, <eob> that number is only 10 percent. <eob>
That's a huge statement on how broken <eol> the Indian public education system is. <eob>
So it was with that background <eol> that I got a call in the summer of 2013 <eob> from an absolutely brilliant lady <eol> called Surina Rajan. <eob>
She was, at that time, the head <eol> of the Department of School Education <eob> in a state called Haryana in India. <eob>
So she said to us, "Look, I've been <eol> heading this department <eob> for the last two years. <eob>
I've tried a number of things, <eol> and nothing seems to work. <eob> Can you possibly help?" <eob>
Let me describe Haryana <eol> a little bit to you. <eob>
Haryana is a state which has <eol> 30 million people. <eob>
It has 15,000 public schools <eob> and 2 million plus children <eol> in those public schools. <eob>
So basically, with that phone call, <eob> I promised to help a state and system <eob> which was as large as that of Peru <eol> or Canada transform itself. <eob>
As I started this project, <eol> I was very painfully aware of two things. <eob>
One, that I had never done anything <eol> like this before. <eob>
And two, many others had, perhaps <eol> without too much success. <eob>
As my colleagues and I looked across the country <eob> and across the world, <eob> we couldn't find another example <eob> that we could just pick up <eol> and replicate in Haryana. <eob>
We knew that we had to craft <eol> our own journey. <eob>
But anyway, we jumped right <eol> in and as we jumped in, <eob> all sorts of ideas <eol> started flying at us. <eob>
People said, "Let's change <eol> the way we recruit teachers, <eob> let's hire new principals and train them <eob> and send them <eol> on international learning tours, <eob> let's put technology inside classrooms." <eob> By the end of week one, <eol> we had 50 ideas on the table, <eob> all amazing, all sounded right. <eob>
There was no way we were going <eol> to be able to implement 50 things. <eob>
So I said, "Hang on, stop. <eob>
Let's first at least decide what is <eol> it we're trying to achieve." <eob> So with a lot of push and pull <eol> and debate, <eob> Haryana set itself a goal <eol> which said: by 2020, <eob> we want 80 percent of our children <eol> to be at grade-level knowledge. <eob>
Now the specifics of the goal <eol> don't matter here, <eob> but what matters is how specific <eol> the goal is. <eob>
Because it really allowed us <eol> to take all those ideas <eob> which were being thrown at us <eob> and say which ones <eol> we were going to implement. <eob>
Does this idea support this goal? <eob>
If yes, let's keep it. <eob>
But if it doesn't or we're not sure, <eol> then let's put it aside. <eob>
As simple as it sounds, having <eol> a very specific goal right up front <eob> has really allowed us <eol> to be very sharp and focused <eob> in our transformation journey. <eob>
And looking back over the last <eol> two and a half years, <eob> that has been a huge positive for us. <eob>
So we had the goal, <eob> and now we needed to figure out <eol> what are the issues, what is broken. <eob>
Before we went into schools, <eol> a lot of people told us <eob> that education quality is poor <eob> because either the teachers are lazy, <eol> they don't come into schools, <eob> or they're incapable, <eol> they actually don't know how to teach. <eob>
Well, when we went inside schools, <eol> we found something completely different. <eob>
On most days, most teachers <eol> were actually inside schools. <eob>
And when you spoke with them, <eob> you realized they were perfectly <eol> capable of teaching elementary classes. <eob>
But they were not teaching. <eob>
I went to a school <eob> where the teachers <eol> were getting the construction of a classroom <eob> and a toilet supervised. <eob>
I went to another school <eob> where two of the teachers <eol> had gone to a nearby bank branch <eob> to deposit scholarship money <eol> into kids' accounts. <eob>
At lunchtime, most teachers <eol> were spending all of their time <eob> getting the midday meal cooking, <eol> supervised and served to the students. <eob>
So we asked the teachers, <eob> "What's going on, why <eol> are you not teaching?" <eob> And they said, "This is what's expected of us. <eob>
When a supervisor comes to visit us, <eob> these are exactly the things <eol> that he checks. <eob>
Has the toilet been made, <eol> has the meal been served. <eob>
When my principal goes <eol> to a meeting at headquarters, <eob> these are exactly the things <eol> which are discussed." <eob>
You see, what had happened was, <eol> over the last two decades, <eob> India had been fighting the challenge <eol> of access, having enough schools, <eob> and enrollment, bringing children <eol> into the schools. <eob>
So the government launched <eol> a whole host of programs <eob> to address these challenges, <eob> and the teachers became <eol> the implicit executors of these programs. <eob>
Not explicitly, but implicitly. <eob>
And now, what was actually needed <eol> was not to actually train teachers further <eob> or to monitor their attendance <eob> but to tell them that what is most important <eob> is for them to go back inside classrooms <eol> and teach. <eob>
They needed to be monitored <eol> and measured and awarded <eob> on the quality of teaching <eob> and not on all sorts of other things. <eob>
So as we went through the education system, <eob> as we delved into it deeper, <eol> we found a few such core root causes <eob> which were determining, which were shaping <eol> how people behaved in the system. <eob>
And we realized that unless we change <eol> those specific things, <eob> we could do a number of other things. <eob> We could train, we could put <eol> technology into schools, <eob> but the system wouldn't change. <eob>
And addressing these non-obvious core issues <eob> became a key part of the program. <eob>
So, we had the goal <eob> and we had the issues, <eob> and now we needed to figure out <eol> what the solutions were. <eob>
We obviously did not want <eol> to recreate the wheel, <eob> so we said, "Let's look around <eol> and see what we can find." <eob> And we found these beautiful, <eol> small pilot experiments <eob> all over the country <eol> and all over the world. <eob>
Small things being done by NGOs, <eol> being done by foundations. <eob>
But what was also interesting <eol> was that none of them actually scaled. <eob>
All of them were limited to 50, <eol> 100 or 500 schools. <eob>
And here, we were looking <eol> for a solution for 15,000 schools. <eob>
So we looked into why, <eob> if these things actually work, <eol> why don't they actually scale? <eob>
What happens is that <eol> when a typical NGO comes in, <eob> they not only bring in their expertise <eob> but they also bring in additional resources. <eob>
So they might bring in money, <eob> they might bring in people, <eob> they might bring in technology. <eob>
And in the 50 or 100 schools <eol> that they actually operate in, <eob> those additional resources actually create a difference. <eob>
But now imagine that the head of this NGO <eob> goes to the head of the School Education Department <eob> and says, "Hey, now let's do this <eol> for 15,000 schools." <eob> Where is that guy or girl <eol> going to find the money <eob> to actually scale this up to 15,000 schools? <eob>
He doesn't have the additional money, <eob> he doesn't have the resources. <eob>
And hence, innovations don't scale. <eob>
So right at the beginning of the project, <eol> what we said was, <eob> "Whatever we have to do <eol> has to be scalable, <eob> it has to work in all 15,000 schools." <eob> And hence, it has to work <eol> within the existing budgets <eob> and resources that the state actually has. <eob>
Much easier said than done. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I think this was definitely <eol> the point in time <eob> when my team hated me. <eob>
We spent a lot of long hours in office, <eol> in cafés, <eob> sometimes even in bars, <eob> scratching out heads and saying, <eob> "Where are the solutions, <eol> how are we going to solve this problem?" <eob>
In the end, I think we did find solutions <eol> to many of the issues. <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob>
In the context of effective learning, <eob> one of the things people <eol> talk about is hands-on learning. <eob> Children shouldn't memorize things from books, <eob> they should do activities, <eob> and that's a more effective way to learn. <eob>
Which basically means giving students things <eob> like beads, learning <eol> rods, abacuses. <eob>
But we did not have <eol> the budgets to give that <eob> to 15,000 schools, 2 million children. <eob>
We needed another solution. <eob>
We couldn't think of anything. <eob>
One day, one of our team members <eol> went to a school <eob> and saw a teacher pick up sticks <eol> and stones from the garden outside <eob> and take them into the classroom <eob> and give them to the students. <eob>
That was a huge eureka moment for us. <eob>
So what happens now <eol> in the textbooks in Haryana <eob> is that after every concept, <eol> we have a little box <eob> which are instructions <eol> for the teachers which say, <eob> "To teach this concept, <eol> here's an activity that you can do. <eob>
And by the way, in order <eol> to actually do this activity, <eob> here are things that you can use <eol> from your immediate environment, <eob> whether it be the garden <eol> outside or the classroom inside, <eob> which can be used as learning aids for kids." <eob> And we see teachers <eol> all over Haryana <eob> using lots of innovative things <eol> to be able to teach students. <eob>
So in this way, whatever we designed, <eob> we were actually able to implement it <eob> across all 15,000 schools from day one. <eob>
Now, this brings me to my last point. <eob>
How do you implement something <eol> across 15,000 schools <eob> and 100,000 teachers? <eob>
The department used to have a process <eob> which is very interesting. <eob>
I like to call it <eol> "The Chain of Hope." <eob> They would write a letter from the headquarters <eob> and send it to the next level, <eob> which was the district offices. <eob>
They would hope that in each <eol> of these district offices, <eob> an officer would get the letter, <eol> would open it, read it <eob> and then forward it to the next level, <eob> which was the block offices. <eob>
And then you would hope <eol> that at the block office, <eob> somebody else got the letter, <eob> opened it, read it and forwarded it <eol> eventually to the 15,000 principals. <eob>
And then one would hope <eol> that the principals <eob> got the letter, received <eol> it, understood it <eob> and started implementing it. <eob>
It was a little bit ridiculous. <eob>
Now, we knew technology was the answer, <eob> but we also knew that <eol> most of these schools <eob> don't have a computer or email. <eob>
However, what the teachers <eol> do have are smartphones. <eob>
They're constantly on SMS, <eol> on Facebook and on WhatsApp. <eob>
So what now happens in Haryana is, <eob> all principals and teachers <eol> are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups <eob> and anytime something needs to be communicated, <eob> it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups. <eob>
It spreads like wildfire. <eob>
You can immediately check <eol> who has received it, <eob> who has read it. <eob>
Teachers can ask clarification <eol> questions instantaneously. <eob>
And what's interesting is, <eob> it's not just the headquarters <eol> who are answering these questions. <eob>
Another teacher from a completely different <eol> part of the state <eob> will stand up and answer the question. <eob>
Everybody's acting as <eol> everybody's peer group, <eob> and things are getting implemented. <eob>
So today, when you go <eol> to a school in Haryana, <eob> things look different. <eob>
The teachers are back inside classrooms, <eob> they're teaching. <eob>
Often with innovative techniques. <eob>
When a supervisor comes <eol> to visit the classroom, <eob> he or she not only checks <eol> the construction of the toilet <eob> but also what is the quality <eol> of teaching. <eob>
Once a quarter, all students <eol> across the state <eob> are assessed <eol> on their learning outcomes <eob> and schools which are doing <eol> well are rewarded. <eob>
And schools which are not doing so well <eob> find themselves having <eol> difficult conversations. <eob>
Of course, they also get additional support <eob> to be able to do <eob> better in the future. <eob>
In the context of education, <eob> it's very difficult <eol> to see results quickly. <eob>
When people talk about systemic, <eol> large-scale change, <eob> they talk about periods <eol> of 7 years and 10 years. <eob>
But not in Haryana. <eob>
In the last one year, <eol> there have been three independent studies, <eob> all measuring student learning outcomes, <eob> which indicate that something fundamental, <eob> something unique is happening in Haryana. <eob>
Learning levels of children <eol> have stopped declining, <eob> and they have started going up. <eob>
Haryana is one of the few states <eol> in the country <eob> which is showing an improvement, <eob> and certainly the one <eol> that is showing the fastest rate of improvement. <eob>
These are still early signs, <eob> there's a long way to go, <eob> but this gives us a lot <eol> of hope for the future. <eob>
I recently went to a school, <eob> and as I was leaving, <eob> I ran into a lady, <eob> her name was Parvati, <eob> she was the mother of a child, <eob> and she was smiling. <eob>
And I said, "Why are you smiling, <eol> what's going on?" <eob> And she said, "I don't know what's going on, <eob> but what I do know is that my children <eol> are learning, <eob> they're having fun, <eob> and for the time being, <eol> I'll stop my search for a private school <eob> to send them to." <eob>
So I go back to where I started: <eob> Can government systems transform? <eob>
I certainly believe so. <eob>
I think if you give them the right levers, <eob> they can move mountains. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I was a kid, <eob> I experienced something so powerful, <eob> I spent the rest of my life searching for it, <eob> and in all the wrong places. <eob>
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality. <eob> It was music. <eob> And this is where the story begins. <eob>
That's me, <eob> listening to the Beatles' "White Album." <eob> And the look on my face is the feeling <eob> that I've been searching for ever since. <eob>
Music goes straight to the emotional vein, <eob> into your bloodstream <eob> and right into your heart. <eob>
It deepens every experience. <eob> Fellas? <eob>
(Music) <eob>
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert <eob> and Joshua Roman. <eob> Music -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Yeah. <eob>
Music makes everything <eol> have more emotional resonance. <eob>
Let's see how it does for this talk. <eob>
The right piece of music at the right <eol> time fuses with us <eob> on a cellular level. <eob>
When I hear that one song <eob> from that one summer <eob> with that one girl, <eob> I'm instantly transported <eol> back there again. <eob> Hey, Stacey. <eob>
Here's a part of the story, though, <eol> where I got a little greedy. <eob>
I thought if I added more layers <eol> on top of the music, <eob> I could make the feelings <eol> even more powerful. <eob>
So I got into directing music videos. <eob>
This is what they looked like. <eob>
That's my brother, Jeff. <eob> Sorry about this, Jeff. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's me, just so we're even. <eob> Incredible moves. <eob> Should've been a dancer. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
These experiments grew, <eob> and in time, started to look <eol> more like this. <eob>
In both, I'm searching <eol> for the same thing, though, <eob> to capture that lightning in a bottle. <eob>
Except, I'm not. <eob>
Adding moving pictures over the music <eol> added narrative dimension, yes, <eob> but never quite equated the power <eob> that just raw music had for me <eol> on its own. <eob>
This is not a great thing to realize <eol> when you've devoted your life <eob> and professional career to becoming <eol> a music video director. <eob>
I kept asking myself, did <eol> I take the wrong path? <eob>
So I started thinking: if I could involve <eol> you, the audience, more, <eob> I might be able to make you feel <eol> something more as well. <eob>
So Aaron Koblin and I began <eol> auditioning new technologies <eob> that could put more of you inside of the work, <eob> like your childhood home in <eol> "The Wilderness Downtown," <eob> your hand-drawn portraits, <eol> in "The Johnny Cash Project," <eob> and your interactive dreams <eob> in "3 Dreams of Black." <eob> We were pushing beyond the screen, <eob> trying to connect more deeply <eob> to people's hearts and imaginations. <eob>
But it wasn't quite enough. <eob>
It still didn't have the raw experiential power <eol> of pure music for me. <eob>
So I started chasing <eol> a new technology <eob> that I only had read about <eol> in science fiction. <eob>
And after years of searching, <eol> I found a prototype. <eob>
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña <eol> in Mark Bolas's lab in USC. <eob>
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it. <eob>
I could taste the lightning. <eob>
It was called virtual reality. <eob>
This was it five years ago <eol> when I ran into it. <eob>
This is what it looks like now. <eob>
I quickly started building things <eol> in this new medium, <eob> and through that process <eol> we realized something: <eob> that VR is going to play <eol> an incredibly important role <eob> in the history of mediums. <eob>
In fact, it's going to be the last one. <eob>
I mean this because it's the first medium <eol> that actually makes the jump <eob> from our internalization of an author's expression <eob> of an experience, <eob> to our experiencing it firsthand. <eob> You look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If we go back to the origins <eol> of mediums, <eob> by all best guesses, <eob> it starts around a fire, <eol> with a good story. <eob>
Our clan leader is telling us <eob> about how he hunted the woolly mammoth <eol> on the tundra that day. <eob>
We hear his words <eob> and translate them into our own internal truths. <eob>
The same thing happens <eob> when we look at the cave <eol> painting version of the story, <eob> the book about the mammoth hunt, <eob> the play, <eob> the radio broadcast, <eob> the television show <eob> or the movie. <eob>
All of these mediums require <eol> what we call "suspension of disbelief," <eob> because there's a translation gap <eol> between the reality of the story <eob> and our consciousness interpreting the story <eob> into our reality. <eob>
I'm using the word "consciousness" <eol> as a feeling of reality that we get <eob> from our senses experiencing <eol> the world around us. <eob>
Virtual reality bridges that gap. <eob>
Now, you are on the tundra hunting <eol> with the clan leader. <eob>
Or you are the clan leader. <eob> Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So here's what special about VR. <eob>
In all other mediums, <eob> your consciousness interprets the medium. <eob>
In VR, your consciousness is the medium. <eob>
So the potential for VR is enormous. <eob>
But where are we now? <eob>
What is the current state of the art? <eob>
Well, <eob> we are here. <eob>
We are the equivalent <eol> of year one of cinema. <eob>
This is the Lumière Brothers film <eob> that allegedly sent a theater <eol> full of people running for their lives <eob> as they thought a train was coming toward them. <eob>
Similar to this early stage <eol> of this medium, <eob> in VR, we also have to move past the spectacle <eob> and into the storytelling. <eob>
It took this medium decades <eob> to figure out its preferred <eol> language of storytelling, <eob> in the form of a feature film. <eob>
In VR today, we're more learning grammar <eob> than writing language. <eob>
We've made 15 films <eol> in the last year at our VR company, Vrse, <eob> and we've learned a few things. <eob>
We found that we have a unique, <eol> direct path into your senses, <eob> your emotions, even your body. <eob>
So let me show you some things. <eob>
For the purpose of this demo, <eob> we're going to take every direction <eol> that you could possibly look, <eob> and stretch it into this giant rectangle. <eob> OK, here we go. <eob>
So, first: camera movement <eol> is tricky in VR. <eob>
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick. <eob>
We found if you move the camera <eol> at a constant speed in a straight line, <eob> you can actually get away with it, though. <eob>
The first day in film school, <eob> they told me you have to learn <eol> every single rule <eob> before you can break one. <eob>
We have not learned every single rule. <eob>
We've barely learned any at all, <eob> but we're already trying to break them <eob> to see what kind of creative things <eol> we can accomplish. <eob>
In this shot here, where we're moving <eol> up off the ground, I added acceleration. <eob>
I did that because I wanted <eol> to give you a physical sensation <eob> of moving up off the ground. <eob>
In VR, I can give that to you. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot <eol> in this medium as well. <eob>
It guides us how to feel. <eob>
In this project we made <eol> with the New York Times, Zach Richter <eob> and our friend, JR, <eob> we take you up in a helicopter, <eob> and even though you're flying <eol> 2,000 feet above Manhattan, <eob> you don't feel afraid. <eob>
You feel triumphant for JR's character. <eob>
The music guides you there. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
Contrary to popular belief, <eob> there is composition in virtual reality, <eob> but it's completely different <eol> than in film, <eob> where you have a rectangular frame. <eob>
Composition is now where <eol> your consciousness exists <eob> and how the world moves around you. <eob>
In this film, "Waves of Grace," <eol> which was a collaboration between Vrse, <eob> the United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail, <eob> we also see the changing role <eol> of the close-up in virtual reality. <eob> A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone. <eob>
It brings that character inside <eol> of your personal space, <eob> a space that we'd usually reserve <eol> for the people that we love. <eob>
And you feel an emotional closeness <eol> to the character <eob> because of what you feel <eol> to be a physical closeness. <eob>
Directing VR is not like directing <eol> for the rectangle. <eob>
It's more of a choreography <eol> of the viewer's attention. <eob>
One tool we can use <eol> to guide your attention <eob> is called "spatialized sound." <eob> I can put a sound anywhere <eol> in front of you, to left or right, <eob> even behind you, <eob> and when you turn your head, <eol> the sound will rotate accordingly. <eob>
So I can use that to direct your attention <eol> to where I want you to see. <eob>
Next time you hear someone <eol> singing over your shoulder, <eob> it might be Bono. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
VR makes us feel like <eol> we are part of something. <eob>
For most of human history, <eol> we lived in small family units. <eob> We started in caves, <eob> then moved to clans and tribes, <eol> then villages and towns, <eob> and now we're all global citizens. <eob>
But I believe that we are still <eol> hardwired to care the most <eob> about the things that are local to us. <eob>
And VR makes anywhere <eol> and anyone feel local. <eob>
That's why it works as an empathy machine. <eob>
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you <eol> to a Syrian refugee camp, <eob> and instead of watching a story <eol> about people over there, <eob> it's now a story about us here. <eob>
But where do we go from here? <eob>
The tricky thing is that <eol> with all previous mediums, <eob> the format is fixed at its birth. <eob>
Film has been a sequence of rectangles, <eob> from Muybridge and his horses to now. <eob>
The format has never changed. <eob>
But VR as a format, as a medium, <eob> isn't complete yet. <eob>
It's not using physical celluloid <eol> or paper or TV signals. <eob>
It actually employs what we use <eol> to make sense of the world. <eob>
We're using your senses <eol> as the paints on the canvas, <eob> but only two right now. <eob>
Eventually, we can see if we will have <eol> all of our human senses employed, <eob> and we will have agency to live the story <eol> in any path we choose. <eob>
And we call it virtual reality right now, <eob> but what happens when we move <eol> past simulated realities? <eob> What do we call it then? <eob> What if instead of verbally <eol> telling you about a dream, <eob> I could let you live inside that dream? <eob>
What if instead of just experiencing <eol> visiting some reality on Earth, <eob> you could surf gravitational waves <eol> on the edge of a black hole, <eob> or create galaxies from scratch, <eob> or communicate with each other not using words <eob> but using our raw thoughts? <eob>
That's not a virtual reality anymore. <eob>
And honestly I don't know <eol> what that's called. <eob>
But I hope you see where we're going. <eob>
But here I am, intellectualizing <eol> a medium I'm saying is experiential. <eob> So let's experience it. <eob>
Tap on the power button <eol> to unlock the phone. <eob> For the people watching at home, <eob> we're going to put up a card right now <eob> to show you how to download this experience <eol> on your phone yourself, <eob> and even get a Google cardboard <eol> of your own to try it with. <eob>
We played in cardboard boxes as kids, <eob> and as adults, I'm hoping <eol> we can all find a little bit of that lightning <eob> by sticking our head in one again. <eob>
You're about to participate <eob> in the largest collective VR viewing in history. <eob>
And in that classic old-timey style <eol> of yesteryear, <eob> we're all going to watch something <eob> at the exact same time, together. <eob>
Let's hope it works. <eob>
What's the countdown look like? <eob>
I can't see. <eob>
(Video) JR: Let me tell you <eob> how I shot the cover <eol> of the New York Times Magazine, <eob> "Walking New York." <eob> I just got strapped on outside the helicopter, <eob> and I had to be perfectly <eol> vertical so I could grab it. <eob>
And when I was perfectly above -- <eob> you know, with the wind, <eol> we had to redo it a few times -- <eob> then I kept shooting. <eob>
(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord, <eob> protect us from evil, <eob> for you are the Lord, <eob> the light. <eob>
You who gave us life took it away. <eob>
Let your will be done. <eob>
Please bring peace to the many <eol> who have lost loved ones. <eob> Help us to live again. <eob>
Child's voice: There are more kids <eol> in Zaatari than adults right now. <eob>
Sometimes I think <eob> we are the ones in charge. <eob>
Chris Milk: How was it? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
That was a cheap way of getting you <eol> to do a standing ovation. <eob>
I just made you all stand. <eob>
I knew you'd applaud at the end. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I believe that everyone <eol> on Earth needs to experience <eob> what you just experienced. <eob>
That way we can collectively <eol> start to shape this, <eob> not as a tech platform <eob> but as a humanity platform. <eob>
And to that end, in November of last year, <eob> the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced." <eob> It launched with one million Google Cardboards <eob> sent out to every Sunday subscriber <eol> with their newspaper. <eob>
But a funny thing happened <eol> that Sunday morning. <eob>
A lot of people got them <eob> that were not the intended recipients <eol> on the mailing label. <eob>
And we started seeing this <eol> all over Instagram. <eob> Look familiar? <eob>
Music led me on a path <eob> of searching for what seemed <eol> like the unattainable <eob> for a very long time. <eob>
Now, millions of kids just had <eol> the same formative experience <eob> in their childhood <eob> that I had in mine. <eob>
Only I think this one <eob> surpasses it. <eob>
Let's see <eob> where this <eob> leads them. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
As a little Hawaiian, <eob> my mom and auntie always told me <eol> stories about Kalaupapa -- <eob> the Hawaiian leper colony <eob> surrounded by the highest <eol> sea cliffs in the world -- <eob> and Father Damien, <eob> the Belgian missionary who gave his life <eol> for the Hawaiian community. <eob>
As a young nurse, <eob> my aunt trained the nuns <eol> caring for the remaining lepers <eob> almost a 100 years after <eol> Father Damien died of leprosy. <eob>
I remember stories she told <eob> about traveling down <eol> switchback cliff paths on a mule, <eob> while my uncle played <eol> her favorite hula songs on the ukulele <eob> all the way down to Kalaupapa. <eob>
You see, as a youngster, <eob> I was always curious about a few things. <eob>
First was why a Belgian missionary <eol> chose to live in complete isolation <eob> in Kalaupapa, <eob> knowing he would inevitably <eol> contract leprosy <eob> from the community of people <eol> he sought to help. <eob>
And secondly, <eob> where did the leprosy bacteria come from? <eob>
And why were Kānaka Maoli, <eob> the indigenous people of Hawaii, <eob> so susceptible to developing <eol> leprosy, or "mai Pake?" <eob>
This got my curious about what <eol> makes us unique as Hawaiians -- <eob> namely, our genetic makeup. <eob>
But it wasn't until high school, <eob> through the Human Genome Project, <eob> that I realized I wasn't alone <eob> in trying to connect <eol> our unique genetic ancestry <eob> to our potential health, <eol> wellness and illness. <eob>
You see, <eob> the 2.7 billion-dollar project <eob> promised an era of predictive <eol> and preventative medicine <eob> based on our unique genetic makeup. <eob>
So to me it always seemed obvious <eob> that in order to achieve this dream, <eob> we would need to sequence <eol> a diverse cohort of people <eob> to obtain the full spectrum <eol> of human genetic variation on the planet. <eob>
That's why 10 years later, <eob> it continues to shock me, <eob> knowing that 96 percent of genome studies <eob> associating common genetic variation <eol> with specific diseases <eob> have focused exclusively <eol> on individuals of European ancestry. <eob>
Now you don't need a PhD <eob> to see that that leaves four percent <eol> for the rest of diversity. <eob>
And in my own searching, <eob> I've discovered that far less <eol> than one percent <eob> have actually focused on indigenous <eol> communities, like myself. <eob>
So that begs the question: <eob> Who is the Human Genome <eol> Project actually for? <eob>
Just like we have <eol> different colored eyes and hair, <eob> we metabolize drugs differently <eob> based on the variation in our genomes. <eob>
So how many of you <eol> would be shocked to learn <eob> that 95 percent of clinical trials <eob> have also exclusively featured <eol> individuals of European ancestry? <eob>
This bias <eob> and systematic lack of engagement <eol> of indigenous people <eob> in both clinical trials <eol> and genome studies <eob> is partially the result <eol> of a history of distrust. <eob>
For example, <eob> in 1989, researchers <eol> from Arizona State University <eob> obtained blood samples <eol> from Arizona's Havasupai tribe, <eob> promising to alleviate the burden <eol> of type 2 diabetes <eob> that was plaguing their community, <eob> only to turn around and use <eol> those exact same samples -- <eob> without the Havasupai's consent -- <eob> to study rates <eol> of schizophrenia, inbreeding, <eob> and challenge <eol> the Havasupai's origin story. <eob>
When the Havasupai found out, <eob> they sued successfully for $700,000, <eob> and they banned ASU from conducting <eol> research on their reservation. <eob>
This culminated in a sort of domino effect <eob> with local tribes in the Southwest -- <eob> including the Navajo Nation, <eob> one of the largest <eol> tribes in the country -- <eob> putting a moratorium on genetic research. <eob>
Now despite this history of distrust, <eob> I still believe that indigenous people <eol> can benefit from genetic research. <eob>
And if we don't do something soon, <eob> the gap in health disparities <eol> is going to continue to widen. <eob>
Hawaii, for example, <eob> has the longest life expectancy <eol> on average of any state in the US, <eob> yet native Hawaiians like myself <eob> die a full decade <eol> before our non-native counterparts, <eob> because we have some <eol> of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes, <eob> obesity, <eob> and the number one and number <eol> two killers in the US: <eob> cardiovascular disease and cancer. <eob>
So how do we ensure <eob> the populations of people <eol> that need genome sequencing the most <eob> are not the last to benefit? <eob>
My vision is to make <eol> genetic research more native, <eob> to indigenize genome <eol> sequencing technology. <eob>
Traditionally, genomes <eol> are sequenced in laboratories. <eob>
Here's an image of your classic <eol> genome sequencer. <eob> It's huge. <eob> It's the size of a refrigerator. <eob> There's this obvious physical limitation. <eob>
But what if you could sequence <eol> genomes on the fly? <eob>
What if you could fit a genome <eol> sequencer in your pocket? <eob>
This nanopore-based sequencer <eob> is one 10,000th the size <eol> of your traditional genome sequencer. <eob>
It doesn't have the same <eol> physical limitations, <eob> in that it's not tethered to a lab bench <eol> with extraneous cords, <eob> large vats of chemicals <eol> or computer monitors. <eob>
It allows us to de-black box genome <eol> sequencing technology development <eob> in a way that's immersive <eol> and collaborative, <eob> activating and empowering <eol> indigenous communities ... <eob> as citizen scientists. <eob>
100 years later <eob> in Kalaupapa, <eob> we now have the technology to sequence <eol> leprosy bacteria in real time, <eob> using mobile genome sequencers, <eob> remote access to the Internet <eob> and cloud computation. <eob>
But only if that's what <eol> Hawaiian people want. <eob>
In our space, <eob> on our terms. <eob>
IndiGenomics is about science <eol> for the people by the people. <eob>
We'll be starting with a tribal <eol> consultation resource, <eob> focused on educating <eol> indigenous communities <eob> on the potential use and misuse <eol> of genetic information. <eob>
Eventually we'd like to have our own <eol> IndiGenomics research institute <eob> to conduct our own experiments <eob> and educate the next generation <eol> of indigenous scientists. <eob>
In the end, <eob> indigenous people need to be partners in <eol> and not subjects of genetic research. <eob>
And for those on the outside, <eob> just as Father Damien did, <eob> the research community needs <eol> to immerse itself in indigenous culture <eob> or die trying. <eob>
Mahalo. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'll never forget the sound <eob> of laughing with my friends. <eob>
I'll never forget the sound <eob> of my mother's voice <eol> right before I fell asleep. <eob>
And I'll never forget <eol> the comforting sound of water <eob> trickling down a stream. <eob>
Imagine my fear, pure fear, <eob> when, at the age of 10, <eob> I was told I was going to lose my hearing. <eob>
And over the next five years, <eob> it progressed until I was classified <eol> as profoundly deaf. <eob>
But I believe that losing my hearing <eob> was one of the greatest gifts <eol> I've ever received. <eob>
You see, I get to experience <eol> the world in a unique way. <eob>
And I believe that <eol> these unique experiences <eob> that people with disabilities have <eob> is what's going to help us <eol> make and design a better world <eob> for everyone -- both for people <eol> with and without disabilities. <eob>
I used to be a disability rights lawyer, <eob> and I spent a lot of my time <eol> focused on enforcing the law, <eob> ensuring that accommodations were made. <eob>
And then I had to quickly <eol> learn international policy, <eob> because I was asked to work <eol> on the UN Convention <eob> that protects people with disabilities. <eob>
As the leader of the NGO there, <eob> I spent most of my energy <eol> trying to convince people <eob> about the capabilities <eol> of people with disabilities. <eob>
But somewhere along the way, <eob> and after many career transitions <eob> that my parents weren't so happy about -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I stumbled upon a solution <eob> that I believe may be <eol> an even more powerful tool <eob> to solve some of the world's <eol> greatest problems, <eob> disability or not. <eob>
And that tool is called design thinking. <eob>
Design thinking is a process <eol> for innovation and problem solving. <eob>
There are five steps. <eob>
The first is defining the problem <eob> and understanding its constraints. <eob>
The second is observing people <eol> in real-life situations <eob> and empathizing with them. <eob>
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas -- <eol> the more the better, <eob> the wilder the better. <eob>
Fourth, prototyping: <eol> gathering whatever you can, <eob> whatever you can find, <eob> to mimic your solution, to test it <eob> and to refine it. <eob>
And finally, implementation: <eob> ensuring that the solution <eol> you came up with is sustainable. <eob>
Warren Berger says that design thinking <eol> teaches us to look sideways, <eob> to reframe, to refine, to experiment <eob> and, probably most importantly, <eob> ask those stupid questions. <eob>
Design thinkers believe <eol> that everyone is creative. <eob>
They believe in bringing people <eol> from multiple disciplines together, <eob> because they want to share <eol> multiple perspectives <eob> and bring them together <eol> and ultimately merge them <eob> to form something new. <eob>
Design thinking is such a successful <eol> and versatile tool <eob> that it has been applied <eol> in almost every industry. <eob>
I saw the potential that it had <eol> for the issues I faced, <eob> so I decided to go back to school <eob> and get my master's in social design. <eob>
This looks at how to use design <eol> to create positive change in the world. <eob>
While I was there, <eob> I fell in love with woodworking. <eob>
But what I quickly realized <eob> was that I was missing out on something. <eob>
As you're working with a tool, <eob> right before it's about <eol> to kick back at you -- <eob> which means the piece or the tool <eol> jumps back at you -- <eob> it makes a sound. <eob>
And I couldn't hear this sound. <eob>
So I decided, <eob> why not try and solve it? <eob>
My solution was a pair of safety glasses <eob> that were engineered <eol> to visually alert the user <eob> to pitch changes in the tool, <eob> before the human ear could pick it up. <eob>
Why hadn't tool designers <eol> thought of this before? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner. <eob>
I wasn't weighed down by expertise <eol> or conventional wisdom. <eob>
The second is: I was Deaf. <eob>
My unique experience of the world <eol> helped inform my solution. <eob>
disability or not. <eob> And as I went on, I kept running into <eol> more and more solutions <eob> that were originally made <eol> for people with disabilities, <eob> and that ended up being picked up, <eob> embraced and loved by the mainstream, <eob>
This is an OXO potato peeler. <eob>
It was originally designed <eol> for people with arthritis, <eob> but it was so comfortable, <eol> everybody loved it. <eob>
Text messaging: that was originally <eol> designed for people who are Deaf. <eob>
And as you know, <eol> everybody loves that, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I started thinking: <eob> What if we changed our mindset? <eob>
What if we started designing <eol> for disability first -- <eob> not the norm? <eob>
As you see, when we design <eol> for disability first, <eob> we often stumble upon <eol> solutions that are not only inclusive, <eob> but also are often better <eol> than when we design for the norm. <eob>
And this excites me, <eob> because this means that the energy <eol> it takes to accommodate someone <eob> with a disability <eob> can be leveraged, molded and played with <eob> as a force for creativity and innovation. <eob>
This moves us from the mindset <eol> of trying to change the hearts <eob> and the deficiency mindset of tolerance, <eob> to becoming an alchemist, <eob> the type of magician that this world <eol> so desperately needs <eob> to solve some of its greatest problems. <eob>
Now, I also believe <eob> that people with disabilities have <eob> great potential to be designers <eob> within this design-thinking process. <eob>
Without knowing it, from a very early age, <eob> I've been a design thinker, <eol> fine-tuning my skills. <eob>
Design thinkers are, by nature, <eol> problem solvers. <eob>
So imagine listening to a conversation <eob> and only understanding <eol> 50 percent of what is said. <eob>
You can't ask them to repeat <eol> every single word. <eob>
They would just get frustrated with you. <eob>
So without even realizing it, <eob> my solution was to take <eol> the muffled sound I heard, <eob> that was the beat, <eob> and turn it into a rhythm <eol> and place it with the lips I read. <eob>
Years later, someone commented <eol> that my writing had a rhythm to it. <eob>
Well, this is because I experience <eol> conversations as rhythms. <eob>
I also became really, <eol> really good at failing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Quite literally. <eob> My first semester in Spanish, I got a D. <eob> But what I learned <eol> was that when I picked myself up <eob> and changed a few things around, <eob> eventually, I succeeded. <eob>
Similarly, design thinking <eol> encourages people to fail <eob> and fail often, <eob> because eventually, you will succeed. <eob>
Very few great innovations in this world <eob> have come from someone succeeding <eol> on the first try. <eob>
I also experienced this lesson in sports. <eob>
I'll never forget my coach <eol> saying to my mom, <eob> "If she just didn't have her hearing loss, <eob> she would be on the national team." <eob> But what my coach, and what I <eol> didn't even know at the time, <eob> was that my hearing loss <eol> actually helped me excel at sports. <eob>
You see, when you lose your hearing, <eol> not only do you adapt your behavior, <eob> but you also adapt your physical senses. <eob>
One example of this <eob> is that my visual <eol> attention span increased. <eob>
Imagine a soccer player, <eol> coming down the left flank. <eob>
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was, <eob> and the ball is coming <eol> down the left flank. <eob>
A person with normal hearing <eol> would have the visual perspective of this. <eob>
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide. <eob>
So I picked up the players over here, <eob> that were moving about <eol> and coming down the field. <eob>
And I picked them up quicker, <eol> so that if the ball was passed, <eob> I could reposition myself <eol> and be ready for that shot. <eob>
So as you can see, <eob> I've been a design thinker <eol> for nearly all my life. <eob>
My observation skills have been honed <eol> so that I pick up on things <eob> that others would never pick up on. <eob>
My constant need to adapt <eol> has made me a great ideator <eob> and problem solver. <eob>
And I've often had to do this <eol> within limitations and constraints. <eob>
This is something that designers <eol> also have to deal with frequently. <eob>
My work most recently took me to Haiti. <eob>
Design thinkers often seek out <eol> extreme situations, <eob> because that often informs <eol> some of their best designs. <eob>
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm. <eob>
I lived and worked <eol> with 300 Deaf individuals <eob> that were relocated <eol> after the 2010 earthquake. <eob>
But five and a half years later, <eob> there still was no electricity; <eob> there still was no safe drinking water; <eob> there were still no job opportunities; <eob> there was still rampant crime, <eol> and it went unpunished. <eob>
International aid organizations <eol> came one by one. <eob>
But they came <eob> with pre-determined solutions. <eob>
They didn't come ready <eol> to observe and to adapt <eob> based on the community's needs. <eob>
One organization gave them <eol> goats and chickens. <eob>
But they didn't realize <eob> that there was so much hunger <eol> in that community, <eob> that when the Deaf went to sleep <eol> at night and couldn't hear, <eob> people broke into their yards <eol> and their homes <eob> and stole these chickens and goats, <eob> and eventually they were all gone. <eob>
Now, if that organization <eol> had taken the time <eob> to observe Deaf people, <eol> to observe the community, <eob> they would have realized their problem <eob> and perhaps they would have <eol> come up with a solution, <eob> something like a solar light, <eob> lighting up a secure pen <eol> to put them in at night <eob> to ensure their safety. <eob>
You don't have to be a design thinker <eob> to insert the ideas <eol> I've shared with you today. <eob> You are creative. <eob> You are a designer -- <eob> everyone is. <eob>
Let people like me help you. <eob>
Let people with disabilities <eol> help you look sideways, <eob> and in the process, <eob> solve some of the greatest problems. <eob>
That's it. Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What an intriguing group <eol> of individuals you are ... <eob> to a psychologist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I've had the opportunity <eol> over the last couple of days <eob> of listening in on some of your conversations <eob> and watching you interact with each other. <eob>
And I think it's fair to say, already, <eob> that there are 47 people in this audience, <eob> at this moment, <eob> displaying psychological symptoms <eol> I would like to discuss today. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I thought you might like <eol> to know who you are. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But instead of pointing at you, <eob> which would be gratuitous <eol> and intrusive, <eob> I thought I would tell you <eol> a few facts and stories, <eob> in which you may catch <eol> a glimpse of yourself. <eob>
I'm in the field of research <eol> known as personality psychology, <eob> which is part of a larger personality science <eob> which spans the full spectrum, <eol> from neurons to narratives. <eob>
And what we try to do, <eob> in our own way, <eob> is to make sense of how each of us -- <eob> each of you -- <eob> is, in certain respects, <eob> like all other people, <eob> like some other people <eob> and like no other person. <eob>
Now, already you may be saying of yourself, <eob> "I'm not intriguing. <eob> I am the 46th most boring person <eol> in the Western Hemisphere." <eob> Or you may say of yourself, <eob> "I am intriguing, <eob> even if I am regarded by most people <eol> as a great, thundering twit." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness <eol> and your inherent "twitiness" <eob> that makes me, as a psychologist, <eol> really fascinated by you. <eob>
So let me explain why this is so. <eob>
One of the most influential approaches <eol> in personality science <eob> is known as trait psychology, <eob> and it aligns you along five dimensions <eol> which are normally distributed, <eob> and that describe universally held aspects <eol> of difference between people. <eob>
They spell out the acronym OCEAN. <eob>
So, "O" stands for "open to experience," <eob> versus those who are more closed. <eob> "C" stands for "conscientiousness," <eob> in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. <eob> "E" -- "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people. <eob> "A" -- "agreeable individuals," <eob> in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. <eob>
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals," <eob> in contrast to those who are more stable. <eob>
All of these dimensions <eol> have implications for our well-being, <eob> for how our life goes. <eob>
And so we know that, for example, <eob> openness and conscientiousness <eol> are very good predictors of life success, <eob> but the open people achieve <eol> that success through being audacious <eob> and, occasionally, odd. <eob>
The conscientious people <eol> achieve it through sticking to deadlines, <eob> to persevering, as well as having some passion. <eob>
Extroversion and agreeableness <eol> are both conducive <eob> to working well with people. <eob>
Extroverts, for example, <eol> I find intriguing. <eob>
With my classes, <eol> I sometimes give them a basic fact <eob> that might be revealing <eol> with respect to their personality: <eob> I tell them that it is virtually impossible <eol> for adults <eob> to lick the outside of their own elbow. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Did you know that? <eob> Already, some of you have tried to lick <eol> the outside of your own elbow. <eob>
But extroverts amongst you <eob> are probably those who have <eol> not only tried, <eob> but they have successfully licked the elbow <eob> of the person sitting next to them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Those are the extroverts. <eob>
Let me deal in a bit more detail <eol> with extroversion, <eob> because it's consequential <eol> and it's intriguing, <eob> and it helps us understand <eol> what I call our three natures. <eob>
First, our biogenic nature -- <eol> our neurophysiology. <eob>
Second, our sociogenic or second nature, <eob> which has to do with the cultural <eol> and social aspects of our lives. <eob>
And third, what makes you individually <eol> you -- idiosyncratic -- <eob> what I call your "idiogenic" nature. <eob>
Let me explain. <eob> One of the things <eob> that characterizes extroverts <eol> is they need stimulation. <eob>
And that stimulation can be achieved <eol> by finding things that are exciting: <eob> loud noises, parties <eol> and social events here at TED -- <eob> you see the extroverts forming <eol> a magnetic core. <eob>
They all gather together. <eob>
And I've seen you. <eob>
The introverts are more likely to spend <eol> time in the quiet spaces <eob> up on the second floor, <eob> where they are able to reduce stimulation -- <eob> and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, <eob> but you're not necessarily <eol> antisocial. <eob>
It may be that you simply <eol> realize that you do better <eob> when you have a chance to lower <eol> that level of stimulation. <eob>
Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, <eol> from your body. <eob>
Caffeine, for example, works much better <eol> with extroverts than it does introverts. <eob>
When extroverts come into the office <eol> at nine o'clock in the morning <eob> and say, "I really need a cup of coffee," <eob> they're not kidding -- <eob> they really do. <eob>
Introverts do not do as well, <eob> particularly if the tasks <eol> they're engaged in -- <eob> and they've had some coffee -- <eob> if those tasks are speeded, <eob> and if they're quantitative, <eob> introverts may give the appearance <eol> of not being particularly quantitative. <eob>
But it's a misconstrual. <eob>
So here are the consequences <eol> that are really quite intriguing: <eob> we're not always what seem to be, <eob> and that takes me to my next point. <eob>
I should say, before getting to this, <eob> something about sexual intercourse, <eob> although I may not have time. <eob>
And so, if you would like me to -- <eob> yes, you would? <eob> OK. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There are studies done <eob> on the frequency with which individuals <eol> engage in the conjugal act, <eob> as broken down by male, female; <eol> introvert, extrovert. <eob>
So I ask you: <eob> How many times per minute -- <eob> oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How many times per month <eob> do introverted men engage in the act? <eob> 3.0. <eob> Extroverted men? <eob> More or less? <eob> Yes, more. <eob> 5.5 -- almost twice as much. <eob>
Introverted women: 3.1. <eob> Extroverted women? <eob> Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, <eob> which I will explain later -- <eob> they are heroic. <eob> 7.5. <eob> They not only handle <eol> all the male extroverts, <eob> they pick up a few introverts as well. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We communicate differently, extroverts <eol> and introverts. <eob>
Extroverts, when they interact, <eob> want to have lots of social encounter <eol> punctuated by closeness. <eob>
They'd like to stand close <eol> for comfortable communication. <eob>
They like to have a lot of eye contact, <eob> or mutual gaze. <eob>
We found in some research <eob> that they use more diminutive <eol> terms when they meet somebody. <eob>
So when an extrovert meets a Charles, <eob> it rapidly becomes <eol> "Charlie," and then "Chuck," <eob> and then "Chuckles Baby." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Whereas for introverts, <eob> it remains "Charles," <eol> until he's given a pass to be more intimate <eob> by the person he's talking to. <eob> We speak differently. <eob> Extroverts prefer black-and-white, <eol> concrete, simple language. <eob>
Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you <eob> that I am as extreme an introvert <eol> as you could possibly imagine -- <eob> we speak differently. <eob>
We prefer contextually complex, <eob> contingent, <eob> weasel-word sentences -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
More or less? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
As it were. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Not to put too fine a point upon it -- <eob> like that. <eob>
When we talk, <eob> we sometimes talk past each other. <eob>
I had a consulting contract <eol> I shared with a colleague <eob> who's as different from me <eol> as two people can possibly be. <eob>
First, his name is Tom. <eob> Mine isn't. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Secondly, he's six foot five. <eob>
I have a tendency not to be. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And thirdly, he's as extroverted <eol> a person as you could find. <eob>
I am seriously introverted. <eob>
I overload so much, <eob> I can't even have a cup of coffee <eol> after three in the afternoon <eob> and expect to sleep in the evening. <eob>
We had seconded to this project <eol> a fellow called Michael. <eob>
And Michael almost brought the project <eol> to a crashing halt. <eob>
So the person who seconded him <eol> asked Tom and me, <eob> "What do you make of Michael?" <eob> Well, I'll tell you <eol> what Tom said in a minute. <eob>
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese." <eob> And here is how extroverted ears <eol> heard what I said, <eob> which is actually pretty accurate. <eob>
I said, "Well Michael does have <eol> a tendency at times <eob> of behaving in a way <eol> that some of us might see <eob> as perhaps more assertive <eol> than is normally called for." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Tom rolled his eyes and he said, <eob> "Brian, that's what I said: <eob> he's an asshole!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, as an introvert, <eob> I might gently allude <eol> to certain "assholic" qualities <eob> in this man's behavior, <eob> but I'm not going to lunge <eol> for the a-word. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the extrovert says, <eob> "If he walks like one, <eol> if he talks like one, I call him one." <eob> And we go past each other. <eob>
Now is this something <eol> that we should be heedful of? <eob> Of course. <eob> It's important that we know this. <eob>
Is that all we are? <eob>
Are we just a bunch of traits? <eob> No, we're not. <eob> Remember, you're <eob> like some other people <eob> and like no other person. <eob>
How about that idiosyncratic you? <eob>
As Elizabeth or as George, <eob> you may share your extroversion <eol> or your neuroticism. <eob>
But are there some distinctively <eol> Elizabethan features of your behavior, <eob> or Georgian of yours, <eob> that make us understand you better <eol> than just a bunch of traits? <eob>
That make us love you? <eob>
Not just because you're a certain <eol> type of person. <eob>
I'm uncomfortable <eol> putting people in pigeonholes. <eob>
I don't even think pigeons <eol> belong in pigeonholes. <eob>
So what is it that makes us different? <eob>
It's the doings that we have in our life -- <eol> the personal projects. <eob>
You have a personal project right now, <eob> but nobody may know it here. <eob>
It relates to your kid -- <eob> you've been back three times <eol> to the hospital, <eob> and they still don't know what's wrong. <eob>
Or it could be your mom. <eob>
And you'd been acting out of character. <eob>
These are free traits. <eob>
You're very agreeable, <eol> but you act disagreeably <eob> in order to break down those barriers <eol> of administrative torpor <eob> in the hospital, <eob> to get something for your mom <eol> or your child. <eob>
What are these free traits? <eob>
They're where we enact a script <eob> in order to advance a core <eol> project in our lives. <eob>
And they are what matters. <eob>
Don't ask people what type you are; <eob> ask them, "What are your core <eol> projects in your life?" <eob> And we enact those free traits. <eob>
I'm an introvert, <eob> but I have a core project, <eol> which is to profess. <eob>
I'm a professor. <eob>
And I adore my students, <eob> and I adore my field. <eob>
And I can't wait to tell them about <eol> what's new, what's exciting, <eob> what I can't wait <eol> to tell them about. <eob>
And so I act in an extroverted way, <eob> because at eight in the morning, <eob> the students need a little bit of humor, <eob> a little bit of engagement <eol> to keep them going <eob> in arduous days of study. <eob>
But we need to be very careful <eob> when we act protractedly out of character. <eob>
Sometimes we may find <eol> that we don't take care of ourselves. <eob>
I find, for example, after a period <eol> of pseudo-extroverted behavior, <eob> I need to repair somewhere on my own. <eob>
As Susan Cain said in her <eol> "Quiet" book, <eob> in a chapter that featured <eol> the strange Canadian professor <eob> who was teaching <eol> at the time at Harvard, <eob> I sometimes go to the men's room <eob> to escape the slings and arrows <eol> of outrageous extroverts. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I remember one particular day <eol> when I was retired to a cubicle, <eob> trying to avoid overstimulation. <eob>
And a real extrovert came in beside me -- <eol> not right in my cubicle, <eob> but in the next cubicle over -- <eob> and I could hear various evacuatory noises, <eob> which we hate -- even our own, <eob> that's why we flush <eol> during as well as after. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I heard <eol> this gravelly voice saying, <eob> "Hey, is that Dr. Little?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If anything is guaranteed <eol> to constipate an introvert for six months, <eob> it's talking on the john. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's where I'm going now. <eob>
Don't follow me. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
When we're designing new products, <eob> services or businesses, <eob> the only time you'll know <eol> if they're any good, <eob> if the designs are good, <eob> is to see how they're used <eol> in the real world, in context. <eob>
I'm reminded of that every time <eol> I walk past Highbury Fields <eob> in north London. <eob> It's absolutely beautiful. <eob> There's a big open green space. <eob>
There's Georgian buildings <eol> around the side. <eob>
But then there's this mud trap <eol> that cuts across the middle. <eob>
People clearly don't want to walk <eol> all the way around the edge. <eob> Instead, they want to take <eol> the shortcut, <eob> and that shortcut is self-reinforcing. <eob>
Now, this shortcut is called a desire path, <eob> and it's often the path <eol> of least resistance. <eob>
I find them fascinating, <eob> because they're often the point where design <eol> and user experience diverge. <eob>
Now at this point, I should apologize, <eob> because you guys are going to start <eol> seeing these everywhere. <eob>
But today, I'm going to pick <eol> three I find interesting <eob> and share what actually it reminds me <eob> about launching new products and services. <eob>
The first is in the capital city <eol> of Brazil -- Brasilia. <eob>
And it reminds me that sometimes, <eob> you have to just focus <eol> on designing for a real need <eob> at low friction. <eob> Now, Brasilia is fascinating. <eob> It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s. <eob>
It was the golden age of flying, <eob> so he laid it out like a plane, <eol> as you can see there. <eob>
Slightly worryingly, <eob> he put most of the important government <eol> buildings in the cockpit. <eob>
But if you zoom in, in the very center <eol> of Brasilia, <eob> just where the point is there, <eob> you see it's littered with desire paths. <eob>
They're absolutely everywhere. <eob>
Now, they thought <eol> that they had future-proofed this design. <eob>
They thought in the future <eol> we wouldn't need to walk anywhere -- <eob> we'd be able to drive -- <eob> so there was little need <eol> for walkways or pavements. <eob>
But as you can see, there's a real need. <eob>
These are very dangerous desire paths. <eob>
If we just pick one, in the middle, <eob> you can see it crosses 15 <eol> lanes of traffic. <eob>
It won't surprise you guys <eob> that Brasilia has <eol> five times the pedestrian accident rate <eob> of your average US city. <eob> People are resourceful. <eob> They'll always find the low-friction route <eob> to save money, save time. <eob>
Not all these desire paths are dangerous, <eob> I was reminded flying here <eol> when I was in Heathrow. <eob>
Many of us get frustrated <eol> when we're confronted <eob> with the obligatory walk through duty-free. <eob>
It was amazing to me <eob> how many people refused to take <eol> the long, meandering path to the left, <eob> and just cut through to the right, <eob> cut through the desire path. <eob>
The question that's interesting is: <eob> What do designers <eol> think when they see our behavior here? <eob> Do they think we're stupid? <eob> Do they think we're lazy? <eob> Or do they accept that this <eol> is the only truth? <eob>
This is their product. <eob>
We're effectively co-designing <eol> their product. <eob>
So our job is to design <eol> for real needs <eob> at low friction, <eob> because if you don't, <eol> the customer will, anyway. <eob>
The second desire path I wanted to share <eob> is at the University of California. <eob>
And it reminds me that sometimes <eob> the best way to come up <eol> with a great design <eob> is just to launch it. <eob>
Now, university campuses <eol> are fantastic for spotting desire paths. <eob>
I think it's because students <eol> are always late and they're pretty smart. <eob>
So they're dashing to lectures. <eob>
They'll always find the shortcut. <eob>
And the designers here knew that. <eob>
So they built the buildings <eob> and then they waited a few months <eol> for the paths to form. <eob>
They then paved them. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Incredibly smart approach. <eob>
In fact, often, just launching the straw <eol> man of a service <eob> can teach you what people really want. <eob>
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston <eol> knew he wanted to open a restaurant. <eob> But where should it be? <eob> What should the menu be? <eob> He launched a service, <eob> in this case a food truck, <eob> and he changed the location each day. <eob>
He'd write a different menu <eol> on the side in a whiteboard marker <eob> to figure out what people wanted. <eob>
He now has a chain of restaurants. <eob>
So it can be incredibly efficient <eob> to launch something to spot <eol> the desire paths. <eob>
The third and final desire path <eol> I wanted to share with you <eob> is the UNIH. <eob>
It reminds me that the world's in flux, <eob> and we have to respond to those changes. <eob>
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital. <eob>
I've marked for you on the left <eol> the Oncology Department. <eob>
The patients would usually stay <eol> in the hotels down on the bottom right. <eob>
This was a patient-centered organization, <eob> so they laid on cars for their patients. <eob>
But what they realized <eol> when they started offering chemotherapy <eob> is the patients rarely <eol> wanted to get in cars. <eob>
They were too nauseous, <eol> so they'd walk back to their hotels. <eob>
This desire path that you see <eol> diagonally, formed. <eob>
The patients even called it <eol> "The Chemo Trail." <eob> Now, when the hospital saw this originally, <eob> they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it. <eob>
But after a while, they realized <eol> it was an important need <eob> they were meeting for their patients, <eob> so they paved it. <eob>
And I think our job is often to pave <eol> these emerging desire paths. <eob>
If we look back at the one in North London again, <eob> that desire path hasn't always been there. <eob>
The reason it sprung up <eob> is people were traveling <eol> to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium <eob> on game days, <eob> from the Underground station you <eol> see on the bottom right. <eob>
So you see the desire path. <eob>
If we just wind the clock <eol> back a few years, <eob> when the stadium was being constructed, <eob> there is no desire path. <eob>
So our job is to watch <eol> for these desire paths emerging, <eob> and, where appropriate, pave them, <eob> as someone did here. <eob>
Someone installed a barrier, <eob> people started walking across <eol> and round the bottom as you see, <eob> and they paved it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I think this is a wonderful <eol> reminder as well, <eob> that, actually, the world is in flux. <eob> It's constantly changing, <eob> because if you look at the top of this image, <eob> there's another desire path forming. <eob>
So these three desire paths remind me <eob> we need to design for real human needs. <eob>
I think empathy for what your customers want <eob> is probably the biggest leading indicator <eol> of business success. <eob>
Design for real needs <eob> and design them in low friction, <eob> because if you don't offer them <eol> in low friction, <eob> someone else will, <eol> often the customer. <eob>
Secondly, often the best way <eol> to learn what people really want <eob> is to launch your service. <eob>
The answer is rarely inside the building. <eob>
Get out there and see <eol> what people really want. <eob>
And finally, in part because of technology, <eob> the world is incredibly flux at the moment. <eob> It's changing constantly. <eob> These desire paths are going <eol> to spring up faster than ever. <eob>
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones <eob> and pave over them. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Every weekend for as long as I can remember, <eob> my father would get up <eol> on a Saturday, <eob> put on a worn sweatshirt <eob> and he'd scrape away <eob> at the squeaky old wheel <eol> of a house that we lived in. <eob>
I wouldn't even call it restoration; <eob> it was a ritual, catharsis. <eob>
He would spend all year scraping paint <eol> with this old heat gun <eob> and a spackle knife, <eob> and then he would repaint where he scraped, <eob> only to begin again the following year. <eob>
Scraping and re-scraping, <eol> painting and repainting: <eob> the work of an old house <eol> is never meant to be done. <eob>
The day my father turned 52, <eol> I got a phone call. <eob>
My mother was on the line <eob> to tell me that doctors <eol> had found a lump in his stomach -- <eob> terminal cancer, she told me, <eob> and he had been given only <eol> three weeks to live. <eob>
I immediately moved home <eol> to Poughkeepsie, New York, <eob> to sit with my father on death watch, <eob> not knowing what the next days <eol> would bring us. <eob>
To keep myself distracted, <eob> I rolled up my sleeves, <eob> and I went about finishing <eol> what he could now no longer complete -- <eob> the restoration of our old home. <eob>
When that looming three-week deadline came <eob> and then went, <eob> he was still alive. <eob>
And at three months, <eob> he joined me. <eob>
We gutted and repainted the interior. <eob>
At six months, the old <eol> windows were refinished, <eob> and at 18 months, <eob> the rotted porch was finally replaced. <eob>
And there was my father, <eob> standing with me outside, admiring <eol> a day's work, <eob> hair on his head, fully in remission, <eob> when he turned to me and he said, <eob> "You know, Michael, <eob> this house saved my life." <eob>
So the following year, <eol> I decided to go to architecture school. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But there, I learned something <eol> different about buildings. <eob>
Recognition seemed to come <eob> to those who prioritized <eol> novel and sculptural forms, <eob> like ribbons, or ... <eob> pickles? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I think this is supposed <eol> to be a snail. <eob>
Something about this bothered me. <eob> Why was it that the best architects, <eol> the greatest architecture -- <eob> all beautiful and visionary and innovative -- <eob> is also so rare, <eob> and seems to serve so very few? <eob>
And more to the point: <eob> With all of this creative talent, <eol> what more could we do? <eob>
Just as I was about <eol> to start my final exams, <eob> I decided to take a break <eol> from an all-nighter <eob> and go to a lecture <eol> by Dr. Paul Farmer, <eob> a leading health activist <eol> for the global poor. <eob>
I was surprised to hear a doctor <eol> talking about architecture. <eob>
Buildings are making people sicker, <eol> he said, <eob> and for the poorest in the world, <eob> this is causing epidemic-level problems. <eob>
In this hospital in South Africa, <eob> patients that came <eol> in with, say, a broken leg, <eob> to wait in this unventilated hallway, <eob> walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand <eol> of tuberculosis. <eob>
Simple designs for infection <eol> control had not been thought about, <eob> and people had died because of it. <eob>
"Where are the architects?" Paul said. <eob>
If hospitals are making people sicker, <eob> where are the architects and designers <eob> to help us build and design hospitals <eol> that allow us to heal? <eob>
That following summer, <eob> I was in the back of a Land Rover <eol> with a few classmates, <eob> bumping over the mountainous hillside <eol> of Rwanda. <eob>
For the next year, I'd be living <eol> in Butaro in this old guesthouse, <eob> which was a jail after the genocide. <eob>
I was there to design <eol> and build a new type of hospital <eob> with Dr. Farmer and his team. <eob>
If hallways are making patients sicker, <eob> what if we could design <eol> a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside, <eob> and makes people walk in the exterior? <eob>
If mechanical systems rarely work, <eob> what if we could design <eol> a hospital that could breathe <eob> through natural ventilation, <eob> and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint? <eob>
And what about the patients' experience? <eob>
Evidence shows <eol> that a simple view of nature <eob> can radically improve health outcomes, <eob> So why couldn't we design a hospital <eob> where every patient had a window with a view? <eob>
Simple, site-specific designs <eol> can make a hospital that heals. <eob>
Designing it is one thing; <eob> getting it built, we learned, <eol> is quite another. <eob>
We worked with Bruce Nizeye, <eob> a brilliant engineer, <eob> and he thought about construction differently <eob> than I had been taught in school. <eob>
When we had to excavate <eol> this enormous hilltop <eob> and a bulldozer was expensive <eol> and hard to get to site, <eob> Bruce suggested doing it by hand, <eob> using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe," <eob> which means "community works <eol> for the community." <eob> Hundreds of people came <eol> with shovels and hoes, <eob> and we excavated that hill <eob> in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. <eob>
Instead of importing furniture, <eol> Bruce started a guild, <eob> and he brought in master carpenters to train others <eob> in how to make furniture by hand. <eob>
And on this job site, <eob> 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, <eob> Bruce insisted that we bring <eol> on labor from all backgrounds, <eob> and that half of them be women. <eob>
Bruce was using the process <eol> of building to heal, <eob> not just for those who were sick, <eob> but for the entire community <eol> as a whole. <eob>
We call this the locally fabricated way <eol> of building, or "lo-fab," <eob> and it has four pillars: <eob> hire locally, <eob> source regionally, <eob> train where you can <eob> and most importantly, <eob> think about every design decision <eol> as an opportunity <eob> to invest in the dignity of the places <eol> where you serve. <eob>
Think of it like the local food movement, <eob> but for architecture. <eob>
And we're convinced that this way <eol> of building <eob> can be replicated <eol> across the world, <eob> and change the way we talk <eol> about and evaluate architecture. <eob>
Using the lo-fab way of building, <eob> even aesthetic decisions <eol> can be designed to impact people's lives. <eob>
In Butaro, we chose <eol> to use a local volcanic stone <eob> found in abundance within the area, <eob> but often considered a nuisance by farmers, <eob> and piled on the side of the road. <eob>
We worked with these masons <eol> to cut these stones <eob> and form them into the walls <eol> of the hospital. <eob>
And when they began on this corner <eob> and wrapped around the entire hospital, <eob> they were so good at putting <eol> these stones together, <eob> they asked us if they could take <eol> down the original wall and rebuild it. <eob>
And you see what is possible. <eob> It's beautiful. <eob> And the beauty, to me, <eob> comes from the fact that I know <eol> that hands cut these stones, <eob> and they formed them into this thick wall, <eob> made only in this place with rocks from this soil. <eob>
When you go outside today and you <eol> look at your built world, <eob> ask not only: <eob> "What is the environmental <eol> footprint?" -- an important question -- <eob> but what if we also asked, <eob> "What is the human handprint <eol> of those who made it?" <eob>
We started a new practice <eol> based around these questions, <eob> and we tested it around the world. <eob>
Like in Haiti, <eob> where we asked if a new hospital <eol> could help end the epidemic of cholera. <eob>
In this 100-bed hospital, <eob> we designed a simple strategy <eob> to clean contaminated medical waste <eol> before it enters the water table, <eob> and our partners <eol> at Les Centres GHESKIO <eob> are already saving lives because of it. <eob>
Or Malawi: <eob> we asked if a birthing center <eol> could radically reduce <eob> maternal and infant mortality. <eob>
Malawi has one of the highest <eol> rates of maternal and infant death <eob> in the world. <eob>
Using a simple strategy <eol> to be replicated nationally, <eob> we designed a birthing center <eob> that would attract women <eol> and their attendants <eob> to come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births. <eob>
Or in the Congo, where we asked <eob> if an educational center could also be used <eob> to protect endangered wildlife. <eob>
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat <eob> is leading to global epidemic, <eol> disease transfer and war. <eob>
In one of the hardest-to-reach places <eob> in the world, <eob> we used the mud and the dirt <eol> and the wood around us <eob> to construct a center <eob> that would show us ways to protect <eol> and conserve our rich biodiversity. <eob>
Even here in the US, <eob> we were asked to rethink <eob> the largest university for the deaf <eol> and hard of hearing <eob> in the world. <eob>
The deaf community, through sign language, <eob> shows us the power <eol> of visual communication. <eob>
We designed a campus that would awaken the ways <eob> in which we as humans <eol> all communicate, <eob> both verbally and nonverbally. <eob>
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown, <eob> we thought about old industrial infrastructure. <eob>
We wondered: <eob> Could we use arts and culture <eol> and design to revitalize this city <eob> and other Rust Belt cities <eol> across our nation, <eob> and turn them into centers <eol> for innovation and growth? <eob>
In each of these projects, <eol> we asked a simple question: <eob> What more can architecture do? <eob>
And by asking that question, <eob> we were forced to consider <eol> how we could create jobs, <eob> how we could <eob> source regionally <eob> and how we could invest <eol> in the dignity of the communities <eob> in which we serve. <eob>
I have learned <eob> that architecture <eol> can be a transformative engine for change. <eob>
About a year ago, <eol> I read an article <eob> about a tireless <eol> and intrepid civil rights leader <eob> named Bryan Stevenson. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision. <eob>
He and his team had been documenting <eob> the over 4,000 lynchings <eol> of African-Americans <eob> that have happened <eol> in the American South. <eob>
And they had a plan to mark every county <eol> where these lynchings occurred, <eob> and build a national memorial <eol> to the victims of lynching <eob> in Montgomery, Alabama. <eob>
Countries like Germany and South Africa <eob> and, of course, Rwanda, <eob> have found it necessary to build memorials <eob> to reflect on the atrocities of their past, <eob> in order to heal their national psyche. <eob>
We have yet to do this <eol> in the United States. <eob>
So I sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org: <eob> "Dear Bryan," it said, <eob> "I think your building project <eob> is maybe the most important project <eol> we could do in America <eob> and could change the way we think <eol> about racial injustice. <eob>
By any chance, <eob> do you know who will design it?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Surprisingly, shockingly, <eob> Bryan got right back to me, <eob> and invited me down to meet <eol> with his team and talk to them. <eob>
Needless to say, <eol> I canceled all my meetings <eob> and I jumped on a plane <eol> to Montgomery, Alabama. <eob>
When I got there, <eob> Bryan and his team picked me up, <eol> and we walked around the city. <eob>
And they took the time to point out <eob> the many markers that have been <eol> placed all over the city <eob> to the history of the Confederacy, <eob> and the very few that mark the history <eol> of slavery. <eob>
And then he walked me to a hill. <eob>
It overlooked the whole city. <eob>
He pointed out the river and the train tracks <eob> where the largest domestic slave-trading <eol> port in America <eob> had once prospered. <eob>
And then to the Capitol rotunda, <eob> where George Wallace had stood on its steps <eob> and proclaimed, "Segregation forever." <eob> And then to the very hill below us. <eob>
He said, "Here we will build <eol> a new memorial <eob> that will change the identity <eol> of this city and of this nation." <eob>
Our two teams have worked <eol> together over the last year <eob> to design this memorial. <eob>
The memorial will take us on a journey <eob> through a classical, <eol> almost familiar building type, <eob> like the Parthenon or the colonnade <eol> at the Vatican. <eob>
But as we enter, <eob> the ground drops below us <eol> and our perception shifts, <eob> where we realize that these columns <eol> evoke the lynchings, <eob> which happened in the public square. <eob>
And as we continue, <eob> we begin to understand the vast number <eob> of those who have yet to be put to rest. <eob>
Their names will be engraved on the markers <eol> that hang above us. <eob>
And just outside will be <eol> a field of identical columns. <eob>
But these are temporary columns, <eol> waiting in purgatory, <eob> to be placed in the very counties <eol> where these lynchings occurred. <eob>
Over the next few years, <eob> this site will bear witness, <eob> as each of these markers is claimed <eob> and visibly placed in those counties. <eob>
Our nation will begin to heal <eol> from over a century of silence. <eob>
When we think about <eol> how it should be built, <eob> we were reminded of Ubudehe, <eob> the building process we learned <eol> about in Rwanda. <eob>
We wondered <eob> if we could fill <eol> those very columns <eob> with the soil from the sites <eol> of where these killings occurred. <eob>
Brian and his team have begun <eol> collecting that soil <eob> and preserving it in individual jars <eob> with family members, community <eol> leaders and descendants. <eob>
The act of collecting soil itself <eob> has lead to a type of spiritual healing. <eob>
It's an act of restorative justice. <eob>
As one EJI team member noted <eob> in the collection of the soil <eol> from where Will McBride was lynched, <eob> "If Will McBride left one drop of sweat, <eob> one drop of blood, <eob> one hair follicle -- <eob> I pray that I dug it up, <eob> and that his whole body would be at peace." <eob>
We plan to break ground <eol> on this memorial later this year, <eob> and it will be a place <eol> to finally speak of the unspeakable acts <eob> that have scarred this nation. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When my father told me <eol> that day that this house -- <eob> our house -- <eob> had saved his life, <eob> what I didn't know <eob> was that he was referring <eol> to a much deeper relationship <eob> between architecture and ourselves. <eob>
Buildings are not simply <eol> expressive sculptures. <eob>
They make visible our personal <eol> and our collective aspirations <eob> as a society. <eob>
Great architecture can give us hope. <eob>
Great architecture can heal. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I lead a team at Google <eol> that works on machine intelligence; <eob> in other words, the engineering discipline <eol> of making computers and devices <eob> able to do some of the things that brains do. <eob>
And this makes us interested <eol> in real brains <eob> and neuroscience as well, <eob> and especially interested <eol> in the things that our brains do <eob> that are still far superior <eol> to the performance of computers. <eob>
Historically, one of those areas <eol> has been perception, <eob> the process by which things out there in the world -- <eob> sounds and images -- <eob> can turn into concepts in the mind. <eob>
This is essential for our own brains, <eob> and it's also pretty useful on a computer. <eob>
The machine perception algorithms, <eol> for example, that our team makes, <eob> are what enable your pictures <eol> on Google Photos to become searchable, <eob> based on what's in them. <eob>
The flip side of perception is creativity: <eob> turning a concept into something <eol> out there into the world. <eob>
So over the past year, our work <eol> on machine perception <eob> has also unexpectedly connected <eol> with the world of machine creativity <eob> and machine art. <eob>
I think Michelangelo had a penetrating insight <eob> into to this dual relationship <eol> between perception and creativity. <eob>
This is a famous quote of his: <eob> "Every block of stone <eol> has a statue inside of it, <eob> and the job of the sculptor <eol> is to discover it." <eob> So I think that what Michelangelo was getting at <eob> is that we create by perceiving, <eob> and that perception itself <eol> is an act of imagination <eob> and is the stuff of creativity. <eob>
The organ that does all the thinking <eol> and perceiving and imagining, <eob> of course, is the brain. <eob>
And I'd like to begin <eol> with a brief bit of history <eob> about what we know about brains. <eob>
Because unlike, say, the heart <eol> or the intestines, <eob> you really can't say very much about a brain <eol> by just looking at it, <eob> at least with the naked eye. <eob>
The early anatomists who looked at brains <eob> gave the superficial structures <eol> of this thing all kinds of fanciful names, <eob> like hippocampus, meaning "little shrimp." <eob> But of course that sort of thing <eol> doesn't tell us very much <eob> about what's actually going on inside. <eob>
The first person who, I think, <eol> really developed some kind of insight <eob> into what was going on in the brain <eob> was the great Spanish neuroanatomist, <eol> Santiago Ramón y Cajal, <eob> in the 19th century, <eob> who used microscopy and special stains <eob> that could selectively fill in <eol> or render in very high contrast <eob> the individual cells in the brain, <eob> in <eob> order to start to understand <eol> their morphologies. <eob>
in the 19th century, <eob> And these are the kinds of drawings <eol> that he made of neurons <eob>
This is from a bird brain. <eob>
And you see this incredible <eol> variety of different sorts of cells, <eob> even the cellular theory itself <eol> was quite new at this point. <eob>
And these structures, <eob> these cells that have these arborizations, <eob> these branches that can go very, <eol> very long distances -- <eob> this was very novel at the time. <eob>
They're reminiscent, of course, of wires. <eob>
That might have been obvious to some people <eob> in the 19th century; <eob> the revolutions of wiring and electricity <eol> were just getting underway. <eob>
But in many ways, <eob> these microanatomical drawings <eol> of Ramón y Cajal's, like this one, <eob> they're still in some ways unsurpassed. <eob>
We're still more than a century later, <eob> trying to finish the job <eol> that Ramón y Cajal started. <eob>
These are raw data <eol> from our collaborators <eob> at the Max Planck Institute <eol> of Neuroscience. <eob>
And what our collaborators have done <eob> is to image little pieces of brain tissue. <eob>
The entire sample here is about <eol> one cubic millimeter in size, <eob> and I'm showing you a very, <eol> very small piece of it here. <eob>
That bar on the left is about one micron. <eob>
The structures you see are mitochondria <eob> that are the size of bacteria. <eob>
And these are consecutive slices <eob> through this very, very tiny block of tissue. <eob>
Just for comparison's sake, <eob> the diameter of an average strand <eol> of hair is about 100 microns. <eob>
So we're looking at something <eol> much, much smaller <eob> than a single strand of hair. <eob>
And from these kinds of serial <eol> electron microscopy slices, <eob> one can start to make reconstructions <eol> in 3D of neurons that look like these. <eob>
So these are sort of in the same style <eol> as Ramón y Cajal. <eob>
Only a few neurons lit up, <eob> because otherwise we wouldn't be <eol> able to see anything here. <eob> It would be so crowded, <eob> so full of structure, <eob> of wiring all connecting one neuron to another. <eob>
So Ramón y Cajal was <eol> a little bit ahead of his time, <eob> and progress on understanding the brain <eob> proceeded slowly over the next few decades. <eob>
But we knew that neurons used electricity, <eob> and by World War II, our technology <eol> was advanced enough <eob> to start doing real electrical experiments <eol> on live neurons <eob> to better understand how they worked. <eob>
This was the very same time <eol> when computers were being invented, <eob> very much based on the idea <eol> of modeling the brain -- <eob> of "intelligent machinery," <eol> as Alan Turing called it, <eob> one of the fathers <eol> of computer science. <eob>
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts looked <eol> at Ramón y Cajal's drawing <eob> of visual cortex, <eob> which I'm showing here. <eob>
This is the cortex that processes <eol> imagery that comes from the eye. <eob>
And for them, this looked <eol> like a circuit diagram. <eob>
So there are a lot of details <eol> in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram <eob> that are not quite right. <eob>
But this basic idea <eob> that visual cortex works <eol> like a series of computational elements <eob> that pass information one to the next in a cascade, <eob> is essentially correct. <eob>
Let's talk for a moment <eob> about what a model for processing <eol> visual information would need to do. <eob>
The basic task of perception <eob> is to take an image like this one and say, <eob> "That's a bird," <eob> which is a very simple thing <eol> for us to do with our brains. <eob>
But you should all understand <eol> that for a computer, <eob> this was pretty much impossible <eol> just a few years ago. <eob>
The classical computing paradigm <eob> is not one in which this task <eol> is easy to do. <eob>
So what's going on between the pixels, <eob> between the image of the bird <eol> and the word "bird," <eob> is essentially a set of neurons <eol> connected to each other <eob> in a neural network, <eob> as I'm diagramming here. <eob>
This neural network could be biological, <eol> inside our visual cortices, <eob> or, nowadays, we start <eol> to have the capability <eob> to model such neural networks <eol> on the computer. <eob>
And I'll show you what <eol> that actually looks like. <eob>
So the pixels you can think <eol> about as a first layer of neurons, <eob> and that's, in fact, how it works in the eye -- <eob> that's the neurons in the retina. <eob>
And those feed forward <eob> into one layer after another <eol> layer, after another layer of neurons, <eob> all connected by synapses of different weights. <eob>
The behavior of this network <eob> is characterized by the strengths <eol> of all of those synapses. <eob>
Those characterize the computational properties <eol> of this network. <eob>
And at the end of the day, <eob> you have a neuron or a small group <eol> of neurons <eob> that light up, saying, "bird." <eob>
Now I'm going to represent <eol> those three things -- <eob> the input pixels and the synapses <eol> in the neural network, <eob> and bird, the output -- <eob> by three variables: x, w and y. <eob> There are maybe a million or so x's -- <eob> a million pixels in that image. <eob>
There are billions or trillions <eol> of w's, <eob> which represent the weights <eol> of all these synapses in the neural network. <eob>
And there's a very small number of y's, <eob> of outputs that that network has. <eob> "Bird" is only four letters, right? <eob>
So let's pretend <eol> that this is just a simple formula, <eob> x "x" w = y. <eob> I'm putting the times in scare quotes <eob> because what's really going on there, of course, <eob> is a very complicated series <eol> of mathematical operations. <eob>
That's one equation. <eob> There are three variables. <eob>
And we all know that if you have one equation, <eob> you can solve one variable <eol> by knowing the other two things. <eob>
So the problem of inference, <eob> that is, figuring out that the picture <eol> of a bird is a bird, <eob> is this one: <eob> it's where y is the unknown <eol> and w and x are known. <eob>
You know the neural network, <eol> you know the pixels. <eob>
As you can see, that's actually <eol> a relatively straightforward problem. <eob>
You multiply two times <eol> three and you're done. <eob>
I'll show you an artificial <eol> neural network <eob> that we've built recently, <eol> doing exactly that. <eob>
This is running in real time <eol> on a mobile phone, <eob> and that's, of course, amazing in its own right, <eob> that mobile phones can do so many billions <eol> and trillions of operations <eob> per second. <eob>
What you're looking at is a phone <eob> looking at one after another <eol> picture of a bird, <eob> and actually not only saying, "Yes, it's a bird," <eob> but identifying the species <eol> of bird with a network of this sort. <eob>
So in that picture, <eob> the x and the w are known, and the y <eol> is the unknown. <eob>
I'm glossing over the very difficult <eol> part, of course, <eob> which is how on earth do we figure out the w, <eob> the brain that can do such a thing? <eob>
How would we ever learn such a model? <eob>
So this process of learning, <eol> of solving for w, <eob> if we were doing this <eol> with the simple equation <eob> in which we think about these as numbers, <eob> we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w, <eob> well, we divide by two and we're done. <eob>
The problem is with this operator. <eob>
So, division -- <eob> we've used division because it's the inverse <eol> to multiplication, <eob> but as I've just said, <eob> the multiplication <eol> is a bit of a lie here. <eob>
This is a very, very complicated, <eol> very non-linear operation; <eob> it has no inverse. <eob>
So we have to figure out a way <eol> to solve the equation <eob> without a division operator. <eob>
And the way to do <eol> that is fairly straightforward. <eob> You just say, let's play <eol> a little algebra trick, <eob> and move the six over <eol> to the right-hand side of the equation. <eob>
Now, we're still using multiplication. <eob>
And that zero -- let's think about it <eol> as an error. <eob>
In other words, if we've solved <eol> for w the right way, <eob> then the error <eol> will be zero. <eob>
And if we haven't gotten it quite right, <eob> the error will be greater than zero. <eob>
So now we can just take guesses <eol> to minimize the error, <eob> and that's the sort of thing <eol> computers are very good at. <eob>
So you've taken an initial guess: <eob> what if w = 0? <eob>
Well, then the error is 6. <eob>
What if w = 1? <eob>
The error is 4. <eob>
And then the computer <eol> can sort of play Marco Polo, <eob> and drive down the error <eol> close to zero. <eob>
As it does that, it's getting successive <eol> approximations to w. <eob> Typically, it never quite gets there, <eol> but after about a dozen steps, <eob> we're up to w = 2.999, which is close enough. <eob>
And this is the learning process. <eob>
So remember that what's been going on here <eob> is that we've been taking a lot of known x's and known y's <eob> and solving for the w in the middle <eol> through an iterative process. <eob>
It's exactly the same way <eol> that we do our own learning. <eob>
We have many, many images as babies <eob> and we get told, "This is a bird; <eol> this is not a bird." <eob> And over time, through iteration, <eob> we solve for w, we solve <eol> for those neural connections. <eob>
So now, we've held x and w fixed to solve for y; <eob> that's everyday, fast perception. <eob>
We figure out how we can solve for w, <eob> that's learning, which is a lot harder, <eob> because we need to do error minimization, <eob> using a lot of training examples. <eob>
And about a year ago, Alex Mordvintsev, on our team, <eob> decided to experiment with what happens <eol> if we try solving for x, <eob> given a known w and a known y. <eob>
In other words, <eob> you know that it's a bird, <eob> and you already have your neural network <eol> that you've trained on birds, <eob> but what is the picture of a bird? <eob>
It turns out that by using exactly <eol> the same error-minimization procedure, <eob> one can do that with the network <eol> trained to recognize birds, <eob> and the result turns out to be ... <eob> a picture of birds. <eob>
So this is <eob> a picture of birds <eob> generated entirely by <eol> a neural network <eob> that was trained to recognize birds, <eob> just by solving for x rather than solving for y, <eob> and doing that iteratively. <eob>
Here's another fun example. <eob>
This was a work made <eol> by Mike Tyka in our group, <eob> which he calls "Animal Parade." <eob> It reminds me a little bit <eol> of William Kentridge's artworks, <eob> in which he makes sketches, rubs them out, <eob> makes sketches, rubs them out, <eob> and creates a movie this way. <eob>
In this case, <eob> what Mike is doing is varying y <eol> over the space of different animals, <eob> in a network designed to recognize <eol> and distinguish <eob> different animals from each other. <eob>
And you get this strange, <eol> Escher-like morph from one animal to another. <eob>
Here he and Alex together have tried reducing <eob> the y's to a space <eol> of only two dimensions, <eob> thereby making a map out of the space <eol> of all things <eob> recognized by this network. <eob>
Doing this kind of synthesis <eob> or generation of imagery <eol> over that entire surface, <eob> varying y over the surface, <eol> you make a kind of map -- <eob> a visual map of all the things <eol> the network knows how to recognize. <eob>
The animals are all here; <eol> "armadillo" is right in that spot. <eob>
You can do this with other kinds <eol> of networks as well. <eob>
This is a network <eol> designed to recognize faces, <eob> to distinguish one face from another. <eob>
And here, we're putting in a y <eol> that says, "me," <eob> my own face parameters. <eob>
And when this thing solves for x, <eob> it generates this rather crazy, <eob> kind of cubist, surreal, <eol> psychedelic picture of me <eob> from multiple points of view at once. <eob>
The reason it looks like <eol> multiple points of view at once <eob> is because that network is designed <eol> to get rid of the ambiguity <eob> of a face being in one pose <eol> or another pose, <eob> being looked at with one kind of lighting, <eol> another kind of lighting. <eob>
So when you do this sort of reconstruction, <eob> if you don't use some sort of guide image <eob> or guide statistics, <eob> then you'll get a sort of confusion <eol> of different points of view, <eob> because it's ambiguous. <eob>
This is what happens if Alex uses <eol> his own face as a guide image <eob> during that optimization <eol> process to reconstruct my own face. <eob>
So you can see it's not perfect. <eob>
There's still quite a lot of work to do <eob> on how we optimize <eol> that optimization process. <eob>
But you start to get something <eol> more like a coherent face, <eob> rendered using my own face as a guide. <eob>
You don't have to start <eol> with a blank canvas <eob> or with white noise. <eob>
When you're solving for x, <eob> you can begin with an x, that is itself <eol> already some other image. <eob>
That's what this little demonstration is. <eob>
This is a network <eol> that is designed to categorize <eob> all sorts of different objects -- <eol> man-made structures, animals ... <eob> Here we're starting with just a picture of clouds, <eob> and as we optimize, <eob> basically, this network <eol> is figuring out what it sees in the clouds. <eob>
And the more time you spend <eol> looking at this, <eob> the more things you also will see in the clouds. <eob>
You could also use the face <eol> network to hallucinate into this, <eob> and you get some pretty crazy stuff. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Or, Mike has done some other experiments <eob> in which he takes that cloud image, <eob> hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates, <eol> zooms hallucinates, zooms. <eob>
And in this way, <eob> you can get a sort of fugue <eol> state of the network, I suppose, <eob> or a sort of free association, <eob> in which the network <eol> is eating its own tail. <eob> So every image is now the basis for, <eob> "What do I think I see next? <eob>
What do I think I see next? <eob> "I showed this for the first time in public <eob> to a group at a lecture in Seattle <eol> called" Higher Education "— <eob> this was right after marijuana <eol> was legalized. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So I'd like to finish up quickly <eob> by just noting that this technology <eol> is not constrained. <eob>
I've shown you purely visual examples <eol> because they're really fun to look at. <eob>
It's not a purely visual technology. <eob>
Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin, <eob> has done experiments involving a camera <eol> that takes a picture, <eob> and then a computer in his backpack writes <eol> a poem using neural networks, <eob> based on the contents <eol> of the image. <eob>
And that poetry neural network <eol> has been trained <eob> on a large corpus <eol> of 20th-century poetry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And the poetry is, you know, <eob> I think, kind of not bad, actually. <eob> In closing, <eob> I think that per Michelangelo, <eob> I think he was right; <eob> perception and creativity are very intimately connected. <eob>
What we've just seen <eol> are neural networks <eob> that are entirely trained <eol> to discriminate, <eob> or to recognize different things in the world, <eob> able to be run in reverse, to generate. <eob>
One of the things that suggests to me <eob> is not only that Michelangelo really did see <eob> the sculpture in the blocks of stone, <eob> but that any creature, any being, any alien <eob> that is able to do perceptual acts <eol> of that sort <eob> is also able to create <eob> because it's exactly the same machinery <eol> that's used in both cases. <eob>
Also, I think that perception <eol> and creativity are by no means <eob> uniquely human. <eob>
We start to have computer models <eol> that can do exactly these sorts of things. <eob>
And that ought to be unsurprising; <eol> the brain is computational. <eob>
And finally, <eob> computing began as an exercise <eol> in designing intelligent machinery. <eob>
It was very much modeled after the idea <eob> of how could we make machines intelligent. <eob>
And we finally are starting <eol> to fulfill now <eob> some of the promises of those <eol> early pioneers, <eob> of Turing and von Neumann <eob> and McCulloch and Pitts. <eob>
And I think that computing <eol> is not just about accounting <eob> or playing Candy Crush or something. <eob>
From the beginning, we modeled them <eol> after our minds. <eob>
And they give us both the ability <eol> to understand our own minds better <eob> and to extend them. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Once there was a star. <eob>
Like everything else, she was born; <eob> grew to be around 30 times <eol> the mass of our sun <eob> and lived for a very long time. <eob>
Exactly how long, <eob> people cannot really tell. <eob>
Just like everything in life, <eob> she reached the end <eol> of her regular star days <eob> when her heart, the core of her life, <eob> exhausted its fuel. <eob>
But that was no end. <eob>
She transformed into a supernova, <eol> and in the process <eob> releasing a tremendous amount of energy, <eob> outshining the rest of the galaxy <eob> and emitting, in one second, <eob> the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days. <eob>
And she evolved into another role <eol> in our galaxy. <eob>
Supernova explosions are very extreme. <eob>
But the ones <eol> that emit gamma rays are even more extreme. <eob>
In the process of becoming a supernova, <eob> the interior of the star collapses <eol> under its own weight <eob> and it starts rotating ever faster, <eob> like an ice skater when pulling <eol> their arms in close to their body. <eob>
In that way, it starts rotating very fast <eol> and it increases, powerfully, <eob> its magnetic field. <eob>
The matter around the star is dragged around, <eob> and some energy from that rotation <eol> is transferred to that matter <eob> and the magnetic field <eol> is increased even further. <eob>
In that way, our star had extra energy <eol> to outshine the rest of the galaxy <eob> in brightness and gamma ray emission. <eob>
My star, the one in my story, <eob> became what is known as a magnetar. <eob>
And just for your information, <eob> the magnetic field of a magnetar <eol> is 1,000 trillion times <eob> the magnetic field of Earth. <eob>
The most energetic events <eol> ever measured by astronomers <eob> carry the name gamma-ray bursts <eob> because we observe them as bursts <eol> most or explosions, <eob> most strongly measured as gamma-ray light. <eob>
Our star, like the one in our story <eol> that became a magnetar, <eob> is detected as a gamma-ray burst <eob> during the most energetic portion <eol> of the explosion. <eob>
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts <eol> are the strongest events <eob> ever measured by astronomers, <eob> we cannot see them <eol> with our naked eye. <eob>
We depend, we rely on other methods <eob> in order to study this gamma-ray light. <eob>
We cannot see them with our naked eye. <eob>
We can only see an itty bitty, <eol> tiny portion <eob> of the electromagnetic spectrum <eol> that we call visible light. <eob>
And beyond that, we rely on other methods. <eob>
Yet as astronomers, we study <eol> a wider range of light <eob> and we depend on other methods to do that. <eob>
On the screen, it may look like this. <eob>
You're seeing a plot. <eob>
That is a light curve. <eob>
It's a plot <eol> of intensity of light over time. <eob>
It is a gamma-ray light curve. <eob>
Sighted astronomers depend <eol> on this kind of plot <eob> in order to interpret <eol> how this light intensity changes over time. <eob>
On the left, you will be seeing <eol> the light intensity without a burst, <eob> and on the right, you will be seeing <eol> the light intensity with the burst. <eob>
Early during my career, <eol> I could also see this kind of plot. <eob>
But then, I lost my sight. <eob>
I completely lost my sight <eol> because of extended illness, <eob> and with it, I lost the opportunity <eol> to see this plot <eob> and the opportunity to do my physics. <eob>
It was a very strong transition <eol> for me in many ways. <eob>
And professionally, it left me <eol> without a way to do my science. <eob>
I longed to access <eol> and scrutinize this energetic light <eob> and figure out the astrophysical cause. <eob>
I wanted to experience the spacious wonder, <eol> the excitement, <eob> the joy produced by the detection <eol> of such a titanic celestial event. <eob>
I thought long and hard about it, <eob> when I suddenly realized <eol> that all a light curve is, <eob> is a table of numbers <eol> converted into a visual plot. <eob>
So along with my collaborators, <eob> we worked really hard and we translated <eol> the numbers into sound. <eob>
I achieved access to the data, <eob> and today I'm able to do physics <eol> at the level of the best astronomer, <eob> using sound. <eob>
And what people have been able to do, <eob> mainly visually, <eob> for hundreds of years, <eob> now I do it <eob> using sound. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Listening to this gamma-ray burst <eob> that you're seeing on the -- <eol> (Applause continues) <eob>
Listening to this burst <eol> that you're seeing on the screen <eob> brought something to the ear <eol> beyond the obvious burst. <eob>
Now I'm going to play the burst for you. <eob>
It's not music, it's sound. <eob>
(Digital beeping sounds) <eob>
This is scientific data <eol> converted into sound, <eob> and it's mapped in pitch. <eob>
The process is called sonification. <eob>
So listening to this brought something <eol> to the ear <eob> besides the obvious burst. <eob>
When I examine the very strong low-frequency regions, <eob> or bass line -- I'm zooming <eol> into the bass line now. <eob>
We noted resonances characteristic <eol> of electrically charged gasses <eob> like the solar wind. <eob>
And I want you to hear what I heard. <eob>
You will hear it as a very fast decrease <eol> in volume. <eob>
And because you're sighted, <eol> I'm giving you a red line <eob> indicating what intensity of light <eol> is being converted into sound. <eob>
The (Whistles) is frogs at home, <eol> don't pay attention to that. <eob>
I think you heard it, right? <eob>
So what we found <eob> is that the bursts last long enough in order <eol> to support wave resonances, <eob> which are things caused by exchanges <eol> of energy between particles <eob> that may have been excited, <eob> that depend on the volume. <eob>
You may remember that I said <eol> that the matter around the star <eob> is dragged around? <eob>
It transmits power with frequency <eol> and field distribution <eob> determined by the dimensions. <eob>
You may remember that we were <eol> talking about a super-massive star <eob> that became a very strong magnetic <eol> field magnetar. <eob>
If this is the case, then outflows <eol> from the exploding star <eob> may be associated with this gamma-ray burst. <eob>
What does that mean? <eob> That star formation may be <eol> a very important part <eob> of these supernova explosions. <eob>
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion <eob> that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display <eob> may also support sighted astronomers <eob> in the search for more information in the data. <eob>
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing <eol> measurements from other telescopes, <eob> and my experiments demonstrated <eob> that when you use sound <eol> as an adjunctive visual display, <eob> astronomers can find more information <eob> in this now more accessible data set. <eob>
This ability to transform data into sound <eob> gives astronomy a tremendous power <eol> of transformation. <eob>
And the fact that a field that is so visual <eol> may be improved <eob> in order to include anyone with interest <eol> in understanding what lies in the heavens <eob> is a spirit-lifter. <eob>
When I lost my sight, <eob> I noticed that I didn't have access <eob> to the same amount and quality of information <eob> a sighted astronomer had. <eob>
It was not until we innovated <eol> with the sonification process <eob> that I regained the hope <eol> to be a productive member of the field <eob> that I had worked so hard <eol> to be part of. <eob>
Yet, information access <eol> is not the only area in astronomy <eob> where this is important. <eob>
The situation is systemic <eob> and scientific fields are not keeping up. <eob>
The body is something changeable -- <eob> anyone may develop <eol> a disability at any point. <eob>
Let's think about, for example, <eob> scientists that are already at the top of their careers. <eob>
What happens to them <eol> if they develop a disability? <eob> Will they feel excommunicated as I did? <eob>
Information access empowers <eol> us to flourish. <eob>
It gives us equal opportunities <eol> to display our talents <eob> and choose what we want <eol> to do with our lives, <eob> based on interest <eol> and not based on potential barriers. <eob>
When we give people the opportunity <eol> to succeed without limits, <eob> that will lead to personal fulfillment <eol> and prospering life. <eob>
And I think that the use <eol> of sound in astronomy <eob> is helping us to achieve <eol> that and to contribute to science. <eob>
While other countries told me <eol> that the study of perception techniques <eob> in order to study astronomy data <eol> is not relevant to astronomy <eob> because there are no blind <eol> astronomers in the field, <eob> South Africa said, <eol> "We want people with disabilities <eob> to contribute to the field." <eob> Right now, I'm working <eob> at the South African Astronomical Observatory, <eob> at the Office of Astronomy for Development. <eob>
There, we are working on sonification <eol> techniques and analysis methods <eob> to impact the students of the Athlone <eol> School for the Blind. <eob>
These students will be learning <eol> radio astronomy, <eob> and they will be learning <eol> the sonification methods <eob> in order to study astronomical events <eol> like huge ejections of energy <eob> from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections. <eob>
What we learn with these students -- <eob> these students have multiple <eol> disabilities and coping strategies <eob> that will be accommodated -- <eob> what we learn with these students <eol> will directly impact <eob> the way things are being done <eol> at the professional level. <eob>
I humbly call this development. <eob>
And this is happening right now. <eob>
I think that science is for everyone. <eob>
It belongs to the people, <eob> and it has to be available to everyone, <eob> because we are all natural explorers. <eob>
I think that if we limit <eol> people with disabilities <eob> from participating in science, <eob> we'll sever our links with history <eol> and with society. <eob>
I dream of a level scientific playing field, <eob> where people encourage <eol> respect and respect each other, <eob> where people exchange strategies <eol> and discover together. <eob>
If people with disabilities <eol> are allowed into the scientific field, <eob> an explosion, a huge titanic burst <eol> of knowledge will take place, <eob> I am sure. <eob>
(Digital beeping sounds) <eob>
That is the titanic burst. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
I could never have imagined <eob> that a 19-year-old suicide bomber <eob> would actually teach me a valuable lesson. <eob> But he did. <eob> He taught me to never presume anything <eob> about anyone you don't know. <eob>
On a Thursday morning in July 2005, <eob> the bomber and I, unknowingly, <eob> boarded the same train carriage <eol> at the same time, <eob> standing, apparently, just feet apart. <eob>
I didn't see him. <eob>
Actually, I didn't see anyone. <eob>
You know not to look <eol> at anyone on the Tube, <eob> but I guess he saw me. <eob>
I guess he looked at all of us, <eob> as his hand hovered <eol> over the detonation switch. <eob>
I've often wondered: What was he thinking? <eob>
Especially in those final seconds. <eob>
I know it wasn't personal. <eob>
He didn't set out to kill <eol> or maim me, Gill Hicks. <eob>
I mean -- he didn't know me. <eob> No. <eob> Instead, he gave me <eob> an unwarranted and an unwanted label. <eob>
I had become the enemy. <eob>
To him, I was the "other," <eob> the "them," as opposed to "us." <eob> The label "enemy" allowed him <eol> to dehumanize us. <eob>
It allowed him to push that button. <eob>
And he wasn't selective. <eob>
Twenty-six precious lives were taken <eol> in my carriage alone, <eob> and I was almost one of them. <eob>
In the time it takes to draw a breath, <eob> we were plunged into a darkness so immense <eob> that it was almost tangible; <eob> what I imagine wading <eol> through tar might be like. <eob>
We didn't know we were the enemy. <eob>
We were just a bunch of commuters <eol> who, minutes earlier, <eob> had followed the Tube etiquette: <eob> no direct eye contact, <eob> no talking <eob> and absolutely no conversation. <eob>
But in the lifting of the darkness, <eob> we were reaching out. <eob> We were helping each other. <eob> We were calling out our names, <eob> a little bit like a roll call, <eob> waiting for responses. <eob>
"I'm Gill. I'm here. <eob> I'm alive. <eob> OK." <eob>
OK." <eob> "I'm Gill. <eob> Here. <eob> Alive. <eob>
I didn't know Alison. <eob>
But I listened for her check-ins <eol> every few minutes. <eob>
I didn't know Richard. <eob>
But it mattered to me that he survived. <eob>
All I shared with them <eob> was my first name. <eob>
They didn't know <eob> that I was a head of a department <eol> at the Design Council. <eob>
And here is my beloved briefcase, <eob> also rescued from that morning. <eob>
They didn't know <eob> that I published architecture <eol> and design journals, <eob> that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society <eol> of Arts, <eob> that I wore black — <eob> still do — <eob> that I smoked cigarillos. <eob>
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore. <eob>
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks, <eob> of course, never dreaming <eol> that one day I would be standing, <eob> balancing on prosthetic legs, <eob> giving a talk. <eob>
I was a young Australian woman <eol> doing extraordinary things in London. <eob>
And I wasn't ready for that all to end. <eob>
I was so determined to survive <eob> that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets <eol> around the tops of my legs, <eob> and I just shut everything <eol> and everyone out, <eob> to focus, to listen to myself, <eob> to be guided by instinct alone. <eob>
I lowered my breathing rate. <eob>
I elevated my thighs. <eob>
I held myself upright <eob> and I fought the urge to close my eyes. <eob>
I held on for almost an hour, <eob> an hour to contemplate <eol> the whole of my life <eob> up until this point. <eob>
Perhaps I should have done more. <eob>
Perhaps I could have <eol> lived more, seen more. <eob>
Maybe I should have gone running, <eol> dancing, taken up yoga. <eob>
But my priority and my focus <eol> was always my work. <eob>
I lived to work. <eob>
Who I was on my business card <eob> mattered to me. <eob>
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel. <eob>
By the time I felt that first touch <eob> from one of my rescuers, <eob> I was unable to speak, <eob> unable to say even <eol> a small word, like "Gill." <eob> I surrendered my body to them. <eob>
I had done all I possibly could, <eob> and now I was in their hands. <eob>
I understood <eob> just who and what humanity really is, <eob> when I first saw the ID tag <eob> that was given to me <eol> when I was admitted to hospital. <eob>
And it read: <eob> "One unknown estimated female." <eob> One unknown estimated female. <eob>
Those four words were my gift. <eob>
What they told me very clearly <eob> was that my life was saved, <eob> purely because I was a human being. <eob>
Difference of any kind made no difference <eob> to the extraordinary lengths <eol> that the rescuers were prepared to go <eob> to save my life, <eob> to save as many unknowns as they could, <eob> and putting their own lives at risk. <eob>
To them, it didn't matter <eol> if I was rich or poor, <eob> the color of my skin, <eob> whether I was male or female, <eob> my sexual orientation, <eob> who I voted for, <eob> whether I was educated, <eob> if I had a faith or no faith at all. <eob>
Nothing mattered <eob> other than I was a precious human life. <eob>
I see myself as a living fact. <eob>
I am proof <eob> that unconditional love and respect <eol> can not only save, <eob> but it can transform lives. <eob>
Here is a wonderful image <eol> of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I <eob> taken just last year. <eob>
Ten years after the event, <eob> and here we are, arm in arm. <eob>
Throughout all the chaos, <eob> my hand was held tightly. <eob> My face was stroked gently. <eob>
What did I feel? <eob> I felt loved. <eob> What's shielded me from hatred <eol> and wanting retribution, <eob> what's given me the courage to say: <eob> this ends with me <eob> is love. <eob> I was loved. <eob>
I believe the potential <eol> for widespread positive change <eob> is absolutely enormous <eob> because I know what we're capable of. <eob>
I know the brilliance of humanity. <eob>
So this leaves me with some <eol> pretty big things to ponder <eob> and some questions for us all to consider: <eob> Is what unites us not far greater <eol> than what can ever divide? <eob>
Does it have to take <eol> a tragedy or a disaster <eob> for us to feel deeply <eol> connected as one species, <eob> as human beings? <eob>
And when will we embrace <eol> the wisdom of our era <eob> to rise above mere tolerance <eob> and move to an acceptance <eob> for all who are only a label <eol> until we know them? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Ichthyology, <eob> the study of fishes. <eob>
It looks like a big, boring word, <eob> but it's actually quite exciting, <eob> because ichthyology is the only "ology" <eob> with "YOLO" in it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, to the cool kids in the audience, <eob> you already know, YOLO stands for "you <eol> only live once," <eob> and because I only have one life, <eob> I'm going to spend it <eol> doing what I always dreamt of doing: <eob> seeing the hidden wonders <eol> of the world and discovering new species. <eob>
And that's what I get to do. <eob>
Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves <eol> for finding new species. <eob>
And it turns out, there's lots of new <eol> cavefish species out there. <eob> You just have to know where to look, <eob> and to maybe be a little thin. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, cavefishes can tell me <eol> a lot about biology and geology. <eob>
They can tell me how the landmasses <eol> around them have changed and moved <eob> by being stuck in these little holes, <eob> and they can tell me about the evolution <eol> of sight, by being blind. <eob>
Now, fish have eyes that <eol> are essentially the same as ours. <eob>
All vertebrates do, and each time <eol> a fish species starts to adapt <eob> to this dark, cold, cave environment, <eob> over many, many generations, <eol> they lose their eyes and their eyesight <eob> until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here. <eob>
Now, each cavefish species <eol> has evolved in a slightly different way, <eob> and each one has a unique geological <eol> and biological story to tell us, <eob> and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species. <eob>
So this is a new species we described, <eol> from southern Indiana. <eob>
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, <eol> the Hoosier cavefish. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Its closest relatives are cavefishes <eol> in Kentucky, <eob> in the Mammoth Cave system. <eob>
And they start to diverge when <eol> the Ohio River split them <eob> a few million years ago. <eob>
And in that time they developed <eol> these subtle differences <eob> in the genetic architecture <eol> behind their blindness. <eob>
There's this gene called rhodopsin <eol> that's super-critical for sight. <eob>
We have it, and these species <eol> have it too, <eob> except one species has lost <eol> all function in that gene, <eob> and the other one maintains it. <eob>
So this sets up this beautiful <eol> natural experiment <eob> where we can look at the genes <eol> behind our vision, <eob> and at the very roots <eol> of how we can see. <eob>
But the genes in these cavefishes <eob> can also tell us about deep <eol> geological time, <eob> maybe no more so than in this species here. <eob>
This is a new species <eol> we described from Madagascar <eob> that we named Typhleotris mararybe. <eob>
That means "big sickness" <eol> in Malagasy, <eob> for how sick we got trying <eol> to collect this species. <eob>
Now, believe it or not, <eob> swimming around sinkholes <eol> full of dead things <eob> and cave full of bat poop <eob> isn't the smartest thing <eol> you could be doing with your life, <eob> but YOLO. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I love this species despite the fact <eol> that it tried to kill us, <eob> and that's because this species <eol> in Madagascar, <eob> its closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away, <eob> cavefishes in Australia. <eob>
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish <eob> can swim across the Indian Ocean, <eob> so what we found when we compared <eol> the DNA of these species <eob> is that they've been separated <eol> for more than 100 million years, <eob> or about the time that the southern continents <eol> were last together. <eob>
So in fact, these species <eol> didn't move at all. <eob> It's the continents <eol> that moved them. <eob>
And so they give us, through their DNA, <eob> this precise model and measure <eob> of how to date and time <eol> these ancient geological events. <eob>
Now, this species here is so new <eob> I'm not even allowed <eol> to tell you its name yet, <eob> but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico, <eob> and it's probably already extinct. <eob>
It's probably extinct because the only known cave <eol> system it's from <eob> was destroyed when a dam <eol> was built nearby. <eob>
Unfortunately for cavefishes, <eob> their groundwater habitat <eob> is also our main source of drinking water. <eob>
Now, we actually don't know <eol> this species' closest relative, yet. <eob>
It doesn't appear <eol> to be anything else in Mexico, <eob> so maybe it's something in Cuba, <eob> or Florida, or India. <eob>
But whatever it is, it might tell us <eol> something new about the geology <eob> of the Caribbean, or the biology <eol> of how to better diagnose <eob> certain types of blindness. <eob>
But I hope we discover this species <eol> before it goes extinct too. <eob>
And I'm going to spend my one life <eob> as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save <eob> these humble little blind cavefishes <eob> that can tell us so much <eol> about the geology of the planet <eob> and the biology of how we see. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So I'd like you <eol> to imagine for a moment <eob> that you're a soldier <eol> in the heat of battle. <eob>
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier <eol> or a medieval archer <eob> or maybe you're a Zulu warrior. <eob>
Regardless of your time and place, <eol> there are some things that are constant. <eob>
Your adrenaline is elevated, <eob> and your actions are stemming <eol> from these deeply ingrained reflexes, <eob> reflexes rooted <eol> in a need to protect yourself and your side <eob> and to defeat the enemy. <eob>
So now, I'd like you to imagine <eol> playing a very different role, <eob> that of the scout. <eob>
The scout's job is not <eol> to attack or defend. <eob>
The scout's job is to understand. <eob>
The scout is the one going out, <eob> mapping the terrain, identifying <eol> potential obstacles. <eob> And the scout may hope to learn that, say, <eol> there's a bridge <eob> in a convenient location across a river. <eob>
But above all, the scout wants <eol> to know what's really there, <eob> as accurately as possible. <eob>
And in a real, actual army, <eol> both the soldier and the scout are essential. <eob>
But you can also think of each <eol> of these roles as a mindset -- <eob> a metaphor for how all of us process <eol> information and ideas <eob> in our daily lives. <eob>
What I'm going to argue today <eol> is that having good judgment, <eob> making accurate predictions, making good decisions, <eob> is mostly about which mindset <eol> you're in. <eob>
To illustrate these mindsets in action, <eob> I'm going to take you back <eol> to 19th-century France, <eob> where this innocuous-looking piece of paper <eob> launched one of the biggest <eol> political scandals in history. <eob>
It was discovered in 1894 <eol> by officers in the French general staff. <eob>
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, <eob> but when they pieced it back together, <eob> they discovered <eol> that someone in their ranks <eob> had been selling military secrets to Germany. <eob>
So they launched a big investigation, <eob> and their suspicions quickly <eol> converged on this man, <eob> Alfred Dreyfus. <eob>
He had a sterling record, <eob> no past history of wrongdoing, <eol> no motive as far as they could tell. <eob>
But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer <eol> at that rank in the army, <eob> and unfortunately at this time, <eol> the French Army was highly anti-Semitic. <eob>
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting <eol> to that on the memo <eob> and concluded that it was a match, <eob> even though outside professional handwriting experts <eob> were much less confident in the similarity, <eob> but never mind that. <eob>
They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, <eob> looking for any signs of espionage. <eob>
They went through his files, <eol> and they didn't find anything. <eob> This just convinced them more <eol> that Dreyfus was not only guilty, <eob> but sneaky as well, because clearly <eol> he had hidden all of the evidence <eob> before they had managed to get to it. <eob>
Next, they went and looked through <eol> his personal history <eob> for any incriminating details. <eob>
They talked to his teachers, <eob> they found that he had studied <eol> foreign languages in school, <eob> which clearly showed a desire <eol> to conspire with foreign governments <eob> later in life. <eob>
His teachers also said that Dreyfus <eol> was known for having a good memory, <eob> which was highly suspicious, right? <eob>
You know, because a spy has to remember <eol> a lot of things. <eob>
So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus <eol> was found guilty. <eob>
Afterwards, they took him <eol> out into this public square <eob> and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform <eob> and broke his sword in two. <eob>
This was called the Degradation <eol> of Dreyfus. <eob>
And they sentenced him <eol> to life imprisonment <eob> on the aptly named Devil's Island, <eob> which is this barren rock off <eol> the coast of South America. <eob>
So there he went, and there <eol> he spent his days alone, <eob> writing letters and letters <eol> to the French government <eob> begging them to reopen his case <eol> so they could discover his innocence. <eob>
But for the most part, France <eol> considered the matter closed. <eob>
One thing that's really interesting <eol> to me about the Dreyfus Affair <eob> is this question of why <eol> the officers were so convinced <eob> that Dreyfus was guilty. <eob>
I mean, you might even assume <eol> that they were setting him up, <eob> that they were intentionally framing him. <eob>
But historians don't think <eol> that's what happened. <eob>
As far as we can tell, <eob> the officers genuinely believed <eol> that the case against Dreyfus was strong. <eob>
Which makes you wonder: <eob> What does it say about the human mind <eob> that we can find such paltry evidence <eob> to be compelling enough to convict a man? <eob>
Well, this is a case of what scientists <eol> call "motivated reasoning." <eob> It's this phenomenon in which <eol> our unconscious motivations, <eob> our desires and fears, <eob> shape the way we interpret <eol> information. <eob>
Some information, some ideas, <eol> feel like our allies. <eob>
We want them to win. <eob>
We want to defend them. <eob>
And other information <eol> or ideas are the enemy, <eob> and we want to shoot them down. <eob>
So this is why I call motivated <eol> reasoning, "soldier mindset." <eob>
Probably most of you have never persecuted <eob> a French-Jewish officer <eol> for high treason, <eob> I assume, <eob> but maybe you've followed sports <eol> or politics, so you might have noticed <eob> that when the referee judges <eol> that your team committed a foul, <eob> for example, <eob> you're highly motivated <eol> to find reasons why he's wrong. <eob>
But if he judges that the other team <eol> committed a foul -- awesome! <eob>
That's a good call, let's not <eol> examine it too closely. <eob>
Or, maybe you've read <eol> an article or a study <eob> that examined some controversial policy, <eob> like capital punishment. <eob>
And, as researchers have demonstrated, <eob> if you support capital punishment <eob> and the study shows <eol> that it's not effective, <eob> then you're highly motivated <eol> to find all the reasons <eob> why the study was poorly designed. <eob>
But if it shows that capital <eol> punishment works, <eob> it's a good study. <eob>
And vice versa: if you don't support <eol> capital punishment, same thing. <eob>
Our judgment is strongly <eol> influenced, unconsciously, <eob> by which side we want to win. <eob>
And this is ubiquitous. <eob>
This shapes how we think <eol> about our health, our relationships, <eob> how we decide how to vote, <eob> what we consider fair or ethical. <eob>
What's most scary to me <eol> about motivated reasoning <eob> or soldier mindset, <eob> is how unconscious it is. <eob>
We can think we're being objective <eol> and fair-minded <eob> and still wind up ruining the life <eol> of an innocent man. <eob>
However, fortunately for Dreyfus, <eol> his story is not over. <eob>
This is Colonel Picquart. <eob>
He's another high-ranking officer <eol> in the French Army, <eob> and like most people, he assumed <eol> Dreyfus was guilty. <eob>
Also like most people in the army, <eol> he was at least casually anti-Semitic. <eob>
But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect: <eob> "What if we're all wrong <eol> about Dreyfus?" <eob> What happened was, he had discovered evidence <eob> that the spying for Germany <eol> had continued, <eob> even after Dreyfus was in prison. <eob>
And he had also discovered <eol> that another officer in the army <eob> had handwriting <eol> that perfectly matched the memo, <eob> much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. <eob>
So he brought these discoveries <eol> to his superiors, <eob> but to his dismay, they either didn't care <eob> or came up with elaborate <eol> rationalizations to explain his findings, <eob> like, "Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy <eob> who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting, <eob> and he picked up the torch of spying <eol> after Dreyfus left. <eob>
But Dreyfus is still guilty." <eob> Eventually, Picquart managed <eol> to get Dreyfus exonerated. <eob>
But it took him 10 years, <eob> and for part of that time, <eol> he himself was in prison <eob> for the crime of disloyalty <eol> to the army. <eob>
A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really <eol> be the hero of this story <eob> because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, <eol> which I agree with. <eob>
But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart <eol> was anti-Semitic <eob> actually makes his actions more admirable, <eob> because he had the same prejudices, <eol> the same reasons to be biased <eob> as his fellow officers, <eob> but his motivation to find the truth <eol> and uphold it trumped all of that. <eob>
So to me, <eob> Picquart is a poster child <eol> for what I call "scout mindset." <eob> It's the drive not to make <eol> one idea win or another lose, <eob> but just to see what's really there <eob> as honestly and accurately as you can, <eob> even if it's not pretty <eol> or convenient or pleasant. <eob>
This mindset is what <eol> I'm personally passionate about. <eob> And I've spent the last few years <eol> examining and trying to figure out <eob> what causes scout mindset. <eob>
And the answer is emotional. <eob> So, just as soldier mindset <eol> is rooted in emotions <eob> like defensiveness or tribalism, <eob> scout mindset is, too. <eob>
It's just rooted in different emotions. <eob>
For example, scouts are curious. <eob>
They're more likely to say <eol> they feel pleasure <eob> when they learn new information <eob> or an itch to solve a puzzle. <eob>
They're more likely to feel <eol> intrigued when they encounter something <eob> that contradicts their expectations. <eob> Scouts also have different values. <eob>
They're more likely to say <eol> they think it's virtuous <eob> to test your own beliefs, <eob> and they're less likely to say <eol> that someone who changes his mind <eob> seems weak. <eob>
And above all, scouts are grounded, <eob> which means their self-worth as a person <eob> isn't tied to how right or wrong <eol> they are about any particular topic. <eob>
So they can believe <eol> that capital punishment works. <eob>
If studies come out showing <eol> that it doesn't, they can say, <eob> "Huh. <eob>
Looks like I might be wrong. <eob>
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid. " <eob>
This cluster of traits is what researchers <eol> have found -- <eob> and I've also found anecdotally -- <eob> predicts good judgment. <eob>
And the key takeaway I want <eol> to leave you with about those traits <eob> is that they're primarily not <eol> about how smart you are <eob> or about how much you know. <eob>
In fact, they don't correlate <eol> very much with IQ at all. <eob>
They're about how you feel. <eob>
There's a quote that I keep coming <eol> back to, by Saint-Exupéry. <eob>
He's the author of "The Little Prince." <eob> He said, "If you want to build a ship, <eob> don't drum up your men <eol> to collect wood and give orders <eob> and distribute the work. <eob> Instead, teach them to yearn <eol> for the vast and endless sea." <eob> In other words, I claim, <eob> if we really want to improve <eol> our judgment as individuals <eob> and as societies, <eob> what we need most is not more instruction in logic <eob> or rhetoric or probability or economics, <eob> even though those things are quite valuable. <eob>
But what we most need <eol> to use those principles well <eob> is scout mindset. <eob>
We need to change the way we feel. <eob>
We need to learn <eol> how to feel proud instead of ashamed <eob> when we notice we might have been <eol> wrong about something. <eob>
We need to learn <eol> how to feel intrigued instead of defensive <eob> when we encounter some information <eol> that contradicts our beliefs. <eob>
So the question I want <eol> to leave you with is: <eob> What do you most yearn for? <eob>
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs? <eob>
Or do you yearn to see the world <eol> as clearly as you possibly can? <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
At Free America, we've done <eol> a listening and learning tour. <eob>
We visited not only with prosecutors <eob> but with legislators, <eob> with inmates in our state and local prisons. <eob>
We've gone to immigration <eol> detention centers. <eob>
We've met a lot of people. <eob>
And we've seen that redemption <eol> and transformation can happen <eob> in our prisons, our jails <eol> and our immigration detention centers, <eob> giving hope to those who want <eol> to create a better life <eob> after serving their time. <eob>
Imagine if we also considered <eol> the front end of this prison pipeline. <eob>
What would it look like if we intervened, <eob> with rehabilitation as a core value -- <eob> with love and compassion as core values? <eob>
We would have a society that is safer, <eob> healthier <eob> and worthy of raising our children in. <eob>
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt. <eob>
James served 12 years <eol> in the San Quentin State Prison <eob> and is being released in 18 months. <eob>
Now James, like you and me, <eob> is more than the worst thing he's done. <eob>
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet. <eob>
He committed a crime; <eob> he's paying his debt, <eob> and working hard to build the skills <eob> to make the transition back to a productive life <eob> when he enters the civilian population again. <eob>
Now James, like millions <eol> of people behind bars, <eob> is an example of what happens <eob> if we believe that our failings <eol> don't define who we are, <eob> that we are all worthy of redemption <eob> and if we support those impacted <eol> by mass incarceration, <eob> we can all heal together. <eob>
I'd like to introduce you <eol> to James right now, <eob> and he's going to share <eol> his journey of redemption <eob> through spoken word. <eob>
James Cavitt: Thanks, John. <eob>

Future software engineers, <eob> entrepreneurs, <eob> craftsmen, <eob> musicians <eob> and artists. <eob>
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work <eob> that men and women <eol> are doing on the inside <eob> to create better lives and futures <eol> for themselves <eob> after they serve their time. <eob>
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live." <eob>
I live in a world where most people <eol> are too afraid to go. <eob>
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, <eob> steel bars, <eob> where razor wire have a way <eob> of cutting away at the hopes <eol> for a brighter tomorrow. <eob>
I live in a world <eob> that kill people who kill people <eob> in order to teach people <eob> that killing people is wrong. <eob> Imagine that. <eob>
Better yet, <eob> imagine a world where healed people <eol> helped hurt people heal <eob> and become strong. <eob>
Maybe then we would all be singin' <eol> "Redemption Song." <eob>
I live in a world <eob> that has been called "hell on Earth" <eob> by those trapped inside. <eob>
But I've come to the stark realization <eob> that prison -- <eob> it really is what you make it. <eob>
You see, in spite of the harshness <eol> of my reality, <eob> there is a silver lining. <eob>
I knew that my freedom was gonna come, <eob> it was just a matter of time. <eob>
And so I treated my first steps <eol> as if they were my last mile, <eob> and I realized that <eol> you don't have to be free <eob> in order to experience freedom. <eob>
And just because you're free, <eob> doesn't mean that you have freedom. <eob>
Many of us, for years, have been battling <eol> our inner demons. <eob>
We walk around smiling when inside <eol> we're really screamin': <eob> freedom! <eob>
Don't you get it? <eob> We're all serving time; <eob> we're just in different places. <eob>
As for me, <eob> I choose to be free <eol> from the prisons I've created. <eob>
The key: <eob> forgiveness. <eob>
Action's my witness. <eob>
If we want freedom, <eob> then we gotta think different. <eob>
Because freedom ... <eob> it isn't a place. <eob>
It's a mind setting. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

I used to have this recurring dream <eob> where I'd walk into a roomful of people, <eob> and I'd try not to make eye <eol> contact with anyone. <eob>
Until someone notices me, <eob> and I just panic. <eob>
And the person walks up to me, <eob> and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so. <eob>
And what is your name?" <eob> And I'm just quiet, unable to respond. <eob>
After some awkward silence, he goes, <eob> "Have you forgotten your name?" <eob> And I'm still quiet. <eob>
And then, slowly, all the other people <eol> in the room begin to turn toward me <eob> and ask, almost in unison, <eob>
(Voice-over, several voices) <eob> "Have you forgotten your name?" <eob> As the chant gets louder, <eol> I want to respond, but I don't. <eob>
I'm a visual artist. <eob> Some of my work is humorous, <eob> and some is a bit funny but in a sad way. <eob>
And one thing that I really enjoy doing <eob> is making these little animations <eob> where I get to do the voice-over <eol> for all kinds of characters. <eob>
I've been a bear. <eob>
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale. <eob>
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
SS: I've been a greeting card. <eob>
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi. <eob>
SS: And my personal favorite <eol> is Frankenstein's monster. <eob>
(Video) Frankenstein's monster (SS's voice): (Grunts) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
SS: I just had to grunt <eol> a lot for that one. <eob>
A few years ago, I made <eol> this educational video <eob> about the history of video games. <eob>
And for that one, I got to do the voice <eol> of Space Invader. <eob>
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi. <eob>
SS: A dream come true, really, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And when that video <eol> was posted online, <eob> I just sat there on the computer, <eol> hitting "refresh," <eob> excited to see the response. <eob>
The first comment comes in. <eob>
(Video) Comment: Great job. <eob> SS: Yes! <eob> I hit "refresh." <eob>
(Video) Comment: Excellent video. <eob>
I look forward to the next one. <eob>
SS: This was just the first <eol> of a two-part video. <eob>
I hit "refresh." <eob> I was going to work <eol> on the second one next. <eob>
(Video) Comment: <eol> Where is part TWO? WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
SS: People other than my mom <eol> were saying nice things about me, <eob> on the Internet! <eob>
I hit "refresh." <eob> It felt like I had finally arrived. <eob>
(Video) Comment: His voice <eol> is annoying. No offense. <eob>
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh. <eob>
(Video) Comment: Could you remake <eol> this without peanut butter in your mouth? <eob>
SS: OK, at least the feedback <eol> is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh." <eob>
(Video) Comment: Please <eol> don't use this narrator again <eob> u can barely understand him. <eob>
SS: Refresh. <eob>
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow <eol> because of the Indian accent. <eob>
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things. <eob>
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent, <eob> I have a Pakistani accent, OK? <eob>
And number two, I clearly have <eol> a Pakistani accent. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But comments like that kept coming in, <eob> so I figured I should just ignore them <eob> and start working on the second part of the video. <eob>
I recorded my audio, <eob> but every time I sat down to edit, <eob> I just could not do it. <eob>
Every single time, it would take me <eol> back to my childhood, <eob> when I had a much harder time speaking. <eob>
I've stuttered for as long <eol> as I can remember. <eob>
I was the kid in class <eob> who would never raise his hand <eol> when he had a question -- <eob> or knew the answer. <eob>
Every time the phone rang, <eob> I would run to the bathroom <eol> so I would not have to answer it. <eob>
If it was for me, my parents <eol> would say I'm not around. <eob>
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom. <eob>
And I hated introducing myself, <eob> especially in groups. <eob>
"Have you forgotten your name?" <eob> I'd always stutter on my name, <eol> and there was usually someone who'd go, <eob> And then everybody would laugh. <eob>
That joke never got old. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I spent my childhood feeling <eol> that if I spoke, <eob> it would become obvious <eol> that there was something wrong with me, <eob> that I was not normal. <eob>
So I mostly stayed quiet. <eob>
And so you see, eventually for me to even be able <eol> to use my voice in my work <eob> was a huge step for me. <eob>
Every time I record audio, <eob> I fumble my way through saying <eol> each sentence many, many times, <eob> and then I go back in <eob> and pick the ones where I think <eol> I suck the least. <eob>
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing <eol> is like Photoshop for your voice. <eob>
I can slow it down, speed it up, <eol> make it deeper, add an echo. <eob>
And if I stutter along the way, <eol> and if I stutter along the way, <eob> I just go back in and fix it. <eob> It's magic. <eob>
SS: Using my highly edited voice in my work <eob> was a way for me to finally sound normal <eol> to myself. <eob>
But after the comments on the video, <eob> it no longer made me feel normal. <eob>
And so I stopped using <eol> my voice in my work. <eob>
Since then, I've thought a lot <eol> about what it means to be normal. <eob>
And I've come to understand <eob> that "normal" has a lot to do <eol> with expectations. <eob>
Let me give you an example. <eob>
I came across this story <eob> about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer. <eob>
Now, Homer mentions <eol> very few colors in his writing. <eob>
And even when he does, <eob> he seems to get them quite a bit wrong. <eob>
For example, the sea <eol> is described as wine red, <eob> people's faces are sometimes green <eol> and sheep are purple. <eob>
But it's not just Homer. <eob>
If you look at all of the ancient literature -- <eob> Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian <eob> and even the original Hebrew Bible -- <eob> they all mention very few colors. <eob>
And the most popular theory for why <eol> that might be the case <eob> is that cultures <eol> begin to recognize a color <eob> only once they have the ability <eol> to make that color. <eob>
So basically, if you can make a color, <eob> only then can you see it. <eob>
A color like red, which was fairly <eol> easy for many cultures to make -- <eob> they began to see <eol> that color fairly early on. <eob>
But a color like blue, <eol> which was much harder to make -- <eob> many cultures didn't begin <eol> to learn how to make that color <eob> until much later. <eob>
They didn't begin to see it <eob> until much later <eob> as well. <eob>
So until then, even though <eol> a color might be all around them, <eob> they simply did not have <eol> the ability to see it. <eob> It was invisIble. <eob> It was not a part of their normal. <eob>
And that story has helped put <eol> my own experience into context. <eob>
So when I first read the comments on the video, <eob> my initial reaction was to take it <eol> all very personally. <eob>
But the people commenting did not know <eob> how self-conscious I am about my voice. <eob>
They were mostly reacting to my accent, <eob> that it is not normal <eol> for a narrator to have an accent. <eob>
But what is normal, anyway? <eob>
We know that reviewers <eol> will find more spelling errors in your writing <eob> if they think you're black. <eob> We know that professors are less likely <eol> to help female or minority students. <eob> And we know that resumes <eol> with white-sounding names <eob> get more callbacks than resumes <eol> with black-sounding names. <eob> Why is that? <eob> Because of our expectations <eol> of what is normal. <eob>
We think it is normal <eob> when a black student has spelling errors. <eob>
We think it is normal <eob> when a female or minority <eol> student does not succeed. <eob>
And we think it is normal <eob> that a white employee is a better hire <eol> than a black employee. <eob>
But studies also show <eol> that discrimination of this kind, <eob> in most cases, is simply favoritism, <eob> and it results more from wanting <eol> to help people that you can relate to <eob> than the desire to harm people <eol> that you can't relate to. <eob>
And not relating to people starts <eol> at a very early age. <eob>
Let me give you an example. <eob>
One library that keeps track of characters <eob> in the children's book <eol> collection every year, <eob> found that in 2014, only <eol> about 11 percent of the books <eob> had a character of color. <eob>
And just the year before, <eol> that number was about eight percent, <eob> even though half of American children <eol> today come from a minority background. <eob> Half. <eob>
So there are two big issues here. <eob> Number one, children are told <eol> that they can be anything, <eob> they can do anything, <eob> and yet, most stories <eol> that children of color consume <eob> are about people who are not like them. <eob>
Number two is that majority groups <eol> don't get to realize <eob> the great extent to which <eol> they are similar to minorities -- <eob> our everyday experiences, our hopes, <eob> our dreams, our fears <eob> and our mutual love for hummus. <eob> It's delicious! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just like the color blue <eol> for Ancient Greeks, <eob> minorities are not a part <eol> of what we consider normal, <eob> because normal is simply a construction <eol> of what we've been exposed to, <eob> and how visible it is around us. <eob>
And this is where things <eol> get a bit difficult. <eob>
I can accept the preexisting notion <eol> of normal -- that normal is good, <eob> and anything outside of that very narrow definition <eol> of normal is bad. <eob>
Or I can challenge <eol> that preexisting notion of normal <eob> with my work <eob> and with my voice <eob> and with my accent <eob> and by standing here onstage, <eob> even though I'm scared shitless <eol> and would rather be in the bathroom. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly <eol> starting to use my voice <eob> in my work again. <eob>
And it feels good. <eob>
It does not mean <eol> I won't have a breakdown <eob> the next time a couple dozen <eol> people say that I talk <eob> (Mumbling) like I have peanut <eol> butter in my mouth. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
SS: It just means I now have <eol> a much better understanding <eob> of what's at stake, <eob> and how giving up is not an option. <eob>
The Ancient Greeks didn't just <eol> wake up one day and realize <eob> that the sky was blue. <eob>
It took centuries, even, for humans <eol> to realize what we had been ignoring <eob> for so long. <eob>
And so we must continuously challenge <eol> our notion of normal, <eob> because doing so is going to allow us <eol> as a society <eob> to finally see the sky <eol> for what it is. <eob>
(Video) Characters: Thank you. <eol> Thank you. <eob> Thank you. <eob> Thank you. <eol> Thank you. <eob> Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts) <eob>
Imagine you are a part of a crew <eol> of astronauts <eob> traveling to Mars or some distant planet. <eob>
The travel time could take a year <eob> or even longer. <eob>
The space on board and the resources <eob> would be limited. <eob>
So you and the crew would have <eol> to figure out how to produce food <eob> with minimal inputs. <eob>
What if you could bring with <eol> you just a few packets of seeds, <eob> and grow crops in a matter of hours? <eob>
And what if those crops <eol> would then make more seeds, <eob> enabling you to feed the entire crew <eob> with just those few packets <eol> of seeds for the duration of the trip? <eob>
Well, the scientists at NASA actually <eol> figured out a way to do this. <eob>
What they came up with <eol> was actually quite interesting. <eob>
It involved microorganisms, <eob> which are single-celled organisms. <eob>
And they also used hydrogen from water. <eob>
The types of microbes that they used <eol> were called hydrogenotrophs, <eob> and with these hydrogenotrophs, <eol> you can create a virtuous carbon cycle <eob> that would sustain life <eol> onboard a spacecraft. <eob>
Astronauts would breathe <eol> out carbon dioxide, <eob> that carbon dioxide would then be captured <eol> by the microbes <eob> and converted into a nutritious, <eol> carbon-rich crop. <eob>
The astronauts would then eat <eol> that carbon-rich crop <eob> and exhale the carbon out <eol> in the form of carbon dioxide, <eob> which would then be captured <eol> by the microbes, <eob> to create a nutritious crop, <eob> which then would be exhaled <eol> in the form of carbon dioxide <eob> by the astronauts. <eob>
So in this way, a closed-loop <eol> carbon cycle is created. <eob>
So why is this important? <eob> We need carbon to survive as humans, <eob> and we get our carbon from food. <eob>
On a long space journey, <eob> you simply wouldn't be able <eol> to pick up any carbon along the way, <eob> so you'd have to figure out <eol> how to recycle it on board. <eob>
This is a clever solution, right? <eob>
But the thing is, <eol> that research didn't really go anywhere. <eob>
We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone <eol> to another planet. <eob>
And this was actually done <eol> in the '60s and '70s. <eob>
So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I, <eob> were interested, actually, in carbon <eol> recycling here on Earth. <eob>
We wanted to come up with technical solutions <eob> to address climate change. <eob>
And we discovered this research <eob> by reading some papers <eol> published in the '60s -- 1967 and later -- <eob> articles about this work. <eob>
And we thought it was a really good idea. <eob>
So we said, well, Earth is actually <eol> like a spaceship. <eob>
We have limited space <eol> and limited resources, <eob> and on Earth, we really do need to figure out <eob> how to recycle our carbon better. <eob>
So we had the idea, <eob> can we take some of these <eol> NASA-type ideas and apply them <eob> to our carbon problem here on Earth? <eob>
Could we cultivate these <eol> NASA-type microbes <eob> in order to make valuable <eol> products here on Earth? <eob>
We started a company to do it. <eob>
And in that company, we discovered <eol> that these hydrogenotrophs -- <eob> which I'll actually call <eol> nature's supercharged carbon recyclers -- <eob> we found that they are a powerful class of microbes <eob> that had been largely <eol> overlooked and understudied, <eob> and that they could make some really valuable products. <eob>
So we began cultivating these products, <eol> these microbes, in our lab. <eob>
We found that we can make essential <eol> amino acids from carbon dioxide <eob> using these microbes. <eob>
And we even made a protein-rich meal <eob> that has an amino acid profile <eol> similar to what you might find <eob> in some animal proteins. <eob>
We began cultivating them even further, <eob> and we found that we can make oil. <eob>
Oils are used to manufacture <eol> many products. <eob>
We made an oil that was similar <eol> to a citrus oil, <eob> which can be used for flavoring <eol> and for fragrances, <eob> but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner <eob> or even as a jet fuel. <eob>
And we made an oil <eol> that's similar to palm oil. <eob>
Palm oil is used to manufacture <eob> a wide range of consumer <eol> and industrial goods. <eob>
We began working with manufacturers <eol> to scale up this technology, <eob> and we're currently working with them <eob> to bring some of these products to market. <eob>
We believe this type of technology <eol> can indeed help us <eob> profitably recycle carbon dioxide <eol> into valuable products -- <eob> something that's beneficial for the planet <eob> but also beneficial for business. <eob>
That's what we're doing today. <eob>
But tomorrow, this type of technology <eol> and using these types of microbes <eob> actually could help us do something even greater <eob> if we take it to the next level. <eob>
We believe that this type of technology <eob> can actually help us address <eol> an issue with agriculture <eob> and allow us to create a type <eol> of agriculture that's sustainable, <eob> that will allow us to scale <eol> to meet the demands of tomorrow. <eob>
And why might we need <eol> a sustainable agriculture? <eob>
Well, actually, it is estimated <eob> that the population will reach <eol> about 10 billion by 2050, <eob> and we're projecting <eol> that we will need to increase food production <eob> by 70 percent. <eob>
In addition, we will need many more resources <eol> and raw materials <eob> to make consumer goods and industrial goods. <eob>
So how will we scale to meet that demand? <eob>
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably <eol> scale to meet that demand. <eob>
There are a number of reasons why. <eob>
One of them is that modern agriculture <eol> is one of the largest emitters <eob> of greenhouse gases. <eob>
In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases <eob> than our cars, our trucks, our planes <eob> and our trains combined. <eob>
Another reason is that modern ag <eol> simply takes up a whole lot of land. <eob>
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles <eol> for crops and livestock. <eob>
What does that look like? <eob>
Well, that's roughly the size <eol> of South America and Africa combined. <eob>
Let me give you a specific example. <eob>
In Indonesia, an amount of virgin <eol> rainforest was cleared <eob> totaling the size of approximately Ireland, <eob> between 2000 and 2012. <eob>
Just think of all of the species, the diversity, <eob> that was removed <eol> in the process, <eob> whether plant life, insects or animal life. <eob>
And a natural carbon sink <eol> was also removed. <eob>
So let me make this real for you. <eob> This clearing happened primarily <eol> to make room for palm plantations. <eob>
And as I mentioned before, <eob> palm oil is used <eol> to manufacture many products. <eob>
In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent <eol> of consumer products <eob> are manufactured using palm oil. <eob>
And that includes things like ice cream, <eol> cookies ... <eob> It includes cooking oils. <eob>
It also includes detergents, <eol> lotions, soaps. <eob>
You and I both probably <eol> have numerous items <eob> in our kitchens and our bathrooms <eob> that were manufactured using palm oil. <eob>
So you and I are direct beneficiaries <eol> of removed rainforests. <eob>
Modern ag has some problems, <eob> and we need solutions if we want <eol> to scale sustainably. <eob>
I believe that microbes can be <eol> a part of the answer -- <eob> specifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers. <eob>
These supercharged carbon recyclers, <eob> like plants, serve <eol> as the natural recyclers <eob> in their ecosystems where they thrive. <eob>
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth, <eob> like hydrothermal vents and hot springs. <eob>
In those ecosystems, <eol> they take carbon and recycle it <eob> into the nutrients needed <eol> for those ecosystems. <eob> And they're rich in nutrients, <eob> such as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates. <eob>
And actually, microbes are already <eol> an integral part of our everyday lives. <eob>
If you enjoy a glass of pinot <eol> noir on a Friday night, <eob> after a long, hard work week, <eob> then you are enjoying a product of microbes. <eob>
If you enjoy a beer <eol> from your local microbrewery -- <eob> a product of microbes. <eob>
Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt. <eob>
These are all products of microbes. <eob>
But the beauty and power associated <eol> with these supercharged carbon recyclers <eob> lies in the fact that they can actually <eol> produce in a matter of hours <eob> versus months. <eob>
That means we can make crops <eob> much faster than we're making them today. <eob>
They grow in the dark, <eob> so they can grow in any season <eob> and in any geography and any location. <eob>
They can grow in containers <eol> that require minimal space. <eob>
And we can get to a type <eol> of vertical agriculture. <eob>
Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture <eob> that requires so much land, <eob> we can scale vertically, <eob> and as a result produce <eol> much more product per area. <eob>
If we implement this type of approach <eol> and use these carbon recyclers, <eob> then we wouldn't have <eol> to remove any more rainforests <eob> to make the food and the goods <eol> that we consume. <eob>
Because, at a large scale, <eob> you can actually make 10,000 times <eol> more output per land area <eob> than you could -- for instance, <eol> if you used soybeans -- <eob> if you planted soybeans <eol> on that same area of land <eob> over a period of a year. <eob>
Ten thousand times <eob> over a period of a year. <eob>
So this is what I mean <eol> by a new type of agriculture. <eob>
And this is what I mean <eol> by developing a system <eob> that allows us to sustainably scale <eol> to meet the demands of 10 billion. <eob>
And what would be the products <eol> of this new type of agriculture? <eob>
Well, we've already made a protein meal, <eob> so you can imagine something similar <eol> to a soybean meal, <eob> or even cornmeal, or wheat flour. <eob>
We've already made oils, <eob> so you can imagine <eol> something similar to coconut oil <eob> or olive oil or soybean oil. <eob>
So this type of crop <eol> can actually produce the nutrients <eob> that would give us pasta and bread, <eob> cakes, nutritional items <eol> of many sorts. <eob>
Furthermore, since oil is used <eol> to manufacture multiple other goods, <eob> industrial products and consumer products, <eob> you can imagine being able to make <eol> detergents, soaps, lotions, etc., <eob> using these types of crops. <eob>
Not only are we running out of space, <eob> but if we continue to operate <eol> under the status quo <eob> with modern agriculture, <eob> we run the risk of robbing our progeny <eol> of a beautiful planet. <eob>
But it doesn't have to be this way. <eob>
We can imagine a future of abundance. <eob>
Let us create systems <eol> that keep planet Earth, our spaceship, <eob> not only from not crashing, <eob> but let us also develop systems <eol> and ways of living <eob> that will be beneficial <eol> to the lives of ourselves <eob> and the 10 billion <eol> that will be on this planet by 2050. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hi. My name is Marwa, <eol> and I'm an architect. <eob>
I was born and raised in Homs, <eob> a city in the central <eol> western part of Syria, <eob> and I've always lived here. <eob>
After six years of war, <eob> Homs is now a half-destroyed city. <eob>
My family and I were lucky; <eol> our place is still standing. <eob>
Although for two years, <eol> we were like prisoners at home. <eob>
Outside there were demonstrations <eol> and battles and bombings and snipers. <eob>
My husband and I used to run <eol> an architecture studio <eob> in the old town main square. <eob>
It's gone, as is most <eol> of the old town itself. <eob>
Half of the city's other neighborhoods <eob> are now rubble. <eob>
Since the ceasefire in late 2015, <eob> large parts of Homs <eol> have been more or less quiet. <eob>
The economy is completely broken, <eol> and people are still fighting. <eob>
The merchants who had stalls <eol> in the old city market <eob> now trade out of sheds on the streets. <eob>
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter, <eob> sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house, <eol> workshops, among many more. <eob> I have started teaching part-time, <eob> and with my husband, <eol> who juggles several jobs, <eob> we've opened a small bookshop. <eob>
Other people do all sorts <eol> of jobs to get by. <eob>
When I look at my destroyed city, <eol> of course, I ask myself: <eob> What has led to this senseless war? <eob>
Syria was largely a place of tolerance, <eob> historically accustomed to variety, <eob> accommodating a wide range <eol> of beliefs, origins, customs, <eob> goods, food. <eob>
How did my country -- <eob> a country with communities <eol> living harmoniously together <eob> and comfortable in discussing <eol> their differences -- <eob> how did it degenerate into civil war, <eol> violence, displacement <eob> and unprecedented sectarian hatred? <eob>
There were many reasons <eol> that had led to the war -- <eob> social, political and economic. <eob>
They all have played their role. <eob>
But I believe there is one key reason <eol> that has been overlooked <eob> and which is important to analyze, <eob> because from it will largely depend <eob> whether we can make sure <eol> that this doesn't happen again. <eob>
And that reason is architecture. <eob>
Architecture in my country <eol> has played an important role <eob> in creating, directing and amplifying <eol> conflict between warring factions, <eob> and this is probably true <eol> for other countries as well. <eob>
There is a sure correspondence <eol> between the architecture of a place <eob> and the character of the community <eol> that has settled there. <eob>
Architecture plays a key role <eol> in whether a community crumbles <eob> or comes together. <eob>
Syrian society has long lived <eol> the coexistence <eob> of different traditions and backgrounds. <eob>
Syrians have experienced <eol> the prosperity of open trade <eob> and sustainable communities. <eob>
They have enjoyed the true meaning <eol> of belonging to a place, <eob> and that was reflected <eol> in their built environment, <eob> in the mosques and churches <eol> built back-to-back, <eob> in the interwoven souks and public venues, <eob> and the proportions and sizes based <eol> on principles of humanity and harmony. <eob>
This architecture of mixity <eol> can still be read in the remains. <eob>
The old Islamic city in Syria <eol> was built over a multilayered past, <eob> integrating with it <eol> and embracing its spirit. <eob>
So did its communities. <eob>
People lived and worked with each other <eob> in a place that gave them <eol> a sense of belonging <eob> and made them feel at home. <eob>
They shared a remarkably <eol> unified existence. <eob>
But over the last century, <eob> gradually this delicate balance <eol> of these places has been interfered with; <eob> first, by the urban planners <eol> of the colonial period, <eob> when the French went <eol> enthusiastically about, <eob> transforming what they saw <eol> as the un-modern Syrian cities. <eob>
They blew up city streets <eol> and relocated monuments. <eob>
They called them improvements, <eob> and they were the beginning <eol> of a long, slow unraveling. <eob>
The traditional urbanism <eol> and architecture of our cities <eob> assured identity and belonging <eol> not by separation, <eob> but by intertwining. <eob>
But over time, the ancient became <eol> worthless, and the new, coveted. <eob>
The harmony of the built <eol> environment and social environment <eob> got trampled over by elements <eol> of modernity — <eob> brutal, unfinished concrete blocks, <eob> neglect, aesthetic devastation, <eob> divisive urbanism that zoned communities <eol> by class, creed or affluence. <eob>
And the same was happening <eol> to the community. <eob>
As the shape of the built environment changed, <eob> so the lifestyles and sense <eol> of belonging of the communities <eob> also started changing. <eob>
From a register <eol> of togetherness, of belonging, <eob> architecture became <eol> a way of differentiation, <eob> and communities started drifting apart <eob> from the very fabric <eol> that used to unite them, <eob> and from the soul of the place that used <eol> to represent their common existence. <eob>
While many reasons had led <eol> to the Syrian war, <eob> we shouldn't underestimate <eol> the way in which, <eob> by contributing to the loss <eol> of identity and self-respect, <eob> urban zoning and misguided, <eol> inhumane architecture <eob> have nurtured sectarian <eol> divisions and hatred. <eob>
Over time, the united city <eol> has morphed into a city center <eob> with ghettos along its circumference. <eob>
And in turn, the coherent communities <eol> became distinct social groups, <eob> alienated from each other <eol> and alienated from the place. <eob>
From my point of view, <eob> losing the sense of belonging to a place <eob> and a sense of sharing it <eol> with someone else <eob> has made it a lot easier to destroy. <eob>
The clear example can be seen <eol> in the informal housing system, <eob> which used to host, before the war, <eol> over 40 percent of the population. <eob>
Yes, prior to the war, <eol> almost half of the Syrian population <eob> lived in slums, <eob> peripheral areas <eol> without proper infrastructure, <eob> made of endless rows of bare block boxes <eob> containing people, <eob> people who mostly belonged <eol> to the same group, <eob> whether based on religion, <eol> class, origin or all of the above. <eob>
This ghettoized urbanism <eol> proved to be a tangible precursor of war. <eob>
Conflict is much easier <eol> between pre-categorized areas -- <eob> where the "others" live. <eob>
The ties that used <eol> to bind the city together -- <eob> whether they were social, <eol> through coherent building, <eob> or economic, through trade in the souk, <eob> or religious, through <eol> the coexistent presence -- <eob> were all lost in the misguided <eol> and visionless modernization <eob> of the built environment. <eob>
Allow me an aside. <eob> When I read about heterogeneous urbanism <eol> in other parts of the world, <eob> involving ethnic neighborhoods <eol> in British cities <eob> or around Paris or Brussels, <eob> I recognize the beginning <eol> of the kind of instability <eob> we have witnessed <eol> so disastrously here in Syria. <eob>
We have severely destroyed cities, <eob> such as Homs, Aleppo, <eol> Daraa and many others, <eob> and almost half of the population <eol> of the country is now displaced. <eob>
Hopefully, the war will end, <eob> and the question that, <eol> as an architect, I have to ask, is: <eob> How do we rebuild? <eob>
What are the principles <eol> that we should adopt <eob> in order to avoid repeating <eol> the same mistakes? <eob>
From my point of view, <eob> the main focus should be on creating places <eob> that make their people feel they belong. <eob>
Architecture and planning <eol> need to recapture <eob> some of the traditional values <eol> that did just that, <eob> creating the conditions <eol> for coexistence and peace, <eob> values of beauty <eol> that don't exhibit ostentation, <eob> but rather, approachability and ease, <eob> moral values that promote <eol> generosity and acceptance, <eob> architecture that is for everyone <eol> to enjoy, not just for the elite, <eob> just as used to be in the shadowed alleys <eol> of the old Islamic city, <eob> mixed designs that encourage <eol> a sense of community. <eob>
There is a neighborhood here in Homs <eol> that's called Baba Amr <eob> that has been fully destroyed. <eob>
Almost two years ago, <eol> I introduced this design <eob> into a UN-Habitat competition <eol> for rebuilding it. <eob>
The idea was to create an urban fabric <eol> inspired by a tree, <eob> capable of growing <eol> and spreading organically, <eob> echoing the traditional bridge <eol> hanging over the old alleys, <eob> and incorporating apartments, <eol> private courtyards, shops, <eob> workshops, places for parking <eol> and playing and leisure, <eob> trees and shaded areas. <eob>
It's far from perfect, obviously. <eob>
I drew it during the few hours <eol> of electricity we get. <eob>
And there are many possible ways <eol> to express belonging and community <eob> through architecture. <eob>
But compare it with the freestanding, <eol> disconnected blocks <eob> proposed by the official project <eol> for rebuilding Baba Amr. <eob>
Architecture is not the axis <eol> around which all human life rotates, <eob> but it has the power to suggest <eol> and even direct human activity. <eob>
In that sense, settlement, <eol> identity and social integration <eob> are all the producer and product <eol> of effective urbanism. <eob>
The coherent urbanism <eol> of the old Islamic city <eob> and of many old European <eol> towns, for instance, <eob> promote integration, <eob> while rows of soulless housing <eol> or tower blocks, <eob> even when they are luxurious, <eob> tend to promote isolation and "otherness." <eob> Even simple things <eob> like shaded places or fruit plants <eol> or drinking water inside the city <eob> can make a difference <eol> in how people feel towards the place, <eob> and whether they consider it <eol> a generous place that gives, <eob> a place that's worth keeping, <eol> contributing to, <eob> or whether they see it <eol> as an alienating place, <eob> full of seeds of anger. <eob>
In order for a place to give, <eol> its architecture should be giving, too. <eob>
Our built environment matters. <eob> The fabric of our cities is reflected <eol> in the fabric of our souls. <eob>
And whether in the shape <eol> of informal concrete slums <eob> or broken social housing <eob> or trampled old towns <eob> or forests of skyscrapers, <eob> the contemporary urban archetypes <eob> that have emerged <eol> all across the Middle East <eob> have been one cause of the alienation <eol> and fragmentation of our communities. <eob>
We can learn from this. <eob>
We can learn how to rebuild <eol> in another way, <eob> how to create an architecture <eol> that doesn't contribute only <eob> to the practical and economic <eol> aspects of people's lives, <eob> but also to their social, spiritual <eol> and psychological needs. <eob>
Those needs were totally overlooked <eol> in the Syrian cities before the war. <eob>
We need to create again <eol> cities that are shared <eob> by the communities that inhabit them. <eob>
If we do so, people will not feel the need <eob> to seek identities opposed <eol> to the other identities all around, <eob> because they will all feel at home. <eob>
Thank you for listening. <eob>
Tonight, I'm going to share <eol> with you my passion for science. <eob>
I'm not talking about science <eol> that takes baby steps. <eob>
I'm talking about science <eol> that takes enormous leaps. <eob>
I'm talking Darwin, <eol> I'm talking Einstein, <eob> I'm talking revolutionary science <eol> that turns the world on its head. <eob>
In a moment, I'm going to talk <eol> about two ideas that might do this. <eob>
I say "might" <eob> because, with revolutionary ideas, <eol> most are flat wrong, <eob> and even those that are <eol> right seldom have the impact <eob> that we want them to have. <eob>
To explain why I picked two ideas <eol> in particular, <eob> I'm going to start with a mystery. <eob>
1847, Vienna, Austria. <eob>
Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber, <eol> compulsively thorough doctor <eob> who ran two maternity clinics. <eob>
They were identical except for one thing. <eob>
Women were dying of high fevers soon <eol> after giving birth <eob> three times more often <eol> at one of the clinics than at the other. <eob>
Trying to figure out what the difference <eol> was that caused this, <eob> Semmelweis looked at everything <eol> he could. <eob> Sanitation? No. <eob> Medical procedures? No. <eob> Air flow? No. <eob>
The puzzle went unsolved <eol> until he happened to autopsy a doctor <eob> who died of an infected scalpel cut. <eob>
The doctor's symptoms were identical to those <eol> of the mothers who were dying. <eob> How was that possible? <eob> How could a male doctor <eol> get the same thing as new mothers? <eob>
Semmelweis reconstructed <eol> everything the doctor had done <eob> right before he got sick, <eob> and he discovered <eol> that he'd been autopsying a corpse. <eob>
Had something gotten <eol> in his wound that killed him? <eob>
With growing excitement, <eob> Semmelweis looked for any connection <eol> he could <eob> between dead bodies in the morgue <eol> and dead mothers in his delivery room, <eob> and he found it. <eob>
It turned out that at the hospital <eol> with the high death rate, <eob> but not the others, <eob> doctors delivered babies immediately <eol> after autopsying corpses in the morgue. <eob> Aha! Corpses <eol> were contaminating the doctors' hands <eob> and killing his mothers. <eob>
So he ordered the doctors <eol> to sterilize their hands, <eob> and the deaths stopped. <eob>
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis <eol> had discovered infectious disease. <eob>
But the doctors of the day <eol> thought he was crazy, <eob> because they knew, and had <eol> for hundreds of years, <eob> that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease, <eob> not these hypothetical particles <eol> that you couldn't see. <eob>
It took 20 years <eol> for Frenchman Louis Pasteur <eob> to prove that Semmelweis was right. <eob>
Pasteur was an agricultural chemist <eob> who tried to figure out why milk <eol> and beer spoiled so often. <eob>
He found that bacteria were the culprits. <eob>
He also found that bacteria could kill <eol> people in exactly the same way <eob> that Semmelweis's patients were dying. <eob>
We now look at what I want to talk <eol> about tonight, in two ideas. <eob>
We saw it with Semmelweis, <eol> that he was a revolutionary. <eob>
He did it for two reasons. <eob>
One, he opened our eyes <eol> to a completely new world. <eob>
We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria. <eob>
We just didn't know <eol> that bacteria killed people. <eob>
And he also demolished fond ideas <eol> that people kept close to their heart. <eob>
Miasmas didn't kill people. <eol> Bacteria killed people. <eob>
So this brings me to the two ideas <eol> I want to talk about tonight. <eob>
One has opened our eyes <eol> to a completely new universe, <eob> and the other attacks long-held beliefs. <eob>
Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig. <eob>
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes <eol> to an entirely new world <eob> by violating the laws of physics. <eob>
Betzig is a true rebel. <eob>
He quit a job at prestigious Bell Laboratory <eob> inventing new microscopes for biology <eob> because he thought scientists <eol> were taking his brilliant inventions <eob> and doing lousy work with them. <eob>
So he became a househusband, <eob> but he never lost his passion <eol> for figuring out <eob> how to get microscopes to see <eol> finer and finer details <eob> than had ever been seen <eol> before or ever could be seen. <eob>
This is crucial if we're ever <eol> going to understand how cells work, <eob> and how cancer works, <eob> and how something 150th the size <eol> of a head of a pin <eob> can do all these amazing things, <eob> like make proteins <eob> and move charges around <eob> and all of those things. <eob>
There's just one problem. <eob>
There's this thing called <eol> the law of physics, <eob> and part of the law of physics <eob> is the thing called <eol> the diffraction limit. <eob>
The diffraction limit is kind of like <eol> when you go to a doctor's office, <eob> you can only see so far down, <eol> no matter how good glasses you have. <eob>
This was a so-called impossible problem. <eob>
But one of Betzig's friends <eol> figured out how to take a tiny molecule <eob> that was smaller than the best microscope <eol> could see <eob> and get it to light up and fluoresce. <eob> "Aha!" Betzig said. <eob> "I think maybe the laws <eol> of physics are not so unbreakable after all." <eob>
So he lashed together a microscope <eol> in his friend's living room. <eob>
He had no laboratory. <eob>
This revolutionary instrument <eol> got different protein molecules <eob> to light up in different colors, <eob> and with a computer, he was able to turn <eol> very, very fuzzy blurs <eob> into very sharp dots and produce <eol> images of unprecedented and startling clarity. <eob>
For this work, last year, <eob> Eric Betzig won <eol> the Nobel Prize. <eob> Why? <eob> Because now we can see <eol> with unprecedented detail <eob> things that we never had seen before, <eob> and now doctors can get <eol> a better handle on things like cancer. <eob>
But do you think Betzig was satisfied there? <eob> No. <eob> He wanted movies. <eob> The problem was <eob> that even the genius microscopes <eol> that he invented were just too slow. <eob>
So what did he do? <eob> He came up with a 200-year-old idea <eob> called moiré patterns. <eob>
So the way that works <eol> is if you take two very, very fine patterns <eob> and you move them <eol> across each other, <eob> you will see a gross pattern <eob> that a microscope can see <eob> that otherwise you would not be able to see. <eob>
So he applied this technique <eol> to taking a really blurry image of a cell <eob> and moving lots of structured light patterns across it <eob> until this cell became crystal clear. <eob>
And here is the result: <eob> a mysterious new world, <eob> full of strange things <eol> zipping around <eob> doing things that we don't know <eol> what they're doing. <eob>
But when we figure it out, we'll have <eol> a better handle on life itself. <eob>
For example, those green globs that you see? <eob>
Those things are called clathrins. <eob>
They're molecules <eol> that protect other molecules <eob> as they move through a cell. <eob>
Unfortunately, viruses sometimes hijack <eol> those to infect cells. <eob>
Also, you see those little squiggly <eol> wormlike things moving around? <eob>
Those are actin molecules. <eob>
Unfortunately, viruses also climb down those things <eob> to get into the cell nucleus <eob> to replicate themselves <eol> and make you sick. <eob>
Now that we can look at movies <eob> of what's actually going on deep <eol> inside a cell, <eob> we have a much better chance <eol> of curing viral diseases like AIDS. <eob>
So when you look at a movie like this, <eob> it's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes <eol> to a completely new world. <eob>
But he hasn't shattered <eol> any cherished beliefs. <eob>
That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey <eob> at Cambridge. <eob>
De Grey definitely has scientists <eol> squirming with an interesting idea: <eob> we can be immortal. <eob> We can beat aging. <eob>
Now, most scientists think <eol> he's a crackpot. <eob>
Any Biology 101 student knows <eob> that aging is an inevitable <eol> consequence of living. <eob>
For example, when we eat, <eob> we take in food and we metabolize it, <eob> and that throws off <eol> what we call free radicals. <eob>
You might have heard of those. <eob>
Also known as oxygen ions, <eob> those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate, <eob> and cause us to get old and lose our hair. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's just like, no, it's exactly like <eob> oxygen binding to iron and making it rust. <eob>
So you age because you rust out. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh, and scientists also know there <eol> is something called immortality: <eob> in cancer cells. <eob>
So if you stop aging, <eob> all of you are going to turn into giant <eol> walking malignant tumors. <eob>
These are cherished beliefs, <eol> but could de Grey be on to something? <eob>
I think he deserves a closer look. <eob>
First of all, I have a really hard time <eol> seeing him as a crackpot. <eob>
Yeah, he started off life <eol> as a computer scientist, <eob> not a biologist, <eob> but he earned a PhD in biology from Cambridge, <eob> and he has published some very significant work <eob> on mitochondrial DNA <eol> and a bunch of other stuff. <eob>
Secondly, he started an antiaging foundation <eob> that has identified seven different <eol> causes of aging, <eob> to me, that seem very plausible, <eob> and he is hot in pursuit of fixes <eol> for every single one of them. <eob>
For example, one of the reasons <eol> we age is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates, <eob> and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy. <eob>
He believes, and he's made <eol> a convincing case, <eob> that using viruses <eol> we can do gene therapy, <eob> fix that DNA <eob> and rejuvenate our cells. <eob>
One more thing. <eob> We have an existent proof <eob> that extreme longevity is possible. <eob>
Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years, <eob> and some lobsters don't age at all. <eob>
Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey <eol> is going to revolutionize our lifespans. <eob>
I mean, after all, we're not trees, <eol> and most of us are not lobsters. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I've got to believe that there are Darwins <eol> and Einsteins out there, <eob> and I'll tell you why. <eob>
Consider this: <eob> there are seven times more people alive <eol> today than during Darwin's time. <eob>
There are four times as many people <eol> alive today as Einstein. <eob>
When you consider <eob> that the proportion of scientists <eol> in the population has skyrocketed, <eob> there are now seven million scientists. <eob>
I've got to believe, and I do believe, <eol> that there's one of them out there <eob> who is working right now in obscurity <eob> to rock our lives, and I don't know about you, <eob> but I can't wait to be rocked. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am British. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Never before has the phrase <eob> "I am British" <eob> elicited so much pity. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I come from an island where many <eol> of us like to believe <eob> there's been a lot of continuity <eol> over the last thousand years. <eob>
We tend to have historically <eol> imposed change on others <eob> but done much less of it ourselves. <eob>
So it came as an immense shock to me <eob> when I woke up on the morning <eol> of June 24 <eob> to discover that my country had voted <eol> to leave the European Union, <eob> my Prime Minister had resigned, <eob> and Scotland was considering <eol> a referendum <eob> that could bring to an end the very existence <eol> of the United Kingdom. <eob>
So that was an immense shock for me, <eob> and it was an immense shock <eol> for many people, <eob> but it was also something <eol> that, over the following several days, <eob> created a complete political meltdown <eob> in my country. <eob>
There were calls for a second referendum, <eob> almost as if, following a sports match, <eob> we could ask the opposition for a replay. <eob>
Everybody was blaming everybody else. <eob>
People blamed the Prime Minister <eob> for calling the referendum <eol> in the first place. <eob>
They blamed the leader of the opposition <eol> for not fighting it hard enough. <eob>
The young accused the old. <eob>
The educated blamed the less <eol> well-educated. <eob>
That complete meltdown was made even worse <eob> by the most tragic element of it: <eob> levels of xenophobia and racist <eol> abuse in the streets of Britain <eob> at a level that I have never seen before <eob> in my lifetime. <eob>
People are now talking about whether my country <eol> is becoming a Little England, <eob> or, as one of my colleagues put it, <eob> whether we're about to become <eol> a 1950s nostalgia theme park <eob> floating in the Atlantic Ocean. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But my question is really, <eob> should we have the degree of shock <eol> that we've experienced since? <eob>
Was it something <eol> that took place overnight? <eob>
Or are there deeper structural factors <eol> that have led us to where we are today? <eob>
So I want to take a step back <eol> and ask two very basic questions. <eob>
First, what does Brexit represent, <eob> not just for my country, <eob> but for all of us around the world? <eob>
And second, what can we do about it? <eob> How should we all respond? <eob>
So first, what does Brexit represent? <eob>
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. <eob>
Brexit teaches us many things <eol> about our society <eob> and about societies around the world. <eob>
It highlights in ways that we seem <eol> embarrassingly unaware of <eob> how divided our societies are. <eob>
The vote split along lines <eol> of age, education, class and geography. <eob>
Young people didn't turn out <eol> to vote in great numbers, <eob> but those that did wanted to remain. <eob>
Older people really wanted <eol> to leave the European Union. <eob>
Geographically, it was London and Scotland <eol> that most strongly committed <eob> to being part of the European Union, <eob> while in other parts of the country <eol> there was very strong ambivalence. <eob>
Those divisions are things <eol> we really need to recognize and take seriously. <eob>
But more profoundly, the vote <eol> teaches us something <eob> about the nature of politics today. <eob>
Contemporary politics is no longer <eol> just about right and left. <eob>
It's no longer just about tax and spend. <eob>
It's about globalization. <eob>
The fault line of contemporary politics <eol> is between those that embrace globalization <eob> and those that fear globalization. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
If we look at why those <eol> who wanted to leave -- <eob> we call them "Leavers," <eol> as opposed to "Remainers" -- <eob> we see two factors in the opinion polls <eob> that really mattered. <eob>
The first was immigration, <eol> and the second sovereignty, <eob> and these represent a desire <eol> for people to take back control of their own lives <eob> and the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians. <eob>
But those ideas are ones <eol> that signify fear and alienation. <eob>
They represent a retreat <eol> back towards nationalism and borders <eob> in ways that many of us would reject. <eob>
What I want to suggest is the picture <eol> is more complicated than that, <eob> that liberal internationalists, <eob> like myself, and I firmly include <eol> myself in that picture, <eob> need to write ourselves <eol> back into the picture <eob> in order to understand <eol> how we've got to where we are today. <eob>
When we look at the voting patterns <eol> across the United Kingdom, <eob> we can visibly see the divisions. <eob>
The blue areas show Remain <eob> and the red areas Leave. <eob>
When I looked at this, <eob> what personally struck me was <eol> the very little time in my life <eob> I've actually spent in many of the red areas. <eob>
I suddenly realized that, looking <eol> at the top 50 areas in the UK <eob> that have the strongest Leave vote, <eob> I've spent a combined total of four days <eol> of my life in those areas. <eob>
In some of those places, <eob> I didn't even know the names <eol> of the voting districts. <eob>
It was a real shock to me, <eob> and it suggested that people like me <eob> who think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant, <eob> perhaps don't know our own countries and societies <eob> nearly as well as we like to believe. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And the challenge that comes <eol> from that is we need to find a new way <eob> to narrate globalization <eol> to those people, <eob> to recognize that for those people <eol> who have not necessarily been to university, <eob> who haven't necessarily <eol> grown up with the Internet, <eob> that don't get opportunities to travel, <eob> they may be unpersuaded by the narrative <eol> that we find persuasive <eob> in our often liberal bubbles. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It means that we need to reach out <eol> more broadly and understand. <eob>
In the Leave vote, a minority <eol> have peddled the politics of fear and hatred, <eob> creating lies and mistrust <eob> around, for instance, the idea <eol> that the vote on Europe <eob> could reduce the number of refugees <eol> and asylum-seekers coming to Europe, <eob> when the vote on leaving <eol> had nothing to do with immigration <eob> from outside the European Union. <eob>
But for a significant majority <eol> of the Leave voters <eob> the concern was disillusionment <eol> with the political establishment. <eob>
This was a protest vote for many, <eob> a sense that nobody represented them, <eob> that they couldn't find a political party <eol> that spoke for them, <eob> and so they rejected <eol> that political establishment. <eob>
This replicates around Europe and much <eol> of the liberal democratic world. <eob>
We see it with the rise in popularity <eol> of Donald Trump in the United States, <eob> with the growing nationalism <eol> of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, <eob> with the increase in popularity <eol> of Marine Le Pen in France. <eob>
The specter of Brexit <eol> is in all of our societies. <eob>
So the question I think we need <eol> to ask is my second question, <eob> which is how should we collectively respond? <eob>
For all of us who care <eol> about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies, <eob> we urgently need a new vision, <eob> a vision of a more tolerant, <eol> inclusive globalization, <eob> one that brings people with us <eol> rather than leaving them behind. <eob>
That vision of globalization <eob> is one that has to start by a recognition <eol> of the positive benefits of globalization. <eob>
The consensus amongst economists <eob> is that free trade, <eol> the movement of capital, <eob> the movement of people across borders <eob> benefit everyone on aggregate. <eob>
The consensus amongst international relations scholars <eob> is that globalization brings <eol> interdependence, <eob> which brings cooperation and peace. <eob>
But globalization also <eol> has redistributive effects. <eob>
It creates winners and losers. <eob>
To take the example of migration, <eob> we know that immigration is a net <eol> positive for the economy as a whole <eob> under almost all circumstances. <eob>
But we also have to be very aware <eob> that there are redistributive consequences, <eob> that importantly, low-skilled immigration <eob> can lead to a reduction in wages <eol> for the most impoverished in our societies <eob> and also put pressure on house prices. <eob>
That doesn't detract from the fact <eol> that it's positive, <eob> but it means more people have <eol> to share in those benefits <eob> and recognize them. <eob>
In 2002, the former Secretary-General <eol> of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, <eob> gave a speech at Yale University, <eob> and that speech was on the topic <eol> of inclusive globalization. <eob>
That was the speech <eol> in which he coined that term. <eob>
And he said, and I paraphrase, <eob> "The glass house of globalization <eol> has to be open to all <eob> if it is to remain secure. <eob>
Bigotry and ignorance <eob> are the ugly face of exclusionary <eol> and antagonistic globalization." <eob>
That idea of inclusive globalization <eol> was briefly revived in 2008 <eob> in a conference on progressive governance <eob> involving many of the leaders <eol> of European countries. <eob>
But amid austerity and the financial <eol> crisis of 2008, <eob> the concept disappeared almost <eol> without a trace. <eob>
Globalization has been taken <eol> to support a neoliberal agenda. <eob>
It's perceived <eol> to be part of an elite agenda <eob> rather than something that benefits all. <eob>
And it needs to be reclaimed <eol> on a far more inclusive basis <eob> than it is today. <eob>
So the question is, <eol> how can we achieve that goal? <eob>
How can we balance on the one hand <eol> addressing fear and alienation <eob> while on the other hand refusing vehemently <eob> to give in to xenophobia and nationalism? <eob>
That is the question for all of us. <eob>
And I think, as a social scientist, <eob> that social science <eol> offers some places to start. <eob>
Our transformation has to be about both ideas <eol> and about material change, <eob> and I want to give you four ideas <eol> as a starting point. <eob>
The first relates to the idea <eol> of civic education. <eob>
What stands out from Brexit <eob> is the gap between public perception <eol> and empirical reality. <eob>
It's been suggested that we've moved <eol> to a postfactual society, <eob> where evidence and truth no longer matter, <eob> and lies have equal status <eol> to the clarity of evidence. <eob> So how can we -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How can we rebuild respect for truth <eol> and evidence into our liberal democracies? <eob>
It has to begin with education, <eob> but it has to start with the recognition <eol> that there are huge gaps. <eob>
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI <eob> published a survey <eol> on attitudes to immigration, <eob> and it showed that as numbers <eol> of immigrants increase, <eob> so public concern <eol> with immigration also increases, <eob> although it obviously <eol> didn't unpack causality, <eob> because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers <eob> but the political and media narrative around it. <eob>
But the same survey also revealed <eob> huge public misinformation <eob> and misunderstanding <eol> about the nature of immigration. <eob>
For example, in these attitudes <eol> in the United Kingdom, <eob> the public believed <eol> that levels of asylum <eob> were a greater proportion <eol> of immigration than they were, <eob> but they also believed the levels <eol> of educational migration <eob> were far lower as a proportion <eol> of overall migration <eob> than they actually are. <eob>
So we have to address <eol> this misinformation, <eob> the gap between perception <eol> and reality on key aspects of globalization. <eob>
And that can't just be something <eol> that's left to our schools, <eob> although that's important to begin <eol> at an early age. <eob>
It has to be about lifelong civic participation <eob> and public engagement <eol> that we all encourage as societies. <eob>
The second thing that I think <eol> is an opportunity <eob> is the idea to encourage more interaction <eol> across diverse communities. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
One of the things that stands out <eol> for me very strikingly, <eob> looking at immigration attitudes <eol> in the United Kingdom, <eob> is that ironically, the regions of my country <eob> that are the most tolerant of immigrants <eob> have the highest numbers of immigrants. <eob>
So for instance, London and the Southeast <eob> have the highest numbers of immigrants, <eob> and they are also by far the most tolerant areas. <eob>
It's those areas of the country <eol> that have the lowest levels of immigration <eob> that actually are the most exclusionary <eol> and intolerant towards migrants. <eob>
So we need to encourage exchange programs. <eob>
We need to ensure that older generations <eol> who maybe can't travel <eob> get access to the Internet. <eob>
We need to encourage, even on a local <eol> and national level, <eob> more movement, more participation, <eob> more interaction with people <eol> who we don't know <eob> and whose views <eol> we might not necessarily agree with. <eob>
The third thing that I think <eol> is crucial, though, <eob> and this is really fundamental, <eob> is we have to ensure <eol> that everybody shares <eob> in the benefits of globalization. <eob>
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking. <eob>
It shows tragically that those people <eol> who voted to leave the European Union <eob> were those who actually benefited <eol> the most materially <eob> from trade with the European Union. <eob>
But the problem is that those <eol> people in those areas <eob> didn't perceive themselves <eol> to be beneficiaries. <eob>
They didn't believe <eol> that they were actually getting access <eob> to material benefits of increased trade <eol> and increased mobility around the world. <eob>
I work on questions predominantly <eol> to do with refugees, <eob> and one of the ideas I spent <eol> a lot of my time preaching, <eob> mainly to developing countries around the world, <eob> is that in order to encourage <eol> the integration of refugees, <eob> we can't just benefit the refugee populations, <eob> we also have to address <eol> the concerns of the host communities in local areas. <eob>
But in looking at that, <eob> one of the policy prescriptions <eol> is that we have to provide <eob> disproportionately better education facilities, <eol> health facilities, <eob> access to social services <eob> in those regions of high immigration <eob> to address the concerns <eol> of those local populations. <eob>
But while we encourage <eol> that around the developing world, <eob> we don't take those lessons home <eob> and incorporate them <eol> in our own societies. <eob>
Furthermore, if we're going <eol> to really take seriously <eob> the need to ensure people share <eol> in the economic benefits, <eob> our businesses and corporations <eol> need a model of globalization <eob> that recognizes that they, too, <eol> have to take people with them. <eob>
The fourth and final idea I want <eol> to put forward <eob> is an idea that we need <eol> more responsible politics. <eob>
There's very little social science evidence <eob> that compares attitudes <eol> on globalization. <eob>
But from the surveys that do exist, <eob> what we can see is there's huge variation <eol> across different countries <eob> and time periods in those countries <eob> for attitudes and tolerance <eob> of questions like migration <eol> and mobility on the one hand <eob> and free trade on the other. <eob>
But one hypothesis that I think emerges <eol> from a cursory look at that data <eob> is the idea that polarized societies <eol> are far less tolerant of globalization. <eob>
It's the societies like Sweden <eol> in the past, <eob> like Canada today, <eob> where there is a centrist politics, <eob> where right and left work together, <eob> that we encourage supportive attitudes <eol> towards globalization. <eob>
And what we see around the world today <eol> is a tragic polarization, <eob> a failure to have dialogue <eol> between the extremes in politics, <eob> and a gap in terms <eol> of that liberal center ground <eob> that can encourage communication <eol> and a shared understanding. <eob>
We might not achieve that today, <eob> but at the very least we have to call <eol> upon our politicians and our media <eob> to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant <eol> of one another. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
These ideas are very tentative, <eob> and that's in part because this needs <eol> to be an inclusive and shared project. <eob>
I am still British. <eob> I am still European. <eob>
I am still a global citizen. <eob>
For those of us who believe <eob> that our identities are not <eol> mutually exclusive, <eob> we have to all work together <eob> to ensure that globalization <eol> takes everyone with us <eob> and doesn't leave people behind. <eob>
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy <eol> and globalization. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Two hundred years of modern science. <eob>
We have to admit <eob> that our performance is not great. <eob>
The machines we build continue <eol> to suffer from mechanical failures. <eob>
The houses we build <eol> do not survive severe earthquakes. <eob>
But we shouldn't be so critical <eol> of our scientists for a simple reason: <eob> they didn't have much time. <eob>
Two hundred years is not a lot of time, <eob> while nature had three billion years <eob> to perfect some of the most amazing materials, <eob> that we wish we had in our possession. <eob>
Remember, these materials <eol> carry a quality assurance <eob> of three billion years. <eob>
Take, for example, sequoia trees. <eob>
They carry hundreds of tons <eol> for hundreds of years <eob> in cold weather, in warm <eol> climates, <eob> UV light. <eob>
Yet, if you look at the structure <eol> by high-resolution electron microscopy, <eob> and you ask yourself, <eol> what is it made of, <eob> surprisingly, it's made of sugar. <eob>
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea. <eob>
It's actually a nanofiber called <eol> nanocrystalline cellulose. <eob>
And this nanocrystalline cellulose <eol> is so strong, on a weight basis, <eob> it's about 10 times stronger than steel. <eob>
Yet it's made of sugar. <eob>
So scientists all over the world <eol> believe that nanocellulose <eob> is going to be one of the most important <eol> materials for the entire industry. <eob>
But here's the problem: <eob> say you want to buy a half a ton <eol> of nanocellulose <eob> to build a boat or an airplane. <eob>
Well, you can Google, you can eBay, <eol> you can even Alibaba. <eob>
You won't find it. <eob> Of course, you're going to find <eol> thousands of scientific papers -- <eob> great papers, where scientists are going to say <eol> this is a great material, <eob> there are lots of things <eol> we can do with it. <eob> But no commercial source. <eob>
So we at the Hebrew University, <eol> together with our partners in Sweden, <eob> decided to focus on the development <eol> of an industrial-scale process <eob> to produce this nanocellulose. <eob>
And, of course, we <eol> didn't want to cut trees. <eob>
So we were looking for another source <eob> of raw material, <eob> and we found one -- in fact, the sludge of the paper industry. <eob>
The reason: there is a lot of it. <eob>
Europe alone produces 11 million tons <eob> of that material annually. <eob>
It's the equivalent <eol> of a mountain three kilometers high, <eob> sitting on a soccer field. <eob>
And we produce this mountain every year. <eob>
So for everybody, <eol> it's an environmental problem, <eob> and for us, it's a gold mine. <eob>
So now, we are actually producing, <eol> on an industrial scale in Israel, <eob> nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden. <eob>
We can do a lot of things <eol> with the material. <eob>
For example, <eob> we have shown that by adding <eol> only a small percent of nanocellulose <eob> into cotton fibers, the same as my shirt is made of, <eob> it increases its strength dramatically. <eob>
So this can be used for making amazing things, <eob> like super-fabrics <eol> for industrial and medical applications. <eob>
But this is not the only thing. <eob>
For example, <eob> self-standing, self-supporting structures, <eob> like the shelters that you can see now, <eob> actually are now showcasing in the Venice Biennale for Architecture. <eob>
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders <eob> in the plant kingdom. <eob> Think about insects. <eob> Cat fleas, for example, <eob> have the ability to jump about <eol> a hundred times their height. <eob> That's amazing. <eob> It's the equivalent of a person <eob> standing in the middle <eol> of Liberty Island in New York, <eob> and in a single jump, <eob> going to the top of the Statue of Liberty. <eob>
I'm sure everybody would like to do that. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> How do cat fleas do it? <eob>
It turns out, <eol> they make this wonderful material, <eob> which is called resilin. <eob>
In simple words, resilin, <eol> which is a protein, <eob> is the most elastic rubber on Earth. <eob>
You can stretch it, <eob> you can squish it, <eob> and it doesn't lose almost <eol> any energy to the environment. <eob>
When you release it -- snap! <eob>
It brings back all the energy. <eob>
So I'm sure everybody would like <eol> to have that material. <eob>
But here's the problem: <eob> to catch cat fleas is difficult. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Why? Because they are jumpy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But now, it's actually enough <eol> to catch one. <eob>
Now we can extract its DNA <eob> and read how cat fleas <eol> make the resilin, <eob> and clone it into a less-jumpy organism <eol> like a plant. <eob>
So that's exactly what we did. <eob>
Now we have the ability <eol> to produce lots of resilin. <eob>
Well, my team decided to do <eol> something really cool at the university. <eob>
They decided to combine <eob> the strongest material produced <eol> by the plant kingdom <eob> with the most elastic material produced <eol> by the insect kingdom -- <eob> nanocellulose with resilin. <eob>
And the result is amazing. <eob>
This material, in fact, is tough, <eol> elastic and transparent. <eob> So there are lots of things <eol> that can be done with this material. <eob> For example, <eob> next-generation sport shoes, <eob> so we can jump higher, run faster. <eob> And even touch screens for computers <eol> and smartphones, <eob> that won't break. <eob>
Well, the problem is, we continue <eol> to implant <eob> synthetic implants in our body, <eob> which we glue and screw into our body. <eob>
And I'm going to say <eol> that this is not a good idea. <eob> Why? Because they fail. <eob> This synthetic material fails, <eob> just like this plastic fork, <eob> that is not strong enough <eol> for its performance. <eob>
But sometimes they are too strong, <eob> and therefore their mechanical properties <eol> do not really fit <eob> their surrounding tissues. <eob>
But in fact, the reason <eol> is much more fundamental. <eob>
The reason is that in nature, <eob> there is no one there <eob> that actually takes my head <eol> and screws it onto my neck, <eob> or takes my skin and glues <eol> it onto my body. <eob>
In nature, everything is self-assembled. <eob>
So every living cell, <eob> whether coming from a plant, insect or human being, <eob> has a DNA that encodes <eol> for nanobio building blocks. <eob>
Many times they are proteins. <eob>
Other times, they are enzymes <eol> that make other materials, <eob> like polysaccharides, fatty acids. <eob>
And the common feature <eol> about all these materials <eob> is that they need no one. <eob>
They recognize each other and self-assemble <eob> into structures -- scaffolds <eol> on which cells are proliferating <eob> to give tissues. <eob>
They develop into organs, <eol> and together bring life. <eob>
So we at the Hebrew University, <eol> about 10 years ago, decided to focus <eob> on probably the most important <eol> biomaterial for humans, <eob> which is collagen. <eob> Why collagen? <eob> Because collagen accounts <eol> for about 25 percent of our dry weight. <eob>
We have nothing more than collagen, <eol> other than water, in our body. <eob>
So I always like to say, <eob> anyone who is in the replacement <eol> parts of human beings <eob> would like to have collagen. <eob>
Admittedly, before we started our project, <eob> there were already more than 1,000 <eol> medical implants <eob> made of collagen. <eob>
You know, simple things like dermal fillers <eol> to reduce wrinkles, <eob> augment lips, <eob> and other, more sophisticated <eol> medical implants, like heart valves. <eob>
So where is the problem? <eob>
Well, the problem is the source. <eob>
The source of all that collagen <eob> is actually coming from dead bodies: <eob> dead pigs, dead cows <eob> and even human cadavers. <eob>
So safety is a big issue. <eob> But it's not the only one. <eob>
Also, the quality. <eob>
Now here, I have a personal interest. <eob>
This is my father, Zvi, in our winery in Israel. <eob>
A heart valve, very similar <eol> to the one that I showed you before, <eob> seven years ago, was implanted in his body. <eob>
Now, the scientific literature says <eol> that these heart valves start to fail <eob> 10 years after the operation. <eob>
No wonder: <eob> they are made from old, used tissues, <eob> just like this wall made <eol> of bricks that is falling apart. <eob>
Yeah, of course, I can take <eol> those bricks and build a new wall. <eob> But it's not going to be the same. <eob>
So the US Food <eol> and Drug Administration <eob> made a notice already in 2007, <eob> asking the companies to start <eol> to look for better alternatives. <eob>
So that's exactly what we did. <eob>
We decided to clone <eol> all the five human genes responsible <eob> for making type I collagen in humans <eob> into a transgenic tobacco plant. <eob>
So now, the plant has the ability <eol> to make human collagen brand new, <eob> untouched. <eob> This is amazing. <eob> Actually, it's happening now. <eob>
Today in Israel, we grow it in 25,000 square <eol> meters of greenhouses <eob> all over the country. <eob>
The farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco. <eob> It looks exactly like regular <eol> tobacco, <eob> except that they have five human genes. <eob> They're responsible for making type <eol> I collagen. <eob>
We grow them for about 50 <eol> to 70 days, <eob> we harvest the leaves, <eob> and then the leaves are transported <eol> by cooling trucks to the factory. <eob>
There, the process of extracting <eol> the collagen starts. <eob>
Now, if you ever made a pesto -- <eol> essentially, the same thing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You crush the leaves, you get the juice <eol> that contains the collagen. <eob>
We concentrate the protein, <eob> transfer the protein to clean rooms <eol> for the final purification, <eob> and the end result is a collagen identical to what we have in our body -- <eob> untouched, brand new <eob> and from which we make <eol> different medical implants: <eob> bone void fillers, for example, <eob> for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion. <eob>
And more recently, even, <eob> we've been able to launch into the market <eol> here in Europe <eob> a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers, <eob> that is now approved <eol> for use in the clinic. <eob>
This is not science fiction. <eob>
This is happening now. <eob>
We are using plants <eol> to make medical implants <eob> for replacement parts for human beings. <eob>
That's amazing. <eob> In fact, more recently, we've been able <eol> to make collagen fibers <eob> which are six times stronger <eol> than the Achilles tendon. <eob>
Together with our partners from Ireland, <eob> we thought about the next thing: <eob> adding resilin to those fibers. <eob>
By doing that, <eob> we've been able to make a superfiber <eob> which is about 380 percent tougher, <eob> and 300 percent more elastic. <eob>
So oddly enough, in the future, <eob> when a patient is transplanted <eol> with artificial tendons or ligaments <eob> made from these fibers, <eob> we'll have better performance <eol> after the surgery <eob> than we had before the injury. <eob>
So what's for the future? <eob>
In the future, we believe <eol> we'll be able to make <eob> many nanobio building blocks <eol> that nature provided for us -- <eob> collagen, nanocellulose, resilin and many more. <eob>
And that will enable us to make <eol> better machines perform better, <eob> even the heart. <eob>
Now, this heart is not <eol> going to be the same <eob> as we can get from a donor. <eob>
It will be better. <eob>
It actually will perform better <eob> and will last longer. <eob>
My friend Zion Suliman once told me <eob> a smart sentence. <eob>
He said, "If you want a new idea, <eob> you should open an old book." <eob> And I'm going to say <eol> that the book was written. <eob>
It was written over three billion years <eob> of evolution. <eob> And the text is the DNA of life. <eob>
All we have to do <eob> is read this text, <eob> embrace nature's gift to us <eob> and start our progress from here. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I'm really glad to be here. <eob> I'm glad you're here, <eob> because that would be a little weird. <eob>
I'm glad we're all here. <eob>
And by "here," I don't mean here. <eob> Or here. <eob> But here. <eob> I mean Earth. <eob> And by "we," I don't mean those <eol> of us in this auditorium, <eob> but life, <eob> all life on Earth -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
from complex to single-celled, <eob> from mold to mushrooms <eob> to flying bears. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The interesting thing is, <eob> Earth is the only place we know <eol> of that has life -- <eob> 8.7 million species. <eob>
We've looked other places, <eob> maybe not as hard <eol> as we should or we could, <eob> but we've looked and haven't found any; <eob> Earth is the only place we know of with life. <eob> Is Earth special? <eob> This is a question <eol> I've wanted to know the answer to <eob> since I was a small child, <eob> and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium <eob> has thought the same thing <eol> and also wanted to know the answer. <eob>
To understand whether there are any planets — <eob> out there in our solar system or beyond — <eob> that can support life, <eob> the first step is to understand <eol> what life here requires. <eob>
It turns out, of all of those <eob> 8.7 million species, <eob> life only needs three things. <eob> On one side, all life <eol> on Earth needs energy. <eob>
Complex life like us derives <eol> our energy from the sun, <eob> but life deep underground can get its energy <eob> from things like chemical reactions. <eob>
There are a number of different energy <eol> sources <eob> available on all planets. <eob>
On the other side, <eob> all life needs food or nourishment. <eob>
And this seems like a tall order, especially <eol> if you want a succulent tomato. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
However, all life <eol> on Earth derives its nourishment <eob> from only six chemical elements, <eob> and these elements can be found <eol> on any planetary body <eob> in our solar system. <eob>
So that leaves the thing <eol> in the middle as the tall pole, <eob> the thing that's hardest to achieve. <eob>
Not moose, but water. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Although moose would be pretty cool. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And not frozen water, and not water <eol> in a gaseous state, but liquid water. <eob>
This is what life needs <eol> to survive, all life. <eob>
And many solar system bodies <eol> don't have liquid water, <eob> and so we don't look there. <eob>
Other solar system bodies <eol> might have abundant liquid water, <eob> even more than Earth, <eob> but it's trapped beneath an icy shell, <eob> and so it's hard to access, <eol> it's hard to get to, <eob> it's hard to even find out <eol> if there's any life there. <eob>
So that leaves a few bodies <eol> that we should think about. <eob> So let's make the problem simpler for ourselves. <eob> Let's think only about liquid water <eol> on the surface of a planet. <eob>
There are only three bodies <eol> to think about <eob> in our solar system, <eob> with regard to liquid water <eol> on the surface of a planet, <eob> and in order of distance <eol> from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars. <eob>
You want to have an atmosphere <eol> for water to be liquid. <eob>
You have to be very careful <eol> with that atmosphere. <eob> You can't have too much atmosphere, too thick <eol> or too warm an atmosphere, <eob> because then you end up <eol> too hot like Venus, <eob> and you can't have liquid water. <eob>
But if you have too little atmosphere <eol> and it's too thin and too cold, <eob> you end up like Mars, too cold. <eob>
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, <eob> and Earth is just right. <eob>
You can look at these images behind me <eol> and you can see automatically <eob> where life can survive <eob> in our solar system. <eob>
It's a Goldilocks-type problem, <eob> and it's so simple <eol> that a child could understand it. <eob>
However, <eob> I'd like to remind you <eol> of two things <eob> from the Goldilocks story <eol> that we may not think about so often <eob> but that I think are really relevant here. <eob>
Number one: <eob> if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold <eob> when Goldilocks walks into the room, <eob> does that mean it's always been too cold? <eob>
Or could it have been just right <eol> at some other time? <eob>
When Goldilocks walks <eol> into the room determines the answer <eob> that we get in the story. <eob>
And the same is true with planets. <eob> They're not static things. They change. <eob> They vary. They evolve. <eob> And atmospheres do the same. <eob>
So let me give you an example. <eob>
Here's one of my favorite <eol> pictures of Mars. <eob>
It's not the highest resolution image, <eol> it's not the sexiest image, <eob> it's not the most recent image, <eob> but it's an image that shows riverbeds <eol> cut into the surface of the planet; <eob> riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water; <eob> riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens <eol> of thousands of years to form. <eob>
This can't happen on Mars today. <eob>
The atmosphere of Mars today <eol> is too thin and too cold <eob> for water to be stable <eol> as a liquid. <eob>
This one image tells you <eol> that the atmosphere of Mars changed, <eob> and it changed in big ways. <eob>
And it changed from a state <eol> that we would define as habitable, <eob> because the three requirements <eol> for life were present long ago. <eob>
Where did that atmosphere go <eob> that allowed water to be <eol> liquid at the surface? <eob>
Well, one idea is <eol> it escaped away to space. <eob>
Atmospheric particles <eol> got enough energy to break free <eob> from the gravity of the planet, <eob> escaping away to space, <eol> never to return. <eob>
And this happens with all bodies <eol> with atmospheres. <eob>
Comets have tails <eob> that are incredibly visible <eol> reminders of atmospheric escape. <eob>
But Venus also has an atmosphere <eol> that escapes with time, <eob> and Mars and Earth as well. <eob>
It's just a matter of degree <eol> and a matter of scale. <eob>
So we'd like to figure out <eol> how much escaped over time <eob> so we can explain this transition. <eob>
How do atmospheres get <eol> their energy for escape? <eob>
How do particles get enough <eol> energy to escape? <eob>
There are two ways, if we're going <eol> to reduce things a little bit. <eob>
Number one, <eob> sunlight. <eob>
Light emitted from the sun <eol> can be absorbed by atmospheric particles <eob> and warm the particles. <eob>
Yes, I'm dancing, but they -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh my God, not even at my wedding. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They get enough energy <eol> to escape and break free <eob> from the gravity of the planet <eob> just by warming. <eob>
A second way they can get energy <eol> is from the solar wind. <eob>
These are particles, mass, <eol> material, spit out from the surface of the sun, <eob> and they go screaming <eol> through the solar system <eob> at 400 kilometers per second, <eob> sometimes faster during solar storms, <eob> and they go hurtling through <eol> interplanetary space <eob> towards planets <eol> and their atmospheres, <eob> and they may provide energy <eob> for atmospheric particles to escape as well. <eob>
This is something that I'm interested in, <eob> because it relates to habitability. <eob>
I mentioned that there were two things <eol> about the Goldilocks story <eob> that I wanted to bring to your attention <eol> and remind you about, <eob> and the second one is a little bit more subtle. <eob>
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot, <eob> and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold, <eob> shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder <eob> if we're following the trend? <eob>
This thing that you've accepted <eol> your entire life, <eob> when you think about it a little bit more, <eol> may not be so simple. <eob>
And of course, distance of a planet from the sun <eol> determines its temperature. <eob>
This has to play into habitability. <eob>
But maybe there are other things <eol> we should be thinking about. <eob>
Maybe it's the bowls themselves <eob> that are also helping to determine <eol> the outcome in the story, <eob> what is just right. <eob>
I could talk to you about a lot <eol> of different characteristics <eob> of these three planets <eob> that may influence habitability, <eob> but for selfish reasons related <eol> to my own research <eob> and the fact that I'm standing up here <eol> holding the clicker and you're not -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I would like to talk <eol> for just a minute or two <eob> about magnetic fields. <eob>
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not. <eob>
Magnetic fields are generated <eol> in the deep interior of a planet <eob> by electrically conducting churning fluid material <eob> that creates this big old magnetic field <eol> that surrounds Earth. <eob>
If you have a compass, you know <eol> which way north is. <eob>
Venus and Mars don't have that. <eob>
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars, <eob> congratulations, you're lost. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Does this influence habitability? <eob> Well, how might it? <eob>
Many scientists think that a magnetic field <eol> of a planet <eob> serves as a shield for the atmosphere, <eob> deflecting solar wind particles <eol> around the planet <eob> in a bit of a force field-type effect <eob> having to do with electric charge <eol> of those particles. <eob>
I like to think of it instead <eol> as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And yes, my colleagues who watch <eol> this later will realize <eob> this is the first time in the history <eol> of our community <eob> that the solar wind has been <eol> equated with mucus. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, so the effect, then, <eol> is that Earth may have been protected <eob> for billions of years, <eob> because we've had a magnetic field. <eob>
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape. <eob>
Mars, on the other hand, <eol> has been unprotected <eob> because of its lack of magnetic field, <eob> and over billions of years, <eob> maybe enough atmosphere <eol> has been stripped away <eob> to account for a transition <eol> from a habitable planet <eob> to the planet that we see today. <eob>
Other scientists think that magnetic fields <eob> may act more like the sails <eol> on a ship, <eob> enabling the planet to interact <eol> with more energy from the solar wind <eob> than the planet would have been able <eol> to interact with by itself. <eob>
The sails may gather energy <eol> from the solar wind. <eob>
The magnetic field may gather energy <eol> from the solar wind <eob> that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen. <eob>
It's an idea that has to be tested, <eob> but the effect and how it works <eob> seems apparent. <eob>
That's because we know <eob> energy from the solar wind <eol> is being deposited into our atmosphere <eob> here on Earth. <eob>
That energy is conducted <eol> along magnetic field lines <eob> down into the polar regions, <eob> resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora. <eob>
If you've ever experienced them, <eol> it's magnificent. <eob>
We know the energy is getting in. <eob> We're trying to measure <eol> how many particles are getting out <eob> and if the magnetic field <eol> is influencing this in any way. <eob>
So I've posed a problem for you here, <eob> but I don't have a solution yet. <eob>
We don't have a solution. <eob>
But we're working on it. <eol> How are we working on it? <eob> Well, we've sent spacecraft <eol> to all three planets. <eob>
Some of them are orbiting now, <eob> including the MAVEN spacecraft <eol> which is currently orbiting Mars, <eob> which I'm involved with <eol> and which is led here, <eob> out of the University of Colorado. <eob>
It's designed to measure <eol> atmospheric escape. <eob>
We have similar measurements <eol> from Venus and Earth. <eob>
Once we have all our measurements, <eob> we can combine all these together, <eol> and we can understand <eob> how all three planets interact <eol> with their space environment, <eob> with the surroundings. <eob>
And we can decide whether magnetic fields <eol> are important for habitability <eob> or not. <eob>
Once we have that answer, <eol> why should you care? <eob>
I mean, I care deeply ... <eob> And financially as well, but deeply. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
First of all, an answer to this question <eob> will teach us more about these three planets, <eob> Venus, Earth and Mars, <eob> not only about how they interact <eol> with their environment today, <eob> but how they were billions <eol> of years ago, <eob> whether they were habitable long ago <eob> or not. <eob>
It will teach us about atmospheres <eob> that surround us and that are close. <eob>
But moreover, <eol> what we learn from these planets <eob> can be applied to atmospheres everywhere, <eob> including planets that we're now observing <eol> around other stars. <eob>
For example, the Kepler spacecraft, <eob> which is built and controlled <eol> here in Boulder, <eob> has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky <eob> for a couple years now, <eob> and it's found thousands of planets -- <eob> in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky <eob> that we don't think is any different <eol> from any other part of the sky. <eob>
We've gone, in 20 years, <eob> from knowing of zero planets <eol> outside of our solar system, <eob> to now having so many, <eob> that we don't know which ones <eol> to investigate first. <eob>
Any lever will help. <eob>
In fact, based on observations <eol> that Kepler's taken <eob> and other similar observations, <eob> we now believe that, <eob> of the 200 billion stars <eol> in the Milky Way galaxy alone, <eob> on average, every star <eol> has at least one planet. <eob>
In addition to that, <eob> estimates suggest there are somewhere <eol> between 40 billion and 100 billion <eob> of those planets that we would define as habitable <eob> in just our galaxy. <eob>
We have the observations of those planets, <eob> but we just don't know which ones <eol> are habitable yet. <eob>
It's a little bit like being trapped <eol> on a red spot -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
on a stage <eob> and knowing that there are other worlds out there <eob> and desperately wanting <eol> to know more about them, <eob> wanting to interrogate them and find out <eol> if maybe just one or two of them <eob> are a little bit like you. <eob>
You can't do that. You can't go there, <eol> not yet. <eob>
And so you have to use the tools <eol> that you've developed around you <eob> for <eob> Venus, Earth and Mars, <eob> and you have to apply them <eol> to these other situations, <eob> and hope that you're making <eol> reasonable inferences from the data, <eob> and that you're going <eol> to be able to determine the best candidates <eob> for habitable planets, and those that are not. <eob>
In the end, and for now, at least, <eob> this is our red spot, right here. <eob>
This is the only planet <eol> that we know of that's habitable, <eob> although very soon we may come <eol> to know of more. <eob>
But for now, this <eol> is the only habitable planet, <eob> and this is our red spot. <eob>
I'm really glad we're here. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is a man-made forest. <eob>
It can spread over acres <eol> and acres of area, <eob> or it could fit in a small space -- <eob> as small as your house garden. <eob>
Age of this forest is just two years old. <eob>
I have a forest in the backyard <eol> of my own house. <eob>
It attracts a lot of biodiversity. <eob>
(Bird call) <eob> I wake up to this every morning, <eob> like a Disney princess. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I am an entrepreneur <eob> who facilitates the making <eol> of these forests professionally. <eob>
We have helped factories, <eob> farms, <eob> schools, <eob> homes, <eob> resorts, <eob> apartment buildings, <eob> public parks <eob> and even a zoo <eob> to have one of such forests. <eob>
A forest is not an isolated piece of land <eol> where animals live together. <eob>
A forest can be an integral part <eol> of our urban existence. <eob>
A forest, for me, <eob> is a place so dense with trees <eol> that you just can't walk into it. <eob>
It doesn't matter <eol> how big or small they are. <eob>
Most of the world <eol> we live in today was forest. <eob>
This was before human intervention. <eob>
Then we built up our cities <eol> on those forests, <eob> like São Paulo, <eob> forgetting that we belong <eol> to nature as well, <eob> as much as 8.4 million <eol> other species on the planet. <eob>
Our habitat stopped being <eol> our natural habitat. <eob>
But not anymore for some of us. <eob>
A few others and I today make <eol> these forests professionally -- <eob> anywhere and everywhere. <eob>
I'm an industrial engineer. <eob>
I specialize in making cars. <eob>
In my previous job at Toyota, <eob> I learned how to convert <eol> natural resources into products. <eob>
To give you an example, <eob> we would drip the sap <eol> out of a rubber tree, <eob> convert it into raw rubber <eob> and make a tire out of it -- the product. <eob>
But these products can never <eol> become a natural resource again. <eob>
We separate the elements from nature <eob> and convert them <eol> into an irreversible state. <eob>
That's industrial production. <eob>
Nature, on the other hand, <eol> works in a totally opposite way. <eob>
The natural system produces <eol> by bringing elements together, <eob> atom by atom. <eob>
All the natural products <eol> become a natural resource again. <eob>
This is something which I learned <eob> when I made a forest <eol> in the backyard of my own house. <eob>
And this was the first time <eol> I worked with nature, <eob> rather than against it. <eob>
Since then, <eob> we have made 75 such forests <eol> in 25 cities across the world. <eob>
Every time we work at a new place, <eob> we find that every single element <eol> needed to make a forest <eob> is available right around us. <eob>
All we have to do is to bring <eol> these elements together <eob> and let nature take over. <eob>
To make a forest we start with soil. <eob>
We touch, feel and even taste it <eob> to identify what properties it lacks. <eob>
If the soil is made up of small particles <eol> it becomes compact -- <eob> so compact, that water cannot seep in. <eob>
We mix some local biomass <eol> available around, <eob> which can help soil become more porous. <eob>
Water can now seep in. <eob>
If the soil doesn't have <eol> the capacity to hold water, <eob> we will mix some more biomass -- <eob> some water-absorbent material <eol> like peat or bagasse, <eob> so soil can hold this water <eol> and it stays moist. <eob>
To grow, plants need water, <eol> sunlight and nutrition. <eob>
What if the soil doesn't have <eol> any nutrition in it? <eob>
We don't just add nutrition <eol> directly to the soil. <eob>
That would be the industrial way. <eob>
It goes against nature. <eob>
We instead add microorganisms to the soil. <eob>
They produce the nutrients <eol> in the soil naturally. <eob>
They feed on the biomass <eol> we have mixed in the soil, <eob> so all they have to do <eol> is eat and multiply. <eob>
And as their number grows, <eob> the soil starts breathing again. <eob> It becomes alive. <eob> We survey the native <eol> tree species of the place. <eob>
How do we decide what's native or not? <eob>
Well, whatever existed <eol> before human intervention is native. <eob>
That's the simple rule. <eob>
We survey a national park <eob> to find the last remains <eol> of a natural forest. <eob>
We survey the sacred groves, <eob> or sacred forests around old temples. <eob>
And if we don't find anything at all, <eob> we go to museums <eob> to see the seeds or wood of trees <eol> existing there a long time ago. <eob>
We research old paintings, <eol> poems and literature from the place, <eob> to identify the tree species <eol> belonging there. <eob>
Once we know our trees, <eob> we divide them in four different layers: <eob> shrub layer, sub-tree layer, <eol> tree layer and canopy layer. <eob>
We fix the ratios of each layer, <eob> and then we decide the percentage <eol> of each tree species in the mix. <eob>
If we are making a fruit forest, <eob> we increase the percentage <eol> of fruit-bearing trees. <eob>
It could be a flowering forest, <eob> a forest that attracts <eol> a lot of birds or bees, <eob> or it could simply be a native, <eol> wild evergreen forest. <eob>
We collect the seeds <eol> and germinate saplings out of them. <eob>
We make sure that trees <eol> belonging to the same layer <eob> are not planted next to each other, <eob> or they will fight for the same <eol> vertical space when they grow tall. <eob>
We plant the saplings close to each other. <eob>
On the surface, we spread <eol> a thick layer of mulch, <eob> so when it's hot outside <eol> the soil stays moist. <eob>
When it's cold, <eob> frost formation happens only on the mulch, <eob> so soil can still breathe <eol> while it's freezing outside. <eob>
The soil is very soft -- <eob> so soft, that roots <eol> can penetrate into it easily, <eob> rapidly. <eob>
Initially, the forest doesn't <eol> seem like it's growing, <eob> but it's growing under the surface. <eob>
In the first three months, <eob> roots reach a depth of one meter. <eob>
These roots form a mesh, <eob> tightly holding the soil. <eob>
Microbes and fungi live <eol> throughout this network of roots. <eob>
So if some nutrition is not available <eol> in the vicinity of a tree, <eob> these microbes are going to get <eol> the nutrition to the tree. <eob>
Whenever it rains, <eob> magically, <eob> mushrooms appear overnight. <eob>
And this means the soil below <eol> has a healthy fungal network. <eob>
Once these roots are established, <eob> forest starts growing on the surface. <eob>
As the forest grows <eol> we keep watering it — <eob> for the next two to three years, <eol> we water the forest. <eob>
We want to keep all the water <eol> and soil nutrition only for our trees, <eob> so we remove the weeds <eol> growing on the ground. <eob>
As this forest grows, <eol> it blocks the sunlight. <eob>
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense <eob> that sunlight can't reach <eol> the ground anymore. <eob>
Weeds cannot grow now, <eol> because they need sunlight as well. <eob>
At this stage, <eob> every single drop of water <eol> that falls into the forest <eob> doesn't evaporate back <eol> into the atmosphere. <eob>
This dense forest condenses the moist air <eob> and retains its moisture. <eob>
We gradually reduce and eventually <eol> stop watering the forest. <eob>
And even without watering, <eob> the forest floor stays moist <eol> and sometimes even dark. <eob>
Now, when a single leaf <eol> falls on this forest floor, <eob> it immediately starts decaying. <eob>
This decayed biomass forms humus, <eob> which is food for the forest. <eob>
As the forest grows, <eob> more leaves fall on the surface -- <eob> it means more humus is produced, <eob> it means more food so the forest <eol> can grow still bigger. <eob>
And this forest keeps <eol> growing exponentially. <eob>
Once established, <eob> these forests are going to regenerate <eol> themselves again and again -- <eob> probably forever. <eob>
In a natural forest like this, <eob> no management is the best management. <eob>
It's a tiny jungle party. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This forest grows as a collective. <eob> If the same trees -- <eob> same species -- <eob> would have been planted independently, <eob> it wouldn't grow so fast. <eob>
And this is how we create <eol> a 100-year-old forest <eob> in just 10 years. <eob> Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"Mom, who are these people?" <eob> It was an innocent question <eol> from my young daughter Alia <eob> around the time when she was three. <eob>
We were walking along with my husband <eob> in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls. <eob>
Alia was peering at a huge poster <eol> standing tall in the middle of the mall. <eob>
It featured the three rulers <eol> of the United Arab Emirates. <eob>
As she tucked in my side, <eob> I bent down and explained <eol> that these were the rulers of the UAE <eob> who had worked hard to develop their nation <eob> and preserve its unity. <eob>
She asked, "Mom, why is it <eol> that here where we live, <eob> and back in Lebanon, <eol> where grandma and grandpa live, <eob> we never see the pictures <eol> of powerful women on the walls? <eob>
Is it because women are not important?" <eob>
This is probably the hardest question <eol> I've had to answer in my years as a parent <eob> and in my 16-plus years <eol> of professional life, for that matter. <eob>
I had grown up in my hometown <eol> in Lebanon, <eob> the younger of two daughters <eol> to a very hard-working pilot <eob> and director of operations <eol> for the Lebanese Airlines <eob> and a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma. <eob>
My father had encouraged my sister <eol> and I to pursue our education <eob> even though our culture emphasized at the time <eob> that it was sons and not daughters <eol> who should be professionally motivated. <eob>
I was one of very few girls <eol> of my generation <eob> who left home at 18 <eol> to study abroad. <eob>
My father didn't have a son, <eob> and so I, in a sense, became his. <eob>
Fast-forward a couple of decades, <eol> and I hope I didn't do too badly <eob> in making my father proud of his would-be son. <eob>
As I got my Bachelor's <eol> and PhD in electrical engineering, <eob> did R & amp; D in the UK, then consulting <eol> in the Middle East, <eob> I have always been in male-dominated environments. <eob>
Truth be told, I have never found a role <eol> model I could truly identify with. <eob>
My mother's generation <eol> wasn't into professional leadership. <eob>
There were some encouraging men <eol> along the way, <eob> but none knew the demands <eol> and pressures I was facing, <eob> pressures that got particularly acute <eol> when I had my own two beautiful children. <eob>
And although Western women love to give us poor, <eol> oppressed Arab women advice, <eob> they live different lives with different constraints. <eob>
So Arab women of my generation have had <eol> to become our own role models. <eob>
We have had to juggle <eol> more than Arab men, <eob> and we have had to face more cultural <eol> rigidity than Western women. <eob>
As a result, I would like to think <eol> that we poor, oppressed women <eob> actually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share, <eob> lessons that might turn out useful <eob> for anyone wishing to thrive <eol> in the modern world. <eob>
Here are three of mine. <eob>
["Convert their sh * t into your fuel."] <eob>
There is this word that everybody <eol> is touting as the key to success: <eob> resilience. <eob>
Well, what exactly is resilience, <eol> and how do you develop it? <eob>
I believe resilience is simply <eol> the ability to transform shit into fuel. <eob>
In my previous job, well before my current firm, <eob> I was working with a man <eol> we will call John. <eob>
I had teamed up with John <eol> and was working hard, <eob> hoping he would notice how great I was <eob> and that he would come to support my case <eol> to make partner at the firm. <eob>
I was, in addition to delivering <eol> on my consulting projects, <eob> writing passionately on the topic <eol> of women economic empowerment. <eob>
One day, I got to present my research <eol> to a roomful of MBA students. <eob>
John was part of the audience <eob> listening for the first time <eol> to the details of my study. <eob>
As I proceeded with my presentation, <eob> I could see John in the corner of my eye. <eob>
He had turned a dark shade of pink <eob> and had slid under his chair <eol> in apparent shame. <eob>
I finished my presentation <eol> to an applauding audience <eob> and we rushed out <eol> and jumped into the car. <eob>
There he exploded. <eob> "What you did up there was unacceptable! <eob>
You are a consultant, not an activist!" <eob> I said, "John, I don't understand. <eob>
I presented a couple of gender <eol> parity indices, <eob> and some conclusions <eol> about the Arab world. <eob>
Yes, we do happen to be today <eol> at the bottom of the index, <eob> but what is it that I said <eol> or presented that was not factual?" <eob>
To which he replied, "The whole premise <eol> of your study is wrong. <eob>
What you are doing is dangerous <eol> and will break the social fabric of our society." <eob> He paused, then added, <eob> "When women have children, <eol> their place is in the home." <eob>
Time stood still for a long while, <eob> and all I could think and repeat <eol> in the chaos of my brain was: <eob> "You can forget about <eol> that partnership, Leila. <eob>
It's just never going to happen." <eob> It took me a couple of days <eol> to fully absorb this incident and its implications, <eob> but once I did, I reached <eol> three conclusions. <eob>
One, that these were his issues, <eob> his complexes. <eob>
There may be many like him in our society, <eob> but I would never let their issues <eol> become mine. <eob>
Two, that I needed <eol> another sponsor, and fast. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I got one, by the way, <eol> and boy, was he great. <eob>
And three, that I would get to show John <eol> what women with children can do. <eob>
I apply this lesson equally well <eol> to my personal life. <eob>
As I have progressed in my career, <eob> I have received many words <eol> of encouragement, <eob> but I have also often been met by women, <eol> men and couples <eob> who have clearly had an issue with my husband <eol> and I <eob> having chosen the path <eol> of a dual-career couple. <eob>
So you get this well-meaning couple <eob> who tells you straight out <eol> at a family gathering <eob> or at a friends gathering, <eob> that, come on, you must know <eol> you're not a great mom, <eob> given how much you're investing <eol> in your career, right? <eob>
I would lie if I said these words didn't hurt. <eob>
My children are the most precious thing to me, <eob> and the thought that I could be failing them <eol> in any way is intolerable. <eob>
But just like I did with John, <eob> I quickly reminded myself <eol> that these were their issues, <eob> their complexes. <eob>
So instead of replying, <eob> I gave back one of my largest smiles <eob> as I saw, in flashing light, <eob> the following sign in my mind's eye. <eob>
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.] <eob>
You see, as a young woman in these situations, <eol> you have two options. <eob> You can either decide to internalize <eol> these negative messages <eob> that are being thrown at you, <eob> to let them make you feel like a failure, <eob> like success is way too hard <eol> to ever achieve, <eob> or you can choose to see <eol> that others' negativity is their own issue, <eob> and instead transform it into your own personal fuel. <eob>
I have learned to always go for option two, <eob> and I have found that it has taken me <eol> from strength to strength. <eob>
And it's true what they say: <eob> success is the best revenge. <eob>
Some women in the Middle East <eob> are lucky enough to be married <eol> to someone supportive of their career. <eob>
Correction: I should say <eol> "smart enough," <eob> because who you marry is your own choice, <eob> and you'd better marry someone supportive <eol> if you plan to have a long career. <eob>
Still today, the Arab man is not <eol> an equal contributor in the home. <eob>
It's simply not expected by our society, <eob> and even frowned upon as not very manly. <eob>
As for the Arab woman, our society still assumes <eob> that her primary source of happiness <eol> should be the happiness and prosperity <eob> of her children and husband. <eob>
She mostly exists for her family. <eob>
Things are changing, <eol> but it will take time. <eob>
For now, it means <eol> that the professional Arab woman <eob> has to somehow maintain <eol> the perfect home, <eob> make sure that her children's every need <eol> is being taken care of <eob> and manage her demanding career. <eob>
To achieve this, <eol> I have found the hard way <eob> that you need to apply <eol> your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life. <eob>
You need to work your life. <eob>
Here is how I do this in my personal life. <eob>
One thing to know about the Middle East <eob> is that nearly every family has access <eol> to affordable domestic help. <eob>
The challenge therefore <eol> becomes how to recruit effectively. <eob>
Just like I would in my business life, <eol> I have based the selection <eob> of who would support me with my children <eol> while I'm at work <eob> on a strong referral. <eob>
Cristina had worked <eol> for four years with my sister <eob> and the quality of her work <eol> was well-established. <eob>
She is now an integral member of our family, <eob> having been with us since Alia <eol> was six months old. <eob>
She makes sure that the house <eol> is running smoothly while I'm at work, <eob> and I make sure to empower her <eob> in the most optimal conditions <eol> for her and my children, <eob> just like I would my best talent at work. <eob>
This lesson applies whatever <eol> your childcare situation, <eob> whether an au pair, nursery, <eob> part-time nanny that you share <eol> with someone else. <eob>
Choose very carefully, and empower. <eob>
If you look at my calendar, <eob> you will see every working day <eob> one and a half hours from 7pm to 8: <eol> 30pm UAE time <eob> blocked and called "family time." <eob> This is sacred time. <eob>
I have done this ever since <eol> Alia was a baby. <eob>
I do everything in my power <eol> to protect this time <eob> so that I can be home by then <eol> to spend quality time with my children, <eob> asking them about their day, <eob> checking up on homework, <eol> reading them a bedtime story <eob> and giving them lots of kisses <eol> and cuddles. <eob>
If I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone, <eob> I use Skype to connect with my children <eol> even if I am miles away. <eob>
Our son Burhan is five years old, <eob> and he's learning to read <eol> and do basic maths. <eob>
Here's another confession: <eob> I have found that our daughter <eol> is actually more successful <eob> at teaching him these skills than I am. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It started as a game, but Alia loves <eol> playing teacher to her little brother, <eob> and I have found that these sessions <eol> actually improve Burhan's literacy, <eob> increase Alia's sense of responsibility, <eob> and strengthen the bonding <eol> between them, <eob> a win-win all around. <eob>
The successful Arab women I know <eob> have each found their unique <eol> approach to working their life <eob> as they continue to shoulder <eob> the lion's share <eol> of responsibility in the home. <eob>
But this is not just about surviving <eol> in your dual role <eob> as a career woman and mother. <eob>
This is also about being in the present. <eob>
When I am with my children, <eob> I try to leave work out of our lives. <eob>
Instead of worrying about how many minutes <eol> I can spend with them every day, <eob> I focus on turning these minutes <eol> into memorable moments, <eob> moments where I'm seeing my kids, <eob> hearing them, connecting with them. <eob>
["Join forces, don't compete."] <eob>
Arab women of my generation <eol> have not been very visible <eob> in the public eye <eol> as they grew up. <eob>
This explains, I think, to some extent, <eob> why you find so few women in politics <eol> in the Arab world. <eob>
The upside of this, however, <eob> is that we have spent a lot of time <eob> developing a social skill <eol> behind the scenes, <eob> in coffee shops, in living rooms, <eob> on the phone, <eob> a social skill that <eol> is very important to success: <eob> networking. <eob>
I would say the average Arab woman <eob> has a large network <eol> of friends and acquaintances. <eob> The majority of those are also women. <eob>
In the West, it seems like ambitious women <eol> often compare themselves to other women <eob> hoping to be noticed <eol> as the most successful woman in the room. <eob>
This leads to the much-spoken-about <eol> competitive behavior <eob> between professional women. <eob>
If there's only room <eol> for one woman at the top, <eob> then you can't make room for others, <eol> much less lift them up. <eob>
Arab women, generally speaking, <eob> have not fallen <eol> for this psychological trap. <eob>
Faced with a patriarchal society, <eob> they have found that <eol> by helping each other out, <eob> all benefit. <eob>
In my previous job, I was the most senior <eol> woman in the Middle East, <eob> so one could think that investing <eol> in my network of female colleagues <eob> couldn't bring many benefits <eob> and that I should instead invest my time <eob> developing my relationships with male seniors and peers. <eob>
Yet two of my biggest breaks came <eol> through the support of other women. <eob>
It was the head of marketing who initially suggested <eob> I be considered as a young global leader <eol> to the World Economic Forum. <eob>
She was familiar with my media engagements <eol> and my publications, <eob> and when she was asked to voice her opinion, <eob> she highlighted my name. <eob>
It was a young consultant, <eol> a Saudi lady and friend, <eob> who helped me sell my first project <eol> in Saudi Arabia, <eob> a market I was finding hard <eol> to gain traction in as a woman. <eob>
She introduced me to a client, <eob> and that introduction led to the first of very many <eol> projects for me in Saudi. <eob>
Today, I have two senior <eol> women on my team, <eob> and I see making them successful <eol> as key to my own success. <eob>
Women continue to advance in the world, <eob> not fast enough, but we're moving. <eob>
The Arab world, too, is making progress, <eol> despite many recent setbacks. <eob>
Just this year, the UAE appointed <eol> five new female ministers to its cabinet, <eob> for a total of eight female ministers. <eob>
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet, <eob> and more than many developed countries <eol> can claim. <eob>
This is today my daughter <eol> Alia's favorite picture. <eob>
This is the result, no doubt, <eol> of great leadership, <eob> but it is also the result of strong Arab women <eob> not giving up and continuously <eol> pushing the boundaries. <eob>
It is the result of Arab women <eol> deciding every day like me <eob> to convert shit into fuel, <eob> to work their life <eol> to keep work out of their life, <eob> and to join forces and not compete. <eob>
As I look to the future, <eob> my hopes for my daughter <eol> when she stands on this stage <eob> some 20, 30 years from now <eob> are that she be as proud to call herself <eol> her mother's daughter <eob> as her father's daughter. <eob>
My hopes for my son <eob> are that by then, the expression <eol> "her mother's son" or "mama's boy" <eob> would have taken on a completely different meaning. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So this is my niece. <eob> Her name is Yahli. <eob>
She is nine months old. <eob>
Her mum is a doctor, <eol> and her dad is a lawyer. <eob>
By the time Yahli goes to college, <eob> the jobs her parents do <eol> are going to look dramatically different. <eob>
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University <eol> did a study on the future of work. <eob>
They concluded that almost one <eol> in every two jobs have a high risk <eob> of being automated by machines. <eob>
Machine learning is the technology <eob> that's responsible <eol> for most of this disruption. <eob>
It's the most powerful <eol> branch of artificial intelligence. <eob>
It allows machines to learn from data <eob> and mimic some of the things <eol> that humans can do. <eob>
My company, Kaggle, operates <eol> on the cutting edge of machine learning. <eob>
We bring together hundreds <eol> of thousands of experts <eob> to solve important problems for industry <eol> and academia. <eob>
This gives us a unique perspective <eol> on what machines can do, <eob> what they can't do <eob> and what jobs they might automate <eol> or threaten. <eob>
Machine learning started making its way <eol> into industry in the early '90s. <eob>
It started with relatively simple tasks. <eob> It started with things like assessing <eol> credit risk from loan applications, <eob> sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters <eol> from zip codes. <eob>
Over the past few years, we have made <eol> dramatic breakthroughs. <eob>
Machine learning is now capable of far, <eol> far more complex tasks. <eob>
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community <eob> to build an algorithm <eol> that could grade high-school essays. <eob>
The winning algorithms <eol> were able to match the grades <eob> given by human teachers. <eob>
Last year, we issued an even more <eol> difficult challenge. <eob>
Can you take images of the eye <eol> and diagnose an eye disease <eob> called diabetic retinopathy? <eob>
Again, the winning algorithms <eol> were able to match the diagnoses <eob> given by human ophthalmologists. <eob>
Now, given the right data, machines <eol> are going to outperform humans <eob> at tasks like this. <eob>
A teacher might read 10,000 essays <eol> over a 40-year career. <eob>
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes. <eob>
A machine can read millions of essays <eol> or see millions of eyes <eob> within minutes. <eob>
We have no chance of competing <eol> against machines <eob> on frequent, high-volume tasks. <eob>
But there are things we can do <eol> that machines can't do. <eob>
Where machines have made very little progress <eob> is in tackling novel situations. <eob>
They can't handle things <eol> they haven't seen many times before. <eob>
The fundamental limitations <eol> of machine learning <eob> is that it needs to learn <eol> from large volumes of past data. <eob>
Now, humans don't. <eob>
We have the ability <eol> to connect seemingly disparate threads <eob> to solve problems <eol> we've never seen before. <eob>
Percy Spencer was a physicist <eol> working on radar during World War II, <eob> when he noticed the magnetron was melting <eol> his chocolate bar. <eob>
He was able to connect his understanding <eol> of electromagnetic radiation <eob> with his knowledge of cooking <eob> in order to invent -- any guesses? -- <eol> the microwave oven. <eob>
Now, this is a particularly <eol> remarkable example of creativity. <eob>
But this sort of cross-pollination happens <eol> for each of us in small ways <eob> thousands of times per day. <eob>
Machines cannot compete with us <eob> when it comes to tackling novel situations, <eob> and this puts a fundamental limit <eol> on the human tasks <eob> that machines will automate. <eob>
So what does this mean <eol> for the future of work? <eob>
The future state of any single job <eol> lies in the answer to a single question: <eob> To what extent is that job <eol> reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, <eob> and to what extent does it <eol> involve tackling novel situations? <eob>
On frequent, high-volume tasks, <eol> machines are getting smarter and smarter. <eob>
Today they grade essays. <eol> They diagnose certain diseases. <eob>
Over coming years, <eol> they're going to conduct our audits, <eob> and they're going to read boilerplate <eol> from legal contracts. <eob>
Accountants and lawyers are still needed. <eob>
They're going to be needed <eol> for complex tax structuring, <eob> for pathbreaking litigation. <eob>
But machines will shrink their ranks <eob> and make these jobs harder to come by. <eob>
Now, as mentioned, <eob> machines are not making progress <eol> on novel situations. <eob>
The copy behind a marketing campaign <eol> needs to grab consumers' attention. <eob>
It has to stand out from the crowd. <eob>
Business strategy <eol> means finding gaps in the market, <eob> things that nobody else is doing. <eob>
It will be humans that are creating <eol> the copy behind our marketing campaigns, <eob> and it will be humans <eol> that are developing our business strategy. <eob>
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do, <eob> let every day bring you a new challenge. <eob>
If it does, then you will stay ahead <eol> of the machines. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine that you are a product designer. <eob>
And you've designed a product, <eob> a new type of product, <eol> called the human immune system. <eob>
You're pitching this product <eob> to a skeptical, strictly <eol> no-nonsense manager. <eob> Let's call him Bob. <eob> I think we all know <eol> at least one Bob, right? <eob>
How would that go? <eob>
Bob, I've got this incredible idea <eob> for a completely new type <eol> of personal health product. <eob>
It's called the human immune system. <eob>
I can see from your face that you're having <eol> some problems with this. <eob> Don't worry. I know <eol> it's very complicated. <eob>
I don't want to take you <eol> through the gory details, <eob> I just want to tell you about some <eol> of the amazing features of this product. <eob>
First of all, it cleverly <eol> uses redundancy <eob> by having millions of copies <eol> of each component -- <eob> leukocytes, white blood cells -- <eob> before they're actually needed, <eob> to create a massive buffer <eol> against the unexpected. <eob>
And it cleverly leverages diversity <eob> by having not just leukocytes <eol> but B cells, T cells, <eob> natural killer cells, antibodies. <eob>
The components don't really matter. <eob>
The point is that together, <eob> this diversity of different approaches <eol> can cope with more or less anything <eob> that evolution has been able to throw up. <eob>
And the design is completely modular. <eob>
You have the surface barrier <eol> of the human skin, <eob> you have the very rapidly reacting <eol> innate immune system <eob> and then you have the highly targeted <eol> adaptive immune system. <eob>
The point is, that if one system fails, <eol> another can take over, <eob> creating a virtually foolproof system. <eob>
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, <eol> but stay with me, <eob> because here is the really killer feature. <eob>
The product is completely adaptive. <eob>
It's able to actually develop <eol> targeted antibodies <eob> to threats that it's never even met before. <eob>
It actually also does this <eol> with incredible prudence, <eob> detecting and reacting to every tiny threat, <eob> and furthermore, remembering <eol> every previous threat, <eob> in case they are ever encountered again. <eob>
What I'm pitching you today <eol> is actually not a stand-alone product. <eob>
The product is embedded <eol> in the larger system of the human body, <eob> and it works in complete harmony <eol> with that system, <eob> to create this unprecedented level <eol> of biological protection. <eob>
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do <eol> you think of my product? <eob>
And Bob may say something like, <eob> I sincerely appreciate <eol> the effort and passion <eob> that have gone into your presentation, <eob> blah blah blah -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But honestly, it's total nonsense. <eob>
You seem to be saying that the key <eol> selling points of your product <eob> are that it is inefficient <eol> and complex. <eob>
Didn't they teach you 80-20? <eob>
And furthermore, you're saying <eol> that this product is siloed. <eob> It overreacts, <eob> makes things up as it goes along <eob> and is actually designed <eol> for somebody else's benefit. <eob>
I'm sorry to break it to you, <eol> but I don't think this one is a winner. <eob>
If we went with Bob's philosophy, <eob> I think we'd actually end up <eol> with a more efficient immune system. <eob>
And efficiency is always important <eol> in the short term. <eob>
Less complex, more efficient, <eol> more bang for the buck. <eob>
Who could say no to that? <eob>
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem, <eob> and that is that the user <eol> of this product, you or I, <eob> would probably die within one week <eol> of the next winter, <eob> when we encountered a new strain <eol> of the influenza virus. <eob>
I first became interested <eol> in biology and business, <eob> and longevity and resilience, <eob> when I was asked a very unusual question <eob> by the CEO of a global tech company. <eob>
And the question was: <eob> What do we have to do to make sure <eol> that our company lasts 100 years? <eob> A seemingly innocent question, <eob> but actually, it's a little trickier <eol> than you might think, <eob> considering that the average <eol> US public company now <eob> can expect a life span <eol> of only 30 years. <eob>
That is less than half of the life span <eob> that its employees can expect to enjoy. <eob>
Now, if you were the CEO <eol> of such a company, <eob> badgered by investors <eol> and buffeted by change, <eob> we might forgive you <eol> for not even worrying too much <eob> about what happens 30 years out. <eob>
But here's something <eol> that should keep you awake at night: <eob> the probability that your company <eol> will not be around in five year's time, <eob> on average, is now <eol> a staggering 32 percent. <eob>
That's a one in three chance <eol> that your company will be taken over <eob> or will fail within just five years. <eob>
Let's come back to our tech <eol> CEO's question. <eob>
Where better to turn for advice <eol> than nature, <eob> that's been in the business <eol> of life and death <eob> for longer than any company? <eob>
As a lapsed biologist, <eob> I decided to immediately call <eol> a real biologist, <eob> my friend Simon Levin, <eob> Professor of Biology and Mathematics <eol> at Princeton University. <eob>
Together, we looked at a variety <eol> of biological systems, <eob> ranging from natural tropical rainforests <eob> through to managed forests and fisheries. <eob>
And we asked ourselves the question: <eob> What makes these systems resilient and enduring? <eob>
And what we found <eol> was that the same six principles <eob> that we saw underpinning <eol> the miracle of the human immune system <eob> actually cropped up again and again, <eob> from redundancy through <eol> to embeddedness. <eob>
In fact, we saw these principles <eol> not only in biologically enduring systems, <eob> we also found them being very characteristic <eob> of long-lived social systems, <eob> like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church, <eob> believe it or not. <eob>
We also went on to look at business, <eob> and found that these very same properties <eol> also characterized businesses <eob> that were resilient and long-lived, <eob> and we noted their absence from ones <eol> which were short-lived. <eob>
Let's first take a look at what happens <eol> when the corporate immune system <eob> collapses. <eob>
This beautiful building is part <eol> of the Shitennoji Temple Complex <eob> in Osaka, Japan. <eob>
In fact, it's one of the oldest <eol> temples in Japan. <eob>
It was built by a Korean artisan, <eob> because at the time, Japan <eol> was not yet building temples. <eob>
And this Korean artisan went on <eol> to found a temple-building company. <eob>
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, <eob> was still around 1,428 years later. <eob>
In fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company <eob> in the world. <eob>
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today? <eob>
Not too well, I'm afraid. <eob>
It borrowed very heavily <eob> during the bubble period <eol> of the Japanese economy, <eob> to invest in real estate. <eob>
And when the bubble burst, <eol> it couldn't refinance its loans. <eob>
The company failed, <eob> and it was taken over <eol> by a major construction company. <eob>
Tragically, after 40 generations <eol> of very careful stewardship <eob> by the Kongō family, <eob> Kongō Gumi succumbed <eol> to a spectacular lapse <eob> in the ability to apply a principle <eol> of prudence. <eob>
Speaking of company failures: <eob> we're all familiar <eol> with the failure of Kodak, <eob> the company that declared bankruptcy <eob> in January 2012. <eob>
Much more interesting, however, is the question: <eob> Why did Fujifilm — <eob> same product, same pressures <eol> from digital technology, same time — <eob> why was Fujifilm able to survive <eol> and flourish? <eob>
Fujifilm used its capabilities <eol> in chemistry, material science and optics <eob> to diversify into a number of areas, <eob> ranging from cosmetics <eol> to pharmaceuticals, <eob> to medical systems to biomaterials. <eob>
Some of these diversification <eol> attempts failed. <eob>
But in aggregate, <eob> it was able to adapt <eol> its portfolio sufficiently <eob> to survive and flourish. <eob>
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it, <eob> the strategy succeeded because it had <eol> "more pockets and drawers" <eob> than the rivals. <eob>
He meant, of course, <eob> that they were able to create more options <eob> than the rivals. <eob>
Fujifilm survived because it applied <eol> the principles of prudence, <eob> diversity <eob> and adaptation. <eob>
A catastrophic factory fire, like <eol> the one we see here, <eob> completely wiped out, in one evening, <eob> the only plant which supplied Toyota <eol> with valves for car-braking systems. <eob>
The ultimate test of resilience. <eob>
Car production ground to a screeching halt. <eob>
How was it, then, that Toyota <eol> was able to recover car production? <eob>
Can you imagine how long it took? <eob> Just five days. <eob> From having no braking valves <eol> to complete recovery in five days. <eob>
How was this possible? <eob>
Toyota managed its network <eol> of suppliers in such a collaborative manner <eob> that it could work very quickly <eol> and smoothly with suppliers <eob> to repurpose production, <eob> fill the missing braking valve capacity <eob> and have car production come online again. <eob>
Toyota applied the principles <eol> of modularity of its supply network, <eob> embeddedness in an integrated system <eob> and the functional redundancy <eol> to be able to repurpose, smoothly, <eob> existing capacity. <eob>
Now fortunately, few companies succumb <eol> to catastrophic fires. <eob>
But we do read in the newspaper <eol> every day about companies <eob> succumbing to the disruption <eol> of technology. <eob>
How is it, then, that the consumer <eol> optics giant Essilor <eob> is able to avoid technology disruption, <eol> and even profit from it? <eob>
And yes, technology disruption <eol> is not only a big deal <eob> in software and electronics. <eob>
Essilor carefully scans <eol> the competitive environment <eob> for potentially disruptive technologies. <eob>
It acquires those technologies very early, <eob> before they've become expensive or competitors <eol> have mobilized around them, <eob> and it then develops those technologies itself, <eob> even at the risk of failure <eob> or the risk of self-disruption. <eob>
Essilor stays ahead of its game, <eob> and has delivered spectacular performance <eob> for over 40 years, <eob> by using the principles of prudence <eob> and adaptation. <eob>
OK, if these principles <eol> are so powerful, you might be thinking, <eob> why are they not commonplace <eol> in business? <eob>
Why do we not use these words every day? <eob>
Well, change has to first <eol> start in the mind. <eob>
If we think back <eol> to our pitch to Bob, <eob> in order to apply the principles <eob> that underpin the miracle <eol> of the human immune system, <eob> we first need to think differently <eob> about business. <eob>
Now typically, when we think about business, <eob> we use what I call "mechanical thinking." <eob> We set goals, <eob> we analyze problems, <eob> we construct and we adhere to plans, <eob> and more than anything else, <eob> we stress efficiency and short-term performance. <eob>
Now, don't get me wrong -- <eob> this is a splendidly practical <eol> and effective way <eob> of addressing relatively simple challenges <eob> in relatively stable environments. <eob>
It's the way that Bob -- <eol> and probably many of us, myself included -- <eob> process most business problems <eol> we're faced with every day. <eob>
In fact, it was a pretty <eol> good mental model for business -- <eob> overall -- <eob> until about the mid-1980s, <eob> when the conjunction of globalization <eob> and a revolution in technology and telecommunications <eob> made business far more dynamic <eol> and unpredictable. <eob>
But what about those more dynamic <eol> and unpredictable situations <eob> that we now increasingly face? <eob>
I think in addition <eol> to the mechanical thinking, <eob> we now need to master the art <eol> of biological thinking, <eob> as embodied by our six principles. <eob>
In other words, we need to think <eol> more modestly and subtly <eob> about when and how <eob> we can shape, rather than control, <eob> unpredictable and complex situations. <eob>
It's a little like the difference <eol> between throwing a ball <eob> and releasing a bird. <eob>
The ball would head in a straight line, <eob> probably towards the intended target, <eob> and the bird certainly would not. <eob>
So what do you think? <eob>
Sounds a little impractical, <eol> a little theoretical, perhaps? <eob> Not at all. <eob> Every small entrepreneurial company <eob> naturally thinks <eol> and acts biologically. <eob> Why? <eob> Because it lacks the resources <eol> to shape its environment <eob> through brute force. <eob>
It lacks the scale to buffer change, <eob> and it's constantly thinking <eol> about the tough odds <eob> for a start-up to survive. <eob>
Now, the irony is, of course, <eob> that every large company started off <eol> as a small, entrepreneurial company. <eob>
But along the way somewhere, <eob> many have lost this ability <eol> to think and act biologically. <eob>
They need to rejuvenate their ability <eol> to think biologically <eob> in order to survive <eol> and thrive in today's environment. <eob>
So let's not just think <eol> about short-term performance. <eob>
Every company I know spends <eol> plenty of time <eob> thinking about the central <eol> question of strategy: <eob> How good is our competitive game? <eob>
In addition, let's also consider <eob> the second, more biological <eol> and equally important question: <eob> How long will that game last? <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Is there life beyond Earth <eol> in our solar system? <eob>
Wow, what a powerful question. <eob>
You know, as a scientist -- <eob> planetary scientist -- <eob> we really didn't take <eol> that very seriously until recently. <eob>
Carl Sagan always said, <eob> "It takes extraordinary evidence <eol> for extraordinary claims." <eob> And the claims of having life beyond Earth <eob> need to be definitive, <eob> they need to be loud <eob> and they need to be everywhere <eol> for us to be able to believe it. <eob>
So how do we make this journey? <eob>
What we decided to do <eob> is first look for those ingredients for life. <eob>
The ingredients of life are: <eob> liquid water -- <eob> we have to have a solvent, <eob> can't be ice, has to be liquid. <eob>
We also have to have energy. <eob>
We also have to have organic material -- <eob> things that make us up, <eob> but also things that we need to consume. <eob>
So we have to have these elements <eob> in environments for long periods of time <eob> for us to be able to be confident that life, <eob> in that moment when it starts, <eob> can spark and then grow and evolve. <eob>
Well, I have to tell you <eol> that early in my career, <eob> when we looked at those three elements, <eob> I didn't believe that they were beyond Earth <eob> in any length of time <eol> and for any real quantity. <eob>
Why? We look at the inner planets. <eob>
Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water. <eob>
Mars -- dry and arid. <eob> It's got no water. <eob>
And beyond Mars, <eob> the water in the solar system <eol> is all frozen. <eob>
But recent observations have changed all that. <eob>
It's now turning our attention <eol> to the right places <eob> for us to take a deeper look <eob> and really start to answer <eol> our life question. <eob>
So when we look out into the solar system, <eob> where are the possibilities? <eob>
We're concentrating our attention <eol> on four locations. <eob>
The planet Mars <eob> and then three moons of the outer planets: <eob> Titan, Europa and small Enceladus. <eob>
So what about Mars? <eob> Let's go through the evidence. <eob> Well, Mars we thought <eol> was initially moon-like: <eob> full of craters, arid and a dead world. <eob>
And so about 15 years ago, <eob> we started a series of missions <eol> to go to Mars <eob> and see if water existed <eol> on Mars in its past <eob> that changed its geology. <eob>
We ought to be able to notice that. <eob>
And indeed we started <eol> to be surprised right away. <eob>
Our higher resolution images show deltas <eol> and river valleys and gulleys <eob> that were there in the past. <eob>
And in fact, <eob> Curiosity -- <eob> which has been roving on the surface <eol> now for about three years -- <eob> has really shown us that it's sitting <eol> in an ancient river bed, <eob> where water flowed rapidly. <eob>
And not for a little while, <eob> perhaps hundreds of millions of years. <eob>
And if everything was there, <eob> including organics, <eob> perhaps life had started. <eob>
Curiosity has also drilled in that red soil <eob> and brought up other material. <eob>
And we were really excited <eol> when we saw that. <eob>
Because it wasn't red Mars, <eob> it was gray material, <eob> it's gray Mars. <eob>
We brought it into the rover, <eob> we tasted it, <eob> and guess what? <eob>
We tasted organics -- <eob> carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, <eob> nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur -- <eob> they were all there. <eob>
So Mars in its past, <eob> with a lot of water, <eob> perhaps plenty of time, <eob> could have had life, <eob> could have had that spark, <eob> could have grown. <eob>
And is that life still there? <eob>
We don't know that. <eob>
But a few years ago <eob> we started to look at a number of craters. <eob>
During the summer, <eob> dark lines would appear <eol> down the sides of these craters. <eob>
The more we looked, <eob> the more craters we saw, <eob> the more of these features. <eob>
We now know more than a dozen of them. <eob>
A few months ago the fairy tale came true. <eob>
We announced to the world that we know <eol> what these streaks are. <eob>
It's liquid water. <eob>
These craters are weeping <eol> during the summer. <eob>
Liquid water is flowing down <eol> these craters. <eob>
So what are we going to do now -- <eob> now that we see the water? <eob>
Well, it tells us that Mars has all <eol> the ingredients necessary for life. <eob>
In its past it had perhaps <eol> two-thirds of its northern hemisphere -- <eob> there was an ocean. <eob>
It has weeping water right now. <eob>
Liquid water on its surface. <eob> It has organics. <eob> It has all the right conditions. <eob>
So what are we going to do next? <eob>
We're going to launch a series of missions <eob> to begin that search for life on Mars. <eob>
And now it's more appealing <eol> than ever before. <eob>
As we move out into the solar system, <eob> here's the tiny moon Enceladus. <eob>
This is not in what we call <eol> the traditional habitable zone, <eob> this area around the sun. <eob>
This is much further out. <eob>
This object should be ice <eol> over a silicate core. <eob>
But what did we find? <eob> Cassini was there since 2006, <eob> and after a couple years looked back <eol> after it flew by Enceladus <eob> and surprised us all. <eob>
Enceladus is blasting sheets <eol> of water out into the solar system <eob> and sloshing back down onto the moon. <eob> What a fabulous environment. <eob> Cassini just a few months ago <eol> also flew through the plume, <eob> and it measured silicate particles. <eob>
Where does the silica come from? <eob>
It must come from the ocean floor. <eob>
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn, <eob> pulling and squeezing this moon -- <eob> is melting that ice, <eob> creating an ocean. <eob>
But it's also doing that to the core. <eob>
Now, the only thing that we can think of <eob> that does that here on Earth <eol> as an analogy ... <eob> are hydrothermal vents. <eob>
Hydrothermal vents deep <eol> in our ocean were discovered in 1977. <eob>
Oceanographers were completely surprised. <eob>
And now there are thousands <eol> of these below the ocean. <eob>
What do we find? <eob> The oceanographers, when they go <eol> and look at these hydrothermal vents, <eob> they're teeming with life, <eob> regardless of whether the water <eol> is acidic or alkaline -- <eob> doesn't matter. <eob>
So hydrothermal vents are a fabulous <eol> abode for life here on Earth. <eob>
So what about Enceladus? <eob> Well, we believe because it has water <eob> and has had it for a significant period of time, <eob> and we believe it has hydrothermal vents <eob> with perhaps the right organic material, <eob> it is a place where life <eol> could exist. <eob>
And not just microbial -- <eob> maybe more complex <eol> because it's had time to evolve. <eob>
Another moon, very similar, <eob> is Europa. <eob>
Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996 <eob> and made fabulous observations of Europa. <eob>
Europa, we also know, <eol> has an under-the-ice crust ocean. <eob>
Galileo mission told us that, <eol> but we never saw any plumes. <eob>
But we didn't look for them. <eob>
Hubble, <eob> just a couple years ago, <eob> observing Europa, <eob> saw plumes of water <eob> spraying from the cracks <eol> in the southern hemisphere, <eob> just exactly like Enceladus. <eob>
These moons, <eob> which are not in what we call <eol> a traditional habitable zone, <eob> that are out in the solar system, <eob> have liquid water. <eob>
And if there are organics there, <eob> there may be life. <eob>
This is a fabulous set of discoveries <eob> because these moons <eol> have been in this environment like that <eob> for billions of years. <eob>
Life started here on Earth, we believe, <eol> after about the first 500 million, <eob> and look where we are. <eob>
These moons <eob> are fabulous moons. <eob>
Another moon that we're looking <eol> at is Titan. <eob>
Titan is a huge moon of Saturn. <eob>
It perhaps is much larger <eol> than the planet Mercury. <eob>
It has an extensive atmosphere. <eob>
It's so extensive -- <eob> and it's mostly nitrogen <eol> with a little methane and ethane -- <eob> that you have to peer <eol> through it with radar. <eob>
And on the surface, Cassini <eol> has found liquid. <eob>
We see lakes ... <eob> actually almost the size of our Black Sea <eol> in some places. <eob>
And this area is not liquid water; <eob> it's methane. <eob>
If there's any place in the solar system <eol> where life is not like us, <eob> where the substitute <eol> of water is another solvent -- <eob> and it could be methane -- <eob> it could be Titan. <eob>
Well, is there life beyond Earth <eol> in the solar system? <eob>
We don't know yet, <eob> but we're hot on the pursuit. <eob>
The data that we're receiving <eol> is really exciting <eob> and telling us -- <eob> forcing us to think about this <eol> in new and exciting ways. <eob>
I believe we're on the right track. <eob>
That in the next 10 years, <eol> we will answer that question. <eob>
And if we answer it, <eob> and it's positive, <eob> then life is everywhere <eol> in the solar system. <eob> Just think about that. <eob> We may not be alone. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We are stealing nature from our children. <eob>
Now, when I say this, I don't mean <eol> that we are destroying nature <eob> that they will have wanted us to preserve, <eob> although that is unfortunately also the case. <eob>
What I mean here is that we've started <eol> to define nature in a way <eob> that's so purist and so strict <eob> that under the definition we're creating for ourselves, <eob> there won't be any nature <eol> left for our children <eob> when they're adults. <eob>
But there's a fix for this. <eob> So let me explain. <eob>
Right now, humans use half of the world <eob> to live, to grow their crops <eol> and their timber, <eob> to pasture their animals. <eob>
If you added up all the human beings, <eob> we would weigh 10 times as much as all <eol> the wild mammals put together. <eob>
We cut roads through the forest. <eob>
We have added little plastic particles <eol> to the sand on ocean beaches. <eob>
We've changed the chemistry <eol> of the soil with our artificial fertilizers. <eob>
And of course, we've changed <eol> the chemistry of the air. <eob>
So when you take your next breath, <eob> you'll be breathing in 42 percent <eol> more carbon dioxide <eob> than if you were breathing in 1750. <eob>
So all of these changes, and many others, <eob> have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric <eol> of the "Anthropocene." <eob> And this is a term that some geologists <eol> are suggesting <eob> we should give to our current epoch, <eob> given how pervasive human influence <eol> has been over it. <eob>
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch, <eol> but I think it's a helpful way <eob> to think about the magnitude <eol> of human influence on the planet. <eob>
So where does this put nature? <eob>
What counts as nature in a world <eol> where everything is influenced by humans? <eob>
So 25 years ago, environmental <eol> writer Bill McKibben said <eob> that because nature was <eol> a thing apart from man <eob> and because climate change meant <eob> that every centimeter of the Earth <eol> was altered by man, <eob> then nature was over. <eob>
In fact, he called his book <eol> "The End of Nature." <eob>
I disagree with this. <eol> I just disagree with this. <eob>
I disagree with this definition of nature, <eol> because, fundamentally, we are animals. <eob> Right? Like, we evolved on this planet <eob> in the context of all the other animals <eol> with which we share a planet, <eob> and all the other plants, <eol> and all the other microbes. <eob>
And so I think that nature <eob> is not that which is untouched <eol> by humanity, man or woman. <eob>
I think that nature <eol> is anywhere where life thrives, <eob> anywhere where there <eol> are multiple species together, <eob> anywhere that's green and blue and thriving <eol> and filled with life <eob> and growing. <eob>
And under that definition, <eob> things look a little bit different. <eob>
Now, I understand that <eol> there are certain parts of this nature <eob> that speak to us in a special way. <eob>
Places like Yellowstone, <eob> or the Mongolian steppe, <eob> or the Great Barrier Reef <eob> or the Serengeti. <eob>
Places that we think of as kind <eol> of Edenic representations <eob> of a nature before <eol> we screwed everything up. <eob>
And in a way, they are less impacted <eol> by our day to day activities. <eob>
Many of these places <eol> have no roads or few roads, <eob> so on, like such. <eob>
But ultimately, even these Edens <eol> are deeply influenced by humans. <eob>
Now, let's just take North America, <eol> for example, <eob> since that's where we're meeting. <eob>
So between about 15,000 years ago <eol> when people first came here, <eob> they started a process of interacting <eol> with the nature <eob> that led to the extinction of a big slew <eol> of large-bodied animals, <eob> from the mastodon <eol> to the giant ground sloth, <eob> saber-toothed cats, <eob> all of these cool animals <eol> that unfortunately are no longer with us. <eob>
And when those animals went extinct, <eob> you know, the ecosystems <eol> didn't stand still. <eob>
Massive ripple effects <eol> changed grasslands into forests, <eob> changed the composition <eol> of forest from one tree to another. <eob>
So even in these Edens, <eob> even in these perfect-looking places <eob> that seem to remind us <eol> of a past before humans, <eob> we're essentially looking <eol> at a humanized landscape. <eob>
Not just these prehistoric humans, <eol> but historical humans, indigenous people <eob> all the way up until the moment <eol> when the first colonizers showed up. <eob>
And the case is the same <eol> for the other continents as well. <eob>
Humans have just been involved in nature <eob> in a very influential way <eol> for a very long time. <eob>
Now, just recently, someone told me, <eob>
"Oh, but there are still wild places." <eob>
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go." <eob>
And he said, "The Amazon." <eob>
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon. <eob>
I was just there. <eob> It's awesome. National Geographic <eol> sent me to Manú National Park, <eob> which is in the Peruvian Amazon, <eob> but it's a big chunk of rainforest, <eol> uncleared, no roads, <eob> protected as a national park, <eob> one of the most, in fact, biodiverse <eol> parks in the world. <eob>
And when I got in there with my canoe, <eol> what did I find, but people. <eob> People have been living there <eol> for hundreds and thousands of years. <eob>
People live there, and they don't just float <eol> over the jungle. <eob>
They have a meaningful relationship <eol> with the landscape. <eob> They hunt. They grow crops. <eob> They domesticate crops. <eob> They use the natural resources <eol> to build their houses, <eob> to thatch their houses. <eob>
They even make pets out of animals <eol> that we consider to be wild animals. <eob>
These people are there <eob> and they're interacting <eol> with the environment <eob> in a way that's really meaningful and that <eol> you can see in the environment. <eob>
Now, I was with an anthropologist <eol> on this trip, <eob> and he told me, as we were floating <eol> down the river, <eob> he said, "There are no demographic <eol> voids in the Amazon." <eob> This statement has really stuck with me, <eob> because what it means is that <eol> the whole Amazon is like this. <eob>
There's people everywhere. <eob>
And many other tropical forests <eol> are the same, <eob> and not just tropical forests. <eob>
People have influenced ecosystems in the past, <eob> and they continue to influence them <eol> in the present, <eob> even in places where <eol> they're harder to notice. <eob>
So, if all of the definitions <eol> of nature that we might want to use <eob> that involve it being untouched by humanity <eob> or not having people in it, <eob> if all of those actually give us <eol> a result where we don't have any nature, <eob> then maybe they're the wrong definitions. <eob>
Maybe we should define it <eol> by the presence of multiple species, <eob> by the presence of a thriving life. <eob>
Now, if we do it that way, <eob> what do we get? <eob>
Well, it's this kind of miracle. <eob>
All of a sudden, there's nature all <eol> around us. <eob>
All of a sudden, we see <eol> this Monarch caterpillar <eob> munching on this plant, <eob> and we realize that there it is, <eob> and it's in this empty lot <eol> in Chattanooga. <eob>
And look at this empty lot. <eob>
I mean, there's, like, probably, <eob> a dozen, minimum, plant species growing there, <eob> supporting all kinds of insect life, <eob> and this is a completely unmanaged <eol> space, a completely wild space. <eob>
This is a kind of wild nature <eol> right under our nose, <eob> that we don't even notice. <eob>
And there's an interesting <eol> little paradox, too. <eob>
So this nature, <eob> this kind of wild, untended part <eob> of our urban, peri-urban, <eol> suburban agricultural existence <eob> that flies under the radar, <eob> it's arguably more wild <eol> than a national park, <eob> because national parks are very carefully managed <eob> in the 21st century. <eob>
Crater Lake in southern Oregon, <eol> which is my closest national park, <eob> is a beautiful example of a landscape <eol> that seems to be coming out of the past. <eob>
But they're managing it carefully. <eob>
One of the issues they have now <eol> is white bark pine die-off. <eob>
White bark pine is a beautiful, <eol> charismatic -- <eob> I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora <eob> that grows up at high altitude -- <eob> and it's got all these problems <eol> right now with disease. <eob>
There's a blister rust <eol> that was introduced, <eob> bark beetle. <eob>
So to deal with this, the park <eol> service has been planting <eob> rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park, <eob> even in areas that they are otherwise <eol> managing as wilderness. <eob>
And they're also putting out <eol> beetle repellent in key areas <eob> as I saw last time <eol> I went hiking there. <eob>
And this kind of thing is really much <eol> more common than you would think. <eob>
National parks are heavily managed. <eob> The wildlife is kept to a certain population <eol> size and structure. <eob> Fires are suppressed. <eob> Fires are started. <eob> Non-native species are removed. <eob>
Native species are reintroduced. <eob>
And in fact, I took a look, <eob> and Banff National Park <eol> is doing all of the things I just listed: <eob> suppressing fire, having fire, <eob> radio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison. <eob>
It takes a lot of work to make these places <eol> look untouched. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And in a further irony, these places <eol> that we love the most <eob> are the places that we love <eol> a little too hard, sometimes. <eob>
A lot of us like to go there, <eob> and because we're managing them <eol> to be stable <eob> in the face of a changing planet, <eob> they often are becoming more fragile over time. <eob>
Which means that they're <eol> the absolute worst places <eob> to take your children on vacation, <eob> because you can't do anything there. <eob>
You can't climb the trees. <eob> You can't fish the fish. <eob> You can't make a campfire out <eol> in the middle of nowhere. <eob> You can't take home the pinecones. <eob>
There are so many rules and restrictions <eob> that from a child's point of view, <eob> this is, like, the worst nature ever. <eob>
Because children don't want to hike <eob> through a beautiful landscape <eol> for five hours <eob> and then look at a beautiful view. <eob>
That's maybe what we want <eol> to do as adults, <eob> but what kids want to do <eol> is hunker down in one spot <eob> and just tinker with it, <eol> just work with it, <eob> just pick it up, build a house, <eol> build a fort, do something like that. <eob>
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places <eob> are often distant from where people live. <eob> And they're expensive to get to. <eob>
They're hard to visit. <eob>
So this means that <eol> they're only available to the elites, <eob> and that's a real problem. <eob>
The Nature Conservancy did <eol> a survey of young people, <eob> and they asked them, how often <eol> do you spend time outdoors? <eob> And only two out of five spent time outdoors <eob> at least once a week. <eob>
The other three out of five <eol> were just staying inside. <eob>
And when they asked them why, <eol> what are the barriers to going outside, <eob> the response of 61 percent was, <eob> "There are no natural areas <eol> near my home." <eob>
And this is crazy. This is just patently false. <eob> I mean, 71 percent <eol> of people in the US <eob> live within a 10-minute walk <eol> of a city park. <eob>
And I'm sure the figures <eol> are similar in other countries. <eob>
And that doesn't even count your back garden, <eob> the urban creek, the empty lot. <eob>
Everybody lives near nature. <eob>
Every kid lives near nature. <eob>
We've just somehow forgotten <eol> how to see it. <eob>
We've spent too much time <eol> watching David Attenborough documentaries <eob> where the nature is really sexy -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and we've forgotten how to see the nature <eol> that is literally right outside our door, <eob> the nature of the street tree. <eob>
So here's an example: Philadelphia. <eob> There's this cool elevated railway <eob> that you can see from the ground, <eol> that's been abandoned. <eob>
Now, this may sound like the beginning <eol> of the High Line story in Manhattan, <eob> and it's very similar, except <eol> they haven't developed this into a park yet, <eob> although they're working on it. <eob>
So for now, it's still <eol> this little sort of secret wilderness <eob> in the heart of Philadelphia, <eob> and if you know where the hole <eol> is in the chain-link fence, <eob> you can scramble up to the top <eob> and you can find this completely wild meadow <eob> just floating above the city of Philadelphia. <eob>
Every single one of these plants <eol> grew from a seed <eob> that planted itself there. <eob>
This is completely autonomous, <eol> self-willed nature. <eob>
And it's right in the middle of the city. <eob>
And they've sent people up <eol> there to do sort of biosurveys, <eob> and there are over 50 plant species up there. <eob>
And it's not just plants. <eob>
This is an ecosystem, <eol> a functioning ecosystem. <eob>
It's creating soil. <eol> It's sequestering carbon. <eob>
There's pollination going on. <eob>
I mean, this is really an ecosystem. <eob>
So scientists have started calling ecosystems <eol> like these "novel ecosystems," <eob> because they're often <eol> dominated by non-native species, <eob> and because they're just super weird. <eob>
They're just unlike anything <eol> we've ever seen before. <eob>
For so long, we dismissed all these novel <eol> ecosystems as trash. <eob>
We're talking about regrown <eol> agricultural fields, <eob> timber plantations that are not <eol> being managed on a day-to-day basis, <eob> second-growth forests generally, <eol> the entire East Coast, <eob> where after agriculture moved west, <eol> the forest sprung up. <eob>
And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii, <eob> where novel ecosystems are the norm, <eob> where exotic species totally dominate. <eob>
This forest here has Queensland maple, <eob> it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia. <eob>
You can make your own novel <eol> ecosystem, too. <eob>
It's really simple. <eob> You just stop mowing your lawn. <eob>
Ilkka Hanski <eob> was an ecologist in Finland, <eol> and he did this experiment himself. <eob>
He just stopped mowing his lawn, <eob> and after a few years, <eol> he had some grad students come, <eob> and they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard, <eob> and they found 375 plant species, <eob> including two endangered species. <eob>
So when you're up there <eol> on that future High Line of Philadelphia, <eob> surrounded by this wildness, <eob> surrounded by this diversity, <eol> this abundance, this vibrance, <eob> you can look over the side <eob> and you can see a local playground <eol> for a local school, <eob> and that's what it looks like. <eob>
These children have, that -- <eob> You know, under my definition, <eob> there's a lot of the planet <eol> that counts as nature, <eob> but this would be one of the few places <eol> that wouldn't count as nature. <eob>
There's nothing there except humans, <eol> no other plants, no other animals. <eob>
And what I really wanted to do <eob> was just, like, throw a ladder over the side <eob> and get all these kids to come up with me <eol> into this cool meadow. <eob>
In a way, I feel like this <eol> is the choice that faces us. <eob>
If we dismiss these new natures <eol> as not acceptable or trashy or no good, <eob> we might as well just pave them over. <eob>
And in a world where everything is changing, <eob> we need to be very careful <eol> about how we define nature. <eob>
In order not to steal it <eol> from our children, <eob> we have to do two things. <eob>
First, we cannot define nature <eol> as that which is untouched. <eob>
This never made any sense anyway. <eob>
Nature has not been untouched <eol> for thousands of years. <eob>
And it excludes most of the nature <eol> that most people can visit <eob> and have a relationship with, <eob> including only nature that children cannot touch. <eob>
Which brings me to the second thing <eol> that we have to do, <eob> which is that we have to let children touch nature, <eob> because that which is untouched is unloved. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We face some pretty grim environmental <eol> challenges on this planet. <eob>
Climate change is among them. <eob>
There's others too: habitat loss <eol> is my favorite thing <eob> to freak out about in the middle of the night. <eob>
But in order to solve them, <eob> we need people -- smart, dedicated people -- <eob> who care about nature. <eob>
who care about nature. <eob> And the only way we're going <eol> to raise up a generation of people <eob> is by letting them touch nature. <eob>
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology, <eob> Fort Theory of Conservation. <eob>
Every ecologist I know, <eol> every conservation biologist I know, <eob> every conservation professional I know, <eob> built forts when they were kids. <eob>
If we have a generation that doesn't know <eol> how to build a fort, <eob> we'll have a generation <eol> that doesn't know how to care about nature. <eob>
And I don't want to be the one <eol> to tell this kid, <eob> who is on a special program <eob> that takes Philadelphia kids <eol> from poor neighborhoods <eob> and takes them to city parks, <eob> I don't want to be the one <eob> to tell him <eol> that the flower he's holding <eob> is a non-native invasive weed <eol> that he should throw away as trash. <eob>
I think I would much rather learn from this boy <eob> that no matter where this plant comes from, <eob> it is beautiful, and it deserves <eol> to be touched and appreciated. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's this fact that I love <eol> that I read somewhere once, <eob> that one of the things that's contributed <eol> to homo sapiens' success <eob> as a species <eob> is our lack of body hair -- <eob> that our hairlessness, our nakedness <eob> combined with our invention of clothing, <eob> gives us the ability to modulate <eol> our body temperature <eob> and thus be able to survive <eol> in any climate we choose. <eob>
And now we've evolved to the point <eol> where we can't survive without clothing. <eob>
And it's more than just utility, <eob> now it's a communication. <eob>
Everything that we choose <eol> to put on is a narrative, <eob> a story about where we've been, <eob> what we're doing, <eob> who we want to be. <eob>
I was a lonely kid. <eob>
I didn't have an easy time <eol> finding friends to play with, <eob> and I ended up making <eol> a lot of my own play. <eob>
I made a lot of my own toys. <eob>
It began with ice cream. <eob>
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown, <eob> and they served ice cream <eol> from behind the counter <eob> in these giant, five-gallon, <eol> cardboard tubs. <eob>
And someone told me -- <eol> I was eight years old -- <eob> someone told me that when <eol> they were done with those tubs, <eob> they washed them out <eol> and kept them in the back, <eob> and if you asked they would give you one. <eob>
It took me a couple of weeks <eol> to work up the courage, <eob> but I did, and they did. <eob>
They gave me one -- I went home <eol> with this beautiful cardboard tub. <eob> I was trying to figure out what <eol> I could do with this exotic material -- <eob> metal ring, top and bottom. <eob>
I started turning it over in my head, <eol> and I realized, "Wait a minute -- <eob> my head actually fits inside this thing." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, I cut a hole out, <eob> I put some acetate in there <eob> and I made myself a space helmet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I needed a place to wear the space helmet, <eob> so I found a refrigerator box <eol> a couple blocks from home. <eob>
I pushed it home, <eob> and in my parents' guest room closet, <eob> I turned it into a spaceship. <eob>
I started with a control panel <eol> out of cardboard. <eob> I cut a hole for a radar screen <eob> and put a flashlight <eol> underneath it to light it. <eob>
I put a view screen up, <eol> which I offset off the back wall -- <eob> and this is where I thought <eol> I was being really clever -- <eob> without permission, I painted <eol> the back wall of the closet black <eob> and put a star field, <eob> which I lit up with some Christmas lights <eol> I found in the attic, <eob> and I went on some space missions. <eob>
A couple years later, <eob> the movie "Jaws" came out. <eob>
I was way too young to see it, <eol> but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever, <eob> like everyone else in America at the time. <eob>
There was a store in my town <eol> that had a "Jaws" costume in their window, <eob> and my mom must have overheard <eol> me talking to someone <eob> about how awesome <eol> I thought this costume was, <eob> because a couple days before Halloween, <eob> she blew my freaking mind <eol> by giving me this "Jaws" costume. <eob>
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope <eob> for people of a certain age to complain <eob> that kids these days have no idea <eol> how good they have it, <eob> but let me just show you a random sampling <eob> of entry-level kids' costumes <eol> you can buy online right now ... <eob> ... and this is the "Jaws" costume <eol> my mom bought for me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is a paper-thin shark face <eob> and a vinyl bib with the poster <eol> of "Jaws" on it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I loved it. <eob>
A couple years later, <eob> my dad took me to a film <eol> called "Excalibur." <eob> I actually got him to take me to it twice, <eob> which is no small thing, <eol> because it is a hard, R-rated film. <eob>
But it wasn't the blood <eol> and guts or the boobs <eob> that made me want to go see it again. <eob> They helped -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was the armor. <eob> The armor in "Excalibur" <eol> was intoxicatingly beautiful to me. <eob>
These were literally knights <eol> in shining, mirror-polished armor. <eob>
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur" <eol> wear their armor everywhere. <eob>
All the time -- they wear it at dinner, <eol> they wear it to bed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was like, "Are they reading my mind? <eob>
I want to wear armor all the time!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I went back to my favorite material, <eob> the gateway drug for making, <eob> corrugated cardboard, <eob> and I made myself a suit of armor, <eob> replete with the neck shields <eol> and a white horse. <eob>
Now that I've oversold it, <eob> here's a picture of the armor that I made. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, this is only the first <eol> suit of armor I made <eob> inspired by "Excalibur." <eob> A couple of years later, <eob> I convinced my dad to embark <eol> on making me a proper suit of armor. <eob>
Over about a month, <eob> he graduated me from cardboard <eol> to roofing aluminum called flashing <eob> and still, one of my all-time favorite <eol> attachment materials, <eob> POP rivets. <eob>
We carefully, over that month, <eob> constructed an articulated suit <eol> of aluminum armor <eob> with compound curves. <eob>
We drilled holes in the helmet <eol> so that I could breathe, <eob> and I finished just in time <eol> for Halloween and wore it to school. <eob>
Now, this is the one thing in this talk <eob> that I don't have a slide to show you, <eob> because no photo exists of this armor. <eob>
I did wear it to school, <eob> there was a yearbook photographer <eol> patrolling the halls, <eob> but he never found me, for reasons <eol> that are about to become clear. <eob>
There were things I didn't anticipate <eob> about wearing a complete suit <eol> of aluminum armor to school. <eob>
In third period math, <eol> I was standing in the back of class, <eob> and I'm standing in the back of class <eob> because the armor did not <eol> allow me to sit down. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is the first thing <eol> I didn't anticipate. <eob>
And then my teacher looks at <eol> me sort of concerned <eob> about halfway through the class <eol> and says, "Are you feeling OK?" <eob> I'm thinking, "Are you kidding? <eob>
Am I feeling OK? <eob> I'm wearing a suit of armor! <eol> I am having the time of my — <eob> "And I'm just about to tell her <eol> how great I feel, <eob> when the classroom starts to list <eol> to the left <eob> and disappear down this long tunnel, <eob> and then I woke up in the nurse's office. <eob>
I had passed out from heat exhaustion, <eob> wearing the armor. <eob>
And when I woke up, <eob> I wasn't embarrassed about having <eol> passed out in front of my class, <eob> I was wondering, "Who took my armor? <eob>
Where's my armor? " <eob>
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years, <eob> some colleagues and I get hired <eol> to make a show for Discovery Channel, <eob> called "MythBusters." <eob> And over 14 years, <eob> I learn on the job how to build <eol> experimental methodologies <eob> and how to tell stories <eol> about them for television. <eob>
I also learn early on <eob> that costuming can play a key role <eol> in this storytelling. <eob>
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color <eob> and narrative clarity <eol> to the stories we're telling. <eob>
And then we do an episode <eol> called "Dumpster Diving," <eob> and I learn a little bit more <eob> about the deeper implications <eol> of what costuming means to me. <eob>
In the episode "Dumpster Diving," <eob> the question we were trying to answer is: <eob> Is jumping into a dumpster as safe <eob> as the movies would lead you to believe? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The episode was going to have <eol> two distinct parts to it. <eob>
One was where we get trained <eol> to jump off buildings by a stuntman <eob> into an air bag. <eob>
And the second was the graduation <eol> to the experiment: <eob> we'd fill a dumpster full of material <eol> and we'd jump into it. <eob>
I wanted to visually separate <eol> these two elements, <eob> and I thought, <eob> "Well, for the first part we're training, <eol> so we should wear sweatsuits — <eob> Oh! <eob>
Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' <eol> on the back of the sweatsuits. <eob>
That's for the training." <eob> But for the second part, I wanted <eol> something really visually striking -- <eob> "I know! I'll dress as Neo <eol> from 'The Matrix.'" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I went to Haight Street. <eob> I bought some beautiful <eol> knee-high, buckle boots. <eob>
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay. <eob>
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear <eol> contact lenses in order to wear. <eob>
The day of the experiment shoot comes up, <eob> and I step out of my car in this costume, <eob> and my crew takes a look at me ... <eob> and start suppressing <eol> their church giggles. <eob>
They're like, <eol> "(Laugh sound)." <eob> And I feel two distinct things <eol> at this moment. <eob>
I feel total embarrassment <eob> over the fact that <eol> it's so nakedly clear to my crew <eob> that I'm completely <eol> into wearing this costume. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the producer in my mind reminds myself <eob> that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo, <eob> that flowing coat is going to look <eol> beautiful behind me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Five years into the "MythBusters" run, <eob> we got invited to appear <eol> at San Diego Comic-Con. <eob>
I'd known about Comic-Con for years <eol> and never had time to go. <eob>
This was the big leagues -- <eol> this was costuming mecca. <eob>
People fly in from all over the world <eob> to show their amazing creations <eol> on the floor in San Diego. <eob>
And I wanted to participate. <eob>
I decided that I would put together <eol> an elaborate costume <eob> that covered me completely, <eob> and I would walk the floor <eol> of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously. <eob>
The costume I chose? <eob> Hellboy. <eob> That's not my costume, <eob> that's actually Hellboy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I spent months <eob> assembling the most screen-accurate <eol> Hellboy costume I could, <eob> from the boots to the belt to the pants <eob> to the right hand of doom. <eob>
I found a guy who made <eol> a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest <eob> and I put them on. <eob>
I even had contact lenses made <eol> in my prescription. <eob>
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con <eob> and I can't even tell you <eol> how balls hot it was in that costume. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sweating! I should've remembered this. <eob>
I'm sweating buckets <eol> and the contact lenses hurt my eyes, <eob> and none of it matters <eol> because I'm totally in love. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Not just with the process of putting <eol> on this costume and walking the floor, <eob> but also with the community <eol> of other costumers. <eob>
It's not called costuming at Cons, <eob> it's called "cosplay." <eob> Now ostensibly, cosplay means <eol> people who dress up <eob> as their favorite characters <eol> from film and television <eob> and especially anime, <eob> but it is so much more than that. <eob>
These aren't just people <eol> who find a costume and put it on -- <eob> they mash them up. <eob>
They bend them to their will. <eob>
They change them to be the characters <eol> they want to be in those productions. <eob>
They're super clever and genius. <eob>
They let their freak flag fly <eol> and it's beautiful. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But more than that, <eob> they rehearse their costumes. <eob>
At Comic-Con or any other Con, <eob> you don't just take pictures <eol> of people walking around. <eob>
You go up and say, <eob> "Hey, I like your costume, <eol> can I take your picture?" <eob> And then you give them time <eol> to get into their pose. <eob>
They've worked hard on their pose <eob> to make their costume look <eol> great for your camera. <eob>
And it's so beautiful to watch. <eob> And I take this to heart. <eob>
At subsequent Cons, <eob> I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk <eol> as the Joker from "The Dark Knight." <eob> I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith <eol> from "Lord of the Rings," <eob> and I actually frighten some children. <eob>
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" -- <eob> that head laugh that Chewbacca does. <eob>
And then I dressed up as <eol> No-Face from "Spirited Away." <eob> If you don't know about "Spirited Away" <eol> and its director, Hayao Miyazaki, <eob> first of all, you're welcome. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is a masterpiece, <eol> and one of my all-time favorite films. <eob>
It's about a young girl named Chihiro <eol> who gets lost in the spirit world <eob> in an abandoned Japanese theme park. <eob>
And she finds her way back out again <eob> with the help of a couple <eol> of friends she makes -- <eob> a captured dragon named Haku <eob> and a lonely demon named No-Face. <eob>
No-Face is lonely <eol> and he wants to make friends, <eob> and he thinks the way to do it <eol> is by luring them to him <eob> and producing gold in his hand. <eob>
But this doesn't go very well, <eob> and so he ends up going <eol> on kind of a rampage <eob> until Chihiro saves him, <eob> rescues him. <eob>
So I put together a No-Face costume, <eob> and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con. <eob>
And I very carefully practiced <eol> No-Face's gestures. <eob>
I resolved I would not speak <eol> in this costume at all. <eob>
When people asked to take my picture, <eob> I would nod <eob> and I would shyly stand next to them. <eob>
They would take the picture <eob> and then I would secret out <eol> from behind my robe <eob> a chocolate gold coin. <eob>
And at the end of the photo process, <eol> I'd make it appear for them. <eob> Ah, ah ah! -- like that. <eob>
And people were freaking out. <eob> "Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! <eol> Oh my god, this is so cool!" <eob> And I'm feeling and I'm walking <eol> the floor and it's fantastic. <eob>
And about 15 minutes in something happens. <eob>
Somebody grabs my hand, <eob> and they put a coin back into it. <eob>
And I think maybe they're giving me <eol> a coin as a return gift, <eob> but no, this is one of the coins <eol> that I'd given away. <eob>
I don't know why. <eob>
And I keep on going, <eol> I take some more pictures. <eob>
And then it happens again. <eob>
Understand, I can't see anything <eol> inside this costume. <eob>
I can see through the mouth -- <eob> I can see people's shoes. <eob>
I can hear what they're saying <eol> and I can see their feet. <eob>
But the third time someone <eol> gives me back a coin, <eob> I want to know what's going on. <eob>
So I sort of tilt my head back <eol> to get a better view, <eob> and what I see is someone walking <eol> away from me going like this. <eob>
And then it hits me: <eob> it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face. <eob>
In the film "Spirited Away," <eob> bad luck befalls those <eol> who take gold from No-Face. <eob>
This isn't a performer-audience <eol> relationship; this is cosplay. <eob>
We are, all of us on that floor, <eob> injecting ourselves into a narrative <eol> that meant something to us. <eob>
And we're making it our own. <eob>
We're connecting with something <eol> important inside of us. <eob>
And the costumes <eol> are how we reveal ourselves <eob> to each other. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What do you do if you had <eol> to figure out the information <eob> behind 11.5 million documents, <eob> verify it and make sense of it? <eob>
That was a challenge <eob> that a group of journalists <eol> had to face late last year. <eob>
An anonymous person <eol> calling himself John Doe <eob> had somehow managed to copy <eol> nearly 40 years of records <eob> of the Panamanian law firm <eol> Mossack Fonseca. <eob>
This is one of many firms around the world <eob> that specialize in setting up accounts <eol> in offshore tax havens <eob> like the British Virgin Islands, <eob> for rich and powerful people <eol> who like to keep secrets. <eob>
John Doe had managed to copy <eol> every spreadsheet from this firm, <eob> every client file, <eob> every email, <eob> from 1977 to the present day. <eob>
It represented the biggest cache <eob> of inside information <eol> into the tax haven system <eob> that anyone had ever seen. <eob>
But it also presented a gigantic challenge <eol> to investigative journalism. <eob>
Think about it: <eol> 11.5 million documents, <eob> containing the secrets of people <eol> from more than 200 different countries. <eob>
Where do you start <eol> with such a vast resource? <eob>
Where do you even begin to tell a story <eob> that can trail off <eol> into every corner of the globe, <eob> and that can affect almost <eol> any person in any language, <eob> sometimes in ways <eol> they don't even know yet. <eob>
John Doe had given the information <eol> to two journalists <eob> at the German newspaper <eol> Süddeutsche Zeitung. <eob>
He said he was motivated <eol> by -- and I quote -- <eob> "The scale of the injustice <eol> that the documents would reveal." <eob> But one user alone can never make sense <eob> of such a vast amount of information. <eob>
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out <eob> to my organization in Washington, DC, <eob> The International Consortium <eol> of Investigative Journalists. <eob>
We decided to do something <eol> that was the very opposite <eob> of everything we'd been taught <eol> to do as journalists: <eob> share. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
By nature, investigative <eol> reporters are lone wolves. <eob>
We fiercely guard our secrets, <eob> at times even from our editors, <eob> because we know that the moment <eol> we tell them what we have, <eob> they'll want that story right away. <eob>
And to be frank, <eob> when you get a good story, <eob> you like to keep the glory to yourself. <eob>
But there's no doubt <eol> that we live in a shrinking world, <eob> and that the media has largely <eol> been slow to wake up to this. <eob>
The issues we report on <eol> are more and more transnational. <eob>
Giant corporations operate <eol> on a global level. <eob>
Environmental and health <eol> crises are global. <eob>
So, too, are financial flows <eol> and financial crises. <eob>
So it seems staggering <eol> that journalism has been so late <eob> to cover stories in a truly global way. <eob>
And it also seems staggering <eol> that journalism has been so slow <eob> to wake up to the possibilities <eol> that technology brings, <eob> rather than being frightened of it. <eob>
The reason journalists <eol> are scared of technology is this: <eob> the profession's largest institutions <eol> are going through tough times <eob> because of the changing way <eol> that people are consuming news. <eob>
The advertising business models <eol> that have sustained reporting are broken. <eob>
And this has plunged <eol> journalism into crisis, <eob> forcing those institutions <eol> to reexamine how they function. <eob>
But where there is crisis, <eob> there is also opportunity. <eob>
The first challenge presented <eob> by what would eventually become <eol> known as the Panama Papers <eob> was to make the documents <eol> searchable and readable. <eob>
There were nearly five million emails, <eob> two million PDFs that needed <eol> to be scanned and indexed, <eob> and millions more files <eol> and other kinds of documents. <eob>
They all needed to be housed <eol> in a safe and secure location <eob> in the cloud. <eob>
We next invited reporters <eol> to have a look at the documents. <eob>
In all, reporters from more <eol> than 100 media organizations <eob> in 76 countries -- <eob> from the BBC in Britain <eob> to Le Monde newspaper in France <eob> to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan. <eob> "Native eyes on native names," <eol> we called it, the idea being, <eob> who best to tell you <eol> who was important to Nigeria <eob> than a Nigerian journalist? <eob>
Who best in Canada than a Canadian? <eob>
There were only two rules <eol> for everyone who was invited: <eob> we all agreed to share everything <eol> that we found with everybody else, <eob> and we all agreed to publish <eol> together on the same day. <eob>
We chose our media partners based on trust <eob> that had been built up through <eol> previous smaller collaborations <eob> and also from leads <eol> that jumped out from the documents. <eob>
Over the next few months, <eob> my small nonprofit organization <eol> of less than 20 people <eob> was joined by more than 350 other <eol> reporters from 25 language groups. <eob>
The biggest information leak in history <eob> had now spawned the biggest <eol> journalism collaboration in history: <eob> 376 sets of native eyes doing <eol> what journalists normally never do, <eob> working shoulder to shoulder, <eob> sharing information, <eob> but telling no one. <eob>
For it became clear at this point <eob> that in order to make <eol> the biggest kind of noise, <eob> we first needed <eol> the biggest kind of silence. <eob>
To manage the project <eol> over the many months it would take, <eob> we built a secure virtual newsroom. <eob> We used encrypted communication systems, <eob> and we built a specially <eol> designed search engine. <eob>
Inside the virtual newsroom, <eob> the reporters could gather around the themes <eob> that were emerging from the documents. <eob>
Those interested in blood diamonds <eol> or exotic art, for instance, <eob> could share information about how <eol> the offshore world was being used <eob> to hide the trade in both <eol> of those commodities. <eob>
Those interested in sport <eol> could share information <eob> about how famous sports stars <eol> were putting their image rights <eob> into offshore companies, <eob> thereby likely avoiding taxes <eob> in the countries <eol> where they plied their trade. <eob>
But perhaps most exciting of all <eob> were the number of world leaders <eol> and elect politicians <eob> that were emerging from the documents <eob> — <eob> figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine, <eob> close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia <eob> and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked <eob> through his late father, Ian Cameron. <eob>
Buried in the documents <eol> were secret offshore entities, <eob> such as Wintris Inc., <eob> a company in the British Virgin Islands <eob> that had actually belonged <eol> to the sitting Icelandic prime minister. <eob>
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson, <eob> the Icelandic reporter <eol> we invited to join the project, <eob> as the loneliest man in the world. <eob>
For nine months, he refused paid work <eob> and lived off the earnings of his wife. <eob>
He pasted tarps <eol> over the windows of his home <eob> to prevent prying eyes <eol> during the long Icelandic winter. <eob>
And he soon ran out of excuses <eol> to explain his many absences, <eob> as he worked red-eyed, <eob> night after night, <eob> month after month. <eob>
In all that time, he sat on information <eob> that would eventually bring down <eol> the leader of his country. <eob>
Now, when you're an investigative reporter <eol> and you make an amazing discovery, <eob> such as your prime minster can be linked <eol> to a secret offshore company, <eob> that that company has a financial <eol> interest in Icelandic banks -- <eob> the very issue he's been elected on -- <eob> well, your instinct <eol> is to scream out very loud. <eob>
Instead, as one of the few people <eol> that he could speak to, <eob> Johannes and I shared <eol> a kind of gallows humor. <eob> "Wintris is coming," he used to say. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones." <eob>
When reporters like Johannes <eol> wanted to scream, <eob> they did so inside the virtual newsroom, <eob> and then they turned <eol> those screams into stories <eob> by going outside the documents <eol> to court records, <eob> official company registers, <eob> and by eventually putting questions <eol> to those that we intended to name. <eob>
Panama Papers actually allowed <eol> the reporters to look at the world <eob> through a different lens <eol> from everybody else. <eob>
As we were researching the story, <eob> unconnected to us, <eob> a major political bribery scandal <eol> happened in Brazil. <eob>
A new leader was elected in Argentina. <eob>
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA, <eob> the organization that controls <eol> the world of professional soccer. <eob>
The Panama Papers <eol> actually had unique insights <eob> into each one of these unfolding events. <eob>
So you can imagine the pressure <eol> and the ego dramas <eob> that could have ruined <eol> what we were trying to do. <eob>
Any of one of these journalists, <eob> they could have broken the pact. <eob>
But they didn't. <eob>
And on April 3 this year, <eob> at exactly 8pm German time, <eob> we published simultaneously <eol> in 76 countries. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The Panama Papers quickly became <eol> one of the biggest stories of the year. <eob>
This is the scene in Iceland <eol> the day after we published. <eob>
It was the first of many protests. <eob>
The Icelandic prime minister <eol> had to resign. <eob>
It was a first of many resignations. <eob>
We spotlighted many famous people <eol> such as Lionel Messi, <eob> the most famous <eol> soccer player in the world. <eob>
And there were some <eol> unintended consequences. <eob>
These alleged members <eol> of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested <eob> after we published details <eol> about their hideout. <eob>
They'd been using the address <eob> to register their offshore company. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There's a kind of irony <eol> in what we've been able to do. <eob>
The technology -- the Internet -- <eol> that has broken the business model <eob> is allowing us to reinvent <eol> journalism itself. <eob>
And this dynamic is producing <eob> unprecedented levels <eol> of transparency and impact. <eob>
We showed how a group of journalists <eol> can effect change across the world <eob> by applying new methods <eol> and old-fashioned journalism techniques <eob> to vast amounts of leaked information. <eob>
We put all-important context <eol> around what was given to us by John Doe. <eob>
And by sharing resources, <eob> we were able to dig deep -- <eob> much deeper and longer than most <eol> media organizations allow these days, <eob> because of financial concerns. <eob>
Now, it was a big risk, <eob> and it wouldn't work for every story, <eob> but we showed with the Panama Papers <eob> that you can write about any country <eol> from just about anywhere, <eob> and then choose your preferred <eol> battleground to defend your work. <eob>
Try obtaining a court injunction <eob> that would prevent the telling <eol> of a story in 76 different countries. <eob>
Try stopping the inevitable. <eob>
Shortly after we published, <eol> I got a three-word text from Johannes: <eob> "Wintris has arrived." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps <eol> has a new era for journalism. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. <eob>
I guess you're going to send <eol> that applause to the 350 journalists <eob> who worked with you, right? <eob>
Now, a couple of questions <eol> I would like to ask. <eob>
The first one is, <eob> you'd been working <eol> in secrecy for over a year <eob> with 350-something colleagues <eol> from all over the world -- <eob> was there ever a moment when you thought <eob> that the leak may be leaked, <eob> that the collaboration may just be broken <eob> by somebody publishing a story? <eob>
Or somebody not in the group <eol> releasing some information <eob> that they got to know? <eob>
Gerard Ryle: We had a series <eol> of crises along the way, <eob> including when something major <eol> was happening in the world, <eob> the journalists from that country <eol> wanted to publish right away. <eob>
We had to calm them down. <eob>
Probably the biggest crisis we had <eol> was a week before publication. <eob>
We'd sent a series of questions <eol> to the associates of Vladimir Putin, <eob> but instead of responding, <eob> the Kremlin actually held <eol> a press conference and denounced us, <eob> and denounced the whole thing <eol> as being, I guess, a plot from the West. <eob>
At that point, Putin thought <eol> it was just about him. <eob>
And, of course, a lot of editors <eol> around the world <eob> were very nervous about this. <eob>
They thought the story <eol> was going to get out. <eob>
You can imagine the amount <eol> of time they'd spent, <eob> the amount of resources, <eol> money spent on this. <eob>
So I had to basically spend <eol> the last week calming everyone down, <eob> a bit like a general, <eol> where you're holding your troops back: <eob> "Calm, remain calm." <eob> And then eventually, <eol> of course, they all did. <eob>
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, <eob> you released a lot of the documents <eol> as an open database <eob> for everybody to search <eol> via keyword, essentially. <eob>
GR: We very much believe <eob> that the basic information <eol> about the offshore world <eob> should be made public. <eob>
Now, we didn't publish <eol> the underlying documents <eob> of the journalists we're working with. <eob>
But the basic information <eol> such as the name of a person, <eob> what their offshore company was <eol> and the name of that company, <eob> is now all available online. <eob>
In fact, the biggest resource <eol> of its kind basically is out there now <eob>
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do. <eob>
I want to tell you <eol> about the future of money. <eob>
Let's start with a story about this culture <eob> that lived in Micronesia <eol> in the early 1900s, called the Yap. <eob>
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap <eob> because their form of money <eol> is really interesting. <eob>
They use these limestone <eol> discs called Rai stones. <eob>
Now, the Yap don't actually move <eol> these Rai stones around <eob> or exchange them the way <eol> we do with our coins, <eob> because Rai stones can get <eol> to be pretty massive. <eob>
The largest is about four tons <eol> and 12 feet across. <eob>
So the Yap just keep track of who owns <eol> part of what stone. <eob>
There's a story about these sailors <eob> that were transporting a stone <eol> across the ocean <eob> when they ran into some trouble <eol> and the stone actually fell in. <eob>
The sailors got back to the main island <eob> and they told everyone what had happened. <eob>
And everyone decided that, actually, yes, <eob> the sailors had the stone <eol> and -- why not? -- it still counted. <eob>
Even though it was at <eol> the bottom of the ocean, <eob> it was still part of the Yap economy. <eob>
You might think <eol> that this was just a small culture <eob> a hundred years ago. <eob>
But things like this happen <eol> in the Western world as well, <eob> and the Yap actually still use <eol> a form of these stones. <eob>
In 1932, the Bank of France <eol> asked the United States <eob> to convert their holdings <eol> from dollars into gold. <eob>
But it was too inconvenient to think <eol> about actually shipping <eob> all of that gold over to Europe. <eob>
So instead, someone went to where <eol> that gold was being stored <eob> and they just labeled it <eol> as belonging to France now. <eob>
And everyone agreed that France <eol> owned the gold. <eob>
It's just like those Rai stones. <eob>
The point I want to make <eol> with these two examples <eob> is that there's nothing inherently valuable <eob> about a dollar or a stone or a coin. <eob>
The only reason these things <eol> have any value <eob> is because we've all decided <eol> they should. <eob>
And because we've decided that, <eob> they do. <eob>
Money is about the exchanges <eol> and the transactions <eob> that we have with each other. <eob>
Money isn't anything objective. <eob>
It's about a collective story <eol> that we tell each other about value. <eob> A collective fiction. <eob> And that's a really powerful concept. <eob>
In the past two decades, <eob> we've begun to use digital money. <eob>
So I get paid via direct deposit, <eob> I pay my rent via bank transfer, <eob> I pay my taxes online. <eob>
And every month, <eob> a small amount of money <eol> is deducted from my paycheck <eob> and invested in mutual funds <eol> in my retirement account. <eob>
All of these interactions <eob> are literally just changing <eol> 1's and 0's on computers. <eob>
There's not even anything physical, <eol> like a stone or a coin. <eob>
Digital money makes it so that <eol> I can pay someone around the world <eob> in seconds. <eob>
Now when this works, <eob> it's because there are large institutions <eol> underwriting every 1 or 0 <eob> that changes on a computer. <eob>
And when it doesn't, <eob> it's often the fault <eol> of those large institutions. <eob>
Or at least, it's up <eol> to them to fix the problem. <eob>
And a lot of times, they don't. <eob>
There's a lot of friction in the system. <eob>
How long did it take <eol> the US credit card companies <eob> to implement chip and pin? <eob>
Half my credit cards <eol> still don't work in Europe. <eob> That's friction. <eob> Transferring money across borders <eol> and across currencies <eob> is really expensive: <eob> friction. <eob>
friction. <eob> An entrepreneur in India can set <eol> up an online business in minutes, <eob> but it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid: <eob>
Our access to digital money <eol> and our ability to freely transact <eob> is being held captive <eol> by these gatekeepers. <eob>
And there's a lot of impediments <eol> in the system slowing things down. <eob>
That's because digital money <eol> isn't really mine, <eob> it's entries in databases <eol> that belong to my bank, <eob> my credit card company <eol> or my investment firm. <eob>
And these companies have the right <eol> to say "no." <eob> If I'm a PayPal merchant <eob> and PayPal wrongly flags <eol> me for fraud, <eob> that's it. <eob>
My account gets frozen, <eol> and I can't get paid. <eob>
These institutions are standing <eol> in the way of innovation. <eob>
How many of you use Facebook photos, <eol> Google Photos, <eob> Instagram? <eob>
My photos are everywhere. <eob>
They are on my phone, <eol> they're on my laptop, <eob> they're on my old phone, <eol> they're in Dropbox. <eob>
They're on all these different <eol> websites and services. <eob>
And most of these services <eol> don't work together. <eob>
They don't inter-operate. <eob>
And as a result, <eob> my photo library is a mess. <eob>
The same thing happens <eob> when institutions control <eol> the money supply. <eob>
A lot of these services <eol> don't inter-operate, <eob> and as a result, this blocks <eol> what we can do with payment. <eob>
And it makes transaction costs go up. <eob>
So far, we've been through <eol> two phases of money. <eob>
In an analog world, we had to deal <eol> with these physical objects, <eob> and money moved at a certain speed -- <eol> the speed of humans. <eob>
In a digital world, money can reach <eol> much farther and is much faster, <eob> but we're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions. <eob>
Money only moves at the speed of banks. <eob>
We're about to enter a new phase of money. <eob>
The future of money is programmable. <eob>
When we combine software and currency, <eob> money becomes more than just <eol> a static unit of value, <eob> and we don't have to rely <eol> on institutions for security. <eob>
In a programmable world, <eob> we remove humans and institutions <eol> from the loop. <eob>
And when this happens, <eob> we won't even feel like <eol> we're transacting anymore. <eob>
Money will be directed by software, <eob> and it will just safely and securely flow. <eob>
Cryptocurrencies are the first step <eol> of this evolution. <eob>
Cryptocurrencies are digital money <eob> that isn't run by any government or bank. <eob>
It's money designed to work in a world <eol> without intermediaries. <eob>
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency, <eob> but there are hundreds of them. <eob>
There's Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, Dogecoin, <eob> and those are just a few <eol> of the more popular ones. <eob>
And these things are real money. <eob>
The sushi restaurant down my street <eob> takes Bitcoin. <eob>
I have an app on my phone <eol> that I can use to buy sashimi. <eob>
But it's not just for small transactions. <eob>
In March, there was a transaction <eol> that moved around 100,000 bitcoins. <eob>
That's the equivalent <eol> of 40 million US dollars. <eob>
Cryptocurrencies are based <eol> on a special field of mathematics <eob> called cryptography. <eob>
Cryptography is the study <eol> of how to secure communication, <eob> and it's about two really important things: <eob> masking information so it can be <eol> hidden in plain sight, <eob> and verifying a piece of information's source. <eob>
Cryptography underpins so many <eol> of the systems around us. <eob>
And it's so powerful that at times <eob> the US government <eol> has actually classified it as a weapon. <eob>
During World War II, breaking cryptosystems like Enigma <eob> was critical to decoding enemy transmissions <eob> and turning the tide of the war. <eob>
Today, anyone <eol> with a modern web browser is running <eob> a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem. <eob>
It's what we use to secure <eol> our interactions on the Internet. <eob>
It's what makes it safe <eol> for us to type our passwords in <eob> and to send financial information to websites. <eob>
So what the banks used to give us -- <eob> trustworthy digital money transfer -- <eob> we can now get with a clever application <eol> of cryptography. <eob>
And this means that we don't have to rely <eol> on the banks anymore <eob> to secure our transactions. <eob>
We can do it ourselves. <eob>
Bitcoin is based on the very same idea <eol> that the Yap used, <eob> this collective global knowledge <eol> of transfers. <eob>
In Bitcoin, I spend <eol> by transferring Bitcoin, <eob> and I get paid when someone <eol> transfers Bitcoin to me. <eob>
Imagine that we had this magic paper. <eob>
So the way that this paper works <eol> is I can give you a sheet of it <eob> and if you write something on it, <eob> it will magically appear <eol> on my piece as well. <eob>
Let's say we just give everyone this paper <eob> and everyone writes <eol> down the transfers that they're doing <eob> in the Bitcoin system. <eob>
All of these transfers get copied <eol> around to everyone else's pieces of paper. <eob>
And I can look at mine <eob> and I'll have a list <eol> of all of the transfers that are happening <eob> in the entire Bitcoin economy. <eob>
This is actually what's happening <eol> with the Bitcoin blockchain, <eob> which is a list of all of the transactions <eol> in Bitcoin. <eob>
Except, it's not done through paper. <eob>
It's done through computer code, <eob> running on thousands of net <eol>worked computers <eob> around the world. <eob>
All of these computers are collectively <eol> confirming <eob> who owns what Bitcoin. <eob>
So the Bitcoin blockchain <eol> is core to how Bitcoin works. <eob>
But where do bitcoins actually come from? <eob>
Well, the code is designed <eol> to create new Bitcoin <eob> according to a schedule. <eob>
And the way that it works <eol> is that to get those Bitcoin, <eob> I have to solve a puzzle -- <eol> a random cryptographic puzzle. <eob>
Imagine that we had 15 dice, <eob> and we were throwing these dice <eol> over and over again. <eob>
Whenever the dice come up all sixes, <eob> we say that we win. <eob>
This is very close to what these computers <eol> are all actually doing. <eob>
They're trying over and over again <eol> to land on the right number. <eob>
And when <eob> they do, <eob> we say that they've solved the puzzle. <eob>
The computer that solves the puzzle <eob> publishes its solution <eol> to the rest of the network <eob> and collects its reward: new bitcoins. <eob>
And in the act of solving this puzzle, <eob> these computers are actually <eol> helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain <eob> and add to the list of transactions. <eob>
There are actually people all over the world <eol> running this software, <eob> and we call them Bitcoin miners. <eob>
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner. <eob>
You can go download the software right now <eob> and run it in your computer <eol> and try to collect some bitcoins. <eob>
I can't say that I would recommend it, <eob> because right now, the puzzle is so hard <eol> and the network is so powerful, <eob> that if I tried to mine Bitcoin on my laptop, <eob> I probably wouldn't see any <eol> for about two million years. <eob>
The miners, professional miners, <eol> use this special hardware <eob> that's designed to solve <eol> the puzzle really fast. <eob>
Now, the Bitcoin network <eol> and all of this special hardware, <eob> there are estimates that the amount <eol> of energy it uses <eob> is equivalent to that of a small country. <eob>
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies <eob> are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome. <eob>
But the next generation is going <eol> to be so much better and so much faster. <eob>
Cryptocurrencies <eol> are the first step <eob> to a world with a global programmable money. <eob>
And in a world with programmable money, <eob> I can pay anyone else securely <eob> without having to sign up or ask permission, <eob> or do a conversion or worry <eol> about my money getting stuck. <eob>
And I can send money <eob> around the world. <eob>
This is a really amazing thing. <eob>
It's the idea of permission-less innovation. <eob>
The Internet caused an explosion of innovation, <eob> because it was built <eol> upon an open architecture. <eob>
And just like the Internet <eol> changed the way we communicate, <eob> programmable money is going to change <eol> the way we pay, <eob> allocate and decide on value. <eob>
So what kind of world <eol> does programmable money create? <eob>
Imagine a world <eol> where I can rent out my healthcare data <eob> to a pharmaceutical company. <eob>
They can run large-scale data analysis <eob> and provide me with a cryptographic proof <eob> that shows they're only <eol> using my data in a way that we agreed. <eob>
And they can pay me <eol> for what they find out. <eob>
Instead of signing up for streaming services <eob> and getting a cable bill, <eob> what if my television analyzed my watching habits <eob> and recommended well-priced content <eol> that fit within my budget <eob> that I would enjoy? <eob>
Imagine an Internet without ads, <eob> because instead of paying with our attention <eol> when we view content, <eob> we just pay. <eob>
Interestingly, things like micro-payments <eob> are actually going to change the way <eol> security works in our world, <eob> because once we're better able to allocate value, <eob> people will use their money <eol> and their energies <eob> for more constructive things. <eob>
If it cost a fraction of a cent <eol> to send an email, <eob> would we still have spam? <eob>
We're not at this world yet, <eob> but it's coming. <eob>
Right now, it's like we're in a world <eol> that is seeing the first automobile. <eob>
The first cryptocurrency, like the first car, <eob> is slow and hard to understand <eol> and hard to use. <eob>
Digital money, like the horse and carriage, <eob> works pretty well, <eob> and the whole world economy <eol> is built on it. <eob>
If you were the first person on your block <eob> to get a car with an internal combustion engine, <eob> your neighbors would probably <eol> think you were crazy: <eob> "Why would you want this large, clunky machine <eob> that breaks down all the time, <eol> that lights on fire, <eob> and is still slower than a horse?" <eob> But we all know how that story turns out. <eob>
We're entering a new era <eol> of programmable money. <eob>
And it's very exciting, <eol> but it's also a little bit scary. <eob>
Cryptocurrencies can be used <eol> for illegal transactions, <eob> just like cash is used <eol> for crime in the world today. <eob>
When all of our transactions are online, <eob> what does that mean for surveillance -- <eol> who can see what we do? <eob>
Who's advantaged in this new world <eol> and who isn't? <eob>
Will I have to start to pay for things <eol> that I didn't have to pay for before? <eob>
Will we all become slaves <eol> to algorithms and utility functions? <eob>
All new technology comes with trade-offs. <eob>
The Internet brought us a lot <eol> of ways to waste time. <eob>
But it also greatly <eol> increased productivity. <eob>
Mobile phones are annoying <eob> because they make me feel like I have to stay <eol> connected to work <eob> all the time. <eob>
But they also help me stay <eol> connected to friends and family. <eob>
The new sharing economy <eol> is going to eliminate some jobs. <eob>
But it's also going to create new, <eol> flexible forms of employment. <eob>
With programmable money, <eob> we decouple the need <eol> for large, trusted institutions <eob> from the architecture <eol> of the network. <eob>
And this pushes innovation in money <eol> out to the edges, where it belongs. <eob>
Programmable money democratizes money. <eob>
And because of this, things <eol> are going to change and unfold <eob> in ways that we can't even predict. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
The most complex problems in our time <eob> can be solved with simple techniques, <eob> if we are able to dream. <eob>
As a child, I discovered <eol> that creativity is the key <eob> to cross from dreams to reality. <eob>
I learned this from my grandmother, <eob> Dr. Ruth Tichauer, <eob> a Jewish refugee that settled <eol> in the heart of the Andes. <eob>
That is how I grew up: <eob> encouraged to see beyond any limitation. <eob>
So part of my education <eol> included helping her <eob> in remote, indigenous communities. <eob>
I cherish those memories, <eob> because they helped me <eol> to understand life outside the city, <eob> a life with a lot of possibilities, <eob> without barriers, as language or culture. <eob>
During those trips, my grandmother <eol> used to recite a Kipling poem: <eob> "Something hidden. Go and find it. <eob> Go and look behind the Mountains. <eob>
Something lost behind the mountains. <eob>
Lost and waiting for you. Go!" <eob>
In the coming years, <eol> I became a medical student. <eob>
One of every hundred <eol> children born worldwide <eob> has some kind of heart disease. <eob>
There's a part of this problem <eol> I think I can solve -- <eob> the part of this problem <eol> I have spent my life working on. <eob>
The problem starts <eob> during pregnancy. <eob>
The fetus needs to survive <eol> inside the mother. <eob>
Survival depends on communication <eob> between the systemic <eol> and the pulmonary blood. <eob>
At the moment of birth, <eob> this communication needs to stop. <eob>
If it doesn't close, the baby <eol> has a hole in the heart. <eob>
It is caused by prematurity <eol> and genetic conditions. <eob>
But what we know today <eob> is that a lack of oxygen <eol> is also one of the causes. <eob>
As you can see in the chart, <eob> the frequency of this kind of hole <eob> dramatically increases with altitude. <eob>
Video: (Baby crying) <eob>
When you look at patients <eol> with this condition, <eob> they seem desperate to breathe. <eob>
To close the hole, major surgery <eol> used to be the only solution. <eob>
One night, my friend Malte, <eol> were camping in the Amazon region. <eob>
The only thing that would not burn <eol> in the fire was a green avocado branch. <eob>
Then came a moment of inspiration. <eob>
So we used the branch as a mold <eol> for our first invention. <eob>
The holes in children's hearts <eol> can be closed with it. <eob>
A coil is a piece of wire <eol> wrapped onto itself. <eob>
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now, <eob> but that was our first successful attempt <eob> to create a device for this major problem. <eob>
In this video, we can see <eol> how a very tiny catheter <eob> takes the coil to the heart. <eob>
The coil then closes the hole. <eob>
After that moment of inspiration, <eob> there came a very long time of effort <eob> developing a prototype. <eob>
In vitro and in vivo studies took <eol> thousands of hours of work in the lab. <eob>
The coil, if it works, can save lives. <eob>
I returned from Germany to Bolivia, <eob> thinking that wherever we go, <eob> we have the opportunity <eol> to make a difference. <eob>
With my wife and partner, <eol> Dr. Alexandra Heath, <eob> we started to see patients. <eob>
After successfully treating <eol> patients with our coil, <eob> we felt really enthusiastic. <eob>
But we live in a place <eob> that is 12,000 feet high. <eob>
And, <eob> the patients there need a special device <eol> to solve their heart condition. <eob>
The hole in altitude <eol> patients is different, <eob> because the orifice <eol> between the arteries is larger. <eob>
Most patients cannot afford <eol> to be treated on time, <eob> and they die. <eob>
The first coil could successfully treat <eob> only half of the patients in Bolivia. <eob>
The search started again. <eob>
We went back to the drawing board. <eob>
After many trials, <eob> and with the help of my grandmother's <eol> indigenous friends in the mountains, <eob> we obtained a new device. <eob>
For centuries, indigenous women <eol> told stories by weaving complex patterns <eob> on looms, <eob> and an unexpected skill <eol> helped us for the new device. <eob>
We take this traditional method of weaving <eob> and make a design made by a smart material <eob> that records shape. <eob>
It seems this time, <eob> the weaving allows us <eol> to create a seamless device <eob> that doesn't rust <eob> because it's made of only one piece. <eob>
It can change by itself <eol> into very complex structures <eob> by a procedure that took <eol> decades to develop. <eob>
As you can see, the device enters the body <eob> through the natural channels. <eob>
Doctors have only to close <eol> the catheter through the hole. <eob>
Our device expands, places itself <eob> and closes the hole. <eob>
We have this beautiful delivery system <eob> that is so simple to use <eob> because it works by itself. <eob>
No open surgery was necessary. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As doctors, we fight with diseases <eob> that take a long time <eol> and effort to heal -- if they do. <eob>
This is the child from before, <eob> after the procedure. <eob>
As you can see -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As you can see, once the device is in place, <eob> the patient is 100 percent healed. <eob>
From start to finish, <eob> the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes. <eob>
That's very rewarding from the medical <eol> and human point of view. <eob>
We are so proud that some <eol> of our former patients <eob> are part of our team -- <eob> a team, thanks to added close interaction <eob> with patients that work with us. <eob>
Together, we have only one idea: <eob> the best solutions need to be simple. <eob>
We lost the fear <eol> of creating something new. <eob>
The path, it's not easy. <eob>
Many obstacles arise all the time. <eob>
But we receive strength from our patients. <eob>
Their resilience and courage <eob> inspire our creativity. <eob>
Our goal is to make sure <eob> that no child is left behind, <eob> not because of cost or access. <eob>
So we have to start a foundation <eob> with a one-to-one model. <eob>
We will give one device for free <eob> to make sure that every child is treated. <eob>
We are in many countries now, <eob> but we need to be everywhere. <eob>
This whole thing began <eob> with one impossible idea <eob> as will continue it, really: <eob> No child is left behind. <eob>
Muchas gracias. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So when I decided to create an art piece <eol> in Manshiyat Naser, <eob> the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage <eol> collectors in Egypt, <eob> I never thought this project would be <eob> the most amazing human experience <eol> that I would ever live. <eob>
As an artist, I had this humanist intention <eob> of beautifying a poor <eol> and neglected neighborhood <eob> by bringing art to it and hopefully shining <eol> light on this isolated community. <eob>
The first time I heard <eol> about this Christian Coptic community <eob> was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities <eol> under the regime of Hosni Mubarak <eob> decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs <eol> using the pretext of H1N1 virus. <eob>
Originally, they are pig breeders. <eob>
Their pigs and other animals <eol> are fed with the organic waste <eob> that they collect on a daily basis. <eob>
This event killed their livelihood. <eob>
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser, <eol> it felt like a maze. <eob>
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery <eol> on the top of the Muqattam Mountain. <eob>
So you go right, then straight, <eol> then right again, then left <eob> to reach all the way to the top. <eob>
But to reach there, you must dodge between <eol> the trucks overpacked with garbage <eob> and slalom between <eol> the tuk-tuks, <eob> the fastest vehicle to move around <eol> in the neighborhood. <eob>
The smell of the garbage <eol> unloaded from those trucks was intense, <eob> and the noise of the traffic <eol> was loud and overbearing. <eob>
Add to it the din created by the crushers <eol> in those warehouses along the way. <eob>
From outside it looks chaotic, <eol> but everything is perfectly organized. <eob>
The Zaraeeb, that ’ s <eol> how they call themselves, <eob> which means the pig breeders, <eob> have been collecting the garbage of Cairo <eob> and sorting it in their own <eol> neighborhood for decades. <eob>
They have developed one of the most efficient <eob> and highly profitable systems <eol> on a global level. <eob>
Still, the place is perceived <eol> as dirty, marginalized and segregated <eob> because of their association with the trash. <eob>
So my initial idea was <eol> to create an anamorphic piece, <eob> a piece that you can only see <eol> from one vantage point. <eob>
I wanted to challenge myself artistically <eol> by painting over several buildings <eob> and having it only fully visible <eol> from one point on the Muqattam Mountain. <eob>
The Muqattam Mountain <eol> is the pride of the community. <eob>
This is where they built <eol> the St. Simon Monastery, <eob> a 10,000-seat cave church <eol> that they carved into the mountain itself. <eob>
So, the first time I stood <eol> on top of the mountain <eob> and I looked at the neighborhood, <eob> I asked myself, how on earth <eol> will I convince all those owners <eob> to let me paint on their buildings? <eob>
And then Magd came. <eob>
Magd is a guide from the Church. <eob>
He told me the only person I needed <eol> to convince was Father Samaan, <eob> who is the leader of the community. <eob>
But to convince Father Samaan, <eol> I needed to convince Mario, <eob> who is a Polish artist <eol> who moved to Cairo 20 years ago <eob> and who created all the artwork <eol> of the Cave Church. <eob> I am really grateful to Mario. <eob>
He was the key of the project. <eob>
He managed to get me <eol> a meeting with Father Samaan, <eob> and surprisingly, he loved the idea. <eob>
He asked me about where I painted before <eob> and how I will make it happen. <eob>
And he was mainly concerned <eol> by what I was going to write. <eob>
In every work that I create, <eol> I write messages <eob> with my style <eol> of Arabic calligraphy. <eob>
I make sure those messages are relevant <eol> to the place where I am painting <eob> but have this universal dimension, <eob> so anybody around the world <eol> can relate to it. <eob>
So for Manshiyat Naser, <eob> I decided to write in Arabic the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria, <eob> a Coptic bishop <eol> from the third century, <eob> who said: (Arabic), <eob> which means in English, <eob> "Anyone who wants to see <eol> the sunlight clearly <eob> needs to wipe his eyes first." <eob>
It was really important for me <eob> that the community felt connected to the words. <eob>
And for me this quote was perfectly <eol> reflecting the spirit of the project. <eob>
So Father Samaan blessed the project, <eob> and his approval brought all the residents on board. <eob>
Hundreds of liters of paint, <eol> a dozen blue manual lifts, <eob> several trips back and forth to Cairo, <eob> a strong and solid team from France, <eol> North Africa, Middle East and the US, <eob> and after a year of planning <eol> and logistics, there we are, <eob> my team and some members from the local community <eob> creating a piece that will spread <eol> over 50 buildings, <eob> some filling up the space of the calligraphy <eob> that I trace with colors. <eob>
Here some blue, there some yellow, <eol> there some orange. <eob>
Some others carrying some sand bags <eob> and putting them <eol> on the top of the buildings <eob> to hold those manual lifts, <eob> and some others assembling and disassembling <eol> those same lifts <eob> and moving them around the different buildings. <eob>
At the beginning of the project, <eob> I numbered all those buildings <eol> on my sketch, <eob> and there was no real interaction <eol> with the community. <eob>
People didn ’ t get the point of all this. <eob>
But fast enough, those building <eol> numbers became family names. <eob>
The first building was the house <eol> of Uncle Ibrahim. <eob>
Uncle Ibrahim <eol> is such an enthusiastic person. <eob> He was always singing and making jokes, <eob> and his daughters and sons <eol> saved me from his bull <eob> who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Actually, the bull saw me <eol> from the window and came out on the balcony. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. <eob>
Uncle Ibrahim was always <eol> hanging out on the balcony <eob> and talking to me <eol> while I was painting. <eob>
I remember him saying that he didn ’ t go to the mountain for 10 years, <eob> and that he never takes a day off. <eob>
He said that if he stopped working, <eol> who will stop the garbage? <eob>
But surprisingly, at the end of the project, <eob> he came all the way <eol> to the mountain to look at the piece. <eob>
He was really proud to see his house painted, <eob> and he said that this project <eol> was a project of peace and -- <eob> sorry -- <eob>
He said that it was a project <eol> of peace and unity <eob> and that it brought people together. <eob>
So his perception towards the project changed, <eob> and my perception <eol> towards the community changed also, <eob> and towards what they do. <eob>
All the garbage that everybody <eol> is disgusted by is not theirs. <eob>
They just work out of it. <eob>
Actually, they don ’ t live in <eol> the garbage. They live from the garbage. <eob>
So I started doubting myself <eol> and wondering <eob> what was the real purpose <eol> of this whole project? <eob>
It was not about beautifying a place <eol> by bringing art to it. <eob> It was about switching perception <eol> and opening a dialogue <eob> on the connection that we have <eol> with communities that we don ’ t know. <eob>
So day after day, <eob> the calligraphy circle <eol> was taking shape, <eob> and we were always excited to go back <eol> on the mountain to look at the piece. <eob>
And standing exactly at this point <eol> every day made my realize <eob> the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece. <eob>
If you want to see <eol> the real image of somebody, <eob> maybe you should change your angle. <eob>
There was doubts and difficulties, <eob> like fears and stress. <eob>
It wasn't simple to work in such environments, <eob> sometimes having pigs under you while you paint <eob> or climbing a stack of garbage <eol> to reach a lift. <eob>
But we all got over the fear <eol> of the heights, the swinging lifts, <eob> the strength of the smell <eob> and also the stress of not finishing on time. <eob>
But the kindness of all those people <eol> made us forget everything. <eob>
The building number 3 <eol> was the house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda. <eob>
In Egyptian, they have this expression <eol> that says, "Ahsen Nas," <eob> which means "the best people." <eob> They were the best people. <eob> We used to take our break <eol> in front of their houses, <eob> and all the kids of the neighborhood <eob> used to join us. <eob>
I was impressed and amazed <eol> by the kids of Manshiyat Naser. <eob>
For the first few days, they were always <eol> refusing anything we were offering them, <eob> even a snack or a drink. <eob>
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?" <eob> And she told me they teach <eol> their kids to refuse anything <eob> from somebody that they don't know <eob> because maybe this person needs <eol> it more than they do. <eob>
So at this exact point I realized actually <eob> the Zaraeeb community <eol> was the ideal context <eob> to raise the topic of perception. <eob>
We need to question <eol> our level of misconception <eob> and judgment we can have as a society <eob> upon communities based on their differences. <eob>
I remember how we got delayed <eol> on Uncle Ibrahim's house <eob> when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop <eob> were eating the sand bags <eol> that hold the lifts. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The house of Uncle Bakheet <eol> and Aunty Fareeda <eob> was this kind of meeting point. <eob>
Everybody used to gather there. <eob>
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant <eob> when he said that was a project <eol> of peace and unity, <eob> because I really felt <eol> that people were coming together. <eob>
Everyone was greeting us with a smile, <eol> offering us a drink <eob> or inviting us into their own house for lunch. <eob>
Sometime, you are at <eol> the first level of a building, <eob> and somebody opens his window and offers <eol> you some tea. <eob>
And then the same thing <eol> happens on the second floor. <eob>
And you keep going all the way to the top. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I think I never drink as much tea <eol> as I did in Egypt. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And to be honest with you, <eol> we could have finished earlier, <eob> but I think it took us three weeks <eol> because of all those tea breaks. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In Egypt, they have another expression, <eol> which is "Nawartouna," <eob> which means, "You brought light to us." <eob> In Manshiyat Naser <eol> they were always telling us this. <eob>
The calligraphy, actually -- <eob> I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint <eol> for the calligraphy <eob> so at the end of the project, <eol> we rented some black light projectors <eob> and lit up the whole neighborhood, <eob> surprising everybody around. <eob>
We wanted to tell them <eob> that they are the ones <eol> who brought light to us. <eob>
The Zaraeeb community <eol> are strong, honest, hard workers, <eob> and they know their value. <eob>
The people of Cairo call them <eol> "the Zabaleen," <eob> which means "the people of the garbage," <eob> but ironically, the people <eol> of Manshiyat Naser <eob> call the people of Cairo <eol> the Zabaleen. <eob> They say, they are the ones <eol> who produce the garbage, not them. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The goal was to leave <eol> something to this community, <eob> but I feel that they are the ones <eol> who left something in our lives. <eob>
You know, the art project <eol> was just a pretext <eob> for this amazing human experience. <eob>
The art piece at some point <eol> will disappear, vanish, <eob> and actually there is somebody <eol> who is building a second floor <eob> in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house, <eob> so it's covering part of the painting, <eob> so I might need to go back <eol> and paint over it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was about the experience, <eob> about the story, <eob> about the moment. <eob>
From the streets of the neighborhood, <eob> the painting appears in fragments, <eob> isolated from one another, <eob> standing alone. <eob>
But connected with the sign of calligraphy <eob> that today reveals the powerful <eol> message that we should all think about <eob> before we want to judge somebody. <eob>
"Anyone who wants to see <eol> the sunlight clearly <eob> needs to wipe <eol> his eyes first." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hello, everybody. <eob> I brought with me today a baby diaper. <eob>
You'll see why in a second. <eob>
Baby diapers have interesting properties. <eob>
They can swell enormously when you <eol> add water to them, <eob> an experiment done by millions <eol> of kids every day. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But the reason why <eob> is that they're designed <eol> in a very clever way. <eob>
They're made out of a thing <eol> called a swellable material. <eob>
It's a special kind of material <eol> that, when you add water, <eob> it will swell up enormously, <eob> maybe a thousand times in volume. <eob>
And this is a very useful, industrial <eol> kind of polymer. <eob>
But what we're trying <eol> to do in my group at MIT <eob> is to figure out if we can do something <eol> similar to the brain. <eob>
Can we make it bigger, <eob> big enough that you can peer inside <eob> and see all the tiny building blocks, <eol> the biomolecules, <eob> how they're organized <eol> in three dimensions, <eob> the structure, the ground truth <eol> structure of the brain, if you will? <eob>
If we could get that, <eob> maybe we could have a better understanding <eol> of how the brain is organized <eob> to yield thoughts and emotions <eob> and actions and sensations. <eob>
Maybe we could try to pinpoint <eol> the exact changes in the brain <eob> that result in diseases, <eob> diseases like Alzheimer's <eol> and epilepsy and Parkinson's, <eob> for which there are few treatments, <eol> much less cures, <eob> and for which, very often, <eol> we don't know the cause or the origins <eob> and what's really causing them to occur. <eob>
Now, our group at MIT <eob> is trying to take a different point of view <eob> from the way neuroscience has been done <eol> over the last hundred years. <eob> We're designers. We're inventors. <eob> We're trying to figure out <eol> how to build technologies <eob> that let us look at and repair the brain. <eob>
And the reason is, <eob> the brain is incredibly, <eol> incredibly complicated. <eob>
So what we've learned over <eol> the first century of neuroscience <eob> is that the brain is a very complicated <eol> network, <eob> made out of very specialized cells called neurons <eob> with very complex geometries, <eob> and electrical currents <eol> will flow through these complexly shaped neurons. <eob>
Furthermore, neurons <eol> are connected in networks. <eob> They're connected by little junctions called synapses <eol> that exchange chemicals <eob> and allow the neurons to talk to each other. <eob>
The density of the brain is incredible. <eob>
In a cubic millimeter of your brain, <eob> there are about 100,000 of these neurons <eob> and maybe a billion of those connections. <eob>
But it's worse. <eob>
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron, <eob> and, of course, this is just our artist's rendition of it. <eob> What you would see are thousands <eol> and thousands of kinds of biomolecules, <eob> little nanoscale machines <eol> organized in complex, 3D patterns, <eob> and together they mediate those electrical pulses, <eob> those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together <eob> to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth. <eob>
Now, we don't know how the neurons <eol> in the brain are organized <eob> to form networks, <eob> and we don't know how the biomolecules are organized <eob> within neurons <eob> to form these complex, organized machines. <eob>
If we really want to understand this, <eob> we're going to need new technologies. <eob>
But if we could get such maps, <eob> if we could look at the organization <eol> of molecules and neurons <eob> and neurons and networks, <eob> maybe we could really understand <eol> how the brain conducts information <eob> from sensory regions, <eob> mixes it with emotion and feeling, <eob> and generates our decisions and actions. <eob>
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set <eol> of molecular changes that occur <eob> in a brain disorder. <eob>
And once we know how those molecules <eol> have changed, <eob> whether they've increased <eol> in number or changed in pattern, <eob> we could use those as targets <eol> for new drugs, <eob> for new ways of delivering energy into the brain <eob> in order to repair the brain computations <eol> that are afflicted <eob> in patients who suffer from brain disorders. <eob>
We've all seen lots of different <eol> technologies over the last century <eob> to try to confront this. <eob>
I think we've all seen brain scans <eob> taken using MRI machines. <eob>
These, of course, have the great power <eol> that they are noninvasive, <eob> they can be used on living human subjects. <eob>
But also, they're spatially crude. <eob>
Each of these blobs that you see, <eol> or voxels, as they're called, <eob> can contain millions and millions of neurons. <eob>
So it's not at the level of resolution <eob> where it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur <eob> or the changes in the wiring of these networks <eob> that contributes to our ability <eol> to be conscious and powerful beings. <eob>
At the other extreme, <eol> you have microscopes. <eob>
Microscopes, of course, <eol> will use light to look at little tiny things. <eob>
For centuries, they've been used <eol> to look at things like bacteria. <eob> For neuroscience, <eob> microscopes are <eol> actually how neurons were discovered in the first place, <eob> about 130 years ago. <eob>
But light is fundamentally limited. <eob>
You can't see individual molecules <eol> with a regular old microscope. <eob>
You can't look at these tiny connections. <eob>
So if we want to make our ability <eol> to see the brain more powerful, <eob> to get down to the ground truth structure, <eob> we're going to need to have <eol> even better technologies. <eob>
My group, a couple years ago, <eol> started thinking: <eob> Why don't we do the opposite? <eob>
If it's so darn complicated <eol> to zoom in to the brain, <eob> why can't we make the brain bigger? <eob>
It initially started <eob> with two grad students in my group, <eol> Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg. <eob>
Now many others in my group <eol> are helping with this process. <eob>
We decided to try to figure out <eol> if we could take polymers, <eob> like the stuff in the baby diaper, <eob> and install it physically <eol> within the brain. <eob>
If we could do it just right, <eol> and you add water, <eob> you can potentially blow the brain up <eob> to where you could distinguish those <eol> tiny biomolecules from each other. <eob>
You would see those connections <eol> and get maps of the brain. <eob>
This could potentially be quite dramatic. <eob>
We brought a little demo here. <eob>
We got some purified baby diaper material. <eob>
It's much easier just <eol> to buy it off the Internet <eob> than to extract the few grains <eol> that actually occur in these diapers. <eob>
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here <eob> of this purified polymer. <eob>
And here we have some water. <eob>
What we're going to do <eob> is see if this teaspoon <eol> of the baby diaper material <eob> can increase in size. <eob>
You're going to see it increase <eol> in volume by about a thousandfold <eob> before your very eyes. <eob>
I could pour much more of this in there, <eob> but I think you've got the idea <eob> that this is a very, very interesting molecule, <eob> and if can use it in the right way, <eob> we might be able to really zoom in on the brain <eob> in a way that you can't do <eol> with past technologies. <eob>
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now. <eob>
What's going on <eol> in the baby diaper polymer? <eob>
If you could zoom in, <eob> it might look something <eol> like what you see on the screen. <eob>
Polymers are chains of atoms <eol> arranged in long, thin lines. <eob>
The chains are very tiny, <eob> about the width of a biomolecule, <eob> and these polymers are really dense. <eob>
They're separated by distances <eob> that are around the size of a biomolecule. <eob>
This is very good <eob> because we could potentially move everything <eol> apart in the brain. <eob>
If we add water, what will happen is, <eob> this swellable material <eol> is going to absorb the water, <eob> the polymer chains <eol> will move apart from each other, <eob> and the entire material is going <eol> to become bigger. <eob>
And because these chains are so tiny <eob> and spaced by biomolecular distances, <eob> we could potentially blow up the brain <eob> and make it big enough to see. <eob>
Here's the mystery, then: <eob> How do we actually make <eol> these polymer chains inside the brain <eob> so we can move all the biomolecules apart? <eob>
If we could do that, <eob> maybe we could get ground truth <eol> maps of the brain. <eob>
We could look at the wiring. <eob>
We can peer inside and see <eol> the molecules within. <eob>
To explain this, we made some animations <eob> where we actually look at, <eol> in these artist renderings, <eob> what biomolecules might look like <eol> and how we might separate them. <eob>
Step one: what we'd have to do, first of all, <eob> is attach every biomolecule, <eol> shown in brown here, <eob> to a little anchor, a little handle. <eob>
We need to pull the molecules <eol> of the brain apart from each other, <eob> and to do that, we need to have <eol> a little handle <eob> that allows those polymers <eol> to bind to them <eob> and to exert their force. <eob>
Now, if you just take baby diaper <eol> polymer and dump it on the brain, <eob> obviously, it's going <eol> to sit there on top. <eob>
So we need to find a way <eol> to make the polymers inside. <eob>
And this is where <eol> we're really lucky. <eob> It turns out, you <eol> can get the building blocks, <eob> monomers, as they're called, <eob> and if you let them go into the brain <eob> and then trigger <eol> the chemical reactions, <eob> you can get them to form <eol> those long chains, <eob> right there inside the brain tissue. <eob>
They're going to wind their way <eol> around biomolecules <eob> and between biomolecules, <eob> forming those complex webs <eob> that will allow you, eventually, <eol> to pull apart the molecules <eob> from each other. <eob>
And every time one <eol> of those little handles is around, <eob> the polymer will bind <eol> to the handle, and that's exactly what we need <eob> in order to pull the molecules apart <eob> from each other. <eob>
All right, the moment of truth. <eob>
We have to treat this specimen <eob> with a chemical to kind of loosen up <eol> all the molecules from each other, <eob> and then, when we add water, <eob> that swellable material is going <eol> to start absorbing the water, <eob> the polymer chains <eol> will move apart, <eob> but now, the biomolecules will come along <eol> for the ride. <eob>
And much like drawing a picture <eol> on a balloon, <eob> and then you blow up the balloon, <eob> the image is the same, <eob> but the ink particles <eol> have moved away <eob> from each other. <eob>
And that's what we've been able to do now, <eol> but in three dimensions. <eob>
There's one last trick. <eob>
As you can see here, <eob> we've color-coded <eol> all the biomolecules brown. <eob> That's because they all kind <eol> of look the same. <eob>
Biomolecules are made out <eol> of the same atoms, <eob> but just in different orders. <eob>
So we need one last thing <eob> in order to make them visible. <eob>
We have to bring in little tags, <eob> with glowing dyes that <eol> will distinguish them. <eob>
So one kind of biomolecule <eol> might get a blue color. <eob>
Another kind of biomolecule <eol> might get a red color. <eob> And so forth. <eob> And that's the final step. <eob>
Now we can look at something like a brain <eob> and look at the individual molecules, <eob> because we've moved them far apart enough <eob> from each other <eob> that we can tell them apart. <eob>
So the hope here is that <eol> we can make the invisible visible. <eob>
We can turn things that might <eol> seem small and obscure <eob> and blow them up <eob> until they're like constellations <eol> of information about life. <eob>
Here's an actual video <eol> of what it might look like. <eob>
We have here a little brain in a dish -- <eob> a little piece of a brain, actually. <eob>
We've infused the polymer in, <eob> and now we're adding water. <eob>
What you'll see is that, right <eol> before your eyes -- <eob> this video is sped up about sixtyfold -- <eob> this little piece of brain tissue <eol> is going to grow. <eob>
It can increase by a hundredfold <eol> or even more in volume. <eob>
And the cool part is, <eol> because those polymers are so tiny, <eob> we're separating biomolecules evenly <eob> from each other. <eob>
It's a smooth expansion. <eob>
We're not losing the configuration <eol> of the information. <eob>
We're just making it easier to see. <eob>
So now we can take actual brain circuitry -- <eob> here's a piece of the brain involved <eol> with, for example, memory -- <eob> and we can zoom in. <eob>
We can start to actually look <eol> at how circuits are configured. <eob>
Maybe someday we could read out a memory. <eob>
Maybe we could actually look at <eol> how circuits are configured <eob> to process emotions, <eob> how the actual wiring of our brain <eol> is organized <eob> in order to make us <eol> who we are. <eob>
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully, <eob> the actual problems in the brain <eol> at a molecular level. <eob>
What if we could actually look into cells in the brain <eob> and figure out, wow, here are the 17 molecules <eol> that have altered <eob> in this brain tissue that has been <eol> undergoing epilepsy <eob> or changing in Parkinson's disease <eob> or otherwise being altered? <eob>
If we get that systematic list of things <eol> that are going wrong, <eob> those become our therapeutic targets. <eob> We can build drugs that bind those. <eob> We can maybe aim energy at different <eol> parts of the brain <eob> in order to help people <eol> with Parkinson's or epilepsy <eob> or other conditions that affect over a billion people <eob> around the world. <eob>
Now, something interesting <eol> has been happening. <eob> It turns out that throughout biomedicine, <eob> there are other problems that expansion <eol> might help with. <eob>
This is an actual biopsy <eol> from a human breast cancer patient. <eob>
It turns out that if you look at cancers, <eob> if you look at the immune system, <eob> if you look at aging, <eol> if you look at development -- <eob> all these processes are involving <eol> large-scale biological systems. <eob> But of course, the problems begin <eol> with those little nanoscale molecules, <eob> the machines that make the cells and the organs <eol> in our body tick. <eob>
So what we're trying to do now <eol> is to figure out <eob> if we can actually use this technology <eol> to map the building blocks of life <eob> in a wide variety of diseases. <eob>
Can we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor <eob> so that we can actually go after it <eol> in a smart way <eob> and deliver drugs that might wipe <eol> out exactly the cells that we want to? <eob>
You know, a lot of medicine <eol> is very high risk. <eob>
Sometimes, it's even guesswork. <eob>
My hope is we can actually turn <eol> what might be a high-risk moon shot <eob> into something that's more reliable. <eob>
If you think about the original moon shot, <eob> where they actually landed on the moon, <eob> it was based on solid science. <eob>
We understood gravity; <eob> we understood aerodynamics. <eob> We knew how to build rockets. <eob>
The science risk was under control. <eob> It was still a great, great feat <eol> of engineering. <eob>
But in medicine, we don't necessarily <eol> have all the laws. <eob>
Do we have all the laws <eol> that are analogous to gravity, <eob> that are analogous <eol> to aerodynamics? <eob>
I would argue that with technologies <eob> like the kinds I'm talking about today, <eob> maybe we can actually derive those. <eob>
We can map the patterns <eol> that occur in living systems, <eob> and figure out how to overcome <eol> the diseases that plague us. <eob>
You know, my wife <eol> and I have two young kids, <eob> and one of my hopes as a bioengineer <eol> is to make life better for them <eob> than it currently is for us. <eob>
And my hope is, <eol> if we can turn biology and medicine <eob> from these high-risk endeavors <eol> that are governed by chance and luck, <eob> and make them things that we win <eol> by skill and hard work, <eob> then that would be a great advance. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine you're walking through a forest. <eob>
I'm guessing you're thinking <eol> of a collection of trees, <eob> what we foresters call a stand, <eob> with their rugged stems <eol> and their beautiful crowns. <eob>
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests, <eob> but a forest is much more than what you see, <eob> and today I want to change the way <eol> you think about forests. <eob>
You see, underground there is this other world, <eob> a world of infinite biological pathways <eob> that connect trees and allow them to communicate <eob> and allow the forest to behave <eol> as though it's a single organism. <eob>
It might remind you <eol> of a sort of intelligence. <eob>
How do I know this? <eob> Here's my story. <eob> I grew up in the forests <eol> of British Columbia. <eob>
I used to lay on the forest floor <eol> and stare up at the tree crowns. <eob> They were giants. <eob> My grandfather was a giant, too. <eob>
He was a horse logger, <eob> and he used to selectively cut cedar poles <eol> from the inland rainforest. <eob>
Grandpa taught me about the quiet <eol> and cohesive ways of the woods, <eob> and how my family was knit into it. <eob>
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps. <eob>
He and I had this curiosity about forests, <eob> and my first big "aha" moment <eob> was at the outhouse by our lake. <eob>
Our poor dog Jigs had slipped <eol> and fallen into the pit. <eob>
So grandpa ran up with his shovel <eol> to rescue the poor dog. <eob>
He was down there, swimming in the muck. <eob>
But as grandpa dug through <eol> that forest floor, <eob> I became fascinated with the roots, <eob> and under that, what I learned later <eol> was the white mycelium <eob> and under that the red and yellow <eol> mineral horizons. <eob>
Eventually, grandpa <eol> and I rescued the poor dog, <eob> but it was at that moment that I realized <eob> that that palette of roots and soil <eob> was really the foundation <eol> of the forest. <eob>
And I wanted to know more. <eob>
So I studied forestry. <eob>
But soon I found myself working alongside <eol> the powerful people <eob> in charge of the commercial harvest. <eob>
The extent of the clear-cutting <eob> was alarming, <eob> and I soon found myself conflicted <eol> by my part in it. <eob>
Not only that, the spraying <eol> and hacking of the aspens and birches <eob> to make way for the more commercially <eol> valuable planted pines and firs <eob> was astounding. <eob>
It seemed that nothing <eol> could stop this relentless industrial machine. <eob>
So I went back to school, <eob> and I studied my other world. <eob>
You see, scientists had just discovered <eol> in the laboratory in vitro <eob> that one pine seedling root <eob> could transmit carbon to another <eol> pine seedling root. <eob>
But this was in the laboratory, <eob> and I wondered, could this happen <eol> in real forests? <eob> I thought yes. <eob> Trees in real forests might also <eol> share information below ground. <eob>
But this was really controversial, <eob> and some people thought <eol> I was crazy, <eob> and I had a really hard time <eol> getting research funding. <eob>
But I persevered, <eob> and I eventually conducted <eol> some experiments deep in the forest, <eob> 25 years ago. <eob>
I grew 80 replicates <eol> of three species: <eob> paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar. <eob>
I figured the birch and the fir would be <eol> connected in a belowground web, <eob> but not the cedar. <eob>
It was in its own other world. <eob>
And I gathered my apparatus, <eob> and I had no money, so <eol> I had to do it on the cheap. <eob>
So I went to Canadian Tire -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and I bought some plastic bags <eol> and duct tape and shade cloth, <eob> a timer, a paper suit, a respirator. <eob>
And then I borrowed some high-tech stuff <eol> from my university: <eob> a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, <eol> a mass spectrometer, microscopes. <eob>
And then I got some <eol> really dangerous stuff: <eob> syringes full of radioactive <eol> carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas <eob> and some high pressure bottles <eob> of the stable isotope <eol> carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas. <eob>
But I was legally permitted. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh, and I forgot some stuff, <eob> important stuff: the bug spray, <eob> the bear spray, the filters <eol> for my respirator. <eob> Oh well. <eob>
The first day of the experiment, <eol> we got out to our plot <eob> and a grizzly bear <eol> and her cub chased us off. <eob>
And I had no bear spray. <eob>
But you know, this is how forest research <eol> in Canada goes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I came back the next day, <eob> and mama grizzly and her cub were gone. <eob>
So this time, we really got started, <eob> and I pulled on my white paper suit, <eob> I put on my respirator, <eob> and then <eob> I put the plastic bags over my trees. <eob>
I got my giant syringes, <eob> and I injected the bags <eob> with my tracer isotope <eol> carbon dioxide gases, <eob> first the birch. <eob>
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas, <eob> into the bag of birch. <eob>
And then for fir, <eob> I injected the stable isotope <eol> carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas. <eob>
I used two isotopes, <eob> because I was wondering <eob> whether there was two-way communication <eol> going on between these species. <eob>
I got to the final bag, <eob> the 80th replicate, <eob> and all of a sudden mama grizzly <eol> showed up again. <eob>
And she started to chase me, <eob> and I had my syringes above my head, <eob> and I was swatting the mosquitos, <eol> and I jumped into the truck, <eob> and I thought, <eob> "This is why people do lab studies." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I waited an hour. <eob> I figured it would take this long <eob> for the trees to suck up the CO2 <eol> through photosynthesis, <eob> turn it into sugars, <eol> send it down into their roots, <eob> and maybe, I hypothesized, <eob> shuttle that carbon belowground <eol> to their neighbors. <eob>
After the hour was up, <eob> I rolled down my window, <eob> and I checked for mama grizzly. <eob>
Oh good, she's over there <eol> eating her huckleberries. <eob>
So I got out of the truck <eol> and I got to work. <eob>
I went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off. <eob>
I ran my Geiger counter <eol> over its leaves. <eob> Kkhh! <eob> Perfect. <eob> The birch had taken up the radioactive gas. <eob>
Then the moment of truth. <eob>
I went over to the fir tree. <eob>
I pulled off its bag. <eob>
Kkhh! <eob> I ran the Geiger counter <eol> up its needles, <eob> and I heard the most beautiful sound. <eob> It was the sound of birch talking to fir, <eob> and birch was saying, "Hey, can I help you?" <eob> And fir was saying, "Yeah, can you send me <eol> some of your carbon? <eob>
Because somebody threw a shade cloth over me." <eob> I went up to cedar, and I ran <eol> the Geiger counter over its leaves, <eob> and as I suspected, <eob> silence. <eob>
Cedar was in its own world. <eob>
It was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir. <eob>
I was so excited, <eob> I ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates. <eob>
The evidence was clear. <eob>
The C-13 and C-14 <eol> was showing me <eob> that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation. <eob>
It turns out at that time of the year, <eob> in the summer, <eob> that birch was sending more carbon <eob> to fir than fir <eol> was sending back to birch, <eob> especially when the fir <eol> was shaded. <eob>
And then in later experiments, <eol> we found the opposite, <eob> that fir <eob> was sending more carbon <eol> to birch than birch was sending to fir, <eob> and this was because the fir <eol> was still growing while the birch was leafless. <eob>
So it turns out the two species <eol> were interdependent, <eob> like yin and yang. <eob>
And at that moment, everything <eol> came into focus for me. <eob>
I knew I had found something big, <eob> something that would change the way <eol> we look at how trees interact in forests, <eob> from not just competitors <eob> but to cooperators. <eob>
And I had found solid evidence <eob> of this massive belowground <eol> communications network, <eob> the other world. <eob>
Now, I truly hoped and believed <eob> that my discovery <eol> would change how we practice forestry, <eob> from clear-cutting and herbiciding <eob> to more holistic and sustainable methods, <eob> methods that were less expensive <eol> and more practical. <eob> What was I thinking? <eob> I'll come back to that. <eob>
So how do we do science <eol> in complex systems like forests? <eob>
Well, as forest scientists, we have <eol> to do our research in the forests, <eob> and that's really tough, <eol> as I've shown you. <eob>
And we have to be really good <eol> at running from bears. <eob>
But mostly, we have to persevere <eob> in spite of all the stuff <eol> stacked against us. <eob>
And we have to follow our intuition <eol> and our experiences <eob> and ask really good questions. <eob>
And then we've got to gather our data <eob> and then <eob> go verify. <eob>
For me, I've conducted <eol> and published hundreds of experiments in the forest. <eob>
Some of my oldest experimental plantations <eol> are now over 30 years old. <eob> You can check them out. <eob> That's how forest science works. <eob>
So now I want to talk about the science. <eob>
How were paper birch and Douglas <eol> fir communicating? <eob>
Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon <eob> but also nitrogen and phosphorus <eob> and water and defense signals <eol> and allele chemicals and hormones -- <eob> information. <eob>
And you know, I have to tell you, <eol> before me, scientists had thought <eob> that this belowground mutualistic <eol> symbiosis called a mycorrhiza <eob> was involved. <eob>
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root." <eob> You see their reproductive organs <eol> when you walk through the forest. <eob>
They're the mushrooms. <eob>
The mushrooms, though, <eol> are just the tip of the iceberg, <eob> because coming out of those stems <eol> are fungal threads that form a mycelium, <eob> and that mycelium infects <eol> and colonizes the roots <eob> of all the trees and plants. <eob>
And where the fungal cells <eol> interact with the root cells, <eob> there's a trade of carbon <eol> for nutrients, <eob> and that fungus gets those nutrients <eol> by growing through the soil <eob> and coating every soil particle. <eob>
The web is so dense that there can be <eol> hundreds of kilometers of mycelium <eob> under a single footstep. <eob>
And not only that, that mycelium <eol> connects different individuals in the forest, <eob> individuals not only of the same species <eol> but between species, like birch and fir, <eob> and it works kind of like the Internet. <eob>
You see, like all networks, <eob> mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links. <eob>
We made this map by examining <eol> the short sequences of DNA <eob> of every tree and every fungal <eol> individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest. <eob>
In this picture, the circles <eol> represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes, <eob> and the lines represent the interlinking <eol> fungal highways, or the links. <eob>
The biggest, darkest nodes <eol> are the busiest nodes. <eob>
We call those hub trees, <eob> or more fondly, mother trees, <eob> because it turns out <eol> that those hub trees nurture their young, <eob> the ones growing in the understory. <eob>
And if you can see <eol> those yellow dots, <eob> those are the young seedlings <eol> that have established within the network <eob> of the old mother trees. <eob>
In a single forest, a mother tree <eol> can be connected to hundreds of other trees. <eob>
And using our isotope tracers, <eob> we have found that mother trees <eob> will send their excess carbon through <eol> the mycorrhizal network <eob> to the understory seedlings, <eob> and we've associated this <eol> with increased seedling survival <eob> by four times. <eob>
Now, we know we all favor <eol> our own children, <eob> and I wondered, could Douglas <eol> fir recognize its own kin, <eob> like mama grizzly and her cub? <eob>
So we set about an experiment, <eob> and we grew mother trees <eol> with kin and stranger's seedlings. <eob>
And it turns out <eol> they do recognize their kin. <eob>
Mother trees colonize their kin <eol> with bigger mycorrhizal networks. <eob>
They send them more carbon below ground. <eob>
They even reduce their own root competition <eob> to make elbow room for their kids. <eob>
When mother trees are injured or dying, <eob> they also send messages of wisdom <eol> on to the next generation of seedlings. <eob>
So we've used isotope tracing <eob> to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree <eob> down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network <eob> and into her neighboring seedlings, <eob> not only carbon but also defense signals. <eob>
And these two compounds <eob> have increased the resistance <eol> of those seedlings to future stresses. <eob> So trees talk. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Through back and forth conversations, <eob> they increase the resilience <eol> of the whole community. <eob>
It probably reminds you <eol> of our own social communities, <eob> and our families, <eob> well, at least some families. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So let's come back <eol> to the initial point. <eob> Forests aren't simply collections of trees, <eob> they're complex systems with hubs and networks <eob> that overlap and connect trees <eol> and allow them to communicate, <eob> and they provide avenues <eol> for feedbacks and adaptation, <eob> and this makes the forest resilient. <eob> That's because there are many hub trees <eol> and many overlapping networks. <eob>
But they're also vulnerable, <eob> vulnerable not only to natural disturbances <eob> like bark beetles <eol> that preferentially attack big old trees <eob> but high-grade logging <eol> and clear-cut logging. <eob>
You see, you can take out <eol> one or two hub trees, <eob> but there comes a tipping point, <eob> because hub trees are not unlike <eol> rivets in an airplane. <eob> You can take out one or two and the plane <eol> still flies, <eob> but you take out one too many, <eob> or maybe that one holding on the wings, <eob> and the whole system collapses. <eob>
So now how are you thinking <eol> about forests? Differently? <eob>
(Audience) Yes. <eob>
Cool. <eob> I'm glad. <eob>
So, remember I said earlier <eol> that I hoped that my research, <eob> my discoveries would change <eol> the way we practice forestry. <eob>
Well, I want to take a check on that 30 years <eol> later here in western Canada. <eob>
This is about 100 kilometers <eol> to the west of us, <eob> just on the border of Banff National Park. <eob>
That's a lot of clear-cuts. <eob>
It's not so pristine. <eob>
In 2014, the World Resources Institute <eol> reported that Canada in the past decade <eob> has had the highest forest disturbance <eol> rate of any country worldwide, <eob> and I bet you thought it was Brazil. <eob>
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year. <eob>
Now, by my estimation, that's about four times <eol> the rate that is sustainable. <eob>
Now, massive disturbance at this scale <eol> is known to affect hydrological cycles, <eob> degrade wildlife habitat, <eob> and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere, <eob> which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks. <eob>
Not only that, we're continuing <eol> to plant one or two species <eob> and weed out the aspens and birches. <eob>
These simplified forests lack complexity, <eob> and they're really vulnerable <eol> to infections and bugs. <eob>
And as climate changes, <eob> this is creating a perfect storm <eob> for extreme events, <eol> like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak <eob> that just swept across North America, <eob> or that megafire in the last couple <eol> months in Alberta. <eob>
So I want to come back <eol> to my final question: <eob> instead of weakening our forests, <eob> how can we reinforce them <eol> and help them deal with climate change? <eob>
Well, you know, the great thing <eol> about forests as complex systems <eob> is they have enormous capacity <eol> to self-heal. <eob>
In our recent experiments, <eob> we found with patch-cutting <eol> and retention of hub trees <eob> and regeneration to a diversity <eol> of species and genes and genotypes <eob> that these mycorrhizal networks, <eol> they recover really rapidly. <eob>
So with this in mind, I want to leave you <eol> with four simple solutions. <eob>
And we can't kid ourselves <eol> that these are too complicated to act on. <eob>
First, we all need <eol> to get out in the forest. <eob>
We need to reestablish local involvement <eol> in our own forests. <eob>
You see, most of our forests now <eob> are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach, <eob> but good forest stewardship requires knowledge <eol> of local conditions. <eob>
Second, we need to save <eol> our old-growth forests. <eob>
These are the repositories of genes <eol> and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks. <eob>
So this means less cutting. <eob>
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting. <eob>
And third, when we do cut, <eob> we need to save the legacies, <eob> the mother trees and networks, <eob> and the wood, the genes, <eob> so they can pass their wisdom <eol> onto the next generation of trees <eob> so they can withstand the future stresses <eol> coming down the road. <eob>
We need to be conservationists. <eob>
And finally, fourthly and finally, <eob> we need to regenerate <eol> our forests with a diversity of species <eob> and genotypes and structures <eob> by planting and allowing natural regeneration. <eob>
We have to give Mother Nature the tools <eol> she needs <eob> to use her intelligence <eol> to self-heal. <eob>
And we need to remember that forests <eol> aren't just a bunch of trees <eob> competing with each other, <eob> they're supercooperators. <eob>
So back to Jigs. <eob> Jigs's fall into the outhouse <eol> showed me this other world, <eob> and it changed my view of forests. <eob>
I hope today to have changed <eol> how you think about forests. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The narrative of a rising Africa <eol> is being challenged. <eob>
About 10 years ago, <eol> I spoke about an Africa, <eob> an Africa of hope and opportunity, <eob> an Africa of entrepreneurs, <eob> an Africa very different from the Africa <eol> that you normally hear about <eob> of death, poverty and disease. <eob>
And that what I spoke about, <eob> became part of what is known <eol> now as the narrative of the rising Africa. <eob>
I want to tell you two stories <eol> about this rising Africa. <eob>
The first has to do with Rwanda, <eob> a country that has gone <eol> through many trials and tribulations. <eob>
And Rwanda has decided to become the technology <eol> hub, or a technology hub <eob> on the continent. <eob>
It's a country with mountainous <eol> and hilly terrain, <eob> a little bit like here, <eob> so it's very difficult <eol> to deliver services to people. <eob>
So what has Rwanda said? <eob>
In order to save lives, it's going <eol> to try using drones <eob> to deliver lifesaving drugs, <eol> vaccines and blood <eob> to people in hard-to-reach places <eob> in partnership with a company called Zipline, <eob> with UPS, and also with the Gavi, <eol> a global vaccine alliance. <eob>
In doing this, it will save lives. <eob>
This is part of the type of innovation <eol> we want to see in the rising Africa. <eob>
The second story has to do with something <eob> that I'm sure most of you <eol> have seen or will remember. <eob>
Very often, countries <eol> in Africa suffer drought and floods, <eob> and it's getting more frequent because of climate change effects. <eob>
When this happens, they normally wait <eol> for international appeals to raise money. <eob>
You see pictures of children <eol> with flies on their faces, <eob> carcasses of dead animals and so on. <eob> Now these countries, 32 countries, came together <eob> under the auspices <eol> of the African Union <eob> and decided to form an organization <eol> called the African Risk Capacity. <eob>
What does it do? <eob>
It's a weather-based insurance agency, <eob> and what these countries do <eol> is to pay insurance each year, <eob> about 3 million dollars a year <eol> of their own resources, <eob> so that in the event they have <eol> a difficult drought situation or flood, <eob> this money will be paid out to them, <eob> which they can then use to take care <eol> of their populations, <eob> instead of waiting for aid to come. <eob>
The African Risk Capacity <eol> last year paid 26 million dollars <eob> to Mauritania, <eol> Senegal and Niger. <eob>
This enabled them to take care of 1.3 million people <eol> affected by drought. <eob>
They were able to restore livelihoods, <eob> buy fodder for cattle, <eol> feed children in school <eob> and in short keep the populations home <eol> instead of migrating out of the area. <eob>
So these are the kinds of stories <eob> of an Africa ready to take <eol> responsibility for itself, <eob> and to look for solutions <eol> for its own problems. <eob>
But that narrative is being challenged now <eob> because the continent has not been <eol> doing well in the last two years. <eob>
It had been growing at five percent per annum <eob> for the last one and a half decades, <eob> but this year's forecast was <eol> three percent. Why? <eob> In an uncertain global environment, commodity <eol> prices have fallen. <eob>
Many of the economies are still <eol> commodity driven, <eob> and therefore their performance has slipped. <eob>
And now the issue of Brexit <eol> doesn't make it any easier. <eob>
I never knew that the Brexit could happen <eob> and that it could be one of the things <eol> that would cause global uncertainty <eob> such as we have. <eob>
So now we've got this situation, <eob> and I think it's time <eol> to take stock <eob> and to say what were the things <eol> that the African countries did right? <eob>
What did they do wrong? <eob>
How do we build on all of this <eol> and learn lessons <eob> so that we can keep Africa rising? <eob>
So let me talk about six things <eol> that I think we did right. <eob>
The first is managing <eol> our economies better. <eob>
The '80s and '90s were the lost <eol> decades, when Africa was not doing well, <eob> and some of you will remember <eol> an "Economist" cover <eob> that said, "The Lost Continent." <eob> But in the 2000s, policymakers learned <eob> that they needed to manage <eol> the macroeconomic environment better, <eob> to ensure stability, <eob> keep inflation low in single digits, <eob> keep their fiscal deficits low, below three percent of GDP, <eob> give investors, both domestic and foreign, <eob> some stability so they'll have confidence to invest in these economies. <eob>
So that was number one. <eob>
Two, debt. <eob> In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio <eol> of African countries was 130 percent, <eob> and they didn't have fiscal space. <eob>
They couldn't use their resources <eol> to invest in their development <eob> because they were paying debt. <eob>
There may be some of you in this room <eol> who worked to support African countries <eob> to get debt relief. <eob>
So private creditors, multilaterals <eol> and bilaterals came together <eob> and decided to do the Highly Indebted <eol> Poor Countries Initiative <eob> and give debt relief. <eob>
So this debt relief in 2005 <eob> made the debt-to-GDP ratio fall down to about 30 percent, <eob> and there was enough resources <eol> to try and reinvest. <eob>
The third thing was loss <eol>-making enterprises. <eob>
Governments were involved in business <eob> which they had no business being in. <eob>
And they were running businesses, <eol> they were making losses. <eob>
So some of these enterprises were restructured, <eob> commercialized, privatized or closed, <eob> and they became less of a burden <eol> on government. <eob>
The fourth thing <eol> was a very interesting thing. <eob>
The telecoms revolution came, <eob> and African countries jumped on it. <eob>
In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines. <eob>
Today, we have about 687 million <eol> mobile lines <eob> on the continent. <eob>
And this has enabled us <eob> to go, move forward <eol> with some mobile technology <eob> where Africa is actually leading. <eob>
In Kenya, the development of mobile money -- <eob> M-Pesa, which all of you have heard about -- <eob> it took some time for the world <eol> to notice that Africa was ahead <eob> in this particular technology. <eob> And this mobile money <eol> is also providing a platform <eob> for access to alternative energy. <eob>
You know, people who can now <eol> pay for solar <eob> the same way they pay for cards <eol> for their telephone. <eob>
So this was a very good development, <eol> something that went right. <eob>
We also invested more in education <eol> and health, not enough, <eob> but there were some improvements. <eob>
250 million children were immunized <eol> in the last one and a half decades. <eob>
The other thing was <eol> that conflicts decreased. <eob>
There were many conflicts <eob> on the continent. <eob>
Many of you are aware of that. <eob>
But they came down, and our leaders <eol> even managed to dampen some coups. <eob>
New types of conflicts have emerged, <eol> and I'll refer to those later. <eob>
So based on all this, <eol> there's also some differentiation <eob> on the continent <eob> that I want you to know about, <eob> because even as the doom <eol> and gloom is here, <eob> there are some countries — Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia, <eob> Tanzania and Senegal are performing <eol> relatively well at the moment. <eob>
But what did we do wrong? <eob>
Let me mention eight things. <eob>
You have to have more things <eol> wrong than right. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So there are eight things we did wrong. <eob>
The first was that even though we grew, <eol> we didn't create enough jobs. <eob>
We didn't create jobs for our youth. <eob>
Youth unemployment <eob> on the continent <eob> is about 15 percent, <eob> and underemployment is a serious problem. <eob>
The second thing that we did <eol> is that the quality of growth was not good enough. <eob>
Even those jobs we created <eol> were low-productivity jobs, <eob> so we moved people from low-productivity agriculture <eob> to low-productivity commerce and working <eol> in the informal sector <eob> in the urban areas. <eob>
The third thing is <eol> that inequality increased. <eob>
So we created more billionaires. <eob>
50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars <eob> own more wealth than the bottom <eol> 75 million people <eob> on the continent. <eob>
Poverty, <eob> the proportion of people in poverty -- <eol> that's the fourth thing -- did decrease, <eob> but the absolute numbers did not because <eol> of population growth. <eob>
And population growth is something <eob> that we don't have enough <eol> of a dialogue about <eob> on the continent. <eob>
And I think we will need <eol> to get a handle on it, <eob> particularly how we educate girls. <eob>
That is the road to really working <eol> on this particular issue. <eob>
The fifth thing is that <eol> we didn't invest enough in infrastructure. <eob>
We had investment from the Chinese. <eob>
That helped some countries, <eol> but it's not enough. <eob>
The consumption of electricity <eol> in Africa <eob> on the continent <eob> in Sub-Saharan Africa <eol> is equivalent to Spain. <eob>
The total consumption <eol> is equivalent to that of Spain. <eob>
So many people are living in the dark, <eob> and as the President of the African <eol> Development Bank said recently, <eob> Africa cannot develop in the dark. <eob>
The other thing we have not done <eob> is that our economies retain <eol> the same structure <eob> that we've had for decades. <eob>
So even though we've been growing, <eob> the structure of the economies <eol> has not changed very much. <eob>
We are still exporting commodities, <eob> and exporting commodities is what? <eob>
It's exporting jobs. <eob>
Our manufacturing value-added <eol> is only 11 percent. <eob>
We are not creating enough decent manufacturing <eol> jobs for our youth, <eob> and trade among ourselves is low. <eob>
Only about 12 percent of our trade <eol> is among ourselves. <eob>
So that's another serious problem. <eob>
Then governance. <eob> Governance is a serious issue. <eob>
We have weak institutions, <eob> and sometimes nonexistent institutions, <eol> and I think this gives way for corruption. <eob>
Corruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten <eol> a good enough handle on, <eob> and we have to fight tooth and nail, <eob> that and increased transparency <eol> in the way we manage our economies <eob> and the way we manage our finances. <eob>
We also need to be wary of new conflicts, <eob> new types of conflicts, <eob> such as we have <eob> with Boko Haram in my country, Nigeria, <eob> and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya. <eob>
We need to partner <eol> with international partners, <eob> developed countries, to fight this together. <eob>
Otherwise, we create a new reality <eob> which is not the type <eol> we want for a rising Africa. <eob>
And finally, the issue of education. <eob>
Our education systems in many countries <eol> are broken. <eob>
We are not creating the types of skills <eol> needed for the future. <eob>
So we have to find a way <eol> to educate better. <eob>
So those are the things <eol> that we are not doing right. <eob>
Now, where do we go from there? <eob>
I believe that the way forward <eol> is to learn to manage success. <eob>
Very often, when people succeed <eol> or countries succeed, <eob> they forget what made them succeed. <eob>
Learning what you're successful at, <eob> managing it and keeping it <eol> is vital for us. <eob>
So all those things <eol> I said we did right, <eob> we have to learn to do it right again, <eol> keep doing it right. <eob>
Managing the economy <eol> while creating stability is vital, <eob> getting prices right, <eol> and policy consistency. <eob>
Very often, we are not consistent. <eob>
One regime goes out, another comes in <eob> and they throw away even the functioning policies <eol> that were there before. <eob>
What does this do? <eob>
It creates uncertainty for people, <eol> for households, <eob> uncertainties for business. <eob>
They don't know whether and how to invest. <eob>
Debt: we must manage the success <eol> we had in reducing our debt, <eob> but now countries are back <eol> to borrowing again, <eob> and we see our debt-to-GDP ratio beginning to creep up, <eob> and in certain countries, <eob> debt is becoming a problem, so we have to avoid that. <eob> So managing success. <eob>
The next thing is focusing <eol> with a laser beam <eob> on those things we did not do well. <eob>
First and foremost is infrastructure. <eob>
Yes, most countries now recognize <eol> they have to invest in this, <eob> and they are trying to do <eol> the best they can to do that. <eob> We must. <eob> The most important thing is power. <eob>
You cannot develop in the dark. <eob>
And then governance and corruption: <eob> we have to fight. <eob>
We have to make our countries transparent. <eob>
And above all, we have to engage <eol> our young people. <eob>
We have genius in our young people. <eob>
I see it every day. <eob>
It's what makes me wake up <eol> in the morning and feel ready to go. <eob>
We have to unleash the genius <eol> of our young people, <eob> get out of their way, support them <eol> to create and innovate <eob> and lead the way. <eob>
And I know that they will lead us <eol> in the right direction. <eob>
And our women, and our girls: <eob> we have to recognize that girls <eol> and women are a gift. <eob>
They have strength, <eob> and we have to unleash that strength <eob> so that they can contribute to the continent. <eob>
I strongly believe that when we do <eol> all of these things, <eob> we find that the rising Africa narrative <eob> is not a fluke. <eob>
It's a trend. <eob>
It's a trend, and if we continue, <eol> if we unleash our youth, <eob> if we unleash our women, <eob> we may step backwards sometimes, <eob> we may even step sideways, <eob> but the trend is clear. <eob>
Africa will continue to rise. <eob>
And I tell you businesspeople in the audience, <eob> investment in Africa is not for today, <eol> is not for tomorrow, <eob> it's not a short-term thing, <eol> it's a longer term thing. <eob>
But if you are not invested in Africa, <eob> then you will be missing <eob> one of the most important <eol> emerging opportunities in the world. <eob>
Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned <eol> corruption in your talk, <eob> and you're known, well-known <eol> as a strong anticorruption fighter. <eob>
But that's had consequences. <eob>
People have fought back, <eol> and your mother was kidnapped. <eob>
How have you been handling this? <eob>
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: <eol> It's been very difficult. <eob>
Thank you <eob> for mentioning the issue of the kidnap <eol> of my mother. <eob>
It's a very difficult subject. <eob>
But what it means is that <eol> when you fight corruption, <eob> when you touch the pockets <eol> of people who are stealing money, <eob> they don't just keep quiet. <eob>
They fight back, and the issue for you <eol> is when they try to intimidate you, <eob> do you give up, or do you fight on? <eob>
Do you find a way to stay on <eol> and fight back? <eob>
And the answer that I had <eol> with the teams I worked with <eob> is <eob> we have to fight <eob> on. <eob>
We have to create those institutions. <eob>
We have to find ways to stop these people <eob> from taking away the heritage <eol> of the future. <eob>
And so that's what we did. <eob>
And even out of government, <eol> we continued to make that point. <eob>
In our countries, nobody, <eol> nobody is going to fight corruption <eob> for us but us. <eob>
And therefore, that comes with consequences, <eob> and we just have to do <eol> the best we can. <eob>
But I thank you and thank TED <eol> for giving us a voice <eob> to say to those people, you will not win, <eob> and we will not be intimidated. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
June 29, 2016. <eob>
My dear fellow citizen: <eob>
I write to you today, <eob> to you who have lost in this era. <eob>
At this moment in our common life, <eob> when the world is full of breaking <eob> and spite <eob> and fear, <eob>
I address this letter <eob> simply to you, <eob> even though we both know <eob> there are many of you behind this "you," <eob> and many of me behind this "I." <eob>
I write to you because at present, <eob> this quaking world we share scares me. <eob>
I gather it scares you, too. <eob>
Some of what we fear, I suspect, <eob> we fear in common. <eob>
But much of what we fear <eol> seems to be each other. <eob>
You fear the world I want to live in, <eob> and I fear your visions in turn. <eob>
Do you know that feeling you get <eol> when you know it's going to storm <eob> before it storms? <eob>
Do you also feel that now, <eob> fellow citizen? <eob>
That malaise and worry <eob> that some who know <eob> feel reminds them of the 1930s? <eob>
Perhaps you don't, <eob> because our fears of each other <eob> are not in sync. <eob>
In this round, <eol> I sense that your fears of me, <eob> of the world that I have insisted <eol> is right for us both, <eob> has gathered over a generation. <eob>
It took time for your fears <eol> to trigger my fears, <eob> not least because at first, <eob> I never thought I needed to fear you. <eob>
I heard you <eob> but did not listen, <eob> all these years when you said <eol> that this amazing new world <eob> wasn't amazing for you, <eob> for many of you, <eob> across the industrialized world; <eob> that the open, liquid world I relished, <eob> of people and goods and technologies flowing freely, <eob> going where they pleased, globally, <eob> was not, for you, an emancipation. <eob>
I have walked through your towns <eob> and, while looking, failed to see. <eob>
I did notice in Stephenville, Texas, <eob> that the town square was dominated <eob> by one lawyer's office after another, <eob> because of all the people rotating <eol> in and out of the prison. <eob>
I did notice the barren shops in Wagner, South Dakota, <eob> and the VFW gathering hall <eob> that stood in mockery <eob> of a community's dream to endure. <eob>
I did notice <eob> at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart, <eob> that far too many people <eol> in their 20s and 30s <eob> looked a decade or two from death, <eob> with patchy, flared-up skin <eob> and thinning, stringy hair <eob> and browning, ground-down teeth <eob> and a lostness in their eyes. <eob>
I did notice <eob> that the young people <eol> I encountered in Paris, <eob> in Florence, in Barcelona, <eob> had degrees but no place to take them, <eob> living on internships well into their 30s, <eob> their lives prevented from launching, <eob> because of an economy that creates wealth — <eob> just not jobs. <eob>
I did notice <eob> the news about those parts <eol> of London becoming ghost quarters, <eob> where the global super-rich turn fishy <eol> money into empty apartments <eob> and price lifelong residents <eol> of a city, young couples starting out, <eob> out of their own home. <eob>
And I heard that the fabric of your life <eob> was tearing. <eob>
You used to be able to count on work, <eob> and now you couldn't. <eob>
and now you couldn't. <eob> You used to be able to nourish your children, <eob> and guarantee that they would climb <eob> a little bit further in life than you had, <eob>
You used to be made to feel dignity <eol> in your work, and now you didn't. <eob>
It used to be normal for people <eol> like you to own a home, <eob> and now it wasn't. <eob>
I cannot say <eob> I didn't know these things, <eob> but I was distracted <eob> creating a future in which <eol> we could live on Mars, <eob> even as you struggled down here on Earth. <eob>
I was distracted <eob> innovating immortality, <eob> even as many of you began to live shorter lives <eol> than your parents had. <eob>
I heard all of these things, <eol> but I didn't listen. <eob>
I looked <eob> but didn't see. <eob>
I read, didn't understand. <eob>
I paid attention <eob> only when you began <eol> to vote and shout, <eob> and when your voting and shouting, <eol> when the substance of it, <eob> began to threaten me. <eob>
I listened only when you moved <eol> toward shattering continental unions <eob> and electing vulgar demagogues. <eob>
Only then did your pain become of interest <eob> to me. <eob>
I know that feeling hurt <eob> is often prologue to dealing hurt. <eob>
I wonder now <eob> if you would be less eager to deal it <eob> if I had stood with you <eob> when you merely felt it. <eob>
I ask myself <eob> why I didn't stand with you then. <eob>
One reason is that I became entranced <eob> by the gurus of change, <eob> became a worshiper of the religion <eol> of the new for novelty's sake, <eob> and of globalization and open borders <eob> and kaleidoscopic diversity. <eob>
Once change became my totalizing faith, <eob> I could be blind. <eob>
I could fail to see change's consequences. <eob>
I could overlook the importance <eob> of roots, traditions, <eol> rituals, stability -- <eob> and belonging. <eob>
And the more fundamentalist I became <eob> in my worship <eol> of change and openness, <eob> the more I drove you towards the other polarity, <eob> to cling, <eob> to freeze, <eob> to close, <eob> to belong. <eob>
I now see as I didn't before <eob> that not having the right skin <eol> or right organ <eob> is not the only varietal of disadvantage. <eob>
There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage <eob> in having those privileged traits <eob> and yet feeling history <eol> to be moving away from you; <eob> that while the past was hospitable <eol> to people like you, <eob> the future will be more hospitable <eob> to others; <eob> that the world is growing less familiar, <eob> less yours day by day. <eob>
I will not concede for a moment <eol> that old privileges should not dwindle. <eob>
They cannot dwindle fast enough. <eob>
It is for you to learn to live <eol> in a new century in which <eob> there are no bonuses for showing up <eol> with the right skin and right organs. <eob>
If and when your anger turns to hate, <eob> please know that there is no space <eol> for that in our shared home. <eob>
But I will admit, <eob> fellow citizen, <eob> that I have discounted the burden <eol> of coping with the loss of status. <eob>
I have forgotten <eob> that what is socially necessary <eol> can also be personally gruelling. <eob>
A similar thing happened <eob> with the economy that you and I share. <eob>
Just as I cannot and don't wish <eob> to turn back to the clock <eol> on equality and diversity, <eob> and yet must understand <eob> the sense of loss they can inspire, <eob> so, too, I refuse <eol> and could not if I wished <eob> turn back the clock on an ever more closely knit, interdependent world, <eob> and on inventions that won't stop being invented. <eob>
And yet I must understand <eol> your experience of these things. <eob>
You have for years been telling me <eol> that your experience of these things <eob> is not as good as my theories forecast. <eob>
Yet before you could finish a complaining sentence <eob> about the difficulty of living <eol> with erratic hours, volatile pay, <eob> vanishing opportunities, <eob> about the pain of dropping your children <eol> off at 24-hour day care <eob> to make your 3am shift, <eob> I shot back at you -- before you could finish your sentence -- <eob> my dogma, <eob> about how what you are actually <eol> experiencing was flexibility <eob> and freedom. <eob>
Language is one of the only things <eol> that we truly share, <eob> and I sometimes used <eol> this joint inheritance <eob> to obfuscate <eob> and deflect <eob> and justify myself; <eob> to re-brand what was good for me <eob> as something appearing good for us both, <eob> when I threw around terms <eol> like "the sharing economy," <eob> and "disruption" <eob> and "global resourcing." <eob>
I see now that what I was really doing, <eob> at times, <eob> was buying your pain on the cheap, <eob> sprucing it up <eob> and trying to sell it back to you <eob> as freedom. <eob>
I have wanted to believe <eol> and wanted you to believe <eob> that the system that has been good to me, <eob> that has made my life ever more seamless, <eob> is also the best system for you. <eob>
I have condescended to you <eob> with the idea that you are voting <eol> against your economic interests -- <eob> voting against your interests, <eob> as if I know your interests. <eob>
That is just my dogmatic <eol> economism talking. <eob>
I have a weakness <eob> for treating people's economic interests <eol> as their only interest, <eob> ignoring things like belonging and pride <eob> and the desire to send a message <eol> to those who ignore you. <eob>
So here we are, <eob> in a scary but not inexplicable moment <eob> of demagoguery, fracture, <eob> xenophobia, resentment and fear. <eob>
And I worry for us both <eol> if we continue down this road, <eob> me not listening, <eob> you feeling unheard, <eob> you shouting to get me to listen. <eob>
I worry when each of us <eol> is seduced by visions of the future <eob> that have no place for the other. <eob>
If this goes on, <eob> if this goes on, <eob> there may be blood. <eob>
There are already hints of this blood <eob> in newspapers every day. <eob> There may be roundups, raids, <eob> deportations, camps, secessions. <eob>
And no, I do not think that I exaggerate. <eob>
There may be even talk of war <eob> in places that were certain <eol> they were done with it. <eob>
There is always the hope of redemption. <eob>
But it will not be a cheap, <eol> shallow redemption <eob> that comes through blather <eol> about us all being in it together. <eob>
This will take more. <eob>
It will take accepting <eol> that we both made choices to be here. <eob>
We create our "others." <eob> As parents, as neighbors, as citizens, <eob> we witness and sometimes ignore each other <eob> into being. <eob>
You were not born vengeful. <eob>
I have some role <eob> in whatever thirst you now feel for revenge, <eob> and that thirst now tempts me <eob> to plot ever more elaborate escapes <eob> from our common life, <eob> from the schools and neighborhoods <eob> and airports and amusement parks <eob> that we used to share. <eob>
We face, then, <eob> a problem not of these large, <eol> impersonal forces. <eob>
We face a problem of your <eol> and my relations. <eob>
We chose ways of relating to each other <eob> that got us here. <eob>
We can choose ways of relating <eob> that get us out. <eob>
fellow citizen? <eob> But there are things <eol> we might have to let go of, <eob> starting with our own <eol> cherished versions of reality. <eob>
Imagine if you let go of fantasies <eob> of a society purged of these <eol> or those people. <eob>
Imagine if I let go of my habit <eob> of saving the world behind your back, <eob> of deliberating on the future <eob> of your work, <eob> your food, <eob> your schools, <eob> in places where you couldn't get past security. <eob>
We can do this only if we first accept <eob> that we have neglected each other. <eob>
If there is hope to summon <eob> in this ominous hour, <eob> it is this. <eob>
We have, for too long, <eob> chased various shimmering dreams <eob> at the cost of attention <eol> to the foundational dream of each other, <eob> the dream of tending to each other, <eob> of unleashing each other's wonders, <eob> of moving through history together. <eob>
We could dare to commit <eol> to the dream of each other <eob> as the thing that matters <eol> before every neon thing. <eob>
Let us dare. <eob>
Sincerely yours, <eob>
a <eob> fellow citizen. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How do we build a society <eob> without fossil fuels? <eob>
This is a very complex challenge, <eob> and I believe developing countries <eol> could take the lead in this transition. <eob>
And I'm aware that this <eol> is a contentious statement, <eob> but the reality is that so much <eol> is at stake in our countries <eob> if we let fossil fuels stay <eol> at the center of our development. <eob>
We can do it differently. <eob>
And it's time, it really is time, <eob> to debunk the myth <eob> that a country has to choose <eol> between development on the one hand <eob> and environmental protection, <eol> renewables, quality of life, on the other. <eob>
I come from Costa Rica, <eol> a developing country. <eob>
We are nearly five million people, <eob> and we live right in the middle <eol> of the Americas, <eob> so it's very easy <eol> to remember where we live. <eob>
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity <eob> comes from renewable sources, <eob> five of them. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hydropower, geothermal, <eob> wind, solar, biomass. <eob>
Did you know that last year, <eob> for 299 days, <eob> we did not use any fossil fuels <eob> in order to generate all our electricity? <eob>
It's a fantastic achievement, <eob> and yet, it hides a paradox, <eob> which is that nearly 70 percent <eob> of all our energy consumption is oil. <eob>
Why? <eob> Because of our transportation system, <eob> which is totally dependent <eol> on fossil fuels, <eob> like it is in most countries. <eob>
So if we think of the energy <eol> transition as a marathon, <eob> the question is, how do we get <eol> to the finish line, <eob> how do we decarbonize <eol> the rest of the economy? <eob>
And it's fair to say <eol> that if we don't succeed, <eob> it's difficult to see who will. <eob>
So that is why I want to talk <eol> to you about Costa Rica, <eob> because I believe <eol> we are a great candidate <eob> in pioneering a vision for development <eob> without fossil fuels. <eob>
If you know one thing about our country, <eob> it's that we don't have an army. <eob>
So I'm going to take you back to 1948. <eob>
That year, the country <eol> was coming out of civil war. <eob>
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died, <eob> and families were bitterly split. <eob>
And yet, a surprising idea <eol> won the hearts and minds: <eob> we would reboot the country, <eob> and that Second Republic <eol> would have no army. <eob>
So we abolished it. <eob>
And the president at the time, <eob> José Figueres, <eob> found a powerful way <eol> by smashing the walls of an army base. <eob>
The following year, 1949, <eob> we made that decision permanent <eol> in the new constitution, <eob> and that is why I can tell you that story <eol> nearly 70 years later. <eob>
And I'm grateful. <eob> I'm grateful they made that decision <eol> before I was born, <eob> because it allowed me <eol> and millions of others <eob> to live in a very stable country. <eob>
And you might be thinking <eol> that it was good luck, <eob> but it wasn't. <eob>
There was a pattern of deliberate choices. <eob>
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given <eol> free education and free health care. <eob>
We called that social guarantees. <eob>
By abolishing the army, <eob> we were able to turn military spending <eol> into social spending, <eob> and that was a driver of stability. <eob>
In the '50s -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In the '50s, we started investing in hydropower, <eob> and that kept us away from the trap <eob> of using fossil fuels <eol> for electricity generation, <eob> which is what the world <eol> is struggling with today. <eob>
In the '70s we invested in national parks, <eob> and that kept us away <eob> from the deeply flawed logic <eol> of growth, growth, growth at any cost <eob> that you see others embracing, <eol> especially in the developing world. <eob>
In the '90s, we pioneered payments <eol> for ecosystem services, <eob> and that helped us reverse deforestation <eob> and boosted ecotourism, <eol> which today is a key engine of growth. <eob>
So investing in environmental protection <eob> did not hurt our economy. <eob> Quite the opposite. <eob>
And it doesn't mean we are perfect, <eob> and it doesn't mean <eol> we don't have contradictions. <eob>
That's not the point. <eob>
The point is that, <eol> by making our own choices, <eob> we were able to develop resilience <eol> in dealing with development problems. <eob>
Also, if you take a country like ours, <eob> the GDP per capita <eol> is around 11,000 dollars, <eob> depending on how you measure it. <eob>
But according to <eol> the Social Progress Index, <eob> we are an absolute outlier <eob> when it comes to turning GDP <eol> into social progress. <eob>
Abolishing the army, <eob> investing in nature and people, <eob> did something very powerful, too. <eob>
It shaped the narrative, <eob> the narrative of a small country <eol> with big ideas, <eob> and it was very empowering <eol> to grow up with that narrative. <eob>
So the question is, <eob> what is the next big idea <eol> for this generation? <eob>
And I believe what comes next <eob> is for this generation <eol> to let go of fossil fuels for good, <eob> just as we did with the army. <eob>
Fossil fuels create climate change. <eob>
We know that, <eob> and we know how vulnerable we are <eol> to the impacts of climate change. <eob>
So as a developing country, <eol> it is in our best interest <eob> to build development <eob> without fossil fuels <eob> that harm people in the first place. <eob>
Because <eob> why would we continue importing oil <eob> for transportation <eob> if we can use electricity instead? <eob>
Remember, <eob> this is the country <eob> where electricity <eol> comes from water in our rivers, <eob> heat from volcanoes, <eob> wind turbines, solar panels, <eob> biowaste. <eob>
Abolishing fossil fuels means <eol> disrupting our transportation system <eob> so that we can power our cars, <eol> buses and trains with electricity <eob> instead of dirty energy. <eob>
And transportation, let me tell you, <eob> has become an existential issue <eol> for us Costa Ricans, <eob> because the model we have <eol> is not working for us. <eob>
It's hurting people, <eob> it's hurting companies, <eob> and it's hurting our health. <eob>
Because <eob> when policies and infrastructure fail, <eob> this is what happens on a daily basis. <eob>
Two hours in the morning, <eob> two hours in the evening. <eob>
I don't understand why <eol> we have to accept this as normal. <eob>
It's offensive <eob> to have to waste our time like this <eol> every single day. <eob>
And this highway is actually quite good <eob> compared to what you see <eol> in other countries <eob> where traffic is exploding. <eob>
You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa." <eob> Presa means "imprisoned." <eob> And people are turning violent <eob> in a country that is otherwise <eol> happy in pura vida. <eob> It's happening. <eob> So a lot is at stake. <eob>
The good news <eob> is that when we talk <eol> about clean transportation <eob> and different mobility, <eob> we're not talking about <eol> some distant utopia out there. <eob>
We're talking about electric mobility <eol> that is happening today. <eob>
By 2022, electric cars <eol> and conventional cars <eob> are expected to cost the same, <eob> and cities are already trying <eol> electric buses. <eob>
And these really cool creatures <eob> are saving money, <eob> and they reduce pollution. <eob>
So if we want to get rid <eol> of oil-based transportation, we can, <eob> because we have options now <eol> that we didn't have before. <eob>
It's really exciting. <eob> But of course, <eob> some get very uncomfortable <eol> with this idea, <eob> and they will come and they will tell you <eob> that the world is stuck with oil, <eol> and so is Costa Rica, so get real. <eob>
That's what they tell you. <eob>
And you know what the answer <eol> to that argument is? <eob>
That in 1948, we didn't say <eol> the world is stuck with armies, <eob> so let's keep our army, too. <eob>
No, we made a very brave choice, <eob> and that choice made the whole difference. <eob>
So it's time for this generation <eol> to be brave again <eob> and abolish fossil fuels for good. <eob>
And I'll give you three reasons <eol> why we have to do this. <eob>
First, <eob> our model of transportation <eol> and urbanization is broken, <eob> so this is the best moment <eol> to redefine our urban and mobility future. <eob>
We don't want cities <eol> that are built for cars. <eob> We want cities for people <eob> where we can walk and we can use bikes. <eob>
And we want public transportation, <eob> lots of it, <eob> public transportation <eol> that is clean and dignifying. <eob>
Because <eob> if we continue adding fleets <eol> of conventional cars, <eob> our cities will become unbearable. <eob>
Second, we have to change, <eob> but incremental change <eol> is not going to be sufficient. <eob>
We need transformational change. <eob>
And there are some <eol> incremental projects in my country, <eob> and I am the first one to celebrate them. <eob>
But let's not kid ourselves. <eob>
We're not talking about ending up <eol> with really beautiful electric cars here <eob> and a few electric buses there <eob> while we keep investing <eol> in the same kind of infrastructure, <eob> more cars, more roads, more oil. <eob>
We're talking about <eol> breaking free from oil, <eob> and you cannot get there <eol> through incrementalism. <eob>
Third, and you know this one, <eob> the world is hungry for inspiration. <eob>
It craves stories of success <eob> in dealing with complex issues, <eob> especially in developing countries. <eob>
in order to generate all our electricity? <eob> So I believe Costa Rica <eol> can be an inspiration to others, <eob> as we did last year when we disclosed <eob> that for so many days <eol> we were not using any fossil fuels <eob>
The news went viral around the world. <eob>
Also, and this makes me extremely proud, <eob> a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres, <eob> played a decisive role in the negotiations <eol> of the Paris climate agreement. <eob>
So we have to protect that legacy <eol> and be an example. <eob>
So what comes next? <eob> The people. <eob> How do we get people to own this? <eob>
How do we get people <eob> to believe that it's possible <eob> to build a society <eob> without fossil fuels? <eob>
A lot of work from <eol> the ground up is needed. <eob>
That is why, in 2014, <eol> we created Costa Rica Limpia. <eob> "Limpia" means "clean," <eob> because we want to empower <eol> and we want to inspire citizens. <eob>
If citizens don't get engaged, <eob> clean transportation decisions <eol> will be bogged down by endless, <eob> and I mean endless, technical discussions, <eob> and by avalanches of lobbying <eol> by various established interests. <eob>
Wanting to be a green country <eol> powered by renewables <eob> is already part of our story. <eob>
We should not let anybody <eol> take that away from us. <eob>
Last year, we brought people <eol> from our seven provinces <eob> to talk about climate change <eol> in terms that matter to them, <eob> and we also brought this year <eob> another group of Costa Ricans <eob> to talk about renewable energy. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
These people disagree on almost everything <eob> except on renewable energy <eob> and clean transportation and clean air. <eob>
It brings people together. <eob>
And the key to real participation <eob> is to help people not to feel small. <eob>
People feel powerless, <eob> and they are tired of not being heard. <eob>
So what we do is concrete things, <eob> and we translate technical issues <eol> into citizen language <eob> to show that citizens have a role to play <eol> and can play it together. <eob>
For the first time, we're tracking <eol> the promises that were made <eob> on clean transportation, <eob> and politicos know <eol> that they have to deliver it, <eob> but the tipping point will come <eol> when we form coalitions -- <eob> citizens, companies, <eob> champions of public transportation -- <eob> that will make electric mobility <eol> the new normal, <eob> especially in a developing country. <eob>
By the time the next election comes, <eob> I believe every candidate <eol> will have to disclose where they stand <eob> on the abolition of fossil fuels. <eob>
Because <eob> this question has to enter <eol> our mainstream politics. <eob>
And I'm telling you, <eol> this is not a question of climate policy <eob> or environmental agenda. <eob>
It's about the country that we want <eob> and the cities that we have <eob> and the cities that we want <eob> and who makes that choice. <eob>
Because at the end of the day, <eol> what we have to show <eob> is that development with renewable energy <eob> is good for the people, <eob> for Costa Ricans that are alive today <eob> and especially for those <eol> who haven't been born. <eob>
This is our National Museum today. <eob> It's bright and peaceful, <eob> and when you stand up in front of it, <eob> it's really hard to believe <eol> these were military barracks <eob> at the end of the '40s. <eob>
We started a new life <eol> without an army in this place, <eob> and here is where our abolition <eob> of fossil fuels will be announced one day. <eob>
And we will make history again. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Guys, we have an issue. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Growth is fading away, <eol> and it's a big deal. <eob>
Our global economy stops growing. <eob>
And it's not new. <eob>
Growth has actually declined <eol> for the last 50 years. <eob>
If we continue like this, <eol> we need to learn <eob> how to live in a world <eol> with no growth in the next decade. <eob>
This is scary because <eol> when the economy doesn't grow, <eob> our children don't get better lives. <eob>
What's even scarier is that when <eol> the pie does not grow, <eob> each of us get a smaller piece. <eob> We're then ready to fight <eol> for a bigger one. <eob>
This creates tensions and serious conflicts. <eob>
Growth matters a lot. <eob>
If we look at the history of growth, <eob> times of big growth <eol> have always been fueled <eob> by big manufacturing revolutions. <eob>
It happened three times, <eol> every 50-60 years. <eob>
The steam engine in the middle <eol> of the 19th century, <eob> the mass-production model <eol> in the beginning of the 20th century -- <eob> thanks, Mr. Ford. <eob>
And the first automation wave <eol> in the 1970s. <eob>
Why did these manufacturing revolutions <eob> create huge growth in our economies? <eob>
Because they have injected <eol> huge productivity improvement. <eob>
It's rather simple: <eob> in order to grow, you need <eol> to be producing more, <eob> putting more into our economy. <eob>
This means either more labor <eol> or more capital or more productivity. <eob>
Each time, productivity <eol> has been the growth lever. <eob>
I'm here today to tell you <eob> that we are on the verge <eol> of another huge change, <eob> and that this change, surprisingly enough, <eob> is going to come from manufacturing, again. <eob> It will get us out of our growth slump <eob> and it will change radically the way <eol> globalization has been shaped <eob> over the last decade. <eob>
I'm here to tell you about the amazing <eol> fourth manufacturing revolution <eob> that is currently underway. <eob>
It's not as if we've done nothing <eol> with manufacturing <eob> since the last revolution. <eob>
Actually, we've made <eol> some pretty lame attempts <eob> to try to revitalize it. <eob>
But none of them have been <eol> the big overhaul <eob> we really need to get us growing again. <eob>
For example, we've tried <eol> to relocate our factories offshore <eob> in order to reduce cost <eol> and take advantage of cheap labor. <eob>
Not only did this not inspire productivity, <eob> but it only saved money <eol> for a short period of time, <eob> because cheap labor didn't stay <eol> cheap for long. <eob>
Then, we've tried <eol> to make our factories larger <eob> and we specialized them by product. <eob>
The idea was that we can make <eol> a lot of one product <eob> and stockpile it to be sold with demand. <eob>
This did help productivity for a while. <eob>
But it introduced a lot of rigidities <eol> in our supply chain. <eob>
Let's take fashion retail. <eob>
Traditional clothing companies <eob> have built offshore, <eol> global, rigid supply chains. <eob>
When fast-fashion competitors like Zara <eob> started replenishing <eol> their stocks faster <eob> from two collections a year <eol> to one collection a month, <eob> none of them have been able <eol> to keep up with the pace. <eob>
Most of them are in great <eol> difficulties today. <eob>
Yet, with all of their shortcomings, <eob> those are the factories we know today. <eob>
When you open the doors, <eob> they look the same as they did 50 years ago. <eob>
We've just changed the location, <eol> the size, the way they operate. <eob>
Can you name anything else that looks the same <eob> as it did 50 years ago? <eob> It's crazy. <eob> We've made all the tweaks <eol> to the model that we could, <eob> and now we hit its limits. <eob>
After all of our attempts to fix <eol> the manufacturing model failed, <eob> we thought growth could come from elsewhere. <eob>
We turned to the tech sector -- <eob> there's been quite a lot <eol> of innovations there. <eob>
Just to name one: the Internet. <eob>
We hoped it could produce growth. <eob>
And indeed, it changed our lives. <eob>
It made big waves in the media, <eol> the service, the entertainment spaces. <eob>
But it hasn't done much for productivity. <eob>
Actually, what's surprising <eol> is that productivity is on the decline <eob> despite all of those innovation efforts. <eob>
Imagine that -- sitting at work, <eol> scrolling through Facebook, <eob> watching videos on YouTube <eol> has made us less productive. <eob> Weird. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is why we are not growing. <eob>
We failed at reinventing the manufacturing space, <eob> and large technological innovations <eol> have played away from it. <eob>
But what if we could combine those forces? <eob>
What if the existing manufacturing <eol> and large technological innovation <eob> came together to create the next big <eol> manufacturing reinvention. <eob>
Bingo! <eob> This is the fourth manufacturing revolution, <eob> and it's happening right now. <eob>
Major technologies are entering <eol> the manufacturing space, <eob> big time. <eob> They will boost industrial productivity <eol> by more than a third. <eob>
This is massive, and it will do <eol> a lot in creating growth. <eob>
Let me tell you about some of them. <eob>
Have you already met <eol> advanced manufacturing robots? <eob>
They are the size of humans, <eob> they actually collaborate with them, <eob> and they can be programmed <eob> in order to perform complex, non-repetitive tasks. <eob>
Today in our factories, only 8 percent <eol> of the tasks are automated. <eob>
The less complex, the more repetitive ones. <eob>
It will be 25 percent in 10 years. <eob>
It means that by 2025, <eob> advanced robots will complement workers <eob> to be, together, 20 percent more productive, <eob> to manufacture 20 percent more outputs, <eob> to achieve 20 percent additional growth. <eob>
This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea. <eob>
These robots are working for us right now. <eob>
Last year in the US, they helped Amazon prepare <eol> and ship all the products <eob> required for Cyber Monday, <eob> the annual peak of online retail. <eob>
Last year in the US, <eob> it was the biggest online shopping <eol> day of the year and of history. <eob>
Consumers spent 3 billion dollars <eol> on electronics that day. <eob>
That's real economic growth. <eob>
Then there's additive manufacturing, <eol> 3D printing. <eob>
3D printing has already improved <eol> plastic manufacturing <eob> and it's now making its way <eol> through metal. <eob>
Those are not small industries. <eob>
Plastic and metals represent 25 percent <eob> of global manufacturing production. <eob>
Let's take a real example. <eob> In the aerospace industry, <eob> fuel nozzles are some <eol> of the most complex parts to manufacture, <eob> for one reason: <eob> they are made up of 20 different parts <eob> that need to be separately produced <eob> and then painstakingly assembled. <eob>
Aerospace companies are now <eol> using 3D printing, <eob> which allows them to turn <eol> those 20 different parts <eob> into just one. <eob> The results? <eob> 40 percent more productivity, <eob> 40 percent more output produced, 40 percent more growth <eob> for this specific industry. <eob>
But actually, the most exciting part <eol> of this new manufacturing revolution <eob> goes much beyond productivity. <eob>
It's about producing better, <eol> smarter products. <eob>
It's about scale customization. <eob>
Imagine a world where you can buy <eol> the exact products you want <eob> with the functionalities you need, <eob> with the design you want, <eob> with the same cost and lead time <eob> as a product that's been mass produced, <eob> like your car, or your clothes <eol> or your cell phone. <eob>
The new manufacturing revolution <eol> makes it possible. <eob>
Advanced robots can be programmed <eob> in order to perform <eol> any product configuration <eob> without any setup time or ramp up. <eob>
3D printers instantaneously produce <eol> any customized design. <eob>
We are now able to produce <eol> a batch of one product, your product, <eob> at the same cost and lead time <eol> as a batch of many. <eob>
Those are only a few examples of the manufacturing <eol> revolution at play. <eob>
Not only will manufacturing become more productive, <eob> it will also become more flexible, <eob> and those were exactly the elements <eol> of growth that we are missing. <eob>
But actually, there are even <eol> some bigger implications <eob> for all of us when manufacturing <eol> will find its way back into the limelight. <eob>
It will create a huge macroeconomic shift. <eob>
First, our factories will be relocated <eol> into our home markets. <eob>
In the world of scale customization, <eob> consumer proximity is the new norm. <eob>
Then, our factories will be smaller, <eol> agile. <eob>
Scale does not matter anymore, <eol> flexibility does. <eob>
They will be operating <eol> on a multi-product, made-to-order basis. <eob>
The change will be drastic. <eob>
Globalization will enter a new era. <eob>
The East-to-West trade flows <eob> will be replaced by regional trade flows. <eob>
East for East, West for West. <eob>
When you think about that, <eob> the old model was pretty much insane. <eob>
Piling up stocks, making products <eol> travel the whole world <eob> before they reach their end consumers. <eob>
The new model, producing just next <eol> to the consumer market, <eob> will be much cleaner, much better <eol> for our environment. <eob>
In mature economies, <eol> manufacturing will be back home, <eob> creating more employment, <eob> more productivity and more growth. <eob>
Good news, isn't it? <eob>
But here's the thing with growth -- <eob> it does not come automatically. <eob>
Mature economies will have to seize it. <eob>
We'll have to massively <eol> re-train our workforce. <eob>
In most countries, like in my country, France, <eob> we've told our children <eol> that manufacturing had no future. <eob>
That it was something happening far away. <eob>
We need to reverse that <eob> and teach manufacturing <eol> again at university. <eob>
Only the countries <eol> that will boldly transform <eob> will be able to seize this growth. <eob>
It's also a chance <eol> for developing economies. <eob>
Of course China and other emerging economies <eob> won't be the factory <eol> of the world anymore. <eob>
Actually, it was not a sustainable <eol> model in the long term, <eob> as those countries are becoming richer. <eob>
Last year, it was already <eol> as expensive to produce in Brazil <eob> as to produce in France. <eob>
By 2018, manufacturing costs in China <eol> will be on par with the US. <eob>
The new manufacturing revolution <eob> will accelerate the transition <eol> of those emerging economies <eob> towards a model driven by domestic consumption. <eob>
And this is good, <eob> because this is where growth <eol> will be created. <eob>
In the next five years, <eob> the next billion consumers in China <eol> will inject more growth in our economies <eob> than the top five European markets together. <eob>
This fourth manufacturing revolution <eol> is a chance for all of us. <eob>
If we play it right, <eob> we'll see sustainable growth <eol> in all of our economies. <eob>
This means more wealth distributed <eol> to all of us <eob> and a better future for our children. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am a palliative care physician <eob> and I would like to talk <eol> to you today about health care. <eob>
I'd like to talk to you <eol> about the health and care <eob> of the most vulnerable <eol> population in our country -- <eob> those people dealing <eol> with the most complex serious health issues. <eob>
I'd like to talk to you <eol> about economics as well. <eob>
And the intersection of these two <eol> should scare the hell out of you -- <eob> it scares the hell out of me. <eob>
I'd also like to talk <eol> to you about palliative medicine: <eob> a paradigm of care for this population, <eol> grounded in what they value. <eob> Patient-centric care based <eol> on their values <eob> that helps this population live better and longer. <eob>
It's a care model that tells the truth <eob> and engages one-on-one <eob> and meets people where they're at. <eob>
I'd like to start by telling the story <eol> of my very first patient. <eob>
It was my first day as a physician, <eob> with the long white coat ... <eob> I stumbled into the hospital <eob> and right away there's a gentleman, Harold, 68 years old, <eob> came to the emergency department. <eob>
He had had headaches for about six weeks <eob> that got worse and worse <eol> and worse and worse. <eob>
Evaluation revealed he had cancer <eol> that had spread to his brain. <eob>
The attending physician directed me <eol> to go share with Harold and his family <eob> the diagnosis, the prognosis and options of care. <eob>
Five hours into my new career, <eob> I did the only thing I knew how. <eob>
I walked in, <eob> sat down, <eob> took Harold's hand, <eob> took his wife's hand <eob> and just breathed. <eob>
He said, "It's not good news <eol> is it, sonny?" <eob>
I said, "No." <eob>
And so we talked and we listened <eol> and we shared. <eob>
And after a while I said, <eob> "Harold, what is it <eol> that has meaning to you? <eob>
What is it that you hold sacred?" <eob>
And he said, <eob> "My family." <eob>
I said, "What do you want to do?" <eob>
He slapped me on the knee and said, <eol> "I want to go fishing." <eob>
I said, "That, I know how to do." <eob>
Harold went fishing the next day. <eob>
He died a week later. <eob>
As I've gone through <eol> my training in my career, <eob> I think back to Harold. <eob>
And I think that this is a conversation <eob> that happens far too infrequently. <eob>
And it's a conversation <eol> that had led us to crisis, <eob> to the biggest threat <eol> to the American way of life today, <eob> which is health care expenditures. <eob>
So what do we know? <eob>
We know that this population, the most ill, <eob> takes up 15 percent <eol> of the gross domestic product -- <eob> nearly 2.3 trillion dollars. <eob>
So the sickest 15 percent <eol> take up 15 percent of the GDP. <eob>
If we extrapolate this out <eol> over the next two decades <eob> with the growth of baby boomers, <eob> at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP. <eob>
Sixty percent of the gross <eol> domestic product <eob> of the United States of America — <eob> it has very little to do <eol> with health care at that point. <eob>
It has to do with a gallon of milk, <eob> with college tuition. <eob>
It has to do with every thing <eol> that we value <eob> and every thing that we know presently. <eob>
It has at stake the free-market economy <eol> and capitalism <eob> of the United States of America. <eob>
Let's forget all the statistics <eol> for a minute, forget the numbers. <eob>
Let's talk about the value <eol> we get for all these dollars we spend. <eob>
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas, <eol> about six years ago, <eob> looked at every dollar <eol> spent by Medicare -- <eob> generally this population. <eob>
We found that those patients who have <eol> the highest per capita expenditures <eob> had the highest suffering, pain, depression. <eob>
And, more often than not, they die sooner. <eob>
How can this be? <eob> We live in the United States, <eob> it has the greatest health care <eol> system on the planet. <eob>
We spend 10 times <eol> more on these patients <eob> than the second-leading <eol> country in the world. <eob>
That doesn't make sense. <eob>
But what we know is, <eob> out of the top 50 countries on the planet <eob> with organized health care systems, <eob> we rank 37th. <eob>
Former Eastern Bloc countries <eol> and sub-Saharan African countries <eob> rank higher than us as far as quality and value. <eob>
Something I experience <eol> every day in my practice, <eob> and I'm sure, something many of you <eol> on your own journeys have experienced: <eob> more is not more. <eob>
Those individuals who had more tests, <eob> more bells, more whistles, <eob> more chemotherapy, more surgery, <eol> more whatever -- <eob> the more that we do to someone, <eob> it decreases the quality of their life. <eob>
And it shortens it, most often. <eob>
So what are we going to do about this? <eob>
What are we doing about this? <eob>
And why is this so? <eob>
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> is that we, the health care industry -- <eol> long white-coat physicians -- <eob> are stealing from you. <eob>
Stealing from you the opportunity <eob> to choose how you want to live your lives <eob> in the context of whatever disease it is. <eob>
We focus on disease <eol> and pathology and surgery <eob> and pharmacology. <eob> We miss the human being. <eob>
How can we treat this <eob> without understanding this? <eob>
We do things to this; <eob> we need to do things for this. <eob>
The triple aim of healthcare: <eob> one, improve patient experience. <eob> Two, improve the population health. <eob> Three, decrease per capita expenditure <eol> across a continuum. <eob>
Our group, palliative care, <eob> in 2012, working with the sickest <eol> of the sick -- <eob> cancer, <eob> heart disease, lung disease, <eob> renal disease, <eob> dementia -- <eob> how did we improve patient experience? <eob>
"I want to be at home, Doc." <eob>
"OK, we'll bring the care to you." <eob>
Quality of life, enhanced. <eob>
Think about the human being. <eob>
Two: population health. <eob> How did we look at this population differently, <eob> and engage with them <eol> at a different level, a deeper level, <eob> and connect to a broader sense <eol> of the human condition than my own? <eob>
How do we manage this group, <eob> so that of our outpatient population, <eob> 94 percent, in 2012, <eol> never had to go to the hospital? <eob>
Not because they couldn't. <eob>
But they didn't have to. <eob>
We brought the care to them. <eob>
We maintained their value, their quality. <eob>
Number three: per capita expenditures. <eob>
For this population, <eob> that today is 2.3 trillion dollars <eol> and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP, <eob> we reduced health care expenditures <eol> by nearly 70 percent. <eob>
They got more of what they wanted <eol> based on their values, <eob> lived better and are living longer, <eob> for two-thirds less money. <eob>
While Harold's time was limited, <eob> palliative care's is not. <eob>
Palliative care is a paradigm <eol> from diagnosis through the end of life. <eob> The hours, <eob> weeks, months, years, <eob> across a continuum -- <eob> with treatment, without treatment. <eob>
Meet Christine. <eob> Stage III cervical <eob> cancer, <eob> so, metastatic cancer that started in her cervix, <eob> spread throughout her body. <eob>
She's in her 50s and she is living. <eob>
This is not about end of life, <eob> this is about life. <eob>
This is not just about the elderly, <eob> this is about people. <eob>
This is Richard. <eob> End-stage lung disease. <eob>
"Richard, what is it <eol> that you hold sacred?" <eob>
"My kids, my wife and my Harley." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Alright! <eob> I can't drive you around on it <eol> because I can barely pedal a bicycle, <eob> but let's see what we can do." <eob>
Richard came to me, <eob> and he was in rough shape. <eob>
He had this little voice telling him <eob> that maybe his time was weeks to months. <eob>
And then we just talked. <eob> And I listened and tried to hear -- <eob> big difference. <eob>
Use these in proportion to this. <eob>
I said, "Alright, let's take it <eol> one day at a time," <eob> like we do in every other <eol> chapter of our life. <eob> And we have met Richard <eol> where Richard's at day-to-day. <eob>
And it's a phone call or two a week, <eob> but he's thriving in the context <eol> of end-stage lung disease. <eob>
Now, palliative medicine <eol> is not just for the elderly, <eob> it is not just for the middle-aged. <eob>
It is for everyone. <eob>
Meet my friend Jonathan. <eob> We have the honor and pleasure <eob> of Jonathan and his father joining us here today. <eob>
Jonathan is in his 20s, <eol> and I met him several years ago. <eob> He was dealing with metastatic testicular <eob> cancer, <eob> spread to his brain. <eob>
He had a stroke, <eob> he had brain surgery, <eob> radiation, chemotherapy. <eob>
Upon meeting him and his family, <eob> he was a couple of weeks <eol> away from a bone marrow transplant, <eob> and in listening and engaging, <eob> they said, "Help us understand -- <eol> what is cancer?" <eob>
How did we get this far <eob> without understanding <eol> what we're dealing with? <eob>
How did we get this far <eob> without empowering somebody <eob> to know what it is they're dealing with, <eob> and then taking the next step <eol> and engaging in who they are as human beings <eob> to know if that is what we should do? <eob>
Lord knows we can do any <eol> kind of thing to you. <eob> But should we? <eob>
And don't take my word for it. <eob>
All the evidence that is related <eol> to palliative care these days <eob> demonstrates with absolute certainty <eol> people live better and live longer. <eob>
There was a seminal article out <eol> of the New England Journal of Medicine <eob> in 2010. <eob>
A study done at Harvard <eol> by friends of mine, colleagues. <eob>
End-stage lung cancer: <eob> one group with palliative care, <eob> a similar group without. <eob>
The group with palliative care <eol> reported less pain, <eob> less depression. <eob>
They needed fewer hospitalizations. <eob>
And, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> they lived three to six months longer. <eob>
If palliative care <eol> were a cancer drug, <eob> every cancer doctor on the planet <eol> would write a prescription for it. <eob>
Why don't they? <eob>
Again, because we goofy, <eol> long white-coat physicians <eob> are trained and of the mantra <eol> of dealing with this, <eob> not with this. <eob>
This is a space <eol> that we will all come to at some point. <eob>
But this conversation today is not about dying, <eob> it is about living. <eob>
Living based on our values, <eob> what we find sacred <eob> and how we want to write <eol> the chapters of our lives, <eob> whether it's the last <eob> or the last five. <eob>
What we know, <eob> what we have proven, <eob> is that this conversation <eol> needs to happen today -- <eob> not next week, not next year. <eob>
What is at stake is our lives today <eob> and the lives of us as we get older <eob> and the lives of our children <eol> and our grandchildren. <eob>
Not just in that hospital room <eob> or on the couch at home, <eob> but everywhere we go <eol> and everything we see. <eob>
Palliative medicine is the answer <eol> to engage with human beings, <eob> to change the journey that we will all face, <eob> and change it for the better. <eob>
To my colleagues, <eob> to my patients, <eob> to my government, <eob> to all human beings, <eob> I ask that we stand and we shout <eol> and we demand <eob> the best care possible, <eob> so that we can live better today <eob> and ensure a better life tomorrow. <eob>
We need to shift today <eob> so that we can live tomorrow. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In July of 1911, <eob> a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor <eol> set out from his rainforest camp <eob> with his team. <eob>
After climbing a steep hill <eob> and wiping the sweat from his brow, <eob> he described what he saw beneath him. <eob>
He saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage <eob> this incredible interlocking maze <eol> of structures <eob> built of granite, <eob> beautifully put together. <eob>
What's amazing about this project <eob> is that it was the first funded <eol> by National Geographic, <eob> and it graced the front cover <eol> of its magazine in 1912. <eob>
This professor used state-of-the-art <eol> photography equipment <eob> to record the site, <eob> forever changing the face <eol> of exploration. <eob>
The site was Machu Picchu, <eob> discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham. <eob>
When he saw the site, he asked, <eob> "This is an impossible dream. <eob>
What could it be?" <eob>
So today, <eob> 100 years later, <eob> I invite you all on an incredible <eol> journey with me, <eob> a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
We will do nothing less <eol> than use state-of-the-art technology <eob> to map an entire country. <eob>
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham, <eob> but we are expanding it to the world, <eob> making archaeological exploration <eol> more open, inclusive, <eob> and at a scale simply not previously possible. <eob>
This is why I am so excited <eob> to share with you all today <eob> that we will begin <eol> the 2016 TED Prize platform <eob> in Latin America, <eob> more specifically Peru. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
We will be taking Hiram Bing <eol>ham's impossible dream <eob> and turning it into an amazing future <eob> that we can all share in together. <eob>
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu. <eob>
It has absolutely stunning jewelry, <eob> like what you can see here. <eob>
It has amazing Moche pottery <eol> of human figures. <eob>
It has the Nazca Lines <eob> and amazing textiles. <eob>
So as part of the TED Prize platform, <eob> we are going to partnering with some <eol> incredible organizations, <eob> first of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider <eob> of high-resolution <eol> commercial satellite imagery. <eob>
They're going to be helping us build <eol> out <eob> this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have. <eob>
Maybe some of you used it <eob> with the MH370 crash <eol> and search for the airplane. <eob>
Of course, they'll also be providing us <eol> with the satellite imagery. <eob>
National Geographic will be helping us with education <eol> and of course exploration. <eob>
As well, they'll be providing us <eol> with rich content for the platform, <eob> including some of the archival imagery like you saw <eol> at the beginning of this talk <eob> and some of their documentary footage. <eob>
We've already begun to build <eol> and plan the platform, <eob> and I'm just so excited. <eob>
So here's the cool part. <eob> My team, headed up by Chase Childs, <eob> is already beginning to look at some <eol> of the satellite imagery. <eob>
Of course, what you can see <eol> here is 0.3-meter data. <eob> This is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru. <eob>
It dates to 850 AD. <eob> It's a really amazing city, <eol> but let's zoom in. <eob>
This is the type and quality of data <eol> that you all will get to see. <eob>
You can see individual <eol> structures, individual buildings. <eob>
And we've already begun to find <eol> previously unknown sites. <eob>
What we can say already <eol> is that as part of the platform, <eob> you will all help discover <eol> thousands of previously unknown sites, <eob> like this one here, <eob> and this potentially large one here. <eob>
Unfortunately, we've also begun to uncover <eol> large-scale looting at sites, <eob> like what you see here. <eob>
So many sites in Peru are threatened, <eob> but the great part <eol> is that all of this data <eob> is going to be shared <eol> with archaeologists on the front lines <eob> of protecting these sites. <eob>
So I was just in Peru, meeting <eol> with their Minister of Culture <eob> as well as UNESCO. <eob>
We'll be collaborating closely with them. <eob>
Just so you all know, <eob> the site is going to be <eol> in both English and Spanish, <eob> which is absolutely essential <eol> to make sure <eob> that people in Peru <eol> and across Latin America can participate. <eob>
Our main project coprincipal investigator <eol> is the gentleman you see here, <eob> Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo, <eob> professor at Catholic University. <eob>
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist <eol> and former vice-minister, <eob> Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate <eol> and share the data with archaeologists <eob> so they can explore these sites <eol> on the ground. <eob>
He also runs this amazing drone mapping program, <eob> some of the images of which you <eol> can see behind me here and here. <eob>
And this data will be <eol> incorporated into the platform, <eob> and also he'll be helping to image <eol> some of the new sites you help find. <eob>
Our on-the-ground partner <eob> who will be helping us <eol> with education, outreach, <eob> as well as site preservation components, <eob> is the Sustainable Preservation Initiative, <eob> led by Dr. Larry Coben. <eob> Some of you may not be aware <eob> that some of the world's poorest communities <eob> coexist with some of the world's <eol> most well-known archaeological sites. <eob>
What SPI does <eob> is it helps to empower these communities, <eob> in particular women, <eob> with new economic approaches <eol> and business training. <eob>
So it helps to teach them <eol> to create beautiful handicrafts <eob> which are then sold on to tourists. <eob>
This empowers the women <eol> to treasure their cultural heritage <eob> and take ownership of it. <eob>
I had the opportunity to spend <eol> some time with 24 of these women <eob> at a well-known archaeological site <eol> called Pachacamac, just outside Lima. <eob>
These women were unbelievably inspiring, <eob> and what's great is that SPI will help us <eol> transform communities <eob> near some of the sites <eol> that you help to discover. <eob>
Peru is just the beginning. <eob>
We're going to be expanding <eol> this platform to the world, <eob> but already I've gotten thousands of emails <eob> from people all across the world -- <eol> professors, educators, students, <eob> and other archaeologists -- <eol> who are so excited to help participate. <eob>
In fact, they're already suggesting amazing places <eol> for us to help discover, <eob> including Atlantis. <eob>
I don't know if we're going <eol> to be looking for Atlantis, <eob> but you never know. <eob>
So I'm just so excited <eol> to launch this platform. <eob>
It's going to be launched formally <eol> by the end of the year. <eob>
And I have to say, <eob> if what my team has already discovered <eol> in the past few weeks are any indication, <eob> what the world discovers <eol> is just going to be beyond imagination. <eob>
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas. <eob>
Thank you <eob> very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
There's a big question <eol> at the center of life <eob> in our democracies today: <eob> How do we fight terror <eol> without destroying democracies, <eob> without trampling human rights? <eob>
I've spent much of my career <eol> working with journalists, <eob> with bloggers, <eob> with activists, <eob> with human rights researchers <eol> all around the world, <eob> and I've come to the conclusion <eob> that if our democratic societies <eol> do not double down <eob> on protecting and defending human rights, <eob> freedom of the press <eob> and a free and open internet, <eob> radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist. <eob>
I actually want to drill down <eol> on this a little bit. <eob> So, one of the countries that has been <eol> on the frontlines of this issue <eob> is Tunisia, <eob> which was the only country <eol> to come out of the Arab Spring <eob> with a successful democratic revolution. <eob>
Five years later, <eob> they're struggling <eol> with serious terror attacks <eob> and rampant ISIS recruitment. <eob>
And many Tunisians <eol> are calling on their government <eob> to do whatever it takes to keep them safe. <eob>
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari <eob> has summed up the situation <eol> with this character who says, <eob> "I don't give a damn about human rights. <eob>
I don't give a damn about the revolution. <eob>
I don't give a damn <eol> about democracy and liberty. <eob>
I just want to be safe." <eob> "Satisfied?" asked his jailer. <eob> "You're safe now." <eob>
If the Tunisian people can figure out <eob> how to deal with their terrorism problem <eob> without ending up in this place, <eob> they will be a model <eol> not only for their region, <eob> but for all of us. <eob>
The reality is that civil society, <eol> journalists and activists <eob> are coming under attack <eol> from extremist groups on the one hand, <eob> and, in many countries, <eob> also from their own governments. <eob>
We're seeing bloggers <eol> and journalists being jailed, <eob> charged and intimidated <eob> by their own governments, <eob> many of which are allies <eol> with the West in the war on terror. <eob> Just three examples. <eob> A friend and former colleague of mine, <eob> Hisham Almiraat, <eob> has been charged <eol> with threatening state security, <eob> along with six other activists in Morocco. <eob>
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi <eol> has been jailed and flogged <eob> for insulting Islam and criticizing <eol> the Saudi regime on his blog. <eob>
More recently, the Turkish representative <eol> for Reporters Without Borders, <eob> Erol Önderoglu, <eob> has been detained and charged <eol> with spreading terrorist propaganda, <eob> because he and some other activists <eol> have been supporting Kurdish media. <eob>
Anti-terror measures <eol> quickly turn into state repression <eob> without strong protection <eol> for minority communities <eob> and for peaceful debate; <eob> this needs to be supported <eol> by a robust, independent local media. <eob>
But while that's not really happening, <eob> Washington is teaming up with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood <eob> to pour millions — hundreds of millions of dollars — <eob> into what's called <eol> "counter-messaging," <eob> a fancy word for propaganda. <eob>
To counter the terrorist propaganda <eol> spreading all over the internet, <eob> in Europe, Internet Referral <eol> Units are being set up, <eob> so that people can report <eol> on extremist content that they find <eob> and get it censored. <eob>
The problem is, <eob> that all of this propaganda, <eol> monitoring and censorship <eob> completely fails to make up for the fact <eob> that the people who are the most credible voices, <eob> who can present credible ideas <eol> and alternative solutions <eob> to real economic, social and political <eol> problems in their community <eob> that are causing people to turn <eol> to extremism in the first place, <eob> are being silenced <eob> by their own governments. <eob>
This is all adding up to a decrease <eol> in freedom across the world. <eob>
Freedom House, <eob> the human rights organization, <eob> reports that 2015 marks <eol> the 10th straight year in a row <eob> of decline in freedom worldwide. <eob>
And this is not just <eol> because of the actions <eob> of authoritarian governments. <eob> It's also because democratic governments <eob> are increasingly cracking <eol> down on dissenters, <eob> whistle-blowers <eob> and investigative journalists. <eob>
UN Secretary General <eol> Ban Ki-Moon has warned <eob> that "preventing extremism and promoting <eol> human rights go hand-in-hand." <eob> It's not to say that governments <eol> shouldn't keep us safe -- <eob> of course they should -- <eob> but we need public oversight, transparency <eob> and accountability to the rule of law. <eob>
Meanwhile, <eob> extremists are literally killing off <eol> civil society in some countries. <eob>
Since 2013 in Bangladesh, <eob> over a dozen secular bloggers <eol> and community activists <eob> have been literally <eol> slaughtered by extremists <eob> while the government has done very little. <eob>
From the city of Raqqa in Syria, <eob> people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf <eol> have been assassinated <eob> for their reporting <eol> out of ISIS-controlled territory. <eob>
The citizen media group called <eol> Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently <eob> relies on strong encryption <eol> to send out their reports <eob> and shield themselves <eol> from interception and surveillance. <eob>
Yet authorities in countries <eol> like the United States, <eob> the United Kingdom <eol> and many other democracies <eob> are seeking to use the law <eob> to either weaken or outright ban <eol> strong encryption, <eob> because the bad guys are using it, too. <eob>
We have got to fight for the right <eol> of citizens to use strong encryption. <eob>
Otherwise, dissent <eol> and investigative journalism <eob> are going to become even more difficult <eob> in even more places. <eob>
And the bad guys -- the criminals <eol> and terrorists -- <eob> are still going to find <eol> ways to communicate. <eob>
Kudos to the companies <eol> that are standing up <eob> for their users' right to use encryption. <eob>
But when it comes to censorship, <eob> the picture is much more troubling. <eob>
Yes, there's a real problem <eob> of extremist content <eol> spreading all over the internet. <eob>
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter <eol> are among the many companies <eob> who report having taken down hundreds <eol> of thousands of pieces of content <eob> and deactivating accounts <eob> that are connected <eol> to the extremist's speech. <eob>
The problem is <eob> their enforcement mechanisms <eol> are a complete black box, <eob> and there is collateral damage. <eob>
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi, <eob> an activist who makes fun <eol> of ISIS on Twitter. <eob>
He had his account deactivated, <eob> because he shares a surname <eol> with a prominent ISIS leader. <eob>
Last December, <eob> a number of women named Isis, <eob> which also happens to be <eol> the name of an Egyptian goddess, <eob> had their accounts deactivated. <eob>
And this woman, <eob> who lives in the United States <eol> and is a computer programmer, <eob> reported on Twitter <eol> about her deactivation on Facebook, <eob> managed to get enough media attention <eol> to have her account reinstated. <eob>
But that's the thing — <eol> she had to get media attention. <eob>
And journalists aren't immune. <eob>
David Thomson, <eob> an expert on terrorism and reporter <eol> for Radio France International, <eob> had reports deleted <eol> from his Facebook account <eob> and had his account <eol> deactivated for several days, <eob> because they contained <eol> pictures of ISIS flags, <eob> even though he was just reporting on ISIS, <eob> not promoting it. <eob>
And then we have stories from people <eol> like this Egyptian man, <eob> Ahmed Abdellahy, <eob> who reported recently in an event <eol> in Washington DC <eob> that some of his arguments <eol> with extremists -- <eob> he now spends his time on social media <eol> arguing with ISIS followers, <eob> trying to get them to turn away -- <eob> some of his arguments <eol> with these extremists get deleted, <eob> which he believes has the effect <eol> of shielding them <eob> from alternative points of view. <eob>
It's unclear whether Facebook <eol> even knows the extent <eob> of the collateral damage, <eob> or the other companies as well. <eob>
But we do know that journalism, <eol> activism and public debate <eob> are being silenced in the effort <eol> to stamp out extremist speech. <eob>
So with these companies having so much <eol> power over the public discourse, <eob> they need to be held accountable. <eob>
They need to carry out impact assessment <eob> to identify and fix the problems <eol> that we're clearly seeing. <eob>
They need to be more transparent <eol> about their enforcement mechanisms, <eob> and they need to have clear <eol> appeal and grievance mechanisms, <eob> so people can get <eol> their content reinstated. <eob>
Now, I've been talking <eol> for the last 10 minutes <eob> about how governments and companies <eol> are making it more difficult <eob> for people like these. <eob>
This is a picture of members <eol> of the citizen media network, <eob> Global Voices, <eob> that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago <eob> with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman. <eob>
Interestingly, about 5 years ago, <eol> right after the Arab Spring, <eob> the data scientist Gilad Lotan <eob> created a network map of the people <eol> in <eob> Global Voices <eob> who were heavy users of Twitter <eol> during the Arab Spring. <eob>
And he found that many of these people <eol> served as key information nodes <eob> between activists and journalists <eob> throughout the Tunisian <eol> and Egyptian revolution. <eob>
We've got to make sure <eol> that these people not only survive, <eob> but are able to continue to thrive. <eob>
Many of them are still active, <eob> other than the ones who have gone to jail <eob> or have been driven into hiding or exile. <eob>
All around the world, <eob> people who are sick and tired <eol> of fear and oppression <eob> are linking up in their communities <eol> and across borders. <eob>
We've got to do everything we can <eol> to push our governments and companies <eob> to do a better job <eol> of protecting their rights. <eob>
We've also got to be more mindful <eob> about how our own personal, political, <eol> consumer and business choices <eob> affect people like these around the world. <eob>
Also, if you follow the news, <eob> it's pretty clear that that alone <eol> isn't going to be enough. <eob>
We've got to take personal responsibility <eol> by joining — <eob> or at very least, actively supporting — <eob> the growing ecosystem of individuals <eol> and groups <eob> who are fighting for social justice, <eob> environmental sustainability, <eob> government accountability, <eob> human rights, <eob> freedom of the press <eob> and a free and open internet, <eob> all around the world. <eob>
I believe that, ultimately, <eol> we can overcome <eob> the digitally empowered networks <eol> of extremism, demagoguery and hate. <eob>
But... <eob> we've got to do this by really beefing up <eol> the global networks <eob> of citizens around the world, <eob> powered by people who are working <eol> hard every day, <eob> and taking personal risk <eob> for a future world that is more peaceful, <eol> just, open and free. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thanks very much for listening. <eob>
I once had this nightmare: <eob> I'm standing in the middle <eol> of a deserted field full of land mines. <eob>
In real life, I love to hike, <eob> but every time I want to go on a hike, <eol> it makes me nervous. <eob>
I have this thought in the back of my mind <eob> that I might lose a limb. <eob>
This underlying fear started 10 years ago, <eob> after I met Mohammed, <eol> a cluster bomb survivor <eob> of the summer 2006 <eol> Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon. <eob>
Mohammed, like so many <eol> other survivors all around the world, <eob> had to live through the horrifying <eol> repercussions of cluster munitions <eob> on a daily basis. <eob>
When the one-month conflict <eol> started in Lebanon, <eob> I was still working <eol> at Agence France-Presse in Paris. <eob>
I remember how I was glued to the screens, <eob> anxiously following the news. <eob>
I wanted to reassure myself <eob> that the falling bombs <eol> missed my parents' home. <eob>
When I arrived in Beirut <eol> on assignment to cover that war, <eob> I was relieved to be united <eol> with my family, <eob> after they had finally managed <eol> to escape southern Lebanon. <eob>
The day the war was over, <eob> I remember seeing this image -- <eob> one of blocked roads, <eob> of displaced people eagerly rushing <eol> south, back to their homes, <eob> regardless of what they would find. <eob>
An estimated four million <eol> cluster submunitions <eob> were spread in Lebanon during <eol> the 34-day conflict. <eob>
Mohammed lost both legs <eol> during the last week of the conflict. <eob>
The fact that he lives a five-minute <eol> drive from my parents' home <eob> made it easier to follow <eol> him through the years. <eob>
It was now almost 10 years <eol> since we first met. <eob>
I saw the young boy <eob> who had to endure <eol> physical and emotional trauma. <eob>
I saw the teenager who tried <eol> to offer his friends tattoos, <eob> in return for a set fee of five dollars. <eob>
And I know the young, jobless man <eol> who spends hours surfing the Internet <eob> trying to meet a girl who might <eol> become his girlfriend. <eob>
His fate and the effects <eol> of losing his legs <eob> are now his daily reality. <eob>
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed <eob> have to deal with so many details <eol> that never occur to us. <eob>
Who would have imagined <eob> that so many daily tasks we do <eol> or take for granted, <eob> such as going to the beach or even <eol> picking up something from the floor, <eob> would become sources <eol> of stress and anxiety? <eob>
Well, that's what eventually <eol> became of Mohammed, <eob> due to his inflexible prosthetic legs. <eob>
Ten years ago, I had no clue <eol> what a cluster bomb was, <eob> nor its horrifying implications. <eob>
I learned that this indiscriminate <eol> weapon was used <eob> in so many parts of the world <eob> and continues to kill on a regular basis, <eob> without distinguishing <eol> between a military target <eob> or a child. <eob>
I naively asked myself, <eob> "But seriously, who made those weapons? <eob>
And what for?" <eob>
Let me explain to you <eol> what a cluster bomb is. <eob> It's a large canister <eol> filled with bomblets. <eob>
When it's dropped from the air, <eob> it opens up in midair to release <eol> hundreds of bomblets. <eob>
They scatter around wide areas <eob> and on impact, <eob> many fail to explode. <eob>
Those unexploded ones end up <eol> just like landmines -- <eob> sitting on the ground, <eob> waiting for their next target. <eob>
If someone steps on them by accident <eob> or picks them up, <eob> they can explode. <eob>
These weapons are extremely unpredictable, <eob> which makes the threat even bigger. <eob>
One day, a farmer can work <eol> his land without a problem. <eob>
The next day, he can make fire <eol> and burn some branches, <eob> and the submunitions close by <eol> could be set off because of the heat. <eob>
The problem is children mistake <eol> those bomblets for toys, <eob> because they can look like <eol> bouncy balls or soda cans. <eob>
Being a documentary photographer, <eob> I decided to go back to Lebanon <eol> a few months after the conflict ended <eob> to meet cluster bomb survivors. <eob>
And I met a few -- <eob> Hussein and Rasha, <eob> who both lost a leg to submunitions. <eob>
Their stories are similar to so many <eol> other kids' stories across the world <eob> and are a testimony <eol> to the horrifying implications <eob> of the continuous use of such weapons. <eob>
That's when I met Mohammed, <eol> in January 2007. <eob>
He was 11 years old, <eob> and I met him exactly four months <eol> after his accident. <eob>
When I first saw him, <eob> he was going through painful physiotherapy <eob> to recover from his fresh wounds. <eob>
Still in shock at such a young age, <eob> Mohammed was struggling <eol> to get used to his new body. <eob>
He would even wake up sometimes <eol> at night wanting to scratch his lost feet. <eob>
What drew me closer to his story <eol> was my instant realization <eob> of the difficulties Mohammed <eol> was likely to face in the future -- <eob> that what he has been suffering <eol> while adjusting to his injury <eob> at the age of 11, <eob> would increase manyfold. <eob>
Even before his disability, <eob> Mohammed's life wasn't easy. <eob>
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp <eol> for Palestinian refugees, <eob> and this is where he still lives. <eob>
Lebanon holds some 400,000 <eol> Palestinian refugees, <eob> and they suffer from discriminatory laws. <eob>
They're not allowed to work <eol> in the public sector <eob> or practice certain professions <eob> and are denied the right to own property. <eob>
This is one of the reasons <eob> why Mohammed doesn't really <eol> regret dropping out of school <eob> right after his injury. <eob>
He said, "What's the point <eol> of a university degree <eob> when I can't find a job to start with?" <eob>
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle <eol> of impact on communities, <eob> and not only the lives of their victims. <eob>
Many who get injured by this weapon <eol> drop out of school, <eob> can't find jobs or even lose their jobs, <eob> therefore losing the ability <eol> to provide for their families. <eob>
This is not to mention <eol> the continuous physical pain <eob> and the experience of feeling isolated. <eob>
These weapons affect <eol> the poorest of the poor. <eob>
The high medical cost <eol> is a burden to the families. <eob>
They end up relying <eol> on humanitarian agencies, <eob> which is insufficient and unsustainable, <eob> especially when injuries require <eol> lifelong support to the injured. <eob>
Ten years after Mohammed's injury, <eob> he is still unable to afford <eol> proper prosthetic legs. <eob>
He's very cautious with his steps, <eob> as a couple of falls over the years <eob> brought him embarrassment <eol> among his friends. <eob>
He joked that since he doesn't have legs, <eob> some days he tries to walk on his hands. <eob>
One of the worst yet invisible <eol> impacts of the weapon <eob> is the psychological scars it leaves. <eob>
In one of Mohammed's <eol> early medical reports, <eob> he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD. <eob>
He suffered from anxiety, <eol> poor appetite, sleep disturbance <eob> and showed signs of anger. <eob>
The reality is Mohammed never received <eol> proper help to fully recover. <eob>
His current obsession <eol> is to leave Lebanon at any cost -- <eob> even if it meant embarking <eol> on a hazardous journey <eob> along with refugees drifting towards <eol> Europe today through the Mediterranean. <eob>
Knowing how risky such a journey would be, <eob> he said, "If I were to die on the way, <eob> it doesn't matter." <eob> To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway. <eob>
Cluster bombs are a world problem, <eob> as this munition keeps destroying <eol> and hurting whole communities <eob> for generations to come. <eob>
In an online interview with the director <eol> of the Mines Advisory Group, <eob> Jamie Franklin, <eob> he said, <eob> "The US forces dropped over two million <eol> tons of munitions over Laos. <eob>
If they couldn't find <eol> their targets in Vietnam, <eob> there were free-drop areas in Laos <eol> where planes would drop their loads <eob> before going back to base, <eob> because it's dangerous to land <eol> with loaded planes." <eob> According to the International <eol> Committee of the Red Cross, <eob> in Laos alone -- one of the poorest <eol> countries in the world -- <eob> nine to 27 million unexploded <eol> submunitions remain. <eob>
Some 11,000 people have been killed <eol> or injured since 1973. <eob>
This lethal weapon has been used <eol> by over 20 states during armed conflicts <eob> in over 35 countries, <eob> such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan. <eob>
So far, 119 states have joined <eol> an international treaty <eob> banning cluster bombs, <eob> which is officially called <eol> the Convention on Cluster Munitions. <eob>
But some of the biggest producers <eol> of cluster munitions -- <eob> namely, the United States, <eol> Russia and China -- <eob> remain outside of this lifesaving treaty <eob> and continue to produce them, <eob> reserve the right to produce <eol> them in the future, <eob> keep those harmful weapons <eol> in their stockpiles <eob> and even possibly use them in the future. <eob>
Cluster bombs have reportedly <eol> been used most recently <eob> in the ongoing conflicts <eol> in Yemen and Syria. <eob>
According to research <eol> on the worldwide investments <eob> in cluster munitions producers <eob> by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO, <eob> financial institutions invested <eol> billions of US dollars <eob> into companies that make <eol> cluster munitions. <eob>
The majority of these institutions <eol> are based in countries <eob> that have not yet signed <eol> the Convention on Cluster Munitions. <eob>
Getting back to Mohammed, <eob> one of the few jobs he was able <eol> to find was picking lemons. <eob>
When I ask him if it's safe <eol> to work in the field <eob> he said, <eob> "I'm not sure." <eob> Research shows that cluster munitions <eol> often contaminate areas <eob> where agriculture is the main source <eol> of income. <eob>
According to Handicap <eol> International's research, <eob> 98 percent of those killed or injured <eol> by cluster munitions are civilians. <eob>
Eighty-four percent <eol> of casualties are males. <eob>
In countries where <eol> these people have no choice <eob> but to work in those fields, <eob> they simply do it <eob> and risk it. <eob>
Mohammed is the only male <eol> to three sisters. <eob>
Culturally, he's expected <eol> to provide for his family, <eob> but he simply can't. <eob>
He tried to have so many different jobs, <eob> but he couldn't keep any <eol> due to his physical disability <eob> and the less-than-friendly environment <eol> to people with disabilities, <eob> to say the least. <eob>
It hurts him a lot when he goes <eol> out looking for a job, <eob> and he's turned away <eob> with a small amount of money <eol> paid to him out of pity. <eob>
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money, <eob> I just want to earn it." <eob>
Mohammed today is 21 years old. <eob>
He's illiterate, <eob> and he communicates with voice messages. <eob>
Here is one of his messages. <eob> (Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic) <eob>
Laura Boushnak: <eol> He said, "My dream is to run, <eob> and I'm pretty sure once I start running, <eob> I would never stop." <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Imagine that you're a pig farmer. <eob>
You live on a small farm <eol> in the Philippines. <eob>
Your animals are your family's <eol> sole source of income -- <eob> as long as they're healthy. <eob> You know that any day, <eob> one of your pigs can catch the flu, <eob> the swine flu. <eob>
Living in tight quarters, one pig coughing and sneezing <eob> may soon lead to the next pig coughing <eol> and sneezing, <eob> until an outbreak of swine flu <eol> has taken over your farm. <eob>
If it's a bad enough virus, <eob> the health of your herd may be gone <eol> in the blink of an eye. <eob>
If you called in a veterinarian, <eob> he or she would visit <eol> your farm and take samples <eob> from your pigs' noses and mouths. <eob>
But then they would have to drive <eol> back into the city <eob> to test those samples <eol> in their central lab. <eob>
Two weeks later, <eol> you'd hear back the results. <eob>
Two weeks may be just enough time <eol> for infection to spread <eob> and take away your way of life. <eob>
But it doesn't have to be that way. <eob>
Today, farmers can take <eol> those samples themselves. <eob>
They can jump right into the pen <eol> and swab their pigs' noses and mouths <eob> with a little filter paper, <eob> place that little filter paper <eol> in a tiny tube, <eob> and mix it with some chemicals <eol> that will extract genetic material <eob> from their pigs' noses and mouths. <eob>
And without leaving their farms, <eob> they take a drop of that genetic material <eob> and put it into a little analyzer smaller <eol> than a shoebox, <eob> program it to detect DNA <eol> or RNA from <eob> the swine flu <eob> virus, <eob> and within one hour get back <eol> the results, visualize the results. <eob>
This reality is possible <eob> because today we're living in the era <eol> of personal DNA technology. <eob>
Every one of us <eol> can actually test DNA ourselves. <eob>
DNA is the fundamental molecule <eol> the carries genetic instructions <eob> that help build the living world. <eob> Humans have DNA. <eob> Pigs have DNA. <eob> Even bacteria and some viruses <eol> have DNA too. <eob>
The genetic instructions <eob> encoded in DNA <eol> inform how our bodies develop, <eob> grow, function. <eob>
And in many cases, that same information <eol> can trigger disease. <eob>
Your genetic information <eob> is strung into a long and twisted molecule, <eol> the DNA double helix, <eob> that has over three billion letters, <eob> beginning to end. <eob>
But the lines that carry meaningful information <eob> are usually very short -- <eob> a few dozen to several thousand letters long. <eob>
So when we're looking to answer <eol> a question based on DNA, <eob> we actually don't need to read <eob> all those three billion letters, typically. <eob>
That would be like getting hungry at night <eob> and having to flip through <eol> the whole phone book <eob> from cover to cover, <eob> pausing at every line, <eob> just to find the nearest <eol> pizza joint. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Luckily, three decades ago, <eob> humans started to invent tools <eob> that can find any specific line <eol> of genetic information. <eob>
These DNA machines are wonderful. <eob>
They can find any line in DNA. <eob>
But once they find it, <eob> that DNA is still tiny, <eol> and surrounded by so much other DNA, <eob> that what these machines then do <eol> is copy the target gene, <eob> and one copy piles <eol> on top of another, <eob> millions and millions and millions of copies, <eob> until that gene stands out against the rest; <eob> until we can visualize it, <eob> interpret it, read it, <eol> understand it, <eob> until we can answer: <eob> Does my pig have the flu? <eob>
Or other questions buried in our own DNA: <eob> Am I at risk of cancer? <eob>
Am I of Irish descent? <eob>
Is that child my son? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This ability to make copies of DNA, <eol> as simple as it sounds, <eob> has transformed our world. <eob>
Scientists use it every day <eol> to detect and address disease, <eob> to create innovative medicines, <eob> to modify foods, <eob> to assess whether our food is safe to eat <eob> or whether it's contaminated <eol> with deadly bacteria. <eob>
Even judges use the output <eol> of these machines in court <eob> to decide whether someone <eol> is innocent or guilty based on DNA evidence. <eob>
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique <eob> was awarded the Nobel Prize <eol> in Chemistry in 1993. <eob>
But for 30 years, <eob> the power of genetic analysis <eol> has been confined to the ivory tower, <eob> or bigwig PhD scientist work. <eob>
Well, several companies around the world <eob> are working on making this same technology accessible <eob> to everyday people like the pig farmer, <eob> like you. <eob>
I cofounded one of these companies. <eob>
Three years ago, <eob> together with a fellow <eol> biologist and friend of mine, <eob> Zeke Alvarez Saavedra, <eob> we decided to make <eol> personal DNA machines <eob> that anyone could use. <eob>
Our goal was to bring DNA science <eol> to more people in new places. <eob>
We started working in our basements. <eob>
We had a simple question: <eob> What could the world look like <eob> if everyone could analyze DNA? <eob> We were curious, <eob> as curious as you would have been <eol> if I had shown you this picture in 1980. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You would have thought, "Wow! <eob>
I can now call my Aunt Glenda from the car <eob> and wish her a happy birthday. <eob>
I can call anyone, anytime. <eob>
This is the future!" <eob> Little did you know, <eob> you would tap on that phone <eol> to make dinner reservations <eob> for you and Aunt Glenda to celebrate together. <eob>
With another tap, <eol> you'd be ordering her gift. <eob> And yet one more tap, <eob> and you'd be "liking" Auntie Glenda on Facebook. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And all of this, <eol> while sitting on the toilet. <eob> It is notoriously hard to predict <eol> where new technology might take us. <eob>
And the same is true for personal DNA <eol> technology today. <eob>
For example, I could never have imagined <eob> that a truffle farmer, of all people, <eob> would use personal DNA machines. <eob>
Dr. Paul Thomas grows truffles <eol> for a living. <eob>
We see him pictured here, <eob> holding the first UK-cultivated truffle in his hands, <eol> on one of his farms. <eob>
Truffles are this delicacy <eob> that stems from a fungus <eol> growing on the roots of living trees. <eob>
And it's a rare fungus. <eob>
Some species may fetch 3,000, 7,000, <eol> or more dollars per kilogram. <eob>
I learned from Paul <eob> that the stakes for a truffle farmer <eol> can be really high. <eob>
When he sources new truffles <eol> to grow on his farms, <eob> he's exposed to the threat <eol> of knockoffs -- <eob> truffles that look <eol> and feel like the real thing, <eob> but they're of lower quality. <eob>
But even to a trained eye like Paul's, <eob> even when looked at under a microscope, <eob> these truffles can pass for authentic. <eob>
So in order to grow <eol> the highest quality truffles, <eob> the ones that chefs all over <eol> the world will fight over, <eob> Paul has to use DNA analysis. <eob>
Isn't that mind-blowing? <eob>
I bet you will never look <eol> at that black truffle risotto again <eob> without thinking of its genes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But personal DNA machines <eol> can also save human lives. <eob>
Professor Ian Goodfellow <eol> is a virologist at the University of Cambridge. <eob>
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone. <eob>
When the Ebola outbreak broke <eol> out in Western Africa, <eob> he quickly realized that doctors <eol> there lacked the basic tools <eob> to detect and combat disease. <eob>
Results could take up to a week <eol> to come back -- <eob> that's way too long for the patients <eol> and the families who are suffering. <eob>
Ian decided to move his lab <eol> into Makeni, Sierra Leone. <eob>
Here we see Ian Goodfellow <eob> moving over 10 tons of equipment <eol> into a pop-up tent <eob> that he would equip <eol> to detect and diagnose the virus <eob> and sequence it within 24 hours. <eob>
But here's a surprise: <eob> the same equipment that Ian <eol> could use at his lab in the UK <eob> to sequence and diagnose Ebola, <eob> just wouldn't work under these conditions. <eob> We're talking 35 Celsius heat <eol> and over 90 percent humidity here. <eob>
But instead, Ian could use <eol> personal DNA machines <eob> small enough to be placed <eol> in front of the air-conditioning unit <eob> to keep sequencing the virus <eob> and keep saving lives. <eob>
This may seem like an extreme <eol> place for DNA analysis, <eob> but let's move on to an even <eol> more extreme environment: <eob> outer space. <eob> Let's talk about DNA analysis in space. <eob>
When astronauts live aboard <eol> the International Space Station, <eob> they're orbiting the planet 250 miles high. <eob>
They're traveling at 17,000 miles per hour. <eob>
Picture that -- <eob> you're seeing 15 sunsets <eol> and sunrises every day. <eob>
You're also living in microgravity, <eob> floating. <eob> And under these conditions, <eol> our bodies can do funky things. <eob>
One of these things is that our immune <eol> systems get suppressed, <eob> making astronauts more prone to infection. <eob>
A 16-year-old girl, <eob> a high school student <eol> from New York, Anna-Sophia Boguraev, <eob> wondered whether changes <eol> to the DNA of astronauts <eob> could be related to this immune suppression, <eob> and through a science competition <eol> called "Genes In Space," <eob> Anna-Sophia designed an experiment <eol> to test this hypothesis <eob> using a personal DNA machine aboard <eol> the International Space Station. <eob>
Here we see Anna-Sophia on April 8, 2016, <eol> in Cape Canaveral, <eob> watching her experiment launch <eol> to the International Space Station. <eob>
That cloud of smoke is the rocket <eob> that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment <eol> to the International Space Station, <eob> where, three days later, <eob> astronaut Tim Peake carried out her experiment -- <eob> in microgravity. <eob>
Personal DNA machines are now aboard <eol> the International Space Station, <eob> where they can help monitor living conditions <eob> and protect the lives of astronauts. <eob>
A 16-year-old designing <eol> a DNA experiment <eob> to protect the lives of astronauts <eob> may seem like a rarity, <eol> the mark of a child genius. <eob>
Well, to me, it signals <eol> something bigger: <eob> that DNA technology is finally within <eol> the reach of every one of you. <eob>
A few years ago, <eob> a college student <eol> armed with a personal computer <eob> could code an app, <eob> an app that is now a social network <eol> with more than one billion users. <eob>
Could we be moving into a world <eob> of one personal DNA machine in every home? <eob>
I know families who are already <eol> living in this reality. <eob>
The Daniels family, for example, <eob> set up a DNA lab <eol> in the basement of their suburban Chicago home. <eob>
This is not a family <eol> made of PhD scientists. <eob>
This is a family like any other. <eob>
They just like to spend time <eol> together doing fun, creative things. <eob>
By day, Brian is an executive <eol> at a private equity firm. <eob>
At night and on weekends, <eol> he experiments with DNA <eob> alongside his kids, ages seven <eol> and nine, <eob> as a way to explore the living world. <eob>
Last time I called them, <eob> they were checking out homegrown <eol> produce from the backyard garden. <eob>
They were testing tomatoes <eol> that they had picked, <eob> taking the flesh of their skin, <eol> putting it in a test tube, <eob> mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA <eob> and then using their home DNA copier <eob> to test those tomatoes <eol> for genetically engineered traits. <eob>
For the Daniels family, <eob> the personal DNA machine <eol> is like the chemistry set <eob> for the 21st century. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Most of us may not yet be <eol> diagnosing genetic conditions <eob> in our kitchen sinks <eob> or doing at-home paternity testing. <eob>
But we've definitely reached a point in history <eob> where every one of you could <eol> actually get hands-on with DNA <eob> in your kitchen. <eob>
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA <eob> and extract meaningful information from it. <eob>
And it's at times like this <eol> that profound transformation <eob> is bound to happen; <eob> moments when a transformative, powerful technology <eob> that was before limited <eol> to a select few in the ivory tower, <eob> finally becomes within the reach <eol> of every one of us, <eob> from farmers to schoolchildren. <eob>
Think about the moment <eob> when phones stopped being plugged <eol> into the wall by cords, <eob> or when computers left the mainframe <eob> and entered your home or your office. <eob>
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution <eob> may be hard to predict, <eob> but one thing is certain: <eob> revolutions don't go backwards, <eob> and DNA technology <eol> is already spreading faster than our imagination. <eob>
So if you're curious, <eob> get up close and personal <eol> with DNA -- today. <eob>
It is in our DNA to be curious. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As a lover of human anatomy, <eob> I'm so excited that we're finally <eol> putting our bodies at the center of focus. <eob>
Through practices <eol> such as preventive medicine, <eob> patient empowerment <eob> and self-monitoring -- <eob> down to now obsessing <eol> over every single step we take in a day. <eob>
All of this works to promote <eob> a healthy connection <eol> between ourselves and our bodies. <eob>
Despite all this focus <eol> on the healthy self, <eob> general public knowledge <eol> of the anatomical self is lacking. <eob>
Many people don't know <eol> the location of their vital organs, <eob> or even how they function. <eob>
And that's because human anatomy <eob> is a difficult and time-intensive <eol> subject to learn. <eob>
How many of you here <eol> made it through anatomy? <eob>
Wow, good -- <eob> most of you are in medicine. <eob>
I, like you, spent countless hours <eol> memorizing hundreds of structures. <eob>
Something no student of anatomy <eol> could do without the help of visuals. <eob>
Because at the end of the day, <eob> whether you remember <eol> every little structure or not, <eob> these medical illustrations are what <eol> makes studying anatomy so intriguing. <eob>
In looking at them, <eob> we're actually viewing <eol> a manual of our very selves. <eob>
But what happens when we're done studying? <eob>
These beautiful illustrations <eol> are then shut back <eob> into the pages of a medical textbook, <eob> or an app, <eob> referenced only when needed. <eob>
And for the public, <eob> medical illustrations may only be encountered passively <eob> on the walls of a doctor's office. <eob>
From the beginnings of modern medicine, <eob> medical illustration, <eob> and therefore anatomy, <eob> have existed primarily within <eol> the realm of medical education. <eob>
Yet there's something fascinating <eol> happening right now. <eob>
Artists are breaking anatomy <eol> out of the confines of the medical world <eob> and are thrusting it <eol> into the public space. <eob>
For the past nine years, <eol> I have been cataloguing and sharing <eob> this rise in anatomical art <eol> with the public -- <eob> all from my perspective <eol> as a medical illustrator. <eob>
But before I get into showing you <eol> how artists are reclaiming anatomy today, <eob> it's important to understand <eol> how art influenced anatomy in the past. <eob>
Now, anatomy is by its <eol> very nature a visual science, <eob> and the first anatomists to understand <eol> this lived during the Renaissance. <eob>
They relied on artists <eob> to help advertise their discoveries <eol> to their peers in the public. <eob>
And this drive to not only teach <eol> but also to entertain <eob> resulted in some of the strangest <eol> anatomical illustrations. <eob>
Anatomy was caught in a struggle <eol> between science, art and culture <eob> that lasted for over 500 years. <eob>
Artists rendered <eol> dissected cadavers as alive, <eob> posed in these humorous <eol> anatomical stripteases. <eob>
Imagine seeing that <eol> in your textbooks today. <eob>
They also showed them as very much dead -- <eob> unwillingly stripped of their skin. <eob>
Disembodied limbs were often <eol> posed in literal still lives. <eob>
And some illustrations <eol> even included pop culture references. <eob>
This is Clara, <eob> a famous rhinoceros that was <eol> traveling Europe in the mid-1700s, <eob> at a time when seeing a rhino <eol> was an exciting rarity. <eob>
Including her in this illustration <eol> was akin to celebrity sponsorship today. <eob>
The introduction of color <eob> then brought a whole new <eol> depth and clarity to anatomy <eob> that made it stunning. <eob>
By the early 20th century, <eob> the perfect balance of science <eol> and art had finally been struck <eob> with the emergence <eol> of medical illustrators. <eob>
They created a universal <eol> representation of anatomy -- <eob> something that was neither alive nor dead, <eob> that was free from those influences <eol> of artistic culture. <eob>
And this focus on no-frills accuracy <eob> was precisely for the benefit <eol> of medical education. <eob>
And this is what we <eol> get to study from today. <eob>
But why is it that <eob> medical illustration <eob> — <eob> both past and present — <eob> captures our imaginations? <eob>
Now, we are innately tuned <eol> into the beauty of the human body. <eob>
And <eob> medical illustration <eob> is still art. <eob> Nothing can elicit an emotional response — <eob> from joy to complete disgust — <eob> more than the human body. <eob>
And today, <eob> artists armed with that emotion, <eob> are grasping anatomy <eol> from the medical world, <eob> and are reinvigorating it through art <eol> in the most imaginative ways. <eob>
A perfect example of this is Spanish <eol> contemporary artist Fernando Vicente. <eob>
He takes 19th century anatomical <eol> illustrations of the male body <eob> and envelops them in a female sensuality. <eob>
The women in his paintings taunt us <eol> to view beyond their surface anatomy, <eob> thereby introducing a strong femininity <eob> that was previously lacking in the history <eol> of anatomical representation. <eob>
Artistry can also be seen in the repair <eol> and recovery of the human body. <eob>
This is an X-ray of a woman <eol> who fractured and dislocated her ankle <eob> in a roller-skating accident. <eob>
As a tribute to her trauma, <eob> she commissioned Montreal-based <eol> architect Federico Carbajal <eob> to construct a wire sculpture <eol> of her damaged lower leg. <eob>
Now, notice those bright red screws <eol> magnified in the sculpture. <eob>
These are the actual surgical screws <eol> used in reconstructing her ankle. <eob>
It's medical hardware <eol> that's been repurposed as art. <eob>
People often ask me how I choose <eol> the art that I showcase online <eob> or feature in gallery shows. <eob>
And for me it's a balance <eol> between the technique <eob> and a concept that pushes the boundaries <eol> of anatomy as a way to know thyself, <eob> which is why the work <eol> of Michael Reedy struck me. <eob>
His serious figure drawings <eol> are often layered in elements of humor. <eob>
For instance, take a look at her face. <eob>
Notice those red marks. <eob>
Michael manifests the consuming <eol> insecurity of a skin condition <eob> as these maniacal cartoon monsters <eob> annoying and out of control <eol> in the background. <eob>
On the mirrored figure, <eob> he renders the full anatomy <eob> and covers it in glitter, <eob> making it look like candy. <eob>
By doing this, <eob> Michael downplays <eol> the common perception of anatomy <eob> so closely tied to just disease and death. <eob>
Now, this next concept <eol> might not make much sense, <eob> but human anatomy <eol> is no longer limited to humans. <eob>
When you were a child, <eob> did you ever wish <eol> that your toys could come to life? <eob>
Well, Jason Freeny <eol> makes those dreams come true <eob> with his magical toy dissections. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
One might think <eol> that this would bring a morbid edge <eob> to one's innocent childhood characters, <eob> but Jason says of his dissections, <eob> "One thing I've never seen <eol> in a child's reaction to my work is fear." <eob> It's always wonder, <eob> amazement <eob> and wanting to explore. <eob>
Fear of anatomy and guts <eol> is a learned reaction. <eob>
This anatomization also extends to <eol> politically and socially charged objects. <eob>
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War," <eob> we see a gun dissected <eol> to reveal human organs. <eob>
But if you look closely, <eob> you'll notice that it lacks a brain. <eob>
And if you keep looking, <eol> you might also notice <eob> that Noah has so thoughtfully <eol> placed the rectum <eob> at the business end of that gun barrel. <eob>
Now, this next artist <eol> I've been following for many years, <eob> watching him excite <eol> the public about anatomy. <eob>
Danny Quirk is a young artist <eob> who paints his subjects <eol> in the process of self-dissection. <eob>
He bends the rules of <eob> medical illustration <eob> by inserting a very dramatic <eol> light and shadow. <eob>
And this creates a 3-D illusion <eob> that lends itself very well <eol> to painting directly on the human skin. <eob>
Danny makes it look as if a person's <eol> skin has actually been removed. <eob>
And this effect — <eob> also cool and tattoo-like — <eob> easily transitions into a <eob> medical illustration. <eob>
Now Danny is currently traveling the world, <eob> teaching anatomy <eol> to the public via his body paintings, <eob> which is why it was so shocking <eol> to find out <eob> that he was rejected from <eob> medical illustration <eob> programs. <eob>
But he's doing just fine. <eob>
Then there are artists <eob> who are extracting anatomy from both <eol> the medical world and the art world <eob> and are placing it <eol> directly on the streets. <eob>
London-based SHOK-1 paints <eol> giant X-rays of pop culture icons. <eob>
His X-rays show how culture <eol> can come to have an anatomy of its own, <eob> and conversely how culture can become <eol> part of the anatomy of a person. <eob>
You come to admire his work <eob> because reproducing X-rays by hand, <eol> let alone with spray paint, <eob> is extremely difficult. <eob>
But then again this is a street artist, <eob> who also happens to hold <eol> a degree in applied chemistry. <eob>
Nychos, an Austrian street artist, <eob> takes the term "exploded view" <eol> to a whole new level, <eob> splattering human and animal dissections <eol> on walls all over the world. <eob>
Influenced by comics and heavy metal, <eob> Nychos inserts a very youthful <eol> and enticing energy into anatomy <eob> that I just love. <eob>
Street artists believe <eol> that art belongs to the public. <eob>
And this street anatomy is so captivating <eob> because it is the furthest removed <eol> from the medical world. <eob>
It forces you to look at it, <eob> and confront your own <eol> perceptions about anatomy, <eob> whether you find it beautiful, <eob> gross, <eob> morbid <eob> or awe-inspiring, like I do. <eob>
That it elicits these responses at all <eob> is due to our intimate <eol> and often changing relationship with it. <eob>
All of the artists <eol> that I showed you here today <eob> referenced medical <eol> illustrations for their art. <eob> But for them, <eob> anatomy isn't just something to memorize, <eob> but a base from which to understand <eol> the human body on a meaningful level; <eob> to depict it in ways that we can relate, <eob> whether it be through cartoons, <eob> body painting <eob> or street art. <eob>
Anatomical art has the power <eob> to reach far beyond <eol> the pages of a medical textbook, <eob> to ignite an excitement in the public, <eob> and reinvigorate an enthusiasm <eol> in the medical world, <eob> ultimately connecting our innermost selves <eol> with our bodies through art. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I spend most of my time <eob> thinking about little girls, <eob> which is kind of a weird thing <eol> for a grown man in our society to say. <eob> But I do. I spend most of my time <eol> thinking about little girls, <eob> and I think it's primarily because <eol> I have one. <eob>
This one's mine, and I think <eol> you would really like her. <eob>
She is smart and funny <eob> and kind to people and a good friend. <eob>
But when I talk about my daughter, <eol> the word I find myself saying most <eob> is "athlete." <eob> My kid's athletic. <eob>
She is strong and fast <eob> and has great balance <eol> and good body control. <eob>
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion <eob> in Shaolin Kempo. <eob>
At nine years old, she is already halfway <eol> to a black belt. <eob>
My daughter is athletic. <eob>
Now, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds <eol> stands in front of you <eob> and says his daughter is athletic, <eob> you might think <eol> that's a reflection of him. <eob> It is not. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My wife in high school <eol> was a two-time all-state soccer player <eob> and a two-time all-state volleyball player, <eob> and I played "Dungeons and Dragons." <eob> And that is why, <eob> although my daughter <eol> is an athlete, <eob> she's also a huge nerd, which I love. <eob>
She walks around our house <eol> in a cloak of flames <eob> that she made herself. <eob>
She sits on the Iron Throne -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
even though she has never seen <eol> "Game of Thrones," <eob> primarily because we are not the worst <eol> parents who ever lived. <eob>
But she knows there's someone <eol> called the Mother of Dragons, <eob> and she calls herself that and she loves it. <eob>
She's a huge comic book fan. <eob>
Right now, her favorite character is Groot. <eob> She loves Groot. <eob> She adores The Incredible Hulk. <eob>
But my daughter really at heart, <eob> her thing is Star Wars. <eob>
My kid is a Jedi. <eob>
Although some days she's also a Sith, <eob> which is a choice that I can respect. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But here's the question <eol> that I have to ask. <eob> Why is it that when my daughter dresses up, <eob> whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk, <eob> whether it's Obi-Wan <eol> Kenobi or Darth Maul, <eob> why is every character she dresses up as a boy? <eob>
And where are all the female superheroes? <eob>
And that is not actually the question, <eob> because there's plenty <eol> of female superheroes. <eob>
My question really is, where is all <eol> the female superhero stuff? <eob>
Where are the costumes? <eol> Where are the toys? <eob>
Because every day when my daughter <eol> plays when she dresses up, <eob> she's learning stuff <eob> through a process that, <eol> in my own line of work, <eob> as a professor of media studies, <eob> we refer to as public pedagogy. <eob>
That is, it is how societies <eol> are taught ideologies. <eob>
It's how you learned what it meant <eol> to be a man or a woman, <eob> what it meant to behave yourself in public, <eob> what it meant to be a patriot <eol> and have good manners. <eob>
It's all the constituent social relations <eol> that make us up as a people. <eob>
It's, in short, how we learn <eol> what we know about other people <eob> and about the world. <eob>
But we live in a 100-percent <eol> media-saturated society. <eob>
What that means is that every single aspect <eol> of your human existence <eob> outside of your basic bodily functions <eob> is in some way touched by media. <eob>
From the car that you drive <eol> to the food that you eat <eob> to the clothes that you wear <eob> to the way you construct your relationships <eob> to the very language you use <eol> to formulate thought -- <eob> all of that is in some way <eol> mediated. <eob>
So the answer in our society <eob> to how do we learn what we know <eol> about other people <eob> and about the world <eob> is largely through media. <eob>
Well, there's a wrinkle in that, <eob> in that our society, <eob> media don't simply exist <eol> as information distribution technologies and devices. <eob>
They also exist as corporate entities. <eob>
And when the distribution of information <eol> is tied to financial gain, <eob> there's a problem. <eob>
How big of a problem? <eob>
Well think about this: <eob> in 1983, 90 percent of American media <eol> were owned by 50 companies. <eob>
In any market, 50 companies <eol> doing something is a lot of companies. <eob>
It's a lot of different worldviews. <eob>
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six, <eob> six companies. <eob> They are NBCUniversal Comcast, <eol> AOL Time Warner, <eob> the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation. <eob>
These <eob> six companies <eob> produce nine out of every 10 movies <eol> you watch, <eob> nine out of every 10 television shows, <eol> nine out of every 10 songs, <eob> nine out of every 10 books. <eob>
So my question to you is, <eob> if <eob> six companies <eob> control 90 percent of American media, <eob> how much influence do you think <eol> they have over what you're allowed to see every day? <eob>
Because in media studies, <eob> we spend a lot of time saying <eol> that media can't tell us what to think, <eob> and they can't; <eol> they're terrible at that. <eob>
But that's not their job. <eob>
Media don't tell us what to think. <eob> Media tell us what to think about. <eob>
They control the conversation, <eob> and in controlling the conversation, <eob> they don't have to get you to think <eol> what they want you to think. <eob>
They'll just get you thinking about the things <eol> they want you to think about, <eob> and more importantly, not thinking about things <eol> they don't want you to think about. <eob>
They control the conversation, <eob>
How does this work in practice? <eob> Let's just take one of those companies. <eob> We'll do an easy one. <eob>
Let's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second. <eob>
The reason why I always pick <eol> the Walt Disney Company is this. <eob>
Is there a single person in this room <eol> who has never seen a Disney movie? <eob> Look around. Exactly. <eob> I picked Disney because they have <eol> what we call 100 percent penetration <eob> in our society. <eob>
Every single person <eol> has been exposed to Disney, <eob> so it's an easy one for me to use. <eob>
Since 1937, Disney has made most <eol> of its money selling princesses to girls. <eob>
It's made a huge chunk of its money. <eob>
Unless, of course, the princess <eol> your daughter is interested in, <eob> as my daughter is, is this one. <eob>
See, in 2012, <eob> Disney purchased LucasFilm <eol> for the sum of four billion dollars, <eob> and immediately they flooded the Disney <eol> stores with Han Solo <eob> and Obi-Wan Kenobi, <eol> with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and Yoda <eob> and not Princess Leia. <eob> Why? Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy <eob> for these princesses. <eob>
So Disney did not put Princess <eol> Leia merchandise in the store, <eob> and when people went <eol> to Disney and said, <eob> "Hey, where's all the Princess <eol> Leia stuff?" <eob> Disney said, <eol> "We have no intention <eob> of putting Princess <eol> Leia merchandise in the store." <eob> And fans were angry and they took to Twitter <eob> with the hashtag #WeWantLeia. <eob>
And Disney said, "Wait, <eol> that's not what we meant. <eob>
What we meant was, <eob> we don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will." <eob> And that was in 2012, and it is 2015, <eob> and if you go to the Disney Store, <eol> as I recently have, <eob> and look for Princess Leia merchandise, <eob> do you know how many Princess Leia items <eol> there are in the Disney Store? <eob>
Zero, because Disney has no intention <eol> of putting Princess Leia in the store. <eob>
And we shouldn't be surprised <eol> because we found out that was their policy <eob> when they bought Marvel in 2009 <eob> for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars. <eob>
Because when you make a lot of money <eol> selling princesses to girls, <eob> you also kind of want <eol> to make money from boys. <eob>
And so what better to sell boys <eol> than superheroes? <eob>
So now Disney had access <eol> to Captain America and to Thor, <eob> The Incredible Hulk, <eob> and they had access even <eob> to a group of superheroes <eol> no one had ever even heard of. <eob>
That's how good Marvel <eol> was at selling superheroes. <eob>
Last year, they released a film called "Guardians <eol> of the Galaxy." <eob> It's a film that absolutely should not work. <eob>
Nobody knew who they were except <eol> for comic book nerds like me. <eob>
One of the characters is a talking tree. <eob>
One of the characters <eol> is an anthropomorphic raccoon. <eob>
It should not work. <eob> And they made a killing <eol> off of "Guardians of the Galaxy." <eob>
This character here in the middle, <eol> her name is Gamora. <eob>
She's played by Zoe Saldana, <eob> and she is strong and smart and fast <eol> and fights like a ninja, <eob> and she is played by a beautiful black woman, <eob> and my daughter fell in love with her. <eob>
So like any good nerd dad, <eol> I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff, <eob> and when I got to the store, <eol> I learned a very interesting thing. <eob>
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack, <eob> well, Gamora's not on it. <eob>
They probably should have marketed this <eol> as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, <eol> she wasn't on it, <eob> and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt, <eob> she wasn't on it. <eob>
And as a matter of fact, <eob> if I went to the store, as I did, <eob> and looked at the display, <eob> you would find a small picture <eol> of Gamora right here, <eob> but if you look at any <eol> of the actual merchandise on that shelf, <eob> Gamora is not on any of it. <eob>
Now, I could have taken to Twitter <eol> with the hashtag #WheresGamora, <eob> like millions of fans did across the world, <eob> but the truth was I wasn't <eol> even really that surprised, <eob> because I was there when Disney <eol> had released "The Avengers." <eob> And just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, <eol> the "Age of Ultron," <eob> and we were very excited, <eob> because there was not one <eol> but two female superheroes, <eob> Scarlet Witch and Black Widow. <eob>
And we were very excited. <eob>
But here's the real thing about this. <eob>
Even though Scarlett Johansson, <eob> who is one of the most popular actresses <eol> in America, plays Black Widow, <eob> and Black Widow is the star <eob> of not one, not two, <eol> but five different Marvel movies, <eob> there is not a single piece <eol> of Black Widow merchandise available. <eob> Not one. <eob> And if you go to the Disney store <eol> and look for a Black Widow costume, <eob> what you will find, is you will find Captain America and <eob> The Incredible Hulk. <eob>
You will find Iron Man and Thor. <eob>
You will even find War Machine, <eob> who isn't even really in the movie <eol> that long. <eob>
Who you will not find is Black Widow. <eob>
And I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, <eol> as many people did, <eob> # WheresNatasha. <eob>
But I'm tired of doing that. <eob>
I'm tired of having to do that. <eob>
All over the country right now, <eob> there are kids playing <eol> with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set, <eob> where Captain America rides <eol> a motorcycle out of a moving jet <eob> and it's really awesome. <eob>
You know how awesome it is? <eob>
So awesome that when it happened <eol> in the movie, <eob> it was Black Widow that did it. <eob>
Not only has she been erased, <eob> but she has been replaced <eol> with a male figure. <eob>
And so what is this teaching us? <eob>
I mean, over the next five years, <eob> Disney and Warner Bros. and a bunch of movie studios <eob> are going to release over 30 feature-length films <eob> with comic book characters, <eob> and of those 30 feature-length films, <eob> exactly two of them will have female solo leads. <eob> Two. <eob> Now, there will be females in the rest of these movies, <eob> but they will be sidekicks, <eol> they will be love interests, <eob> they will be members of teams. <eob> They will not be the main character. <eob>
And if what we learn, what we know <eob> about other people <eob> and about the world <eob> we learn through media, <eob> then these companies are teaching <eol> my daughter that even if she is strong <eob> and smart and fast <eol> and fights like a ninja, <eob> all four of which are true of her, <eob> it doesn't matter. <eob>
She will either be ignored like Gamora <eob> or erased and replaced with a boy <eob> like Black Widow. <eob>
And it's not fair. <eob>
It's not fair to her and it's not fair to your sons <eol> and daughters either. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> I'm raising a little girl, <eol> and she has a little tomboy in her, <eob> which by the way is a terrible thing <eol> to call a girl. <eob>
What that basically is saying is, <eol> those traits that define you, <eob> they're not really yours, <eob> they're just on loan <eol> to you for a little while from boys. <eob>
But do you know how much grief <eol> she's going to take in her life <eob> for having a little tomboy in her? <eob> Zero. None. <eob> People will think it's cute. <eob>
They'll call her feisty, because <eob> in our society, <eob> adding so-called male traits to girls <eob> is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus. <eob>
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike. <eob>
Mike is a little boy in Florida. <eob>
He's 11 years old, <eob> and the thing that he loves <eol> most in the world <eob> is a show called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic," <eob> like millions of other <eol> children across America. <eob>
Now, the show is marketed <eol> to girls ages five to nine, <eob> but there are millions of boys <eob> and grown men <eob> who enjoy "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic." <eob> They have a club. <eob>
They call themselves Bronies, <eob> pony bros, guys who like ponies. <eob>
I happen to be one of them. <eob>
And what are Mike and myself <eob> and millions of other boys <eol> and men learning in this feminine, <eob> sissified world of "My Little Pony?" <eob> Well, they're learning <eol> to study hard and to work hard and to party hard <eob> and to look good and to feel good <eob> and to do good, <eob> and heaven preserve us from teaching <eol> these wussified concepts to boys. <eob>
So the other kids in his neighborhood <eol> pick on Mike and they beat him up <eob> and they make fun of him, <eob> and at 11 years old, Mike goes home, <eob> finds a belt, wraps it <eol> around his neck, <eob> and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed. <eob>
Because we have developed a society <eob> in which you would rather be dead as a boy <eol> than thought of as liking stuff for girls. <eob>
And that is not Mike's fault. <eol> That is our fault. <eob>
We have failed him. <eob>
We have failed our children. <eob>
And we have to do better for them. <eob>
We have to stop making it <eol> so that the only female superheroes <eob> appear on shirts <eol> that are pink and cut for girls. <eob> We have to stop. <eob>
And when I was putting this together, <eol> people said to me, <eob> "Well, that's never going to happen." <eol> And I said, "Oh really?" <eob> Because just this year, <eol> Target announced <eob> that they were going to stop <eol> gendering their toy aisles. <eob>
They were going to mix it up. <eob>
Now, before we break our shoulders <eol> patting Target on the back, <eob> just this week they released a shirt <eob> in which one of the most iconic scenes <eol> in "Star Wars: A New Hope" <eob> where Princess Leia stands up <eol> to the Dark Lord of the Sith, <eob> was released on a t-shirt <eob> in which she's mysteriously replaced by Luke. <eob>
So let's don't pat ourselves <eol> on the back too much. <eob>
Just this week also, <eob> Disney announced it was no longer <eol> going to gender its Halloween costumes, <eob> which I say, "Thank you, Disney, <eob> except the only costumes you make <eol> are of male superheroes, <eob> so does it matter who you have wearing them?" <eob> Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie, <eob> announced they're going to release <eol> a line of DC superhero girls. <eob>
And the funny thing is, <eob> they met with girls <eob> and asked them what they wanted <eol> to see in dolls, <eob> and you can see, they have calves <eob> and elbows that bend so <eol> they can do superhero stuff. <eob>
And please buy them. <eob>
And don't just buy them for your daughters, <eob> buy them for your sons. <eob>
Because it's important that boys <eol> play with and as female superheroes <eob> just as my daughter plays with <eol> and as male superheroes. <eob>
As a matter of fact, what I would love <eob> is a world in which every person <eol> who goes to the store <eob> goes with a little flowchart in their head <eob> of whether or not <eol> they should buy this toy for a boy or a girl, <eob> and it's a real simple flowchart because <eol> it only has one question on it. <eob>
It says, "Is this toy operated <eol> with your genitals?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If the answer is yes, <eob> then that is not a toy for children. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And if the answer is no, <eob> then it's for boys and girls. <eob>
It's really simple. <eob>
Because today is about the future <eol> of the future, and in my future, <eob> boys and girls <eol> are equally respected, <eob> equally valued, and most importantly, <eol> equally represented. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The technology likely to have <eol> the greatest impact <eob> on the next few decades <eob> has arrived. <eob>
And it's not social media. <eob>
It's not big data. <eob>
It's not robotics. <eob>
It's not even AI. <eob>
You'll be surprised to learn <eob> that it's the underlying technology <eol> of digital currencies like Bitcoin. <eob>
It's called the blockchain. Blockchain. <eob>
Now, it's not the most sonorous word in the world, <eob> but I believe that this is now <eob> the next generation of the internet, <eob> and that it holds vast promise <eol> for every business, every society <eob> and for all of you, individually. <eob>
You know, for the past few decades, <eol> we've had the internet of information. <eob>
And when I send you an email <eol> or a PowerPoint file or something, <eob> I'm actually not sending you <eol> the original, <eob> I'm sending you a copy. <eob>
And that's great. <eob>
This is democratized information. <eob>
But when it comes to assets -- <eob> things like money, <eob> financial assets like stocks and bonds, <eob> loyalty points, intellectual property, <eob> music, art, a vote, <eob> carbon credit and other assets -- <eob> sending you a copy is a really bad idea. <eob>
If I send you 100 dollars, <eob> it's really important <eol> that I don't still have the money -- <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
and that I can't send it to you. <eob>
This has been called the "double-spend" problem <eob> by cryptographers for a long time. <eob>
So today, we rely entirely <eol> on big intermediaries -- <eob> middlemen like banks, government, <eob> big social media companies, <eol> credit card companies and so on -- <eob> to establish trust in our economy. <eob>
And these intermediaries perform <eol> all the business and transaction logic <eob> of every kind of commerce, <eob> from authentication, identification of people, <eob> through to clearing, settling <eol> and record keeping. <eob>
And overall, they do a pretty good job. <eob>
But there are growing problems. <eob>
To begin, they're centralized. <eob>
That means they can be hacked, <eol> and increasingly are -- <eob> JP Morgan, the US Federal Government, <eob> LinkedIn, Home Depot and others <eob> found that out the hard way. <eob>
They exclude billions of people <eol> from the global economy, <eob> for example, people <eol> who don't have enough money <eob> to have a bank account. <eob>
They slow things down. <eob>
It can take a second for an email <eol> to go around the world, <eob> but it can take days or weeks <eob> for money to move through the banking <eol> system across a city. <eob>
And they take a big piece of the action -- <eob> 10 to 20 percent just to <eol> send money to another country. <eob>
They capture our data, <eob> and that means we can't monetize it <eob> or use it to better manage our lives. <eob>
Our privacy is being undermined. <eob>
And the biggest problem is that overall, <eob> they've appropriated <eol> the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically: <eob> we have wealth creation, <eol> but we have growing social inequality. <eob>
So what if there were not <eol> only an internet of information, <eob> what if there were an internet of value -- <eob> some kind of vast, global, <eol> distributed ledger <eob> running on millions of computers <eob> and available to everybody. <eob> And where every kind of asset, <eol> from money to music, <eob> could be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged and managed, <eob> all without powerful intermediaries? <eob>
What if there were a native <eol> medium for value? <eob>
Well, in 2008, <eol> the financial industry crashed <eob> and, perhaps propitiously, <eob> an anonymous person <eol> or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto <eob> created a paper where he developed <eol> a protocol for a digital cash <eob> that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. <eob>
And this cryptocurrency enabled people <eol> to establish trust and do transactions <eob> without a third party. <eob>
And this seemingly simple act set off a spark <eob> that ignited the world, <eob> that has everyone excited <eol> or terrified or otherwise interested <eob> in many places. <eob>
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin -- <eob> Bitcoin is an asset; <eol> it goes up and down, <eob> and that should be of interest <eol> to you if you're a speculator. <eob>
More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency. <eob>
It's not a fiat currency controlled <eol> by a nation-state. <eob>
And that's of greater interest. <eob>
But the real pony here <eol> is the underlying technology. <eob>
It's called blockchain. <eob>
So for the first time now in human history, <eob> people everywhere can trust each other <eob> and transact peer to peer. <eob>
And trust is established, <eol> not by some big institution, <eob> but by collaboration, by cryptography <eob> and by some clever code. <eob>
And because trust is native <eol> to the technology, <eob> I call this, "The Trust Protocol." <eob>
Now, you're probably wondering: <eol> How does this thing work? <eob> Fair enough. <eob> Assets -- digital assets <eol> like money to music and everything in between -- <eob> are not stored in a central place, <eob> but they're distributed <eol> across a global ledger, <eob> using the highest level <eol> of cryptography. <eob>
And when a transaction is conducted, <eob> it's posted globally, <eob> across millions and millions of computers. <eob>
And out there, around the world, <eob> is a group of people <eol> called "miners." <eob> These are not young people, <eol> they're Bitcoin miners. <eob>
They have massive computing power <eol> at their fingertips -- <eob> 10 to 100 times bigger <eol> than all of Google worldwide. <eob>
These miners do a lot of work. <eob>
And every 10 minutes, <eob> kind of like the heartbeat <eol> of a network, <eob> a block gets created <eob> that has all the transactions <eol> from the previous 10 minutes. <eob>
Then the miners get to work, <eol> trying to solve some tough problems. <eob>
And they compete: <eob> the first miner to find out the truth <eol> and to validate the block, <eob> is rewarded in digital currency, <eob> in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, <eol> with Bitcoin. <eob>
And then -- this is the key part -- <eob> that block is linked to the previous block <eob> and the previous block <eob> to create a chain of blocks. <eob>
And every one is time-stamped, <eob> kind of like with a digital waxed seal. <eob>
So if I wanted to go and hack a block <eob> and, say, pay you and you with the same money, <eob> I'd have to hack that block, <eob> plus all the preceding blocks, <eob> the entire history of commerce <eol> on that blockchain, <eob> not just on one computer <eol> but across millions of computers, <eob> simultaneously, <eob> all using the highest levels of encryption, <eob> in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world <eob> that's watching me. <eob> Tough to do. <eob> This is infinitely more secure <eob> than the computer systems that we have today. <eob> Blockchain. That's how it works. <eob>
So the Bitcoin blockchain <eol> is just one. <eob> There are many. <eob> The Ethereum blockchain <eol> was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin. <eob>
He's [22] years old, <eob> and this blockchain has some <eol> extraordinary capabilities. <eob>
One of them is that you can build <eol> smart contracts. <eob>
It's kind of what it sounds like. <eob>
It's a contract <eol> that self-executes, <eob> and the contract handles <eol> the enforcement, the management, performance <eob> and payment -- the contract <eol> kind of has a bank account, too, in a sense -- <eob> of agreements between people. <eob>
And today, on the Ethereum blockchain, <eob> there are projects underway to do everything <eob> from create a new replacement <eol> for the stock market <eob> to create a new model of democracy, <eob> where politicians are accountable to citizens. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So to understand <eol> what a radical change this is going to bring, <eob> let's look at one industry, <eol> financial services. <eob> Recognize this? <eob> Rube Goldberg machine. <eob> It's a ridiculously complicated <eol> machine that does something really simple, <eob> like crack an egg or shut a door. <eob>
Well, it kind of reminds me <eol> of the financial services industry, <eob> honestly. <eob>
I mean, you tap your card in the corner store, <eob> and a bitstream goes <eol> through a dozen companies, <eob> each with their own computer system, <eob> some of them being 1970s mainframes <eob> older than many of the people in this room, <eob> and three days later, a settlement occurs. <eob>
Well, with a blockchain financial industry, <eob> there would be no settlement, <eob> because the payment and the settlement <eol> is the same activity, <eob> it's just a change <eol> in the ledger. <eob>
So Wall Street and all around the world, <eob> the financial industry is in <eol> a big upheaval about this, <eob> wondering, can we be replaced, <eob> or how do we embrace this technology <eol> for success? <eob>
Now, why should you care? <eob>
Well, let me describe some applications. <eob> Prosperity. <eob> The first era of the internet, <eob> the internet of information, <eob> brought us wealth but not shared prosperity, <eob> because social inequality <eol> is growing. <eob>
And this is at the heart of all <eol> of the anger and extremism <eob> and protectionism and xenophobia and worse <eob> that we're seeing growing <eol> in the world today, <eob> Brexit being the most recent case. <eob>
So could we develop some new <eol> approaches to this problem of inequality? <eob>
Because the only approach today <eol> is to redistribute wealth, <eob> tax people and spread it around more. <eob>
Could we pre-distribute wealth? <eob>
Could we change the way <eol> that wealth gets created in the first place <eob> by democratizing wealth creation, <eob> engaging more people in the economy, <eob> and then ensuring that <eol> they got fair compensation? <eob>
Let me describe five ways <eol> that this can be done. <eob>
Number one: <eob> Did you know that 70 percent of the people <eol> in the world who have land <eob> have a tenuous title to it? <eob>
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras, <eol> some dictator comes to power, <eob> he says, "I know you've got a piece of paper <eol> that says you own your farm, <eob> but the government computer says <eol> my friend owns your farm." <eob> This happened on a mass scale in Honduras, <eob> and this problem exists everywhere. <eob>
Hernando de Soto, the great <eol> Latin American economist, <eob> says this is the number one issue <eol> in the world <eob> in terms of economic mobility, <eob> more important than having a bank account, <eob> because if you don't have <eol> a valid title to your land, <eob> you can't borrow against it, <eob> and you can't plan for the future. <eob>
So today, companies are working with governments <eob> to put land titles on a blockchain. <eob>
And once it's there, this is immutable. <eob>
You can't hack it. <eob>
This creates the conditions for prosperity <eob> for potentially billions of people. <eob>
Secondly: <eob> a lot of writers talk about Uber <eob> and Airbnb and TaskRabbit and Lyft <eol> and so on <eob> as part of the sharing economy. <eob>
This is a very powerful idea, <eob> that peers can come together <eol> and create and share wealth. <eob>
My view is that ... <eob> these companies are not really sharing. <eob>
In fact, they're successful precisely <eol> because they don't share. <eob>
They aggregate services together, <eol> and they sell them. <eob>
What if, rather than Airbnb being <eol> a $25 billion corporation, <eob> there was a distributed application on a blockchain, <eol> we'll call it B-Airbnb, <eob> and it was essentially owned <eol> by all of the people <eob> who have a room to rent. <eob>
And when someone wants <eol> to rent a room, <eob> they go onto the blockchain database <eol> and all the criteria, <eob> they sift through, <eol> it helps them find the right room, <eob> and then the blockchain <eol> helps with the contracting, <eob> it identifies the party, <eob> it handles the payments <eob> just through digital payments -- <eol> they're built into the system. <eob>
And it even handles reputation, <eob> because if she rates a room <eol> as a five-star room, <eob> that room is there, <eob> and it's rated, and it's immutable. <eob>
So, the big sharing-economy <eol> disruptors in Silicon Valley <eob> could be disrupted, <eob> and this would be good for prosperity. <eob>
Number three: <eob> the biggest flow <eol> of funds from the developed world <eob> to the developing world <eob> is not corporate investment, <eob> and it's not even foreign aid. <eob> It's remittances. <eob> This is the global diaspora; <eob> people have left their ancestral lands, <eob> and they're sending money <eol> back to their families at home. <eob>
This is 600 billion dollars <eol> a year, and it's growing, <eob> and these people are getting ripped off. <eob>
Analie Domingo is a housekeeper. <eob>
She lives in Toronto, <eob> and every month she goes <eol> to the Western Union office <eob> with some cash <eob> to send her remittances <eol> to her mom in Manila. <eob>
It costs her around 10 percent; <eob> the money takes four <eol> to seven days to get there; <eob> her mom never knows when it's <eol> going to arrive. <eob>
It takes five hours out <eol> of her week to do this. <eob>
Six months ago, <eob> Analie Domingo used a blockchain application <eol> called Abra. <eob>
And from her mobile device, <eol> she sent 300 bucks. <eob>
It went directly to her <eol> mom's mobile device <eob> without going through <eol> an intermediary. <eob>
And then her mom <eol> looked at her mobile device -- <eob> it's kind of like an Uber interface, <eol> there's Abra "tellers" moving around. <eob>
She clicks on a teller <eol> that's a five-star teller, <eob> who's seven minutes away. <eob>
The guy shows up at the door, <eol> gives her Filipino pesos, <eob> she puts them in her wallet. <eob>
The whole thing took minutes, <eob> and it cost her two percent. <eob>
This is a big opportunity for prosperity. <eob>
Number four: the most powerful <eol> asset of the digital age is data. <eob>
And data is really a new asset class, <eob> maybe bigger than previous asset classes, <eob> like land under the agrarian economy, <eob> or an industrial plant, <eob> or even money. <eob>
And all of you -- we -- create this data. <eob>
We create this asset, <eob> and we leave this trail <eol> of digital crumbs behind us <eob> as we go throughout life. <eob>
And these crumbs are collected <eol> into a mirror image of you, <eob> the virtual you. <eob>
And <eob> the virtual you <eob> may know more about you than you do, <eob> because you can't remember <eol> what you bought a year ago, <eob> or said a year ago, or your exact <eol> location a year ago. <eob>
And <eob> the virtual you <eob> is not owned by you — <eob> that's the big problem. <eob>
So today, there are companies working <eob> to create an identity in a black box, <eob> the virtual you <eob> owned by you. <eob>
And this black box moves around with you <eob> as you travel throughout the world, <eob> and it's very, very stingy. <eob>
It only gives away <eol> the shred of information <eob> that's required to do something. <eob>
A lot of transactions, <eob> the seller doesn't even need <eol> to know who you are. <eob>
They just need to know that they got paid. <eob>
And then this avatar <eol> is sweeping up all of this data <eob> and enabling you to monetize it. <eob>
And this is a wonderful thing, <eob> because it can also help us <eol> protect our privacy, <eob> and privacy is the foundation <eol> of a free society. <eob>
Let's get this asset that we create <eob> back under our control, <eob> where we can own our own identity <eob> and manage it responsibly. <eob>
Finally -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Finally, number five: <eob> there are a whole number <eol> of creators of content <eob> who don't receive fair compensation, <eob> because the system for intellectual <eol> property is broken. <eob>
It was broken by the first era <eol> of the internet. <eob> Take music. <eob> Musicians are left with crumbs <eol> at the end of the whole food chain. <eob>
You know, if you were a songwriter, <eol> 25 years ago, you wrote a hit song, <eob> it got a million singles, <eob> you could get royalties <eol> of around 45,000 dollars. <eob>
Today, you're a songwriter, <eol> you write a hit song, <eob> it gets a million streams, <eob> you don't get 45k, <eob> you get 36 dollars, <eob> enough to buy a nice pizza. <eob>
So Imogen Heap, <eob> the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, <eob> is now putting music on a blockchain ecosystem. <eob>
She calls it "Mycelia." <eob> And the music has a smart <eol> contract surrounding it. <eob>
And the music protects her <eol> intellectual property rights. <eob>
You want to listen to the song? <eob>
It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents <eol> that flow into a digital account. <eob>
You want to put the song <eol> in your movie, that's different, <eob> and the IP rights are all specified. <eob>
You want to make a ringtone? That's different. <eob> She describes that the song <eol> becomes a business. <eob>
It's out there on this platform marketing itself, <eob> protecting the rights of the author, <eob> and because the song has <eol> a payment system <eob> in the sense of bank account, <eob> all the money flows back to the artist, <eob> and they control the industry, <eob> rather than these powerful intermediaries. <eob>
Now, this is -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is not just songwriters, <eob> it's any creator of content, <eob> like art, <eob> like inventions, <eob> scientific discoveries, journalists. <eob>
There are all kinds of people <eol> who don't get fair compensation, <eob> and with blockchains, <eob> they're going to be able to make it <eol> rain on the blockchain. <eob>
And that's a wonderful thing. <eob>
So, these are five opportunities <eob> out of a dozen <eob> to solve one problem, prosperity, <eob> which is one of countless problems <eob> that blockchains are applicable to. <eob>
Now, technology doesn't create prosperity, <eol> of course -- people do. <eob>
But my case to you is that, once again, <eob> the technology genie has escaped from the bottle, <eob> and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons <eob> at this uncertain time in human history, <eob> and it's giving us <eol> another kick at the can, <eob> another opportunity to rewrite <eol> the economic power grid <eob> and the old order of things, <eob> and solve some of the world's <eol> most difficult problems, <eob> if we will it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There are things we say <eob> when we catch the eye of a stranger <eob> or a neighbor walking by. <eob>
We say, "Hello, how are you? <eob>
It's a beautiful day. <eob>
How do you feel? <eob> "These sound kind of meaningless, right? <eob>
And, in some ways, they are. <eob>
They have no semantic meaning. <eob>
It doesn't matter how you are <eol> or what the day is like. <eob>
They have something else. <eob>
They have social meaning. <eob>
What we mean when we say those things is: <eob> I see you there. <eob>
I'm obsessed with talking to strangers. <eob>
I make eye contact, say hello, <eob> I offer help, I listen. <eob>
I get all kinds of stories. <eob>
About seven years ago, <eol> I started documenting my experiences <eob> to try to figure out why. <eob>
What I found was that something <eol> really beautiful was going on. <eob>
This is almost poetic. <eob>
These were really profound experiences. <eob>
They were unexpected pleasures. <eob>
They were genuine emotional connections. <eob>
They were liberating moments. <eob>
So one day, I was standing on a corner <eol> waiting for the light to change, <eob> which, I'm a New Yorker, <eob> so that means I was actually standing <eol> in the street on the storm drain, <eob> as if that could get me across faster. <eob>
And there's an old man <eol> standing next to me. <eob>
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat <eol> and sort of an old-man hat, <eob> and he looked like somebody from a movie. <eob>
And he says to me, <eob> "Don't stand there. <eob>
You might disappear. <eob> "So this is absurd, right? <eob>
But I did what he said. <eob>
I stepped back onto the sidewalk. <eob>
And he smiled, and he said, <eob> "Good. You never know. <eob> I might have turned around, <eob> and zoop, you're gone." <eob>
This was weird, <eob> and also really wonderful. <eob>
He was so warm, and he was so happy <eol> that he'd saved me. <eob>
We had this little bond. <eob>
For a minute, I felt like my existence <eol> as a person <eob> had been noticed, <eob> and I was worth saving. <eob>
The really sad thing is, <eob> in many parts of the world, <eob> we're raised to believe <eol> that strangers are dangerous by default, <eob> that we can't trust them, <eol> that they might hurt us. <eob>
But most strangers aren't dangerous. <eob>
We're uneasy around them <eol> because we have no context. <eob>
We don't know what their intentions are. <eob>
So instead of using our perceptions <eol> and making choices, <eob> we rely on this category <eol> of "stranger." <eob>
I have a four-year-old. <eob> When I say hello to people on the street, <eob> she asks me why. <eob> She says, "Do we know them?" <eob>
I say, "No, they're our neighbor." <eob>
"Are they our friend?" <eob>
"No, it's just good to be friendly." <eob>
I think twice every time <eol> I say that to her, <eob> because I mean it, but as a woman, particularly, <eob> I know that not every stranger <eol> on the street has the best intentions. <eob>
It is good to be friendly, and it's good <eol> to learn when not to be, <eob> but none of that means we have to be afraid. <eob>
There are two huge benefits <eob> to using our senses instead of our fears. <eob>
The first one is that it liberates us. <eob>
When you think about it, <eob> using perception instead of categories <eob> is much easier said than done. <eob>
Categories are something our brains use. <eob>
When it comes to people, <eob> it's sort of a shortcut <eol> for learning about them. <eob>
We see male, female, young, old, <eob> black, brown, white, stranger, friend, <eob> and we use the information in that box. <eob>
It's quick, it's easy <eob> and it's a road to bias. <eob>
And it means we're not thinking <eol> about people as individuals. <eob>
I know an American researcher <eol> who travels frequently <eob> in Central Asia and Africa, alone. <eob>
She's entering into towns and cities <eob> as a complete stranger. <eob>
She has no bonds, no connections. <eob>
She's a foreigner. <eob>
Her survival strategy is this: <eob> get one stranger to see you <eol> as a real, individual person. <eob>
If you can do that, it'll help other people <eol> see you that way, too. <eob>
The second benefit of using our senses <eol> has to do with intimacy. <eob>
I know it sounds a little counterintuitive, <eob> intimacy and strangers, <eob> but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling <eob> that sociologists call "fleeting intimacy." <eob> So, it's a brief experience <eol> that has emotional resonance and meaning. <eob>
It's the good feeling I got <eob> from being saved from the death trap <eol> of the storm drain by the old man, <eob> or how I feel like part of a community <eob> when I talk to somebody <eol> on my train on the way to work. <eob>
Sometimes it goes further. <eob> Researchers have found that people often feel <eol> more comfortable <eob> being honest and open about <eol> their inner selves with strangers <eob> than they do with their friends <eol> and their families -- <eob> that they often feel more understood <eol> by strangers. <eob>
This gets reported in the media <eol> with great lament. <eob> "Strangers communicate <eol> better than spouses!" <eob> It's a good headline, right? <eob>
I think it entirely misses the point. <eob>
The important thing about these studies <eob> is just how significant these interactions can be; <eob> how this special form of closeness <eob> gives us something we need as much <eol> as we need our friends <eob> and our families. <eob>
So how is it possible that we communicate <eol> so well with strangers? <eob>
There are two reasons. <eob>
The first one is that <eol> it's a quick interaction. <eob>
It has no consequences. <eob>
It's easy to be honest with someone <eol> you're never going to see again, right? <eob> That makes sense. <eob> The second reason is where it gets <eol> more interesting. <eob>
We have a bias when it comes <eol> to people we're close to. <eob>
We expect them to understand us. <eob>
We assume they do, <eob> and we expect them to read our minds. <eob>
So imagine you're at a party, <eob> and you can't believe that <eol> your friend or your spouse <eob> isn't picking up on it <eol> that you want to leave early. <eob>
And you're thinking, <eob> "I gave you the look." <eob>
With a stranger, we have <eol> to start from scratch. <eob>
We tell the whole story, <eob> we explain who the people are, <eol> how we feel about them; <eob> we spell out all the inside jokes. <eob> And guess what? <eob> Sometimes they do understand us <eol> a little better. <eob>
OK. <eob> So now that we know that talking <eol> to strangers matters, <eob> how does it work? <eob>
There are unwritten rules <eol> we tend to follow. <eob>
The rules are very different depending <eol> on what country you're in, <eob> what culture you're in. <eob>
In most parts of the US, <eob> the baseline expectation in public <eob> is that we maintain a balance <eol> between civility and privacy. <eob>
This is known as civil inattention. <eob>
So, imagine two people are walking <eol> towards each other on the street. <eob>
They'll glance at each other <eol> from a distance. <eob>
That's the civility, the acknowledgment. <eob>
And then as they get closer, <eol> they'll look away, <eob> to give each other some space. <eob>
In other cultures, <eob> people go to extraordinary lengths <eol> not to interact at all. <eob>
People from Denmark tell me <eob> that many Danes are so averse <eol> to talking to strangers, <eob> that they would rather miss their stop <eol> on the bus <eob> than say "excuse me" to someone <eol> that they need to get around. <eob>
Instead, there's this elaborate shuffling of bags <eob> and using your body to say <eol> that you need to get past, <eob> instead of using two words. <eob>
In Egypt, I'm told, <eob> it's rude to ignore a stranger, <eob> and there's a remarkable culture <eol> of hospitality. <eob>
Strangers might ask each other <eol> for a sip of water. <eob>
Or, if you ask someone for directions, <eob> they're very likely to invite you home for coffee. <eob>
We see these unwritten rules most clearly <eol> when they're broken, <eob> or when you're in a new place <eob> and you're trying to figure out <eol> what the right thing to do is. <eob>
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit <eol> is where the action is. <eob>
In case it's not clear, I really <eol> want you to do this. OK? <eob> So here's how it's going to go. <eob>
Find somebody who is making eye contact. <eob>
That's a good signal. <eob>
The first thing is a simple smile. <eob>
If you're passing somebody <eol> on the street or in the hallway here, smile. <eob> See what happens. <eob>
Another is triangulation. <eob> There's you, there's a stranger, <eob> there's some third thing <eol> that you both might see and comment on, <eob> like a piece of public art <eob> or somebody preaching in the street <eob> or somebody wearing funny clothes. <eob> Give it a try. <eob> Make a comment about that third thing, and see <eol> if starts a conversation. <eob>
Another is what I call noticing. <eob>
This is usually giving a compliment. <eob>
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes. <eob>
I'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now, <eob> but shoes are fabulous in general. <eob>
And they're pretty neutral as far <eol> as giving compliments goes. <eob>
People always want to tell you things <eol> about their awesome shoes. <eob>
You may have already experienced <eol> the dogs and babies principle. <eob>
It can be awkward <eol> to talk to someone on the street; <eob> you don't know how they're going to respond. <eob>
But you can always talk <eol> to their dog or their baby. <eob>
The dog or the baby <eob> is a social conduit to the person, <eob> and you can tell by how they respond <eob> whether they're open to talking more. <eob>
The last one I want to challenge you to <eob> is disclosure. <eob>
This is a very vulnerable thing to do, <eob> and it can be very rewarding. <eob>
So next time you're talking to a stranger <eob> and you feel comfortable, <eob> tell them something true about yourself, <eob> something really personal. <eob>
You might have that experience <eol> I talked about of feeling understood. <eob>
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up, <eob> people ask me, "What does your dad do?" <eol> or, "Where does he live?" <eob> And sometimes I tell them the whole truth, <eob> which is that he died when I was a kid. <eob>
Always in those moments, <eob> they share their own experiences of loss. <eob>
We tend to meet disclosure <eol> with disclosure, <eob> even with strangers. <eob>
So, here it is. <eob> When you talk to strangers, <eol> you're making beautiful interruptions <eob> into the expected narrative of your daily <eol> life <eob> and theirs. <eob>
You're making unexpected connections. <eob>
If you don't talk to strangers, <eol> you're missing out on all of that. <eob>
We spend a lot of time <eob> teaching our children about strangers. <eob>
What would happen <eol> if we spent more time teaching ourselves? <eob>
We could reject all the ideas <eol> that make us so suspicious of each other. <eob>
We could make a space for change. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The conventional wisdom <eol> about our world today <eob> is that this is a time <eol> of terrible decline. <eob>
And that's not surprising, <eol> given the bad news all around us, <eob> from ISIS to inequality, <eob> political dysfunction, climate change, <eob> Brexit, and on and on. <eob> But here's the thing, <eol> and this may sound a little weird. <eob>
Look, it's not that <eol> I don't see the problems. <eob> I read the same headlines that you do. <eob>
What I dispute is the conclusion <eol> that so many people draw from them, <eob> namely that we're all screwed <eob> because the problems are unsolvable <eob> and our governments are useless. <eob>
Now, why do I say this? <eob> It's not like I'm particularly <eol> optimistic by nature. <eob>
But something about the media's <eol> constant doom-mongering <eob> with its fixation on problems <eol> and not on answers <eob> has always really bugged me. <eob>
So a few years ago I decided, <eob> well, I'm a journalist, <eob> I should see if I can do any better <eob> by going around the world <eol> and actually asking folks <eob> if and how they've tackled <eob> their big economic <eol> and political challenges. <eob>
And what I found astonished me. <eob>
It turns out that there are remarkable <eol> signs of progress out there, <eob> often in the most unexpected places, <eob> and they've convinced me <eol> that our great global challenges <eob> may not be so unsolvable after all. <eob>
Not only are there theoretical fixes; <eob> those fixes have been tried. <eob> They've worked. <eob> And they offer hope for the rest of us. <eob>
I'm going to show you what I mean <eob> by telling you about <eol> how three of the countries I visited -- <eob> Canada, Indonesia and Mexico -- <eob> overcame three supposedly <eol> impossible problems. <eob>
Their stories matter because they contain <eol> tools the rest of us can use, <eob> and not just for those <eol> particular problems, <eob> but for many others, too. <eob>
When most people think <eol> about my homeland, Canada, today, <eob> if they think about Canada at all, <eob> they think cold, they think boring, <eol> they think polite. <eob>
They think we say "sorry" too much <eol> in our funny accents. <eob>
And that's all true. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sorry. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But Canada's also important <eob> because of its triumph over a problem <eob> currently tearing <eol> many other countries apart: <eob> immigration. <eob>
Consider, Canada today is among <eol> the world's most welcoming nations, <eob> even compared to other <eol> immigration-friendly countries. <eob>
Its per capita immigration rate <eol> is four times higher than France's, <eob> and its percentage <eol> of foreign-born residents <eob> is double that of Sweden. <eob>
Meanwhile, Canada admitted <eob> 10 times more Syrian refugees <eol> in the last year <eob> than did the United States. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And now Canada is taking even more. <eob>
And yet, if you ask Canadians <eob> what makes them proudest of their country, <eob> they rank "multiculturalism," <eob> a dirty word in most places, <eob> second, <eob> ahead of hockey. <eob> Hockey. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In other words, <eol> at a time when other countries <eob> are now frantically building <eol> new barriers to keep foreigners out, <eob> Canadians want even more of them in. <eob>
Now, here's the really interesting part. <eob>
Canada wasn't always like this. <eob>
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed <eol> an explicitly racist immigration policy. <eob>
They called it "White Canada," <eob> and as you can see, they were not <eol> just talking about the snow. <eob>
So how did that Canada <eol> become today's Canada? <eob>
Well, despite what my mom <eol> in Ontario will tell you, <eob> the answer had nothing to do with virtue. <eob>
Canadians are not inherently <eol> better than anyone else. <eob>
The real explanation involves the man <eol> who became Canada's leader in 1968, <eob> Pierre Trudeau, who is also <eol> the father of the current prime minister. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The thing to know about that first Trudeau <eob> is that he was very different <eol> from Canada's previous leaders. <eob>
He was a French speaker in a country <eol> long-dominated by its English elite. <eob>
He was an intellectual. <eob>
He was even kind of groovy. <eob>
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga. <eob>
He hung out with the Beatles. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And like all hipsters, <eol> he could be infuriating at times. <eob>
But he nevertheless pulled off <eob> one of the most progressive <eol> transformations any country has ever seen. <eob>
His formula, I've learned, <eol> involved two parts. <eob>
First, Canada threw out <eol> its old race-based immigration rules, <eob> and it replaced them <eol> with new color-blind ones <eob> that emphasized education, <eol> experience and language skills instead. <eob>
And what that did <eol> was greatly increase the odds <eob> that newcomers would <eol> contribute to the economy. <eob>
Then part two, Trudeau <eol> created the world's first policy <eob> of official multiculturalism <eol> to promote integration <eob> and the idea that diversity <eol> was the key to Canada's identity. <eob>
Now, in the years that followed, <eol> Ottawa kept pushing this message, <eob> but at the same time, ordinary Canadians <eob> soon started to see the economic, <eol> the material benefits of multiculturalism <eob> all around them. <eob>
And these two influences soon combined <eob> to create the passionately <eol> open-minded Canada of today. <eob>
Let's now turn to another country <eol> and an even tougher problem, <eob> Islamic extremism. <eob>
In 1998, the people of Indonesia <eol> took to the streets <eob> and overthrew <eol> their longtime dictator, Suharto. <eob>
It was an amazing moment, <eob> but it was also a scary one. <eob>
With 250 million people, <eob> Indonesia is the largest <eol> Muslim-majority country on Earth. <eob>
It's also hot, huge and unruly, <eob> made up of 17,000 islands, <eob> where people speak <eol> close to a thousand languages. <eob>
Now, Suharto had been a dictator, <eob> and a nasty one. <eob>
But he'd also been <eol> a pretty effective tyrant, <eob> and he'd always been careful <eol> to keep religion out of politics. <eob>
So experts feared that without <eol> him keeping a lid on things, <eob> the country would explode, <eob> or religious extremists would take over <eob> and turn Indonesia <eol> into a tropical version of Iran. <eob>
And that's just what seemed <eol> to happen at first. <eob>
In the country's <eol> first free elections, in 1999, <eob> Islamist parties scored <eol> 36 percent of the vote, <eob> and the islands burned <eob> as riots and terror attacks <eol> killed thousands. <eob>
Since then, however, <eol> Indonesia has taken a surprising turn. <eob>
While ordinary folks have grown <eol> more pious on a personal level -- <eob> I saw a lot more headscarves <eol> on a recent visit <eob> than I would have a decade ago -- <eob> the country's politics <eol> have moved in the opposite direction. <eob>
Indonesia is now <eol> a pretty decent democracy. <eob>
And yet, its Islamist parties <eol> have steadily lost support, <eob> from a high of about 38 percent in 2004 <eob> down to 25 percent in 2014. <eob>
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare. <eob>
And while a few Indonesians <eol> have recently joined ISIS, <eob> their number is tiny, <eob> far fewer in per capita terms <eob> than the number of Belgians. <eob>
Try to think of one other <eol> Muslim-majority country <eob> that can say all those same things. <eob>
In 2014, I went to Indonesia <eol> to ask its current president, <eob> a soft-spoken technocrat <eol> named Joko Widodo, <eob> "Why is Indonesia thriving when <eol> so many other Muslim states are dying?" <eob>
"Well, what we realized," he told me, <eob> "is that to deal with extremism, <eol> we needed to deal with inequality first." <eob>
See, Indonesia's religious parties, <eol> like similar parties elsewhere, <eob> had tended to focus on things like <eol> reducing poverty and cutting corruption. <eob>
So that's what Joko <eol> and his predecessors did too, <eob> thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder. <eob>
They also cracked down hard on terrorism, <eob> but Indonesia's democrats <eol> have learned a key lesson <eob> from the dark years of dictatorship, <eob> namely that repression <eol> only creates more extremism. <eob>
So they waged their war <eol> with extraordinary delicacy. <eob>
They used the police instead of the army. <eob>
They only detained suspects <eol> if they had enough evidence. <eob>
They held public trials. <eob>
They even sent <eol> liberal imams into the jails <eob> to persuade the jihadists <eol> that terror is un-Islamic. <eob>
And all of this paid off <eol> in spectacular fashion, <eob> creating the kind of country <eol> that was unimaginable 20 years ago. <eob>
So at this point, <eol> my optimism should, I hope, <eob> be starting to make a bit more sense. <eob>
Neither immigration nor <eob> Islamic extremism <eob> are impossible to deal with. <eob>
Join me now on one last trip, <eob> this time to Mexico. <eob>
Now, of our three stories, <eol> this one probably surprised me the most, <eob> since as you all know, <eob> the country is still struggling <eol> with so many problems. <eob>
And yet, a few years ago, <eol> Mexico did something <eob> that many other countries <eol> from France to India to the United States <eob> can still only dream of. <eob>
It shattered the political paralysis <eol> that had gripped it for years. <eob>
To understand how, <eol> we need to rewind to the year 2000, <eob> when Mexico finally became a democracy. <eob>
Rather than use their new freedoms <eol> to fight for reform, <eob> Mexico's politicians used them <eol> to fight one another. <eob>
Congress deadlocked, <eol> and the country's problems -- <eob> drugs, poverty, crime, corruption -- <eob> spun out of control. <eob>
Things got so bad that in 2008, <eob> the Pentagon warned <eol> that Mexico risked collapse. <eob>
Then in 2012, this guy <eol> named Enrique Peña Nieto <eob> somehow got himself elected president. <eob>
Now, this Peña hardly inspired <eol> much confidence at first. <eob>
Sure, he was handsome, <eob> but he came from Mexico's <eol> corrupt old ruling party, the PRI, <eob> and he was a notorious womanizer. <eob>
In fact, he seemed <eol> like such a pretty boy lightweight <eob> that women called him "bombón," sweetie, <eob> at campaign rallies. <eob>
And yet this same bombón <eol> soon surprised everyone <eob> by hammering out a truce <eob> between the country's <eol> three warring political parties. <eob>
And over the next 18 months, <eol> they together passed <eob> an incredibly comprehensive <eol> set of reforms. <eob>
They busted open Mexico's <eol> smothering monopolies. <eob>
They liberalized <eol> its rusting energy sector. <eob>
They restructured <eol> its failing schools, and much more. <eob>
To appreciate the scale <eol> of this accomplishment, <eob> try to imagine the US Congress <eol> passing immigration reform, <eob> campaign finance reform <eol> and banking reform. <eob> Now, try to imagine Congress <eol> doing it all at the same time. <eob> That's what Mexico did. <eob>
Not long ago, I met with Peña <eol> and asked how he managed it all. <eob>
The President flashed me <eol> his famous twinkly smile -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and told me that the short answer <eol> was "compromiso," compromise. <eob>
Of course, I pushed him for details, <eob> and the long answer <eol> that came out was essentially <eob> "compromise, compromise <eol> and more compromise." <eob> See, Peña knew that he needed <eol> to build trust early, <eob> so he started talking to the opposition <eol> just days after his election. <eob>
To ward off pressure <eol> from special interests, <eob> he kept their meetings small and secret, <eob> and many of the participants <eol> later told me that it was this intimacy, <eob> plus a lot of shared tequila, <eob> that helped build confidence. <eob>
So did the fact that all decisions <eol> had to be unanimous, <eob> and that Peña even agreed to pass <eol> some of the other party's priorities <eob> before his own. <eob>
As Santiago Creel, <eol> an opposition senator, put it to me, <eob> "Look, I'm not saying that I'm special <eol> or that anyone is special, <eob> but that group, that was special." <eob> The proof? <eob>
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held, <eob> and Mexico moved forward <eol> for the first time in years. <eob> Bueno. <eob>
So now we've seen <eol> how these three countries <eob> overcame three of their great challenges. <eob>
And that's very nice for them, right? <eob>
But what good does it do the rest of us? <eob>
Well, in the course of studying these <eol> and a bunch of other success stories, <eob> like the way Rwanda pulled itself <eol> back together after civil war <eob> or Brazil has reduced inequality, <eob> or South Korea has kept its economy <eol> growing faster and for longer <eob> than any other country on Earth, <eob> I've noticed a few common threads. <eob>
Now, before describing them, <eol> I need to add a caveat. <eob>
I realize, of course, <eol> that all countries are unique. <eob>
So you can't simply <eol> take what worked in one, <eob> port it to another <eol> and expect it to work there too. <eob>
Nor do specific solutions work forever. <eob>
You've got to adapt them <eol> as circumstances change. <eob>
That said, by stripping <eol> these stories to their essence, <eob> you absolutely can distill <eol> a few common tools for problem-solving <eob> that will work in other countries <eob> and in boardrooms <eob> and in all sorts of other contexts, too. <eob>
Number one, embrace the extreme. <eob>
In all the stories we've just looked at, <eob> salvation came at a moment <eol> of existential peril. <eob>
And that was no coincidence. <eob>
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office, <eol> he faced two looming dangers. <eob>
First, though his vast, <eol> underpopulated country <eob> badly needed more bodies, <eob> its preferred source <eol> for white workers, Europe, <eob> had just stopped exporting them <eol> as it finally recovered from World War II. <eob>
The other problem was <eol> that Canada's long cold war <eob> between its French <eol> and its English communities <eob> had just become a hot one. <eob>
Quebec was threatening to secede, <eob> and Canadians were actually <eol> killing other Canadians over politics. <eob>
Now, countries face <eol> crises all the time. Right? <eob> That's nothing special. <eob>
But Trudeau's genius <eol> was to realize that Canada's crisis <eob> had swept away all the hurdles <eol> that usually block reform. <eob>
Canada had to open up. <eob>
It had no choice. <eob>
And it had to rethink its identity. <eob>
Again, it had no choice. <eob>
And that gave Trudeau <eol> a once-in-a-generation opportunity <eob> to break the old rules and write new ones. <eob>
And like all our other heroes, <eol> he was smart enough to seize it. <eob>
Number two, there's power <eol> in promiscuous thinking. <eob>
Another striking similarity <eol> among good problem-solvers <eob> is that they're all pragmatists. <eob>
They'll steal the best answers <eol> from wherever they find them, <eob> and they don't let details <eob> like party or ideology <eol> or sentimentality get in their way. <eob>
As I mentioned earlier, <eol> Indonesia's democrats were clever enough <eob> to steal many of the Islamists' <eol> best campaign promises for themselves. <eob>
They even invited some of the radicals <eol> into their governing coalition. <eob>
Now, that horrified <eol> a lot of secular Indonesians. <eob>
But by forcing the radicals <eol> to actually help govern, <eob> it quickly exposed the fact <eol> that they weren't any good at the job, <eob> and it got them mixed up <eol> in all of the grubby compromises <eob> and petty humiliations <eol> that are part of everyday politics. <eob>
And that hurt their image so badly <eol> that they've never recovered. <eob>
Number three, <eob> please all of the people some of the time. <eob>
I know I just mentioned how crises <eol> can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms. <eob>
And that's true, but problem-solving <eol> often requires more than just boldness. <eob>
It takes showing restraint, too, <eob> just when that's <eol> the last thing you want to do. <eob>
Take Trudeau: when he took office, <eob> he could easily have put <eol> his core constituency, <eob> that is Canada's French community, first. <eob>
He could have pleased <eol> some of the people all of the time. <eob>
And Peña could have used his power <eol> to keep attacking the opposition, <eob> as was traditional in Mexico. <eob>
Yet he chose to embrace <eol> his enemies instead, <eob> while forcing his own party to compromise. <eob>
And Trudeau pushed everyone <eol> to stop thinking in tribal terms <eob> and to see multiculturalism, <eol> not language and not skin color, <eob> as what made them <eol> quintessentially Canadian. <eob>
Nobody got everything they wanted, <eob> but everyone got just enough <eol> that the bargains held. <eob>
So at this point you may be thinking, <eob> "OK, Tepperman, <eob> if the fixes really are out there <eol> like you keep insisting, <eob> then why aren't more countries <eol> already using them?" <eob> It's not like they require <eol> special powers to pull off. <eob>
I mean, none of the leaders <eol> we've just looked at were superheroes. <eob>
They didn't accomplish <eol> anything on their own, <eob> and they all had plenty of flaws. <eob>
Take Indonesia's <eol> first democratic president, <eob> Abdurrahman Wahid. <eob>
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic <eob> that he once fell asleep <eob> in the middle of his own speech. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
True story. <eob>
So what this tells us <eol> is that the real obstacle is not ability, <eob> and it's not circumstances. <eob>
It's something much simpler. <eob>
Making big changes <eol> involves taking big risks, <eob> and taking big risks is scary. <eob>
Overcoming that fear requires guts, <eob> and as you all know, <eob> gutsy politicians are painfully rare. <eob>
But that doesn't mean we voters <eob> can't demand courage <eol> from our political leaders. <eob> I mean, that's why we put them <eol> in office in the first place. <eob> And given the state of the world today, <eol> there's really no other option. <eob>
The answers are out there, <eob> but now it's up to us <eob> to elect more women and men <eob> brave enough to find them, <eob> to steal them <eob> and to make them work. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

(Bottles clink) <eob>
It's funny the things you forget. <eob>
I went to see my mother the other day, <eol> and she told me this story <eob> that I'd completely forgotten about <eob> how, when we were driving together, <eol> she would pull the car over, <eob> and by the time she had gotten <eol> out of the car, <eob> and gone around the car <eol> to let me out of the car, <eob> I would have already gotten <eol> out of the car <eob> and pretended to have died. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
People say we live in an age <eol> of information overload. Right? <eob> I don't know about that, <eob> but I just know that I get too many marketing emails. <eob>
"Just three weeks until SafeMart <eol> at King's Cross opens!!!" <eob> And I resented this, <eob> because not only do I not remember <eol> signing up to that, <eob> but I resent the fact <eol> that they appear to think <eob> that I should be excited <eol> about a shop opening. <eob>
So what I did was I scrolled down <eol> to the bottom of the email, <eob> and I pressed, "Unsubscribe." <eob> And I thought that'd be <eol> the end of it. <eob>
But a week later, <eol> I got another one that said, <eob>
"Just two weeks <eob> until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!" <eob>
And I thought, obviously, <eol> I haven't clicked hard enough. <eob>
And here's the problem: <eob> The internet gave us access to everything; <eob> but it also gave everything access to us. <eob>
It's hard enough to discriminate <eob> between the things <eol> that genuinely matter in this world <eob> and the minutiae of life, <eob> without having emails about supermarket chains <eob> and Candy Crush Saga. <eob>
And I was really annoyed with them, <eob> and I thought, OK, I was about <eol> to write a strongly worded email, <eob> which I can do quite well. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So I replied to it, and I said, <eob> "I literally cannot wait!!!!" <eob> "What do you need from me?" <eob>
They got back to me; <eol> a guy called Dan said, <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> "Hi James. I've asked a colleague <eol> to help me with your query." <eob>
Like it needs help. <eob> And I said, "What's the plan, Dan? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> He said, "I think you have misunderstood." <eob> "A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned." <eob>
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks <eol> until,' 'Two weeks until' emails? <eob> I was getting excited." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> "I'm sorry you're disappointed." <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I said, "Not to worry. <eob>
Let's do something anyway! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I'll be honest, then my relationship <eol> with Dan deteriorated somewhat, <eob> because the next email <eol> I got was this: <eob> "Thanks for your email - your Case <eol> Number is..." <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) And I got — and I was just like, <eol> this is... — and I, I.... <eob> And I said, "Danny?" <eob> And I thought, this is terrible. <eob>
All I'm doing is collecting case numbers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered <eol> why there was no bouncy castle." <eob> And then we were back to this. <eob>
And that might have been the end of the story, <eob> but I remembered that anything -- everything -- <eob> even something as mundane as getting out of a car, <eob> can be fun if you find the right game. <eob>
So, <eob> this is what I replied: <eob> [Thanks for your email - <eol> your Case Number is # <eob> 0000001.] <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
It was just a beautiful relationship. <eob> We just kept going. <eob> It was lovely. <eob> But to be honest, guys, <eol> it was quite labor-intensive, <eob> and I had other stuff to do, <eob> believe it or not. <eob>
So what I did is I have <eol> a little email auto-replier program. <eob>
And I set it up so every time <eol> it receives an email from SafeMart, <eob> it just pings one back. <eob>
"Thanks for your email - <eol> your Case Number is ..." <eob> So I set it up, and it says, <eob> Then it has a little formula <eol> that I wrote to up the case number every time. <eob> And I put it on the server <eob> and set it running. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob> I checked back on it the other day, <eob> and it appears there have been <eol> a number of emails going back and forth. <eob> We're on 21,439. <eob>
It gives me an immense sense <eol> of satisfaction to know <eob> that these computer programs <eol> are just going to be pinging one another <eob> for eternity. <eob>
And as legacies go, <eol> I don't think that's bad. <eob>
So guys, just remember: <eob> if ever you feel weighed down <eol> by the bureaucracy <eob> and often mundanity of modern life, <eob> don't fight the frustration. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Let it be the catalyst <eob> for whimsy. <eob>
Twelve years ago, I picked up <eol> a camera for the first time <eob> to film the olive harvest <eol> in a Palestinian village in the West Bank. <eob>
I thought I was there <eol> to make a single documentary <eob> and would then move on <eol> to some other part of the world. <eob>
But something kept bringing me back. <eob>
Now, usually, when international audiences <eol> hear about that part of the world, <eob> they often just want <eol> that conflict to go away. <eob>
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict <eol> is bad, and we wish it could just disappear. <eob>
We feel much the same way <eol> about other conflicts around the world. <eob>
But every time we turn <eol> our attention to the news, <eob> it seems like one more country <eol> has gone up in flames. <eob>
So I've been wondering <eob> whether we should not start <eol> looking at conflict in a different way -- <eob> whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict, <eob> we focus instead on how to wage conflict. <eob>
This has been a big question for me, <eob> one I've pursued together <eol> with my team at the nonprofit Just Vision. <eob>
After witnessing several different kinds <eol> of struggles in the Middle East, <eob> I started noticing some patterns <eol> on the more successful ones. <eob>
I wondered whether these variables <eol> held across cases, and if they did, <eob> what lessons we could glean <eol> for waging constructive conflict, <eob> in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere. <eob>
There is some science about this. <eob>
In a study of 323 major political conflicts <eob> from 1900 to 2006, <eob> Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth found <eol> that nonviolent campaigns <eob> were almost 100 percent more likely <eol> to lead to success than violent campaigns. <eob>
Nonviolent campaigns are also less likely <eol> to cause physical harm <eob> to those waging the campaign, <eob> as well as their opponents. <eob>
And, critically, they typically lead <eol> to more peaceful and democratic societies. <eob>
In other words, nonviolent resistance <eol> is a more effective and constructive way <eob> of waging conflict. <eob>
But if that's such an easy choice, <eol> why don't more groups use it? <eob>
Political scientist Victor Asal and colleagues <eob> have looked at several factors <eob> that shape a political group's <eol> choice of tactics. <eob>
And it turns out that the greatest predictor <eob> of a movement's decision <eol> to adopt nonviolence or violence <eob> is not whether that group is more left-wing <eol> or right-wing, <eob> not whether the group is more <eol> or less influenced by religious beliefs, <eob> not whether it's up against a democracy <eol> or a dictatorship, <eob> and not even the levels of repression <eol> that that group is facing. <eob>
The greatest predictor of a movement's decision <eol> to adopt nonviolence <eob> is its ideology regarding the role <eol> of women in public life. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When a movement includes in its discourse <eob> language around gender equality, <eob> it increases dramatically the chances <eol> it will adopt nonviolence, <eob> and thus, the likelihood it will succeed. <eob>
The research squared up <eol> with my own documentation <eob> of political organizing <eol> in Israel and Palestine. <eob>
I've noticed that movements <eol> which welcome women into leadership positions, <eob> such as the one I documented <eol> in a village called Budrus, <eob> were much more likely to achieve <eol> their goals. <eob>
This village was under a real threat <eol> of being wiped off the map <eob> when Israel started building the separation barrier. <eob>
The proposed route would require <eob> the destruction of this community's olive groves, their cemeteries <eob> and would ultimately enclose <eol> the village from all sides. <eob>
Through inspired local leadership, <eob> they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening. <eob>
The odds were massively <eol> stacked against them. <eob>
But they had a secret weapon: <eob> a 15-year-old girl <eob> who courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer <eob> which was about to uproot <eol> an olive tree, stopping it. <eob>
In that moment, the community <eol> of Budrus realized what was possible <eob> if they welcomed and encouraged <eol> women to participate in public life. <eob>
And so it was that the women of Budrus went <eol> to the front lines day after day, <eob> using their creativity and acumen <eol> to overcome multiple obstacles they faced <eob> in a 10-month unarmed struggle. <eob>
And as you can probably tell at this point, <eob> they win at the end. <eob>
The separation barrier was changed completely <eob> to the internationally <eol> recognized green line, <eob> and the women of Budrus came <eol> to be known across the West Bank <eob> for their indomitable energy. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I want to pause for a second, <eol> which you helped me do, <eob> because I do want to tackle two <eol> very serious misunderstandings <eob> that could happen at this point. <eob>
The first one is that I don't believe <eob> women are inherently <eol> or essentially more peaceful than men. <eob>
But I do believe that in today's world, <eob> women experience power differently. <eob>
Having had to navigate <eol> being in the less powerful position <eob> in multiple aspects of their lives, <eob> women are often more adept <eob> at how to surreptitiously pressure for change <eob> against large, powerful actors. <eob>
The term "manipulative," <eol> often charged against women in a derogatory way, <eob> reflects a reality in which women <eol> have often had to find ways <eob> other than direct confrontation <eol> to achieve their goals. <eob>
And finding alternatives <eol> to direct confrontation <eob> is at the core of nonviolent resistance. <eob>
Now to the second potential <eol> misunderstanding. <eob>
I've been talking a lot about <eol> my experiences in the Middle East, <eob> and some of you might be thinking now <eob> that the solution then is for us <eol> to educate Muslim and Arab societies <eob> to be more inclusive of their women. <eob>
If we were to do that, <eol> they would be more successful. <eob>
They do not need this kind of help. <eob>
Women have been part of the most <eol> influential movements <eob> coming out of the Middle East, <eob> but they tend to be invisible <eol> to the international community. <eob>
Our cameras are largely focused on the men <eob> who often end up involved <eol> in the more confrontational scenes <eob> that we find so irresistible <eol> in our news cycle. <eob>
And we end up with a narrative <eol> that not only erases women <eob> from the struggles in the region <eob> but often misrepresents <eol> the struggles themselves. <eob>
In the late 1980s, <eol> an uprising started in Gaza, <eob> and quickly spread to the West Bank <eol> and East Jerusalem. <eob>
It came to be known as the First Intifada, <eob> and people who have any visual <eol> memory of it <eob> generally conjure up something like this: <eob> Palestinian men throwing rocks <eol> at Israeli tanks. <eob>
The news coverage at the time <eob> made it seem like stones, Molotov cocktails <eol> and burning tires <eob> were the only activities taking place <eol> in the Intifada. <eob>
This period, though, was also marked <eol> by widespread nonviolent organizing <eob> in the forms of strikes, sit-ins <eol> and the creation of parallel institutions. <eob>
During the First Intifada, <eob> whole sectors of the Palestinian <eol> civilian population mobilized, <eob> cutting across generations, <eol> factions and class lines. <eob>
They did this through networks <eol> of popular committees, <eob> and their use of direct action <eol> and communal self-help projects <eob> challenged Israel's very ability <eob> to continue ruling the West Bank <eol> and Gaza. <eob>
According to the Israeli Army itself, <eob> 97 percent of activities <eol> during the First Intifada were unarmed. <eob>
And here's another thing that is not <eol> part of our narrative about that time. <eob>
For 18 months in the Intifada, <eob> women were the ones calling <eol> the shots behind the scenes: <eob> Palestinian women from all walks of life <eob> in charge of mobilizing hundreds <eol> of thousands of people <eob> in a concerted effort <eol> to withdraw consent from the occupation. <eob>
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build a self-sufficient Palestinian economy <eob> by encouraging women in Gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards, <eob> an activity deemed illegal by the Israeli authorities at that time; <eob> Rabeha Diab, who took over decision-making authority <eob> for the entire uprising <eob> when the men who had been running it <eob> were deported; <eob> Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising's directives <eob> in order to spread them across the territories <eob> without getting caught; <eob> and Zahira Kamal, <eob> who ensured the longevity of the uprising <eob> by leading an organization <eob> that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year. <eob>
Despite their extraordinary achievements, <eob> none of these women <eol> have made it into our narrative of the First Intifada. <eob>
We do this in other parts <eol> of the globe, too. <eob>
In our history books, for instance, <eol> and in our collective consciousness, <eob> men are the public faces <eol> and spokespersons <eob> for the 1960s struggle <eol> for racial justice in the United States. <eob>
But women were also a critical <eol> driving force, <eob> mobilizing, organizing, <eol> taking to the streets. <eob>
How many of us think of Septima Clark <eob> when we think of the United States <eol> Civil Rights era? <eob> Remarkably few. <eob> But she played a crucial role <eol> in every phase of the struggle, <eob> particularly by emphasizing literacy <eol> and education. <eob>
She's been omitted, <eol> ignored, <eob> like so many other women <eol> who played critical roles <eob> in the United States Civil Rights Movement. <eob>
This is not about getting credit. <eob>
It's more profound than that. <eob>
The stories we tell matter deeply <eol> to how we see ourselves, <eob> and to how we believe movements <eol> are run <eob> and how movements are won. <eob>
The stories we tell about a movement <eol> like the First Intifada <eob> or the United States Civil Rights era <eob> matter deeply and have a critical influence <eob> in the choices Palestinians, <eob> Americans <eob> and people around the world <eol> will make <eob> next time they encounter an injustice <eob> and develop the courage to confront it. <eob>
If we do not lift up the women <eol> who played critical roles in these struggles, <eob> we fail to offer up role models <eol> to future generations. <eob>
Without role models, it becomes harder <eob> for women to take up their rightful space <eob> in public life. <eob>
in public life. <eob> And as we saw earlier, <eob> one of the most critical variables <eob> in determining whether a movement <eol> will be successful or not <eob> is a movement's ideology <eol> regarding the role of women <eob>
This is a question of whether we're moving <eob> towards more democratic <eol> and peaceful societies. <eob>
In a world where so much change is happening, <eob> and where change is bound <eol> to continue at an increasingly faster pace, <eob> it is not a question of whether we will face conflict, <eob> but rather a question <eob> of which stories will shape <eob> how we choose to wage conflict. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm here today to talk <eol> about the two ideas that, <eob> at least based on my observations <eol> at Khan Academy, <eob> are kind of the core, or the key leverage points <eol> for learning. <eob>
And it's the idea of mastery <eob> and the idea of mindset. <eob>
I saw this in the early days <eol> working with my cousins. <eob>
A lot of them were having trouble <eol> with math at first, <eob> because they had all of these gaps <eol> accumulated in their learning. <eob>
And because of that, at some point <eol> they got to an algebra class <eob> and they might have been a little bit shaky <eol> on some of the pre-algebra, <eob> and because of that, they thought <eol> they didn't have the math gene. <eob>
Or they'd get <eol> to a calculus class, <eob> and they'd be a little bit shaky <eol> on the algebra. <eob>
I saw it in the early days <eob> when I was uploading some <eol> of those videos on YouTube, <eob> and I realized that people <eol> who were not my cousins were watching. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And at first, those comments <eol> were just simple thank-yous. <eob>
I thought that was a pretty big deal. <eob>
I don't know how much time <eol> you all spend on YouTube. <eob> Most of the comments <eol> are not "Thank you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
They're a little edgier than that. <eob>
But then the comments got a little more intense, <eob> student after student saying <eol> that they had grown up not liking math. <eob>
It was getting difficult as they got <eol> into more advanced math topics. <eob>
By the time they got to algebra, <eob> they had so many gaps in their knowledge <eol> they couldn't engage with it. <eob>
They thought they didn't have <eol> the math gene. <eob>
But when they were a bit older, <eob> they took a little agency <eol> and decided to engage. <eob>
They found resources like Khan Academy <eob> and they were able to fill <eol> in those gaps and master those concepts, <eob> and that reinforced their mindset <eol> that it wasn't fixed; <eob> that they actually were capable <eol> of learning mathematics. <eob>
And in a lot of ways, this is how you would master <eol> a lot of things in life. <eob>
It's the way you would learn <eol> a martial art. <eob>
In a martial art, you would practice <eol> the white belt skills <eob> as long as necessary, <eob> and only when you've mastered it <eob> you would move on to become a yellow belt. <eob>
and only when you've mastered it <eob> It's the way you learn <eol> a musical instrument: <eob> you practice the basic piece over and over again, <eob> you go on to the more advanced one. <eob>
But what we point out -- <eob> this is not the way a traditional <eol> academic model is structured, <eob> the type of academic model that most of us <eol> grew up in. <eob>
In a traditional academic model, <eob> we group students together, <eol> usually by age, <eob> and around middle school, <eob> by age and perceived ability, <eob> and we shepherd them all together <eol> at the same pace. <eob>
And what typically happens, <eob> let's say we're in a middle school <eol> pre-algebra class, <eob> and the current unit is on exponents, <eob> the teacher will give <eol> a lecture on exponents, <eob> then we'll go home, do some homework. <eob>
The next morning, <eol> we'll review the homework, <eob> then another lecture, homework, <eol> lecture, homework. <eob>
That will continue for about two <eol> or three weeks, <eob> and then we get a test. <eob>
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent, <eob> maybe you get a 90 percent, <eob> maybe you get a 95 percent. <eob>
And even though the test identified <eol> gaps in our knowledge, <eob> I didn't know 25 percent of the material. <eob>
Even the A student, what was the <eol> five percent they didn't know? <eob>
Even though we've identified the gaps, <eob> the whole class will then move <eol> on to the next subject, <eob> probably a more advanced subject that's going to build <eol> on those gaps. <eob>
It might be logarithms <eol> or negative exponents. <eob>
And that process continues, <eol> and you immediately start to realize <eob> how strange this is. <eob>
I didn't know 25 percent <eol> of the more foundational thing, <eob> and now I'm being pushed <eol> to the more advanced thing. <eob>
And this will continue for months, <eol> years, all the way until at some point, <eob> I might be in an algebra class <eol> or trigonometry class <eob> and I hit a wall. <eob>
And it's not because algebra <eol> is fundamentally difficult <eob> or because the student isn't bright. <eob>
It's because I'm seeing an equation <eol> and they're dealing with exponents <eob> and that 30 percent <eol> that I didn't know is showing up. <eob> And then I start to disengage. <eob>
To appreciate how absurd that is, <eob> imagine if we did other things <eol> in our life that way. <eob> Say, home-building. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we bring in the contractor and say, <eob> "We were told we have two weeks <eol> to build a foundation. <eob>
Do what you can." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So they do what they can. <eob> Maybe it rains. <eob> Maybe some of the supplies don't show up. <eob>
And two weeks later, the inspector comes, looks around, <eob> says, "OK, the concrete <eol> is still wet right over there, <eob> that part's not quite up to code ... <eob> I'll give it an 80 percent." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You say, "Great! <eob>
That's a C. Let's build the first floor. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Same thing. <eob> We have two weeks, do what you can, <eol> inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent. <eob>
Great, that's a D-plus. <eob>
Second floor, third floor, <eob> and all of a sudden, while you're building <eol> the third floor, <eob> the whole structure collapses. <eob>
And if your reaction is the reaction <eol> you typically have in education, <eob> or that a lot of folks have, <eob> you might say, maybe we had a bad contractor, <eob> or maybe we needed better inspection <eol> or more frequent inspection. <eob>
But what was really <eol> broken was the process. <eob>
We were artificially constraining <eol> how long we had to something, <eob> pretty much ensuring a variable outcome, <eob> and we took the trouble <eol> of inspecting and identifying those gaps, <eob> but then we built right on top of it. <eob>
So the idea of mastery learning <eol> is to do the exact opposite. <eob>
Instead of artificially constraining, fixing <eob> when and how long you work on something, <eob> pretty much ensuring that variable outcome, <eob> the A, B, C, D, F -- <eob> do it the other way around. <eob>
What's variable is when and how long <eob> a student actually <eol> has to work on something, <eob> and what's fixed is that <eol> they actually master the material. <eob>
And it's important to realize <eob> that not only will this make the student <eol> learn their exponents better, <eob> but it'll reinforce the right mindset muscles. <eob>
It makes them realize that if you got <eol> 20 percent wrong on something, <eob> it doesn't mean that you have <eol> a C branded in your DNA somehow. <eob>
It means that you should <eol> just keep working on it. <eob>
You should have grit; <eol> you should have perseverance; <eob> you should take agency over your learning. <eob>
Now, a lot of skeptics might say, <eol> well, hey, this is all great, <eob> philosophically, this whole idea <eol> of mastery-based learning <eob> and its connection to mindset, <eob> students taking agency over their learning. <eob>
It makes a lot of sense, <eol> but it seems impractical. <eob>
To actually do it, every student <eol> would be on their own track. <eob>
It would have to be personalized, <eob> you'd have to have private tutors <eol> and worksheets for every student. <eob>
And these aren't new ideas -- <eob> there were experiments in Winnetka, <eol> Illinois, 100 years ago, <eob> where they did mastery-based learning <eol> and saw great results, <eob> but they said it wouldn't scale <eol> because it was logistically difficult. <eob>
The teacher had to give different <eol> worksheets to every student, <eob> give on-demand assessments. <eob>
But now today, it's no longer impractical. <eob>
We have the tools to do it. <eob>
Students see an explanation <eol> at their own time and pace? <eob>
There's on-demand video for that. <eob> They need practice? They need feedback? <eob> There's adaptive exercises <eol> readily available for students. <eob>
And when that happens, <eol> all sorts of neat things happen. <eob>
One, the students <eol> can actually master the concepts, <eob> but they're also building <eol> their growth mindset, <eob> they're building grit, perseverance, <eob> they're taking agency over their learning. <eob>
And all sorts of beautiful things <eol> can start to happen <eob> in the actual classroom. <eob>
Instead of it being focused <eol> on the lecture, <eob> students can interact with each other. <eob>
They can get deeper mastery over the material. <eob> They can go into simulations, <eol> Socratic dialogue. <eob>
To appreciate what we're talking about <eob> and the tragedy of lost potential here, <eob> I'd like to give a little bit <eol> of a thought experiment. <eob>
If we were to go 400 years <eol> into the past to Western Europe, <eob> which even then, was one of the more literate <eol> parts of the planet, <eob> you would see that about 15 percent <eol> of the population knew how to read. <eob>
And I suspect that if you asked someone <eol> who did know how to read, <eob> say a member of the clergy, <eob> "What percentage of the population <eol> do you think is even capable of reading?" <eob> They might say, "Well, with a great education system, <eob> maybe 20 or 30 percent." <eob> But if you fast forward to today, <eob> we know that that prediction <eol> would have been wildly pessimistic, <eob> that pretty close to 100 percent <eol> of the population is capable of reading. <eob>
But if I were to ask you a similar question: <eob> "What percentage of the population <eol> do you think is capable <eob> of truly mastering calculus, <eob> or understanding organic chemistry, <eob> or being able to contribute <eol> to cancer research?" <eob> A lot of you might say, "Well, with a great education system, <eob> maybe 20, 30 percent." <eob>
But what if that estimate <eob> is just based on your own experience <eol> in a non-mastery framework, <eob> your own experience with yourself <eol> or observing your peers, <eob> where you're being pushed <eol> at this set pace through classes, <eob> accumulating all these gaps? <eob>
Even when you got that 95 percent, <eob> what was that five percent you missed? <eob>
And it keeps accumulating -- <eol> you get to an advanced class, <eob> all of a sudden you hit a wall and say, <eob> "I'm not meant <eol> to be a cancer researcher; <eob> not meant <eol> to be a physicist; <eob> not meant <eol> to be a mathematician." <eob> I suspect that that actually is the case, <eob> but if you were allowed <eol> to be operating in a mastery framework, <eob> if you were allowed <eob> to really take <eol> agency over your learning, <eob> and when you get something wrong, <eob> embrace it -- view that failure <eol> as a moment of learning -- <eob> that number, the percent that could really master calculus <eob> or understand organic chemistry, <eob> is actually a lot closer to 100 percent. <eob>
And this isn't even just a "nice to have." <eob> I think it's a social imperative. <eob>
We're exiting what you could call <eol> the industrial age <eob> and we're going into this <eol> information revolution. <eob>
And it's clear that some things <eol> are happening. <eob>
In the industrial age, <eol> society was a pyramid. <eob> At the base of the pyramid, <eol> you needed human labor. <eob> In the middle of the pyramid, <eol> you had an information processing, <eob> a bureaucracy class, <eob> and at the top of the pyramid, <eol> you had your owners of capital <eob> and your entrepreneurs <eob> and your creative class. <eob>
But we know what's happening already, <eob> as we go into this information revolution. <eob>
The bottom of that pyramid, automation, <eol> is going to take over. <eob>
Even that middle tier, information processing, <eob> that's what computers are good at. <eob>
So as a society, we have a question: <eob> All this new productivity <eol> is happening because of this technology, <eob> but who participates in it? <eob>
Is it just going to be <eol> that very top of the pyramid, in which case, <eob> what does everyone else do? <eob> How do they operate? <eob> Or do we do something <eol> that's more aspirational? <eob>
Do we actually attempt to invert the pyramid, <eob> where you have a large creative class, <eob> where almost everyone can participate <eol> as an entrepreneur, <eob> an artist, as a researcher? <eob>
And I don't think that this is utopian. <eob>
I really think that this is all based on the idea <eob> that if we let people tap <eol> into their potential <eob> by mastering concepts, <eob> by being able to exercise <eol> agency over their learning, <eob> that they can get there. <eob>
And when you think of it <eol> as just a citizen of the world, <eob> it's pretty exciting. <eob>
I mean, think about the type <eol> of equity we can we have, <eob> and the rate at which civilization <eol> could even progress. <eob>
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it. <eob>
I think it's going to be <eol> a pretty exciting time to be alive. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I'm a journalist, <eob> so I like to look <eol> for the untold stories, <eob> the lives that quietly play out <eol> under the scream of headlines. <eob>
I've also been going about the business <eol> of putting down roots, <eob> choosing a partner, making babies. <eob>
So for the last few years, <eob> I've been trying to understand <eob> what constitutes the 21st-century good life, <eob> both because I'm fascinated <eol> by the moral and philosophical implications, <eob> but also because I'm in desperate need of answers myself. <eob>
We live in tenuous times. <eob>
In fact, for the first time <eol> in American history, <eob> the majority of parents do not think <eol> that their kids will be better off <eob> than they were. <eob>
This is true of rich and poor, <eol> men and women. <eob>
Now, some of you might hear <eol> this and feel sad. <eob>
After all, America is deeply invested <eob> in this idea of economic transcendence, <eob> that every generation kind of leapfrogs <eol> the one before it, <eob> earning more, buying more, being more. <eob>
We've exported this dream <eol> all over the world, <eob> so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya <eob> inherit our insatiable expectation <eob> for more. <eob>
But when I read this historic <eol> poll for the first time, <eob> it didn't actually make me feel sad. <eob>
It felt like a provocation. <eob> "Better off" -- based on whose standards? <eob>
Is "better off" <eol> finding a secure job <eob> that you can count on <eol> for the rest of your life? <eob>
Those are nearly extinct. <eob>
People move jobs, on average, <eol> every 4.7 years, <eob> and it's estimated that by 2020, <eob> nearly half of Americans will be freelancers. <eob>
OK, so is better off just a number? <eob>
Is it about earning as much <eol> as you possibly can? <eob>
By that singular measurement, <eol> we are failing. <eob>
Median per capita income <eol> has been flat since about 2000, <eob> adjusted for inflation. <eob>
All right, so is better off getting <eol> a big house with a white picket fence? <eob>
Less of us are doing that. <eob>
Nearly five million people lost <eol> their homes in the Great Recession, <eob> and even more of us sobered up about the lengths <eol> we were willing to go -- <eob> or be tricked into going, <eol> in many predatory cases -- <eob> to hold that deed. <eob>
Home-ownership rates are <eol> at their lowest since 1995. <eob>
All right, so we're not <eol> finding steady employment, <eob> we're not earning as much money, <eob> and we're not living <eol> in big fancy houses. <eob>
Toll the funeral bells <eob> for everything that made America great. <eob>
But, <eob> are those the best measurements <eol> of a country's greatness, <eob> of a life well lived? <eob>
What I think makes America great <eol> is its spirit of reinvention. <eob>
In the wake of the Great Recession, <eob> more and more Americans <eol> are redefining what "better off" really means. <eob>
Turns out, it has more to do <eol> with community and creativity <eob> than dollars and cents. <eob>
Now, let me be very clear: <eob> the 14.8 percent of Americans <eol> living in poverty need money, <eob> plain and simple. <eob>
And all of us need policies <eol> that protect us from exploitation <eob> by employers <eol> and financial institutions. <eob>
Nothing that follows is meant <eol> to suggest that the gap between rich and poor <eob> is anything but profoundly immoral. <eob>
But, <eob> too often we let <eol> the conversation stop there. <eob>
We talk about poverty as if it were <eol> a monolithic experience; <eob> about the poor as if they were solely victims. <eob>
Part of what I've learned <eol> in my research and reporting <eob> is that the art of living well <eob> is often practiced most masterfully <eob> by the most vulnerable. <eob>
Now, if necessity is the mother of invention, <eob> I've come to believe <eob> that recession can be the father <eol> of consciousness. <eob>
It confronts us with profound questions, <eob> questions we might be too lazy <eol> or distracted to ask <eob> in times of relative comfort. <eob> How should we work? <eob> How should we live? <eob> All of us, whether we realize it or not, <eob> seek answers to these questions, <eob> with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears. <eob>
My great-grandfather <eol> was a drunk in Detroit, <eob> who sometimes managed <eol> to hold down a factory job. <eob>
He had, as unbelievable <eol> as it might sound, <eob> 21 children, <eob> with one woman, my great-grandmother, <eob> who died at 47 years old <eol> of ovarian cancer. <eob>
Now, I'm pregnant <eol> with my second child, <eob> and I cannot even fathom <eol> what she must have gone through. <eob>
And if you're trying to do the math -- <eol> there were six sets of twins. <eob>
So my grandfather, their son, <eob> became a traveling salesman, <eob> and he lived boom and bust. <eob>
So my dad grew up answering the door <eol> for debt collectors <eob> and pretending his parents <eol> weren't home. <eob>
He actually took his braces off himself <eol> with pliers in the garage, <eob> when his father admitted <eol> he didn't have money <eob> to go back to the orthodontist. <eob>
So my dad, unsurprisingly, <eob> became a bankruptcy lawyer. <eob>
Couldn't write this in a novel, right? <eob>
He was obsessed with providing <eol> a secure foundation <eob> for my brother and I. <eob>
So I ask these questions by way <eol> of a few generations of struggle. <eob>
My parents made sure that I grew up <eol> on a kind of steady ground <eob> that allows one to question <eol> and risk and leap. <eob>
And ironically, and probably <eol> sometimes to their frustration, <eob> it is their steadfast <eol> commitment to security <eob> that allows me to question its value, <eob> or at least its value as we've historically defined it <eob> in the 21st century. <eob>
How should we work? <eob> So let's dig into this first question: <eob>
We should work like our mothers. <eob>
That's right -- we've spent decades <eob> trying to fit women into a work world <eol> built for company men. <eob>
And many have done backbends to fit in, <eob> but others have carved <eol> a more unconventional path, <eob> creating a patchwork of meaning and money <eob> with enough flexibility to do <eol> what they need to do <eob> for those that they love. <eob>
My mom called it "just making it work." <eob> Today I hear life coaches call <eol> it "a portfolio career." <eob> Whatever you call it, <eob> more and more men are craving these whole, <eol> if not harried, lives. <eob>
They're waking up to their desire and duty <eol> to be present fathers and sons. <eob>
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said, <eob> "Labor is a way of knowing." <eob> Labor is a way of knowing. <eob>
In other words, what we work on <eob> is what we understand about the world. <eob>
If this is true, and I think it is, <eob> then women who have disproportionately <eol> cared for the little ones <eob> and the sick ones and the aging ones, <eob> have disproportionately benefited <eob> from the most profound <eol> kind of knowing there is: <eob> knowing the human condition. <eob>
By prioritizing care, <eob> men are, in a sense, staking their claim <eob> to the full range of human existence. <eob>
Now, this means the nine-to-five <eol> no longer works for anyone. <eob>
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete, <eol> as are career ladders. <eob>
Whole industries are being born <eol> and dying every day. <eob>
It's all nonlinear from here. <eob>
So we need to stop asking kids, <eob> "What do you want to be when you grow up?" <eob> and start asking them, "How do you <eol> want to be when you grow up?" <eob> Their work will constantly change. <eob>
The common denominator is them. <eob>
So the more they understand their gifts <eob> and create crews of ideal collaborators, <eob> the better off they will be. <eob>
The challenge ahead is to reinvent <eol> the social safety net <eob> to fit this increasingly <eol> fragmented economy. <eob>
We need portable health benefits. <eob>
We need policies that reflect <eol> that everyone deserves to be vulnerable <eob> or care for vulnerable others, <eob> without becoming destitute. <eob>
We need to seriously <eol> consider a universal basic income. <eob>
We need to reinvent labor organizing. <eob>
The promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit <eob> our 21st century values, <eob> not some archaic idea about bringing <eol> home the bacon, <eob> is long overdue -- <eob> just ask your mother. <eob>
How should we live? <eob> Now, how about the second question: <eob>
We should live <eob> like our immigrant ancestors. <eob>
When they came to America, <eob> they often shared apartments, <eol> survival tactics, child care -- <eob> always knew how to fill one more belly, <eob> no matter how small the food available. <eob>
But they were told that success <eol> meant leaving the village behind <eob> and pursuing that iconic symbol <eol> of the American Dream, <eob> the white picket fence. <eob>
And even today, we see <eol> a white picket fence <eob> and we think success, self-possession. <eob>
But when you strip away <eol> the sentimentality, <eob> what it really does is divides us. <eob>
Many Americans are rejecting <eob> the white picket fence <eob> and the kind of highly privatized life <eol> that happened within it, <eob> and reclaiming village life, <eob> reclaiming interdependence instead. <eob>
Fifty million of us, for example, <eob> live in intergenerational households. <eob>
This number exploded with the Great Recession, <eob> but it turns out people <eol> actually like living this way. <eob>
Two-thirds of those who are living <eol> with multiple generations under one roof <eob> say it's improved their relationships. <eob>
Some people are choosing <eol> to share homes not with family, <eob> but with other people who understand <eol> the health and economic benefits <eob> of daily community. <eob>
CoAbode, an online platform <eol> for single moms looking to share homes <eob> with other single moms, <eob> has 50,000 users. <eob>
And people over 65 are especially prone <eob> to be looking for these alternative <eol> living arrangements. <eob>
They understand <eol> that their quality of life <eob> depends on a mix <eol> of solitude and solidarity. <eob>
Which is true of all of us <eol> when you think about it, <eob> young and old alike. <eob>
For too long, we've pretended <eol> that happiness is a king in his castle. <eob>
But all the research proves otherwise. <eob>
It shows that the healthiest, <eol> happiest and even safest -- <eob> in terms of both climate change disaster, <eol> in terms of crime, all of that -- <eob> are Americans who live lives intertwined <eol> with their neighbors. <eob>
Now, I've experienced this firsthand. <eob>
For the last few years, <eol> I've been living in a cohousing community. <eob>
It's 1.5 acres <eol> of persimmon trees, <eob> this prolific blackberry bush <eol> that snakes around a community garden, <eob> all smack-dab, by the way, <eol> in the middle of urban Oakland. <eob>
The nine units are all built <eol> to be different, <eob> different sizes, different shapes, <eob> but they're meant <eol> to be as green as possible. <eob>
So big, shiny black solar cells on our roof <eob> mean our electricity <eol> bill rarely exceeds <eob> more than five bucks in a month. <eob>
The 25 of us who live there are all <eol> different ages and political persuasions <eob> and professions, <eob> and we live in homes that have everything <eol> a typical home would have. <eob>
But additionally, <eob> we share an industrial-sized kitchen <eol> and eating area, <eob> where we have common meals <eol> twice a week. <eob>
Now, people, when I tell them I live like this, <eob> often have one of two extreme reactions. <eob> Either they say, "Why doesn't everyone <eol> live like this?" <eob> Or they say, "That sounds <eol> totally horrifying. <eob>
I would never want to do that." <eob> So let me reassure you: there is a sacred respect <eol> for privacy among us, <eob> but also a commitment <eol> to what we call "radical hospitality" -- <eob> not the kind advertised <eol> by the Four Seasons, <eob> but the kind that says that every single person <eol> is worthy of kindness, <eob> full stop, end of sentence. <eob>
The biggest surprise for me <eol> of living in a community like this? <eob>
You share all the domestic labor -- <eol> the repairing, the cooking, the weeding -- <eob> but you also share the emotional labor. <eob>
Rather than depending <eol> only on the idealized family unit <eob> to get all of your emotional needs met, <eob> you have two dozen other people <eol> that you can go to <eob> to talk about a hard day at work <eob> or troubleshoot <eol> how to handle an abusive teacher. <eob>
Teenagers in our community will often go <eol> to an adult that is not their parent <eob> to ask for advice. <eob>
It's what bell hooks <eol> called "revolutionary parenting," <eob> this humble acknowledgment <eob> that kids are healthier when they have <eol> a wider range of adults <eob> to emulate and count on. <eob>
Turns out, adults are healthier, too. <eob>
It's a lot of pressure, <eob> trying to be that perfect family <eol> behind that white picket fence. <eob>
The "new better off," <eol> as I've come to call it, <eob> is less about investing <eol> in the perfect family <eob> and more about investing <eol> in the imperfect village, <eob> whether that's relatives <eol> living under one roof, <eob> a cohousing community like mine, <eob> or just a bunch of neighbors <eol> who pledge to really know <eob> and look out for one another. <eob>
It's good common sense, right? <eob>
And yet, money has often made us dumb <eob> about reaching out. <eob>
The most reliable wealth <eob> is found in relationship. <eob>
The new better off is not <eol> an individual prospect at all. <eob>
In fact, if you're a failure <eol> or you think you're a failure, <eob> I've got some good news for you: <eob> you might be a success by standards <eol> you have not yet honored. <eob>
Maybe you're a mediocre earner <eol> but a masterful father. <eob>
Maybe you can't afford your dream home, <eob> but you throw legendary <eol> neighborhood parties. <eob>
If you're a textbook success, <eob> the implications <eol> of what I'm saying could be more grim for you. <eob>
You might be a failure <eol> by standards you hold dear <eob> but that the world doesn't reward. <eob> Only you can know. <eob>
I know that I am not a tribute <eob> to my great-grandmother, <eob> who lived such a short and brutish life, <eob> if I earn enough money <eol> to afford every creature comfort. <eob>
You can't buy your way out of suffering <eol> or into meaning. <eob>
There is no home big enough <eob> to erase the pain <eol> that she must have endured. <eob>
I am a tribute to her <eob> if I live a life as connected <eol> and courageous as possible. <eob>
In the midst of such widespread uncertainty, <eob> we may, in fact, be insecure. <eob>
But we can let that insecurity <eol> make us brittle <eob> or supple. <eob>
We can turn inward, lose faith <eol> in the power of institutions to change -- <eob> even lose faith in ourselves. <eob>
Or we can turn outward, <eob> cultivate faith in our ability <eol> to reach out, to connect, to create. <eob>
Turns out, the biggest danger <eob> is not failing to achieve <eol> the American Dream. <eob>
The biggest danger is achieving a dream <eob> that you don't actually believe in. <eob>
So don't do that. <eob>
Do the harder, more interesting thing, <eob> which is to compose a life <eol> where what you do every single day, <eob> the people you give your best love <eol> and ingenuity and energy to, <eob> aligns as closely as possible <eol> with what you believe. <eob>
That, not something as mundane <eol> as making money, <eob> is a tribute to your ancestors. <eob>
That is the beautiful struggle. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The word concussion evokes <eol> a fear these days more so than it ever has, <eob> and I know this personally. <eob>
I played 10 years of football, <eob> was struck in the head thousands of times. <eob>
And I have to tell you, though, <eol> what was much worse than that <eob> was a pair of bike accidents <eol> I had where I suffered concussions, <eob> and I'm still dealing with the effects <eol> of the most recent one <eob> today as I stand in front of you. <eob>
There is a fear around concussion <eob> that does have some evidence behind it. <eob>
There is information <eol> that a repeated history of concussion <eob> can lead to early dementia, <eol> such as Alzheimer's, <eob> and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. <eob>
That was the subject of the Will <eol> Smith movie "Concussion." <eob> And so everybody is caught up <eol> in football and what they see in the military, <eob> but you may not know <eob> that bike riding is the leading cause <eol> of concussion for kids, <eob> sports-related concussion, that is. <eob>
And so another thing that I should tell you <eob> that you may not know <eob> is that the helmets <eol> that are worn in bicycling and football <eob> and many activities, <eob> they're not designed or tested <eob> for how well they can protect your children <eol> against concussion. <eob>
They're in fact designed and tested <eob> for their ability to protect <eol> against skull fracture. <eob>
And so I get this question <eol> all the time from parents, <eob> and they ask me, <eob> "Would you let your own child play football?" <eob> Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?" <eob> And I think that as a field, <eob> we're a long way from giving an answer <eol> with any kind of confidence there. <eob>
So I look at that question <eol> from a bit of a different lens, <eob> and I want to know, how can we prevent concussion? <eob> Is that even possible? <eob>
And most experts think that it's not, <eob> but the work that we're doing in my lab <eob> is starting to reveal more of the details <eol> around concussion <eob> so that we can have a better understanding. <eob>
The reason we're able to prevent <eol> skull fracture with helmets <eob> is because it's pretty simple. <eob>
We know how it works. <eob>
Concussion has been much more <eol> of a mystery. <eob>
So to give you a sense of what <eol> might be happening in a concussion, <eob> I want to show you the video here <eob> that you see when you type into Google, <eob> "What is a concussion?" <eob> The CDC website comes up, <eob> and this video essentially tells the whole story. <eob>
What you see is the head moves forward, <eob> the brain lags behind, <eob> then the brain catches up <eob> and smashes into the skull. <eob>
It rebounds off the skull <eob> and then proceeds to run into the other <eol> side of the skull. <eob>
And what you'll notice is highlighted <eol> in this video from the CDC, <eob> which I'll note <eol> was funded by the NFL, <eob> is that the outer surface of the brain, <eob> where it was to have smashed <eol> into the skull, <eob> looks like it's been damaged or injured, so it's <eol> on the outer surface of the brain. <eob>
And what I'd like to do with this video <eob> is to tell you that there are some aspects <eol> that are probably right, <eob> indicative of what the scientists think <eol> happens with concussion, <eob> but there's probably more <eol> that's wrong with this video. <eob>
So one thing that I do agree with, <eol> and I think most experts would, <eob> is that the brain does have these dynamics. <eob>
It does lag behind the skull <eob> and then catch up and move back <eol> and forth and oscillate. <eob>
That we think is true. <eob>
However, the amount of motion <eol> you see in the brain in this video <eob> is probably not right at all. <eob>
There's very little room <eol> in the cranial vault, <eob> only a few millimeters, <eob> and it's filled entirely <eol> with cerebral spinal fluid, <eob> which acts as a protective layer. <eob>
And so the brain as a whole probably moves <eol> very little inside the skull. <eob>
The other problem with this video <eob> is that the brain is shown <eob> as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around, <eob> and that's not true either. <eob>
Your brain is one of the softest <eol> substances in your body, <eob> and you can think of it kind of like jello. <eob>
So as your head is moving back and forth, <eob> your brain is twisting and turning and contorting, <eob> and the tissue is getting stretched. <eob>
And so most experts, I think, would agree <eob> that concussion is not likely <eol> to be something that's happening <eob> on this outer surface of the brain, <eob> but rather it's something <eol> that's much deeper <eob> towards the center of the brain. <eob>
Now, the way that <eol> we're approaching this problem <eob> to try to understand <eol> the mechanisms of concussion <eob> and to figure out if we can prevent it <eob> is we are using a device like this. <eob>
It's a mouthguard. <eob>
It has sensors in it <eol> that are essentially the same <eob> that are in your cell phone: <eob> accelerometers, gyroscopes, <eob> and when someone is struck in the head, <eob> it can tell you how their head moved <eob> at a thousand samples per second. <eob>
The principle behind the mouthguard is this: <eob> it fits onto your teeth. <eob>
Your teeth are one of the hardest <eol> substances in your body. <eob>
So it rigidly couples to your skull <eob> and gives you the most precise <eol> possible measurement <eob> of how the skull moves. <eob>
People have tried other approaches, <eol> with helmets. <eob>
We've looked at other sensors <eol> that go on your skin, <eob> and they all simply move <eol> around too much, <eob> and so we found that this is the only reliable way <eob> to take a good measurement. <eob>
So now that we've got this device, <eol> we can go beyond studying cadavers, <eob> because you can only learn so much <eol> about concussion <eob> from studying a cadaver, <eob> and we want to learn and study live humans. <eob>
So where can we find a group <eol> of willing volunteers <eob> to go out and smash their heads <eol> into each other on a regular basis <eob> and sustain concussion? <eob>
Well, I was one of them, <eob> and it's your local friendly <eol> Stanford football team. <eob>
So this is our laboratory, <eob> and I want to show you <eob> the first concussion <eol> we measured with this device. <eob>
One of the things that I should point out <eol> is the device has this gyroscope in it, <eob> and that allows you to measure <eol> the rotation of the head. <eob>
Most experts think that that's the critical factor <eob> that might start to tell us <eol> what is happening in concussion. <eob> So please watch this video. <eob>
Announcer: Cougars bring extra <eol> people late, but Luck has time, <eob> and Winslow is crushed. <eob>
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times <eol> is probably a little excessive there. <eob>
But you get the idea. <eob>
So when you look at <eol> just the film here, <eob> pretty much the only thing you can see <eol> is he got hit really hard and he was hurt. <eob>
But when we extract the data <eob> out of the mouthguard <eol> that he was wearing, <eob> we can see much more detail, <eol> much richer information. <eob>
And one of the things that we noticed here <eob> is that he was struck in the lower left <eol> side of his face mask. <eob> And so that did something first <eol> that was a little counterintuitive. <eob>
His head did not move to the right. <eob>
In fact, it rotated first to the left. <eob>
Then as the neck began to compress, <eob> the force of the blow caused it <eol> to whip back to the right. <eob>
So this left-right motion <eol> was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon, <eob> and we think that is probably <eol> what led to the brain injury. <eob>
Now, this device is only limited <eol> in such that it can measure the skull motion, <eob> but what we really want to know <eol> is what's happening inside of the brain. <eob>
So we collaborate with Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden. <eob> They've developed a finite <eol> element model of the brain. <eob>
And so this is a simulation <eob> using the data from our mouthguard <eol> from the injury I just showed you, <eob> and what you see is the brain -- <eob> this is a cross-section <eol> right in the front <eob> of the brain twisting and contorting as I mentioned. <eob>
So you can see this doesn't look <eol> a lot like the CDC video. <eob>
Now, the colors that you're looking at <eob> are how much the brain tissue <eol> is being stretched. <eob>
And so the red is 50 percent. <eob>
That means the brain has been stretched <eol> to 50 percent of its original length, <eob> the tissue in that particular area. <eob>
And the main thing I want to draw <eol> your attention to is this red spot. <eob>
So the red spot is very close <eol> to the center of the brain, <eob> and relatively speaking, <eob> you don't see a lot of colors <eol> like that on the exterior surface <eob> as the CDC video showed. <eob>
Now, to explain a little more detail <eob> about how we think concussion <eol> might be happening, <eob> one thing I should mention <eob> is that we and others have observed <eol> that a concussion is more likely <eob> when you're struck and your head rotates <eol> in this direction. <eob>
This is more common in sports <eol> like football, <eob> but this seems to be more dangerous. <eob>
So what might be happening there? <eob>
Well, one thing <eol> that you'll notice in the human brain <eob> that is different than other animals <eob> is we have these two very large lobes. <eob>
We have the right brain <eol> and the left brain. <eob>
And the key thing <eol> to notice in this figure here <eob> is that right down the center <eol> of the right brain and the left brain <eob> there's a large fissure <eol> that goes deep into the brain. <eob>
And in that fissure, what you can't see in this image, <eob> you'll have to trust me, <eob> there is a fibrous <eol> sheet of tissue. <eob>
It's called the falx, <eob> and it runs from the front of your head <eol> all the way to the back of your head, <eob> and it's quite stiff. <eob>
And so what that allows for <eol> is when you're struck <eob> and your head rotates in this left-right direction, <eob> forces can rapidly transmit <eol> right down to the center of your brain. <eob>
Now, what's there <eol> at the bottom of this fissure? <eob>
It's the wiring of your brain, <eob> and in fact this red bundle here <eol> at the bottom of that fissure <eob> is the single largest fiber bundle <eob> that is the wiring that connects <eol> the right and left sides of your brain. <eob>
It's called the corpus callosum. <eob>
And we think that this might be <eob> one of the most common <eol> mechanisms of concussion, <eob> and as the forces move down, <eol> they strike the corpus callosum, <eob> it causes a dissociation <eol> between your right and your left brain <eob> and could explain some of the symptoms <eol> of concussion. <eob>
This finding is also consistent <eol> of what we've seen <eob> in this brain disease <eol> that I mentioned, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. <eob>
So this is an image of a middle-aged <eol> ex-professional football player, <eob> and the thing that I want to point out <eol> is if you look at the corpus callosum, <eob> and I'll page back here so you can see <eol> the size of a normal corpus callosum <eob> and the size of the person here <eol> who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, <eob> it is greatly atrophied. <eob>
And the same goes for all of the space <eol> in the ventricles. <eob>
These ventricles are much larger. <eob>
And so all of this tissue <eol> near the center of the brain <eob> has died off over time. <eob>
So what we're learning <eol> is indeed consistent. <eob>
Now, there is some good news here, <eob> and I hope to give you a sense <eol> of hope by the end of this talk. <eob> One of the things that we've noticed, <eob> specifically about this mechanism of injury, <eob> is although there's a rapid transmission <eol> of the forces down this fissure, <eob> it still takes a defined amount of time. <eob>
And what we think is that if we can slow <eol> the head down just enough <eob> so that the brain does not lag <eol> behind the skull <eob> but instead it moves in synchrony with the skull, <eob> then we might be able <eol> to prevent this mechanism of concussion. <eob>
So how can we slow the head down? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A gigantic helmet. <eob> So with more space, <eol> you have more time, <eob> and this is a bit of a joke, <eol> but some of you may have seen this. <eob>
This is bubble soccer, <eol> and it's a real sport. <eob>
In fact, I saw some young adults <eob> playing this sport <eol> down the street from my house the other day, <eob> and as far as I know there have been <eol> no reported concussions. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But in all seriousness, <eol> this principle does work, <eob> but this has gone too far. <eob>
This isn't something that's practical <eol> for bike riding or playing football. <eob>
And so we are collaborating <eol> with a company in Sweden called Hövding. <eob>
Some of you may have seen their work, <eob> and they're using the same principle <eol> of air to give you some extra space <eob> to prevent concussion. <eob>
Kids, don't try this at home please. <eob>
This stuntman does not have a helmet. <eob>
He instead has a neck collar, <eob> and this neck collar has sensors in it, <eob> the same type of sensors <eol> that are in our mouthguard, <eob> and it detects when he's likely to have a fall, <eob> and there's an airbag <eol> that explodes and triggers, <eob> the same way that an airbag works in your car, essentially. <eob>
And in the experiments we've done <eol> in my lab with their device, <eob> we found that it can greatly reduce <eol> the risk of concussion in some scenarios <eob> compared to a normal bicycle helmet. <eob>
So it's a pretty exciting development. <eob>
But in order for us to actually realize <eol> the benefits of technology <eob> that can prevent concussion, <eob> it needs to meet regulations. <eob>
That's a reality. <eob>
And this device is for sale in Europe <eob> but is not for sale in the US, and probably <eol> won't be any time soon. <eob>
So I wanted to tell you why. <eob>
There are some good reasons and then <eol> there are some not so good reasons. <eob>
Bike helmets are federally regulated. <eob>
The Consumer Product Safety Commission <eol> has been given jurisdiction <eob> to approve any bike helmet for sale, <eob> and this is the test they use. <eob>
This is back to what I was telling you <eol> at the beginning about skull fracture. <eob>
That's what this test is for. <eob>
And that's an important thing to do. <eob>
It can save your life, <eol> but it's not sufficient, I would say. <eob>
So for example, one thing this test <eol> doesn't evaluate <eob> is it doesn't tell you is that airbag going to trigger <eob> at the right time and place, and not trigger <eol> when it doesn't need to? <eob>
Similarly, it's not going to tell you <eob> is this helmet likely <eob> to prevent concussion <eob> or not? <eob>
And if you look at football helmets, <eol> which aren't regulated, <eob> they still have a very similar test. <eob>
They're not regulated <eol> by the government, anyway. <eob>
They have an industry body, which <eol> is the way most industries work. <eob>
But this industry body, I can tell you, <eol> has been quite resistant <eob> to updating their standards. <eob>
So in my lab, we are working <eol> on not only the mechanism of concussion, <eob> but we want to understand how can we have better <eol> test standards? <eob>
And we hope that the government <eol> can use this type of information <eob> to encourage innovation <eob> by letting consumers know <eob> how protected are you with a given helmet. <eob>
And I want to bring this back <eol> finally to the original question I asked, <eob> which is, would I feel comfortable <eol> letting my child play football <eob> or ride a bicycle? <eob>
And this might be just a result <eol> of my own traumatic experience. <eob> I'm much more nervous <eol> about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle. <eob>
So she's a year and a half old, <eob> and she's already, well, wants to anyway, <eol> race down the streets of San Francisco. <eob>
This is the bottom of one <eol> of these streets. <eob>
And so my personal goal is to -- <eol> and I believe this is possible -- <eob> is to further develop these technologies, <eob> and in fact, we're working <eol> on something in my lab in particular <eob> that really makes optimal use <eol> of the given space of a helmet. <eob>
And I am confident <eol> that we will be able to, <eob> before she's ready to ride <eol> a two-wheeler, <eob> have something available <eob> that can in fact really reduce <eol> the risk of concussion <eob> and comply with regulatory bodies. <eob>
And so what I'd like to do -- <eob> and I know that this is for some <eol> of you of more immediate nature, <eob> I've got a couple years here -- <eob> is to be able to tell parents <eol> and grandparents when I'm asked, <eob> it is safe and healthy for your children <eol> to engage in these activities. <eob>
And I'm very fortunate to have <eol> a wonderful team at Stanford <eob> that's working hard on this. <eob>
So I hope to come back in a few years <eol> with the final story, <eob> but for now I will tell you, <eob> please don't just be afraid <eol> when you hear the word concussion. <eob> There is hope. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know, I didn't set out <eol> to be a parenting expert. <eob>
In fact, I'm not very interested <eol> in parenting, per Se. <eob>
It's just that there's a certain style <eol> of parenting these days <eob> that is kind of messing up kids, <eob> impeding their chances to develop into theirselves. <eob>
There's a certain style <eol> of parenting these days <eob> that's getting in the way. <eob>
I guess what I'm saying is, <eob> we spend a lot of time <eol> being very concerned <eob> about parents who aren't involved <eol> enough in the lives of their kids <eob> and their education or their upbringing, <eob> and rightly so. <eob>
But at the other end of the spectrum, <eob> there's a lot of harm <eol> going on there as well, <eob> where parents feel a kid <eol> can't be successful <eob> unless the parent is protecting <eol> and preventing at every turn <eob> and hovering over every happening, <eol> and micromanaging every moment, <eob> and steering their kid towards some small subset <eol> of colleges and careers. <eob>
When we raise kids this way, <eob> and I'll say we, <eob> because Lord knows, in raising <eol> my two teenagers, <eob> I've had these tendencies myself, <eob> our kids end up leading <eol> a kind of checklisted childhood. <eob>
And here's what the checklisted <eol> childhood looks like. <eob>
We keep them safe and sound <eob> and fed and watered, <eob> and then we want to be sure <eol> they go to the right schools, <eob> that they're in the right classes <eol> at the right schools, <eob> and that they get the right grades <eol> in the right classes in the right schools. <eob>
But not just the grades, the scores, <eob> and not just the grades and scores, <eol> but the accolades and the awards <eob> and the sports, <eol> the activities, the leadership. <eob>
We tell our kids, <eol> don't just join a club, <eob> start a club, because colleges <eol> want to see that. <eob>
And check the box for community service. <eob>
I mean, show the colleges <eol> you care about others. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And all of this is done to some hoped-for <eol> degree of perfection. <eob>
We expect our kids to perform <eol> at a level of perfection <eob> we were never asked to perform at ourselves, <eob> and so because so much is required, <eob> we think, <eob> well then, of course <eol> we parents have to argue with every teacher <eob> and principal and coach and referee <eob> and act like our kid's concierge <eob> and personal handler <eob> and secretary. <eob>
And then with our kids, <eol> our precious kids, <eob> we spend so much time nudging, <eob> cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, <eol> nagging as the case may be, <eob> to be sure they're not <eol> screwing up, <eob> not closing doors, <eob> not ruining their future, <eob> some hoped-for admission <eob> to a tiny handful of colleges <eob> that deny almost every applicant. <eob>
And here's what it feels like to be <eol> a kid in this checklisted childhood. <eob>
First of all, there's no time <eol> for free play. <eob>
There's no room in the afternoons, <eob> because everything has to be enriching, <eob> we think. <eob>
It's as if every piece of homework, <eol> every quiz, every activity <eob> is a make-or-break moment <eol> for this future we have in mind for them, <eob> and we absolve them of helping out <eol> around the house, <eob> and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep <eob> as long as they're checking off the items <eol> on their checklist. <eob>
And in the checklisted childhood, <eol> we say we just want them to be happy, <eob> but when they come home from school, <eob> what we ask about all too often first <eob> is their homework <eol> and their grades. <eob>
And they see in our faces <eob> that our approval, that our love, <eob> that their very worth, <eob> comes from A's. <eob>
And then we walk alongside them <eob> and offer clucking praise like a trainer <eol> at the Westminster Dog Show -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
coaxing them to just jump a little higher <eol> and soar a little farther, <eob> day after day after day. <eob>
And when they get to high school, <eob> they don't say, "Well, what might I be interested <eol> in studying <eob> or doing as an activity?" <eob> They go to counselors and they say, <eob> "What do I need to do <eol> to get into the right college?" <eob> And then, when the grades start <eol> to roll in in high school, <eob> and they're getting some B's, <eob> or God forbid some C's, <eob> they frantically text their friends <eob> and say, "Has anyone ever gotten <eol> into the right college with these grades?" <eob>
And our kids, <eob> regardless of where they end <eol> up at the end of high school, <eob> they're breathless. <eob> They're brittle. <eob> They're a little burned out. <eob>
They're a little old before their time, <eob> wishing the grown-ups in their lives had said, <eol> "What you've done is enough, <eob> this effort you've put forth <eol> in childhood is enough." <eob> And they're withering now <eol> under high rates of anxiety and depression <eob> and some of them are wondering, <eob> will this life ever turn out to have been worth it? <eob>
Well, we parents, <eob> we parents are pretty sure <eol> it's all worth it. <eob>
We seem to behave -- <eob> it's like we literally think <eol> they will have no future <eob> if they don't get into one <eol> of these tiny set of colleges or careers <eob> we have in mind for them. <eob>
Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid <eob> they won't have a future <eol> we can brag about <eob> to our friends and with stickers <eol> on the backs of our cars. <eob> Yeah. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But if you look at what we've done, <eob> if you have the courage to really look at it, <eob> you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes <eob> from grades and scores, <eob> but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds <eob> all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich," <eob> we send our children the message: <eob> "Hey kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me." <eob> And so with our overhelp, <eob> our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding, <eob> we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, <eob> which is a really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, <eob> far more important than that self-esteem they get <eob> every time we applaud. <eob>
Self-efficacy is built <eob> when one sees that one's own actions <eol> lead to outcomes, <eob> not -- <eob> There you go. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Not one's parents' actions <eol> on one's behalf, <eob> but when one's own actions lead to outcomes. <eob>
So simply put, <eob> if our children are to develop <eol> self-efficacy, and they must, <eob> then they have to do a whole lot more <eol> of the thinking, planning, deciding, <eob> doing, hoping, coping, <eol> trial and error, <eob> dreaming and experiencing of life <eob> for themselves. <eob>
Now, am I saying <eob> every kid is hard-working <eol> and motivated <eob> and doesn't need a parent's involvement <eol> or interest in their lives, <eob> and we should just back off and let go? <eob> Hell no. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That is not what I'm saying. <eob>
What I'm saying is, when we treat <eob> grades and scores and accolades <eol> and awards <eob> as the purpose of childhood, <eob> all in furtherance of <eob> some hoped-for admission <eob> to a tiny number of colleges <eob> or entrance to a small number of careers, <eob> that that's too narrow a definition of success <eol> for our kids. <eob>
And even though we might help them <eol> achieve some short-term wins <eob> by overhelping -- <eob> like they get a better grade <eol> if we help them do their homework, <eob> they might end up with a longer <eol> childhood résumé when we help -- <eob> what I'm saying is that all of this comes <eol> at a long-term cost <eob> to their sense of self. <eob>
What I'm saying is, we should be less concerned <eob> with the specific set of colleges <eob> they might be able to apply <eol> to or might get into <eob> and far more concerned <eob> that they have the habits, the mindset, <eol> the skill set, <eob> the wellness, to be successful wherever they go. <eob>
What I'm saying is, <eob> our kids need us to be <eol> a little less obsessed with grades and scores <eob> and a whole lot more interested <eob> in childhood providing a foundation <eol> for their success <eob> built on things like love <eob> and chores. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Did I just say chores? <eob>
Did I just say chores? I really did. <eob> But really, here's why. <eob> The longest longitudinal study <eol> of humans ever conducted <eob> is called the Harvard Grant Study. <eob>
It found that professional success in life, <eob> which is what we want for our kids, <eob> that professional success in life comes <eol> from having done chores as a kid, <eob> and the earlier you started, the better, <eob> that a roll-up-your-sleeves- <eol> and-pitch-in mindset, <eob> a mindset that says, there's some unpleasant work, <eob> someone's got to do it, <eol> it might as well be me, <eob> a mindset that says, <eob> I will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole, <eob> that that's what gets you ahead in the workplace. <eob>
Now, we all know this. You know this. <eob>
We all know this, and yet, <eol> in the checklisted childhood, <eob> we absolve our kids of doing <eol> the work of chores around the house, <eob> and then they end up <eol> as young adults in the workplace <eob> still waiting for a checklist, <eob> but it doesn't exist, <eob> and more importantly, lacking the impulse, <eol> the instinct <eob> to roll up their sleeves and pitch in <eob> and look around and wonder, <eol> how can I be useful to my colleagues? <eob> How can I anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need? <eob>
A second very important <eol> finding from the Harvard Grant Study <eob> said that happiness in life <eob> comes from love, <eob> not love of work, <eob> love of humans: <eob> our spouse, our partner, <eol> our friends, our family. <eob>
So childhood needs <eol> to teach our kids how to love, <eob> and they can't love others <eol> if they don't first love themselves, <eob> and they won't love themselves <eol> if we can't offer them unconditional love. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Right. And so, <eob> instead of being obsessed <eol> with grades and scores <eob> when our precious <eol> offspring come home from school, <eob> or we come home from work, <eob> we need to close our technology, <eol> put away our phones, <eob> and look them in the eye <eob> and let them see the joy <eol> that fills our faces <eob> when we see our child <eol> for the first time in a few hours. <eob>
And then we have to say, <eob> "How was your day? <eob>
What did you like about today?" <eob> And when your teenage daughter says, <eol> "Lunch," like mine did, <eob> and I want to hear about the math test, <eob> not lunch, <eob> you have to still take <eol> an interest in lunch. <eob>
You gotta say, "What was great <eol> about lunch today?" <eob> They need to know they matter <eol> to us as humans, <eob> not because of their GPA. <eob>
All right, so you're thinking, <eol> chores and love, <eob> that sounds all well and good, <eol> but give me a break. <eob>
The colleges want to see <eol> top scores and grades <eob> and accolades and awards, <eol> and I'm going to tell you, sort of. <eob>
The very biggest brand-name schools <eol> are asking that of our young adults, <eob> but here's the good news. <eob>
Contrary to what the college rankings racket <eol> would have us believe -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
you don't have to go to one <eol> of the biggest brand name schools <eob> to be happy and successful in life. <eob>
Happy and successful people <eol> went to state school, <eob> went to a small college no one has heard of, <eob> went to community college, <eob> went to a college over here and flunked out. <eob>
The evidence is in this room, <eol> is in our communities, <eob> that this is the truth. <eob>
And if we could widen our blinders <eob> and be willing to look <eol> at a few more colleges, <eob> maybe remove our own egos <eol> from the equation, <eob> we could accept and embrace this truth <eol> and then realize, <eob> it is hardly the end of the world <eob> if our kids don't go to one <eol> of those big brand-name schools. <eob>
And more importantly, <eob> if their childhood has not been lived <eol> according to a tyrannical checklist <eob> then when they get to college, <eob> whichever one it is, <eob> well, they'll have gone <eol> there on their own volition, <eob> fueled by their own desire, <eob> capable and ready to thrive there. <eob>
I have to admit something to you. <eob>
I've got two kids I mentioned, <eol> Sawyer and Avery. <eob> They're teenagers. <eob> And once upon a time, <eob> I think I was treating <eol> my Sawyer and Avery <eob> like little bonsai trees -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
that I was going to carefully clip and prune <eob> and shape into some <eol> perfect form of a human <eob> that might just be perfect enough <eol> to warrant them admission <eob> to one of the most highly <eol> selective colleges. <eob>
But I've come to realize, after working <eol> with thousands of other people's kids -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and raising two kids of my own, <eob> my kids aren't bonsai trees. <eob>
They're wildflowers <eob> of an unknown genus and species -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
and it's my job to provide <eol> a nourishing environment, <eob> to strengthen them through chores <eob> and to love them so they can love others <eol> and receive love <eob> and the college, the major, the career, <eob> that's up to them. <eob>
My job is not to make them become <eol> what I would have them become, <eob> but to support them in becoming <eol> their glorious selves. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you heard the news? <eob> We're in a clean energy revolution. <eob>
And where I live in Berkeley, California, <eob> it seems like every day I see a new roof <eol> with new solar panels going up, <eob> electric car in the driveway. <eob>
Germany sometimes gets <eol> half its power from solar, <eob> and India is now committed <eol> to building 10 times more solar <eob> than we have in California, <eob> by the year 2022. <eob>
Even nuclear seems to be <eol> making a comeback. <eob>
Bill Gates is in China <eol> working with engineers, <eob> there's 40 different companies <eol> that are working together <eob> to try to race to build the first <eol> reactor that runs on waste, <eob> that can't melt down <eob> and is cheaper than coal. <eob>
And so you might start to ask: <eob> Is this whole global warming problem <eob> going to be a lot easier to solve <eol> than anybody imagined? <eob>
That was the question we wanted to know, <eob> so my colleagues and I decided <eol> to take a deep dive into the data. <eob>
We were a little skeptical of some parts <eob> of the clean energy revolution story, <eob> but what we found really surprised us. <eob>
The first thing is that clean <eol> energy has been increasing. <eob>
This is electricity from clean energy <eol> sources over the last 20 years. <eob>
But when you look at <eol> the percentage of global electricity <eob> from clean energy sources, <eob> it's actually been in decline <eol> from 36 percent to 31 percent. <eob>
And if you care about climate change, <eob> you've got to go in the opposite direction <eob> to 100 percent of our electricity <eob> from clean energy sources, <eob> as quickly as possible. <eob>
Now, you might wonder, <eob> "Come on, how much could five percentage <eol> points of global electricity be?" <eob> Well, it turns out to be quite a bit. <eob>
It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants <eob> the size of Diablo Canyon, <eol> California's last nuclear plant, <eob> or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz, <eob> which is one of the biggest <eol> solar farms in the world, <eob> and certainly our biggest in California. <eob>
A big part of this is simply <eol> that fossil fuels are increasing <eob> faster than clean energy. <eob> And that's understandable. <eob> There's just a lot of poor countries <eob> that are still using wood <eol> and dung and charcoal <eob> as their main source of energy, <eob> and they need modern fuels. <eob>
But there's something else going on, <eob> which is that one of those clean energy <eol> sources in particular <eob> has actually been on the decline <eol> in absolute terms, <eob> not just relatively. <eob>
And that's nuclear. <eob>
You can see its generation <eol> has declined seven percent <eob> over the last 10 years. <eob>
Now, solar and wind have been <eol> making huge strides, <eob> so you hear a lot of talk <eol> about how it doesn't really matter, <eob> because solar and wind <eol> is going to make up the difference. <eob>
But the data says something different. <eob>
When you combine all the electricity <eol> from solar and wind, <eob> you see it actually barely makes up <eol> half of the decline from nuclear. <eob>
Let's take a closer look <eol> in the United States. <eob>
Over the last couple of years -- <eol> really 2013, 2014 -- <eob> we prematurely retired <eol> four nuclear power plants. <eob>
They were almost entirely <eol> replaced with fossil fuels, <eob> and so the consequence <eol> was that we wiped out <eob> almost as much clean energy <eol> electricity that we get from solar. <eob>
And it's not unique to us. <eob>
People think of California <eol> as a clean energy and climate leader, <eob> but when we looked at the data, <eob> what we found is that, in fact, <eob> California reduced emissions more slowly <eol> than the national average, <eob> between 2000 and 2015. <eob>
What about Germany? <eob> They're doing a lot of clean energy. <eob>
But when you look at the data, <eob> German emissions have actually <eol> been going up since 2009, <eob> and there's really not anybody <eol> who's going to tell you <eob> that they're going to meet <eol> their climate commitments in 2020. <eob>
The reason isn't hard to understand. <eob> Solar and wind provide power <eol> about 10 to 20 percent of the time, <eob> which means that when <eol> the sun's not shining, <eob> the wind's not blowing, <eob> you still need power for your hospitals, <eob> your homes, your cities, your factories. <eob>
And while batteries have made <eol> some really cool improvements lately, <eob> the truth is, they're just never <eol> going to be as efficient <eob> as the electrical grid. <eob>
Every time you put electricity <eol> into a battery and take it out, <eob> you lose about 20 to 40 <eol> percent of the power. <eob>
That's why when, in California, <eob> we try to deal with all the solar <eol> we've brought online -- <eob> we now get about 10 percent <eol> of electricity from solar -- <eob> when the sun goes down, <eol> and people come home from work <eob> and turn on their air conditioners <eol> and their TV sets, <eob> and every other appliance in the house, <eob> we need a lot of natural gas backup. <eob>
So what we've been doing <eob> is stuffing a lot of natural gas <eol> into the side of a mountain. <eob>
And that worked pretty well for a while, <eob> but then late last year, <eol> it sprung a leak. <eob>
This is Aliso Canyon. <eob>
So much methane gas was released, <eob> it was the equivalent of putting <eol> half a million cars on the road. <eob>
It basically blew through all <eol> of our climate commitments for the year. <eob>
Well, what about India? <eob> Sometimes you have to go places <eol> to really get the right data, <eob> so we traveled to India a few months ago. <eob>
We met with all the top officials -- <eol> solar, nuclear, the rest -- <eob> and what they told us is, <eob> "We're actually having <eol> more serious problems <eob> than both Germany and California. <eob>
We don't have backup; <eol> we don't have all the natural gas. <eob>
And that's just the start of it. <eob>
Say we want to get <eol> to 100 gigawatts by 2022. <eob>
But last year we did just five, <eob> and the year before that, we did five." <eob>
So, let's just take <eol> a closer look at nuclear. <eob>
The United Nations Intergovernmental <eol> Panel on Climate Change <eob> has looked at the carbon content <eol> of all these different fuels, <eob> and nuclear comes out really low -- <eol> it's actually lower even than solar. <eob>
And nuclear obviously <eol> provides a lot of power -- <eob> 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <eob>
During a year, a single plant can provide <eol> power 92 percent of the time. <eob>
What's interesting is that <eol> when you look at countries <eob> that have deployed different <eol> kinds of clean energies, <eob> there's only a few that have done so <eob> at a pace consistent with dealing <eol> with the climate crisis. <eob>
So nuclear seems like <eol> a pretty good option, <eob> but there's this big problem with it, <eob> which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of, <eob> which is that people really don't like it. <eob>
There was a study, a survey done <eol> of people around the world, <eob> not just in the United States or Europe, <eob> about a year and a half ago. <eob>
And what they found <eob> is that nuclear is actually one <eol> of the least popular forms of energy. <eob>
Even oil is more popular than nuclear. <eob>
And while nuclear kind of <eol> edges out coal, the thing is, <eob> people don't really fear coal <eol> in the same way they fear nuclear, <eob> which really operates on our unconscious. <eob>
So what is it that we fear? <eob> There's really three things. <eob>
There's the safety <eol> of the plants themselves -- <eob> the fears that they're going <eol> to melt down and cause damage; <eob> there's the waste from them; <eob> and there's the association with weapons. <eob>
And I think, understandably, <eob> engineers look at those concerns <eol> and look for technological fixes. <eob>
That's why Bill Gates is in China <eol> developing advanced reactors. <eob>
That's why 40 different entrepreneurs <eol> are working on this problem. <eob>
And I, myself, have been <eol> very excited about it. <eob>
We did a report: <eol> "How to Make Nuclear Cheap." <eob> In particular, the thorium reactor <eol> shows a lot of promise. <eob>
So when the climate <eol> scientist, James Hansen, <eob> asked if I wanted to go to China with him <eob> and look at the Chinese <eol> advanced nuclear program, <eob> I jumped at the chance. <eob>
We were there with MIT <eol> and UC Berkeley engineers. <eob>
And I had in my mind <eob> that the Chinese would be able <eol> to do with nuclear <eob> what they did with so many other things -- <eob> start to crank out small nuclear <eol> reactors on assembly lines, <eob> ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks <eol> and send them around the world. <eob>
I would get one at home in Berkeley. <eob>
But what I found was somewhat different. <eob>
The presentations were all <eol> very exciting and very promising; <eob> they have multiple reactors <eol> that they're working on. <eob>
The time came for the thorium reactor, <eol> and a bunch of us were excited. <eob>
They went through the whole presentation, <eol> they got to the timeline, <eob> and they said, <eob> "We're going to have <eol> a thorium molten salt reactor <eob> ready for sale to the world <eob> by 2040." <eob> And I was like, "What?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I looked at my colleagues and I was like, <eob> "Excuse me -- <eob> can you guys speed that up a little bit? <eob>
Because we're in a little bit <eol> of a climate crisis right now. <eob>
And your cities are really <eol> polluted, by the way." <eob> And they responded back, they were like, <eob> "I'm not sure what you've heard <eol> about our thorium program, <eob> but we don't have a third of our budget, <eob> and your department of energy <eol> hasn't been particularly forthcoming <eob> with all that data you guys <eol> have on testing reactors." <eob> And I said, "Well, I've got an idea. <eob>
You know how you've got 10 years <eol> where you're demonstrating that reactor? <eob> Let's just skip that part, <eob> and let's just go right <eol> to commercializing it. <eob>
That will save money and time." <eob> And the engineer just <eol> looked at me and said, <eob> "Let me ask you a question: <eob> Would you buy a car that had never <eol> been demonstrated before?" <eob>
So what about the other reactors? <eob> There's a reactor that's coming online <eol> now, they're starting to sell it. <eob>
It's a high-temperature gas reactor. <eob>
It can't melt down. <eob>
But it's really big and bulky, <eol> that's part of the safety, <eob> and nobody thinks <eol> it's going to ever get cheaper <eob> than the reactors that we have. <eob>
The ones that use waste as fuel <eol> are really cool ideas, but the truth is, <eob> we don't actually know how to do that yet. <eob>
There's some risk that you'll <eol> actually make more waste, <eob> and most people think <eol> that if you're including <eob> that waste part of the process, <eob> it's just going to make the whole <eol> machine a lot more expensive, <eob> it's just adding another complicated step. <eob>
The truth is, <eob> there's real questions about how much <eol> of that we're going to do. <eob>
I mean, we went to India and asked <eol> about the nuclear program. <eob>
The government said <eol> before the Paris climate talks <eob> that they were going to do something <eol> like 30 new nuclear plants. <eob>
But when we got there <eol> and interviewed people <eob> and even looked at the internal documents, <eob> they're now saying <eol> they're going to do about five. <eob>
And in most of the world, <eol> especially the rich world, <eob> they're not talking <eol> about building new reactors. <eob>
We're actually talking <eol> about taking reactors down <eob> before their lifetimes are over. <eob>
Germany's actually pressuring <eol> its neighbors to do that. <eob>
I mentioned the United States — <eob> we could lose half of our reactors <eol> over the next 15 years, <eob> which would wipe out 40 percent <eol> of the emissions reductions <eob> we're supposed to get under the Clean Power Plan. <eob>
Of course, in Japan, they took <eol> all their nuclear plants offline, <eob> replaced them with coal, <eol> natural gas, oil burning, <eob> and they're only expected to bring <eol> online about a third to two-thirds. <eob>
So when we went through the numbers, <eob> and just added that up -- <eob> how much nuclear do we see <eol> China and India bringing online <eob> over the next 15 years, <eob> how much do we see at risk <eol> of being taken offline -- <eob> this was the most startling finding. <eob>
What we found is that the world <eol> is actually at risk <eob> of losing four times more clean energy <eol> than we lost <eob> over the last 10 years. <eob>
In other words: we're not in <eol> a clean energy revolution; <eob> we're in a clean energy crisis. <eob>
So it's understandable that engineers <eol> would look for a technical fix <eob> to the fears that people have of nuclear. <eob>
But when you consider <eol> that these are big challenges to do, <eob> that they're going to take <eol> a long time to solve, <eob> there's this other issue, which is: <eob> Are those technical fixes <eol> really going to solve people's fears? <eob>
Let's take safety. <eob> You know, despite what people think, <eob> it's hard to figure out how <eol> to make nuclear power much safer. <eob>
I mean, every medical <eol> journal that looks at it -- <eob> this is the most recent study <eol> from the British journal, "Lancet," <eob> one of the most respected <eol> journals in the world -- <eob> nuclear is the safest way <eol> to make reliable power. <eob>
Everybody's scared of the accidents. <eob>
So you go look at the accident data -- <eob> Fukushima, Chernobyl -- <eob> the World Health Organization <eol> finds the same thing: <eob> the vast majority of harm <eol> is caused by people panicking, <eob> and they're panicking <eol> because they're afraid. <eob>
In other words, <eob> the harm that's caused <eol> isn't actually caused by the machines <eob> or the radiation. <eob>
It's caused by our fears. <eob>
And what about the waste? <eob> Everyone worries about the waste. <eob>
Well, the interesting <eol> thing about the waste <eob> is how little of it there is. <eob>
This is just from one plant. <eob>
If you take all the nuclear waste <eol> we've ever made in the United States, <eob> put it on a football field, stacked it up, <eob> it would only reach 20 feet high. <eob>
And people say it's poisoning <eol> people or doing something -- <eob> it's not, it's just sitting <eol> there, it's just being monitored. <eob>
There's not very much of it. <eob>
By contrast, the waste that we don't <eol> control from energy production -- <eob> we call it "pollution," and it kills <eol> seven million people a year, <eob> and it's threatening very serious <eol> levels of global warming. <eob>
And the truth is that even if we get <eol> good at using that waste as fuel, <eob> there's always going to be <eol> some fuel left over. <eob>
That means there's always going to be <eol> people that think it's a big problem <eob> for reasons that maybe don't have <eol> as much to do with the actual waste <eob> as we think. <eob>
Well, what about the weapons? <eob> Maybe the most surprising thing <eol> is that we can't find any examples <eob> of countries that have nuclear power <eob> and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon. <eob>
In fact, it works the opposite. <eob>
What we find is the only way we know <eob> how to get rid large numbers <eol> of nuclear weapons <eob> is by using the plutonium in the warheads <eob> as fuel in our nuclear power plants. <eob>
And so, if you are wanting to get <eol> the world rid of nuclear weapons, <eob> then we're going to need <eol> a lot more nuclear power. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
As I was leaving China, <eob> the engineer that brought Bill Gates there <eol> kind of pulled me aside, <eob> and he said, "You know, Michael, <eol> I appreciate your interest <eob> in all the different nuclear <eol> supply technologies, <eob> but there's this more basic issue, <eob> which is that there's just not <eol> enough global demand. <eob>
I mean, we can crank out <eol> these machines on assembly lines, <eob> we do know how to make things cheap, <eob> but there's just not enough <eol> people that want them." <eob>
And so, let's do solar and wind <eol> and efficiency and conservation. <eob>
Let's accelerate the advanced <eol> nuclear programs. <eob>
I think we should triple the amount <eol> of money we're spending on it. <eob>
But I just think the most important thing, <eob> if we're going to overcome <eol> the climate crisis, <eob> is to keep in mind that the cause <eol> of the clean energy crisis <eob> isn't from within our machines, <eob> it's from within ourselves. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's a man out there, somewhere, <eob> who looks a little bit like <eol> the actor Idris Elba, <eob> or at least he did 20 years ago. <eob>
I don't know anything else about him, <eob> except that he once saved my life <eob> by putting his own life in danger. <eob>
This man ran across four lanes <eol> of freeway traffic in the middle of the night <eob> to bring me back to safety <eob> after a car accident <eol> that could have killed me. <eob>
And the whole thing left me <eol> really shaken up, obviously, <eob> but it also left me <eol> with this kind of burning, gnawing need <eob> to understand why he did it, <eob> what forces within him <eol> caused him to make the choice <eob> that I owe my life to, <eob> to risk his own life <eol> to save the life of a stranger? <eob>
In other words, what are the causes <eol> of his or anybody else's capacity for altruism? <eob>
But first let me tell you what happened. <eob>
That night, I was 19 years old <eob> and driving back to my home <eol> in Tacoma, Washington, <eob> down the Interstate 5 freeway, <eob> when a little dog darted <eol> out in front of my car. <eob>
And I did exactly <eol> what you're not supposed to do, <eob> which is swerve to avoid it. <eob>
And I discovered why you're not <eol> supposed to do that. <eob>
I hit the dog anyways, <eob> and that sent the car <eol> into a fishtail, <eob> and then a spin across the freeway, <eob> until finally it wound up in the fast lane <eol> of the freeway <eob> faced backwards into oncoming traffic <eob> and then the engine died. <eob>
And I was sure in that moment <eol> that I was about to die too, <eob> but I didn't <eob> because of the actions <eol> of that one brave man <eob> who must have made the decision <eob> within a fraction of a second <eol> of seeing my stranded car <eob> to pull over and run across four lanes <eol> of freeway traffic <eob> in the dark <eob> to save my life. <eob>
And then after he got <eol> my car working again <eob> and got me back to safety <eol> and made sure I was going to be all right, <eob> he drove off again. <eob>
He never even told me his name, <eob> and I'm pretty sure <eol> I forgot to say thank you. <eob>
So before I go any further, <eob> I really want to take a moment <eob> to stop and say thank you <eol> to that stranger. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I tell you all of this <eob> because the events of that night changed <eol> the course of my life to some degree. <eob>
I became a psychology researcher, <eob> and I've devoted my work to understanding <eol> the human capacity to care for others. <eob>
Where does it come from, <eol> and how does it develop, <eob> and what are the extreme forms <eol> that it can take? <eob>
These questions are really important <eol> to understanding basic aspects <eob> of human social nature. <eob>
A lot of people, and this includes everybody <eob> from philosophers <eol> and economists to ordinary people <eob> believe that human nature <eol> is fundamentally selfish, <eob> that we're only ever really motivated <eol> by our own welfare. <eob>
But if that's true, why do some people, <eol> like the stranger who rescued me, <eob> do selfless things, <eol> like helping other people <eob> at enormous risk and cost to themselves? <eob>
Answering this question <eob> requires exploring the roots <eol> of extraordinary acts of altruism, <eob> and what might make people <eol> who engage in such acts <eob> different than other people. <eob>
But until recently, very little work <eol> on this topic had been done. <eob>
The actions of the man who rescued me <eob> meet the most stringent definition <eol> of altruism, <eob> which is a voluntary, costly behavior <eob> motivated by the desire to help <eol> another individual. <eob>
So it's a selfless act <eol> intended to benefit only the other. <eob>
What could possibly explain <eol> an action like that? <eob>
One answer is compassion, obviously, <eob> which is a key driver of altruism. <eob>
But then the question becomes, <eob> why do some people seem <eol> to have more of it than others? <eob>
And the answer may be that the brains <eol> of highly altruistic people <eob> are different in fundamental ways. <eob>
But to figure out how, <eob> I actually started from the opposite end, <eob> with psychopaths. <eob>
A common approach to understanding <eol> basic aspects of human nature, <eob> like the desire to help other people, <eob> is to study people in whom <eol> that desire is missing, <eob> and psychopaths are exactly such a group. <eob>
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder <eob> with strongly genetic origins, <eob> and it results in a personality <eol> that's cold and uncaring <eob> and a tendency to engage in antisocial <eol> and sometimes very violent behavior. <eob>
Once my colleagues and I <eol> at the National Institute of Mental Health <eob> conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research <eob> of psychopathic adolescents, <eob> and our findings, and the findings <eol> of other researchers now, <eob> have shown that people who are psychopathic <eob> pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics. <eob>
First, although they're not generally insensitive <eol> to other people's emotions, <eob> they are insensitive to signs that other <eol> people are in distress. <eob>
And in particular, <eob> they have difficulty recognizing fearful <eol> facial expressions like this one. <eob>
And fearful expressions convey urgent need <eol> and emotional distress, <eob> and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help <eob> in people who see them, <eob> so it makes sense that people <eol> who tend to lack compassion <eob> also tend to be insensitive to these cues. <eob>
The part of the brain <eob> that's the most important <eol> for recognizing fearful expressions <eob> is called the amygdala. <eob>
There are very rare cases <eol> of people who lack amygdalas completely, <eob> and they're profoundly impaired <eol> in recognizing fearful expressions. <eob>
And whereas healthy adults and children <eob> usually show big spikes <eol> in amygdala activity <eob> when they look at fearful expressions, <eob> psychopaths' amygdalas are underreactive <eol> to these expressions. <eob>
Sometimes they don't react at all, <eob> which may be why they have trouble <eol> detecting these cues. <eob>
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas <eol> are smaller than average <eob> by about 18 or 20 percent. <eob>
So all of these findings <eol> are reliable and robust, <eob> and they're very interesting. <eob>
But remember that my main interest <eob> is not understanding why <eol> people don't care about others. <eob> It's understanding why they do. <eob>
So the real question is, <eob> could extraordinary altruism, <eob> which is the opposite <eol> of psychopathy <eob> in terms of compassion and the desire <eol> to help other people, <eob> emerge from a brain <eol> that is also the opposite of psychopathy? <eob>
A sort of antipsychopathic brain, <eob> better able to recognize other people's fear, <eob> an amygdala that's more reactive to this expression <eob> and maybe larger than average <eol> as well? <eob>
As my research has now shown, <eob> all three things are true. <eob>
And we discovered this <eob> by testing a population <eol> of truly extraordinary altruists. <eob>
These are people who have given <eol> one of their own kidneys <eob> to a complete stranger. <eob>
So these are people <eol> who have volunteered to undergo major surgery <eob> so that one of their own healthy kidneys <eol> can be removed <eob> and transplanted into a very ill stranger <eob> that they've never met <eol> and may never meet. <eob> "Why would anybody do this?" <eol> is a very common question. <eob>
And the answer may be <eob> that the brains of these <eol> extraordinary altruists <eob> have certain special characteristics. <eob>
They are better at recognizing <eol> other people's fear. <eob>
They're literally better at detecting <eol> when somebody else is in distress. <eob>
This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions. <eob>
And remember, this is the same <eol> part of the brain that we found <eob> was underreactive in people <eol> who are psychopathic. <eob>
And finally, their amygdalas are larger <eol> than average as well, <eob> by about eight percent. <eob>
So together, what these data suggest <eob> is the existence of something <eol> like a caring continuum in the world <eob> that's anchored at the one end <eol> by people who are highly psychopathic, <eob> and at the other by people <eol> who are very compassionate <eob> and driven to acts <eol> of extreme altruism. <eob>
But I should add <eol> that what makes extraordinary altruists so different <eob> is not just that they're more <eol> compassionate than average. <eob>
They are, <eob> but what's even more unusual about them <eob> is that they're compassionate <eol> and altruistic <eob> not just towards people who are <eol> in their own innermost circle <eob> of friends and family. Right? <eob> Because to have compassion for people <eol> that you love and identify with <eob> is not extraordinary. <eob>
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion <eol> extends way beyond that circle, <eob> even beyond their wider circle <eol> of acquaintances <eob> to people who are outside <eol> their social circle altogether, <eob> total strangers, <eob> just like the man who rescued me. <eob>
And I've had the opportunity now <eol> to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors <eob> how it is that they manage to generate <eol> such a wide circle of compassion <eob> that they were willing to give <eol> a complete stranger their kidney. <eob>
And I found it's a really difficult <eol> question for them to answer. <eob>
I say, "How is it that you're willing <eol> to do this thing <eob> when so many other people don't? <eob>
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans <eob> who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. <eob>
What is it that makes you so special?" <eob>
And what do they say? <eob>
They say, "Nothing. <eob>
There's nothing special about me. <eob>
I'm just the same as everybody else." <eob>
And I think that's actually <eol> a really telling answer, <eob> because it suggests that the circles <eol> of these altruists don't look like this, <eob> they look more like this. <eob>
They have no center. <eob>
These altruists literally <eol> don't think of themselves <eob> as being at the center of anything, <eob> as being better or more inherently <eol> important than anybody else. <eob>
When I asked one altruist <eol> why donating her kidney made sense to her, <eob> she said, "Because it's not about me." <eob> Another said, <eob> "I'm not different. <eol> I'm not unique. <eob>
Your study here is going to find out <eol> that I'm just the same as you." <eob>
I think the best description <eol> for this amazing lack of self-centeredness <eob> is humility, <eob> which is that quality <eol> that in the words of St. Augustine <eob> makes men as angels. <eob> And why is that? <eob> It's because if there's no center of your circle, <eob> there can be no inner rings or outer rings, <eob> nobody who is more or less worthy <eol> of your care and compassion <eob> than anybody else. <eob>
And I think that this is what really <eol> distinguishes extraordinary altruists <eob> from the average person. <eob>
But I also think that this is a view <eol> of the world that's attainable by many <eob> and maybe even most people. <eob>
And I think this because <eol> at the societal level, <eob> expansions of altruism and compassion <eol> are already happening everywhere. <eob>
The psychologist Steven Pinker <eol> and others have shown <eob> that all around the world people <eol> are becoming less and less accepting <eob> of suffering in ever-widening circles of others, <eob> which has led to declines <eol> of all kinds of cruelty and violence, <eob> from animal abuse to domestic violence <eol> to capital punishment. <eob>
And it's led to increases <eol> in all kinds of altruism. <eob>
A hundred years ago, <eol> people would have thought it was ludicrous <eob> how normal and ordinary it is <eob> for people to donate <eol> their blood and bone marrow <eob> to complete strangers today. <eob>
Is it possible that a hundred years from now <eob> people will think <eol> that donating a kidney to a stranger <eob> is just as normal and ordinary <eob> as we think donating blood <eol> and bone marrow is today? <eob> Maybe. <eob>
So what's at the root <eol> of all these amazing changes? <eob>
In part it seems to be <eob> increases in wealth <eol> and standards of living. <eob>
As societies become wealthier <eol> and better off, <eob> people seem to turn their focus <eol> of attention outward, <eob> and as a result, all kinds of altruism <eol> towards strangers increases, <eob> from volunteering to charitable <eol> donations and even altruistic kidney donations. <eob>
But all of these changes also yield <eob> a strange and paradoxical result, <eob> which is that even as the world <eol> is becoming a better and more humane place, <eob> which it is, <eob> there's a very common perception <eol> that it's becoming worse <eob> and more cruel, which it's not. <eob>
And I don't know exactly why this is, <eob> but I think it may be <eol> that we now just know so much more <eob> about the suffering <eol> of strangers in distant places, <eob> and so we now care a lot more <eob> about the suffering <eol> of those distant strangers. <eob>
But what's clear is the kinds of changes <eol> we're seeing show <eob> that the roots of altruism and compassion <eob> are just as much a part of human nature <eol> as cruelty and violence, <eob> maybe even more so, <eob> and while some people do seem <eol> to be inherently more sensitive <eob> to the suffering of distant others, <eob> I really believe that the ability <eol> to remove oneself <eob> from the center of the circle <eob> and expand the circle of compassion outward <eol> to include even strangers <eob> is within reach for almost everyone. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Don't answer that out loud. <eob> But put a number in your head. <eob>
Now: How much do you think the person <eol> sitting next to you gets paid? <eob>
Again, don't answer out loud. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At work, how much do you think <eob> the person sitting in the cubicle <eol> or the desk next to you gets paid? <eob> Do you know? <eob> Should you know? <eob>
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable <eol> for me to even ask you those questions. <eob>
But admit it -- you kind of want to know. <eob>
Most of us are uncomfortable <eol> with the idea of broadcasting our salary. <eob>
We're not supposed <eol> to tell our neighbors, <eob> and we're definitely not supposed <eol> to tell our office neighbors. <eob>
The assumed reason is that if everybody <eol> knew what everybody got paid, <eob> then all hell would break loose. <eob>
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights, <eob> there might even be a few people who quit. <eob>
But what if secrecy is actually the reason <eol> for all that strife? <eob>
And what would happen <eol> if we removed that secrecy? <eob>
What if openness actually increased <eol> the sense of fairness and collaboration <eob> inside a company? <eob>
What would happen <eol> if we had total pay transparency? <eob>
For the past several years, <eob> I've been studying the corporate <eol> and entrepreneurial leaders <eob> who question the conventional wisdom <eol> about how to run a company. <eob>
And the question of pay keeps coming up. <eob>
And the answers keep surprising. <eob>
It turns out that pay transparency -- <eob> sharing salaries openly <eol> across a company -- <eob> makes for a better workplace <eol> for both the employee <eob> and for the organization. <eob>
When people don't know how <eol> their pay compares to their peers', <eob> they're more likely to feel underpaid <eob> and maybe even discriminated against. <eob>
Do you want to work at a place <eol> that tolerates the idea <eob> that you feel underpaid <eol> or discriminated against? <eob>
But keeping salaries secret does exactly that, <eob> and it's a practice <eol> as old as it is common, <eob> despite the fact <eol> that in the United States, <eob> the law protects an employee's right <eol> to discuss their pay. <eob>
In one famous example <eol> from decades ago, <eob> the management of Vanity Fair magazine <eob> actually circulated a memo entitled: <eob> "Forbidding Discussion Among Employees of Salary Received." <eob> "Forbidding" discussion <eol> among employees of salary received. <eob>
Now that memo didn't sit well <eol> with everybody. <eob>
New York literary figures Dorothy Parker, <eob> Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood, <eob> all writers in the Algonquin Round Table, <eob> decided to stand up for transparency <eob> and showed up for work the next day <eob> with their salary written <eol> on signs hanging from their neck. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Imagine showing up for work <eob> with your salary just written <eol> across your chest for all to see. <eob>
But why would a company even want <eol> to discourage salary discussions? <eob>
Why do some people go along with it, <eol> while others revolt against it? <eob>
It turns out that in addition <eol> to the assumed reasons, <eob> pay secrecy is actually a way <eol> to save a lot of money. <eob>
You see, keeping salaries secret <eob> leads to what economists call <eol> "information asymmetry." <eob> This is a situation where, <eol> in a negotiation, <eob> one party has loads <eol> more information than the other. <eob>
And in hiring or promotion <eol> or annual raise discussions, <eob> an employer can use that secrecy <eol> to save a lot of money. <eob>
Imagine how much better <eol> you could negotiate for a raise <eob> if you knew everybody's salary. <eob>
Economists warn that information asymmetry <eob> can cause markets to go awry. <eob>
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier, <eob> and suddenly everybody <eol> is shouting at each other. <eob>
In fact, they even warn <eob> that information asymmetry <eol> can lead to a total market failure. <eob>
And I think we're almost there. <eob>
Here's why: <eob> first, most employees have no idea <eol> how their pay compares to their peers'. <eob>
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees, <eob> two-thirds of everyone <eol> who is paid at the market rate <eob> said that they felt they were underpaid. <eob>
And of everybody who felt <eol> that they were underpaid, <eob> 60 percent said that they intended to quit, <eob> regardless of where they were -- <eol> underpaid, overpaid <eob> or right at the market rate. <eob>
If you were part of this survey, <eol> what would you say? <eob> Are you underpaid? <eob> Well, wait -- how do you even know, <eob> because you're not allowed <eol> to talk about it? <eob>
Next, information asymmetry, <eol> pay secrecy, <eob> makes it easier to ignore the discrimination <eob> that's already present in the market today. <eob>
In a 2011 report from the Institute <eol> for Women's Policy Research, <eob> the gender wage gap between men and women <eob> was 23 percent. <eob>
This is where that 77 cents <eol> on the dollar comes from. <eob>
But in the Federal Government, <eob> where salaries are pinned <eol> to certain levels <eob> and everybody knows what those levels are, <eob> the gender wage gap shrinks to 11 percent -- <eob> and this is before controlling <eol> for any of the factors <eob> that economists argue over whether <eol> or not to control for. <eob>
If we really want to close <eol> the gender wage gap, <eob> maybe we should start by opening up the payroll. <eob>
If this is what total market failure <eol> looks like, <eob> then openness remains the only way <eol> to ensure fairness. <eob>
Now, I realize that letting people <eol> know what you make <eob> might feel uncomfortable, <eob> but isn't it less uncomfortable <eob> than always wondering if you're <eol> being discriminated against, <eob> or if your wife or your daughter <eol> or your sister is being paid unfairly? <eob>
Openness remains the best <eol> way to ensure fairness, <eob> and pay transparency does that. <eob>
That's why entrepreneurial leaders <eol> and corporate leaders <eob> have been experimenting <eol> with sharing salaries for years. <eob> Like Dane Atkinson. <eob> Dane is a serial entrepreneur <eol> who started many companies <eob> in a pay secrecy condition <eob> and even used that condition <eol> to pay two equally qualified people <eob> dramatically different salaries, <eob> depending on how well they could negotiate. <eob>
And Dane saw the strife <eol> that happened as a result of this. <eob>
So when he started his newest company, SumAll, <eob> he committed to salary <eol> transparency from the beginning. <eob>
And the results have been amazing. <eob>
And in study after study, <eob> when people know how they're being paid <eob> and how that pay compares to their peers', <eob> they're more likely to work hard <eol> to improve their performance, <eob> more likely to be engaged, <eol> and they're less likely to quit. <eob>
That's why Dane's not alone. <eob>
From technology start-ups like Buffer, <eob> to the tens of thousands of employees <eol> at Whole Foods, <eob> where not only is your salary <eol> available for everyone to see, <eob> but the performance data <eol> for the store and for your department <eob> is available on the company intranet <eob> for all to see. <eob>
Now, pay transparency <eol> takes a lot of forms. <eob> It's not one size fits all. <eob>
Some post their salaries <eob> for all to see. <eob>
Some only keep it inside the company. <eob>
Some post the formula for calculating pay, <eob> and others post the pay levels <eob> and affix everybody to that level. <eob>
So you don't have to make signs <eob> for all of your employees <eol> to wear around the office. <eob>
And you don't have to be the only one wearing a sign <eob> that you made at home. <eob>
But we can all take greater steps <eol> towards pay transparency. <eob>
For those of you that have the authority <eob> to move forward towards transparency: <eob> it's time to move forward. <eob>
And for those of you <eol> that don't have that authority: <eob> it's time to stand up <eol> for your right to. <eob>
So how much do you get paid? <eob>
And how does that compare <eol> to the people you work with? <eob> You should know. <eob> And so should they. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy <eol> in 2010, <eob> my goal was simple: <eob> open a school to close a prison. <eob>
Now to some, this was an audacious goal, <eob> because our school is located <eol> in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn -- <eob> one of the most underserved <eol> and violent neighborhoods <eob> in all of New York City. <eob>
Like many urban schools <eol> with high poverty rates, <eob> we face numerous challenges, <eob> like finding teachers <eol> who can empathize <eob> with the complexities <eol> of a disadvantaged community, <eob> lack of funding for technology, <eob> low parental involvement <eob> and neighborhood gangs that recruit children <eol> as early as fourth grade. <eob>
So here I was, <eob> the founding principal of a middle school <eol> that was a district public school, <eob> and I only had 45 kids to start. <eob> Thirty percent of them <eol> had special needs. <eob>
Eighty-six percent of them <eol> were below grade level <eob> in English and in math. <eob>
And 100 percent were living <eol> below the poverty level. <eob>
If our children are not in our classrooms, <eob> how will they learn? <eob>
And if they're not learning, <eob> where would they end up? <eob>
It was evident when I would <eol> ask my 13-year-old, <eob> "Young man, <eob> where do you see yourself in five years?" <eob>
And his response: <eob> "I don't know if I'm gonna live that long." <eob>
Or to have a young woman say to me <eob> that she had a lifelong goal <eol> of working in a fast-food restaurant. <eob>
To me, this was unacceptable. <eob>
It was also evident that they had no idea <eob> that there was a landscape of opportunity <eob> that existed beyond their neighborhood. <eob>
We call our students "scholars," <eol> because they're lifelong learners. <eob>
And the skills that they learn today <eob> will prepare them for college <eol> and career readiness. <eob>
I chose the royal colors <eol> of purple and black, <eob> because I want them to be reminded <eol> that they are descendants of greatness, <eob> and that through education, <eob> they are future engineers, <eob> scientists, <eob> entrepreneurs <eob> and even leaders who can and will take over this world. <eob>
To date, <eob> we have had three graduating classes, <eob> at a 98 -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
At a 98-percent graduation rate. <eob>
This is nearly 200 children, <eob> who are now going to some <eol> of the most competitive high schools <eob> in New York City. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It was a cold day in January <eob> when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet, met Brandon Stanton, <eob> the founder of the popular blog "Humans of New York." <eob> Brandon shared the story <eol> of a young man from Brownsville <eob> who had witnessed violence firsthand, <eob> by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof. <eob>
Yet he can still be influenced by a principal <eob> who had opened up a school <eol> that believes in all children. <eob>
Vidal embodies the story <eol> of so many of our underprivileged children <eob> who are struggling to survive, <eob> which is why we must make education <eol> a priority. <eob>
Brandon's post created a global sensation <eob> that touched the lives of millions. <eob>
This resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised <eob> for our scholars to attend field <eol> trips to colleges and universities, <eob> Summer STEAM programs, <eob> as well as college scholarships. <eob>
You need to understand <eob> that when 200 young people <eol> from Brownsville visited Harvard, <eob> they now understood <eob> that a college of their choice <eol> was a real possibility. <eob>
And the impossibilities <eol> that had been imposed upon them <eob> by a disadvantaged community <eob> were replaced by hope <eol> and purpose. <eob>
The revolution in education <eol> is happening in our schools, <eob> with adults who provide love, <eob> structure, <eob> support <eob> and knowledge. <eob>
These are the things <eol> that inspire children. <eob>
But it is not an easy task. <eob>
And there are high demands <eob> within an education system <eol> that is not perfect. <eob>
But I have a dynamic group <eol> of educators <eob> who collaborate as a team to determine <eol> what is the best curriculum. <eob>
They take time beyond their school day, <eob> and come in on weekends <eob> and even use their own money <eol> to often provide resources <eob> when we do not have it. <eob>
And as the principal, <eob> I have to inspect what I expect. <eob>
So I show up in classes <eob> and I conduct observations to give feedback, <eob> because I want my teachers <eol> to be just as successful <eob> as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy. <eob>
And I give them access <eol> to me every single day, <eob> which is why they all have <eol> my personal cell number, <eob> including my scholars and those who graduated -- <eob> which is probably why I get phone <eol> calls and text messages <eob> at three o'clock in the morning. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we are all connected to succeed, <eob> and good leaders do this. <eob>
Tomorrow's future is sitting <eol> in our classrooms. <eob>
And they are our responsibility. <eob>
That means everyone in here, <eob> and those who are watching the screen. <eob>
We must believe in their brilliance, <eob> and remind them by teaching them <eob> that there indeed is power in education. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Why bother? <eob> The game is rigged. <eob>
My vote won't count. <eob>
The choices are terrible. <eob>
Voting is for suckers. <eob>
Perhaps you've thought <eol> some of these things. <eob> Perhaps you've even said them. <eob>
And if so, you wouldn't be alone, <eol> and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. <eob>
The game of public policy today <eol> is rigged in many ways. <eob>
How else would more than half <eol> of federal tax breaks <eob> flow up to the wealthiest five percent of Americans? <eob>
And our choices indeed are often terrible. <eob>
For many people <eol> across the political spectrum, <eob> Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election. <eob>
But in any year, <eol> you can look up and down the ballot <eob> and find plenty to be uninspired about. <eob>
But in spite of all this, <eol> I still believe voting matters. <eob>
And crazy as it may sound, <eob> I believe we can revive the joy of voting. <eob>
Today, I want to talk about <eol> how we can do that, and why. <eob>
There used to be a time <eol> in American history when voting was fun, <eob> when it was much more than just <eol> a grim duty to show up at the polls. <eob>
That time is called <eol> "most of American history." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
From the Revolution to the Civil Rights Era, <eob> the United States had a vibrant, <eob> robustly participatory <eol> and raucous culture of voting. <eob>
It was street theater, open-air debates, <eol> fasting and feasting and toasting, <eob> parades and bonfires. <eob>
During the 19th century, immigrants <eol> and urban political machines <eob> helped fuel this culture of voting. <eob>
That culture grew with each successive <eol> wave of new voters. <eob>
During Reconstruction, <eol> when new African-American voters, <eob> new African-American citizens, <eob> began to exercise their power, <eob> they celebrated in jubilee parades <eob> that connected emancipation <eol> with their newfound right to vote. <eob>
A few decades later, the suffragettes <eob> brought a spirit <eol> of theatricality to their fight, <eob> marching together in white dresses <eol> as they claimed the franchise. <eob>
And the Civil Rights Movement, <eob> which sought to redeem <eol> the promise of equal citizenship <eob> that had been betrayed by Jim Crow, <eob> put voting right at the center. <eob>
From Freedom Summer <eol> to the march in Selma, <eob> that generation of activists <eol> knew that voting matters, <eob> and they knew that spectacle <eol> and the performance of power <eob> is key to actually claiming power. <eob>
But it's been over a half century <eol> since Selma and the Voting Rights Act, <eob> and in the decades since, <eob> this face-to-face culture of voting <eob> has just about disappeared. <eob>
It's been killed by television <eob> and then the internet. <eob>
The couch has replaced the commons. <eob>
Screens have made citizens <eol> into spectators. <eob>
And while it's nice to share <eol> political memes on social media, <eob> that's a rather quiet kind <eol> of citizenship. <eob>
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle calls <eol> "being alone together." <eob>
What we need today <eob> is an electoral culture <eol> that is about being together together, <eob> in person, <eob> in loud and passionate ways, <eob> so that instead of being "eat your vegetables" <eol> or "do you duty," <eob> voting can feel more like "join the club" <eob> or, better yet, "join the party." <eob>
Imagine if we had, <eol> across the country right now, <eob> in local places but nationwide, <eob> a concerted effort to revive <eol> a face-to-face set of ways <eob> to engage and electioneer: <eob> outdoor shows in which candidates <eol> and their causes are mocked <eob> and praised in broad satirical style; <eob> soapbox speeches by citizens; <eob> public debates held inside pubs; <eob> streets filled with political art <eol> and handmade posters and murals; <eob> battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep their candidates. <eob>
Now, all of this may sound a little bit <eol> 18th century to you, <eob> but in fact, it doesn't have to be <eol> any more 18th century <eob> than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton," <eob> which is to say vibrantly contemporary. <eob>
And the fact is that all around the world, <eob> today, millions of people <eol> are voting like this. <eob>
In India, elections are colorful, <eol> communal affairs. <eob>
In Brazil, election day is a festive, <eol> carnival-type atmosphere. <eob>
In Taiwan and Hong Kong, <eol> there is a spectacle, <eob> eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle <eob> to the street theater of elections. <eob>
You might ask, well, here in America, <eol> who has time for this? <eob>
And I would tell you <eob> that the average American watches <eol> five hours of television a day. <eob>
You might ask, who has the motivation? <eob> And I'll tell you, <eob> any citizen who wants to be seen and heard <eob> not as a prop, not as a talking point, <eob> but as a participant, as a creator. <eob>
Well, how do we make this happen? <eob>
Simply by making it happen. <eob>
That's why a group of colleagues and I <eob> launched a new project <eol> called "The Joy of Voting." <eob> In four cities across the United States -- <eob> Philadelphia, Miami, <eob> Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas -- <eob> we've gathered together artists and activists, <eob> educators, political folks, <eol> neighbors, everyday citizens <eob> to come together and create projects <eob> that can foster this culture <eol> of voting in a local way. <eob>
In Miami, that means all-night <eol> parties with hot DJs <eob> where the only way to get in is to show <eol> that you're registered to vote. <eob>
In Akron, it means political plays <eob> being performed in the bed <eol> of a flatbed truck <eob> that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood. <eob>
In Philadelphia, <eob> it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt <eol> all throughout colonial old town. <eob>
And in Wichita, it's making mixtapes and live graffiti art <eob> in the North End to get out the vote. <eob>
There are 20 of these projects, <eob> and they are remarkable <eol> in their beauty and their diversity, <eob> and they are changing people. <eob>
Let me tell you about a couple of them. <eob>
In Miami, <eol> we've commissioned and artist, <eob> a young artist named Atomico, <eob> to create some vivid and vibrant images for <eol> a new series of "I voted" stickers. <eob>
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted. <eob>
He wasn't even registered. <eob>
So as he got to work on creating <eol> this artwork for these stickers, <eob> he also began to get over his sense <eol> of intimidation about politics. <eob>
He got himself registered, <eob> and then he got educated <eol> about the upcoming primary election, <eob> and on election day he was out <eol> there not just passing out stickers, <eob> but chatting up voters <eol> and encouraging people to vote, <eob> and talking about the election <eol> with passersby. <eob>
In Akron, a theater company <eol> called the Wandering Aesthetics <eob> has been putting on these pickup truck plays. <eob>
And to do so, they put out <eol> an open call to the public <eob> asking for speeches, monologues, <eol> dialogues, poems, <eob> snippets of anything <eol> that could be read aloud <eob> and woven into a performance. <eob>
They got dozens of submissions. <eob>
One of them was a poem <eob> written by nine students in an ESL class, <eob> all of them Hispanic migrant workers <eob> from nearby Hartville, Ohio. <eob>
I want to read to you from this poem. <eob>
It's called "The Joy of Voting." <eob>
"I would like to vote for the first time <eob> because things are changing for Hispanics. <eob>
I used to be afraid of ghosts. <eob>
Now I am afraid of people. <eob>
There's more violence and racism. <eob>
Voting can change this. <eob>
The border wall is nothing. <eob>
It's just a wall. <eob>
The wall of shame is something. <eob>
It's very important to vote <eob> so we can break down this wall of shame. <eob>
I have passion in my heart. <eob>
Voting gives me a voice and power. <eob>
I can stand up and do something." <eob>
"The Joy of Voting" project <eol> isn't just about joy. <eob> It's about this passion. <eob> It's about feeling and belief, <eob> and it isn't just our organization's work. <eob>
All across this country right now, <eob> immigrants, young people, veterans, people <eol> of all different backgrounds <eob> are coming together to create <eol> this kind of passionate, joyful activity <eob> around elections, <eob> in red and blue states, <eol> in urban and rural communities, <eob> people of every political background. <eob>
What they have in common is simply this: <eob> their work is rooted in place. <eob>
Because remember, <eol> all citizenship is local. <eob>
When politics becomes <eol> just a presidential election, <eob> we yell and we scream at our screens, <eol> and then we collapse, exhausted. <eob>
But when politics is about us <eob> and our neighbors and other people <eol> in our community <eob> coming together to create <eol> experiences of collective voice and imagination, <eob> then we begin <eol> to remember that this stuff matters. <eob>
We begin to remember that this <eol> is the stuff of self-government. <eob>
Why bother? <eob> Which brings me back to where I began. <eob> There's one way to answer this question. <eob>
Voting matters because it is <eol> a self-fulfilling act of belief. <eob>
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest <eol> that makes any society thrive. <eob>
When we vote, even if it is in anger, <eob> we are part of a collective, <eol> creative leap of faith. <eob>
Voting helps us generate <eol> the very power that we wish we had. <eob>
It's no accident <eol> that democracy and theater <eob> emerged around the same time <eol> in ancient Athens. <eob>
Both of them yank the individual <eol> out of the enclosure of her private self. <eob>
Both of them create great public <eol> experiences of shared ritual. <eob>
Both of them bring the imagination to life <eob> in ways that remind us that <eol> all of our bonds in the end <eob> are imagined, and can be reimagined. <eob>
This moment right now, <eob> when we think about <eol> the meaning of imagination, <eob> is so fundamentally important, <eob> and our ability to take that spirit <eob> and to take that sense <eob> that there is something greater out there, <eob> is not just a matter <eol> of technical expertise. <eob>
It's not just a matter of making the time <eol> or having the know-how. <eob>
It is a matter of spirit. <eob>
But let me give you an answer <eol> to this question, <eob> "Why bother?" <eob> that is maybe a little less spiritual <eol> and a bit more pointed. <eob> Why bother <eob> voting? <eob> Because there is no such thing <eol> as not voting. <eob>
Not voting is voting, <eob> for everything that you may <eol> detest and oppose. <eob>
Not voting can be dressed up <eob> as an act of principled, passive resistance, <eob> but in fact not voting <eob> is actively handing power over <eob> to those whose interests are counter <eol> to your own, <eob> and those who would be very glad <eol> to take advantage of your absence. <eob>
Not voting is for suckers. <eob>
Imagine where this country would be <eob> if all the folks who in 2010 <eol> created the Tea Party <eob> had decided that, you know, politics is too messy, <eob> voting is too complicated. <eob>
There is no possibility <eol> of our votes adding up to anything. <eob>
They didn't preemptively <eol> silence themselves. <eob>
They showed up, <eob> and in the course of showing up, <eol> they changed American politics. <eob>
Imagine if all of the followers <eol> of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders <eob> had decided not to upend the political status quo <eob> and blow apart the frame <eol> of the previously possible <eob> in American politics. <eob>
They did that by voting. <eob>
We live in a time right now, <eob> divided, often very dark, <eob> where across the left and the right, <eol> there's a lot of talk of revolution <eob> and the need for revolution <eol> to disrupt everyday democracy. <eob>
Well, here's the thing: <eob> everyday democracy already gives us <eol> a playbook for revolution. <eob>
In the 2012 presidential election, <eob> young voters, Latino voters, <eob> Asian-American voters, low-income voters, <eob> all showed up at less than 50 percent. <eob>
In the 2014 midterm elections, <eol> turnout was 36 percent, <eob> which was a 70-year low. <eob>
And in your average local election, <eob> turnout hovers somewhere <eol> around 20 percent. <eob>
I invite you to imagine 100 percent. <eob> Picture 100 percent. <eob> Mobilize 100 percent, <eob> and overnight, we get revolution. <eob>
Overnight, the policy priorities <eol> of this country change dramatically, <eob> and every level of government <eol> becomes radically more responsive <eob> to all the people. <eob>
What would it take <eol> to mobilize 100 percent? <eob>
Well, we do have to push back <eol> against efforts afoot <eob> all across the country right now <eob> to make voting harder. <eob>
But at the same time, <eob> we have to actively create <eol> a positive culture of voting <eob> that people want to belong to, <eob> be part of, and experience together. <eob>
We have to make purpose. <eob>
We have to make joy. <eob>
So yes, let's have that revolution, <eob> a revolution of spirit, of ideas, <eob> of policy and participation, <eob> a revolution against cynicism, <eob> a revolution against the self-fulfilling <eol> sense of powerlessness. <eob>
Let's vote this revolution into existence, <eob> and while we're at it, <eob> let's have some fun. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I remember the very first time <eol> I went to a nice restaurant, <eob> a really nice restaurant. <eob>
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner, <eob> and I remember beforehand <eol> the waitress walked around <eob> and asked whether we wanted some wine, <eob> so I said, "Sure, <eol> I'll take some white wine." <eob>
And she immediately said, <eob> "Would you like sauvignon <eol> blanc or chardonnay?" <eob>
And I remember thinking, <eob> "Come on, lady, stop <eol> with the fancy French words <eob> and just give me some white wine." <eob> But I used my powers of deduction <eob> and recognized that chardonnay <eol> and sauvignon blanc <eob> were two separate types of white wine, <eob> and so I told her that I would take the chardonnay, <eob> because frankly that was the easiest <eol> one to pronounce for me. <eob>
So I had a lot of experiences like that <eob> during my first couple of years <eol> as a law student at Yale, <eob> because, despite all outward appearances, <eol> I'm a cultural outsider. <eob>
I didn't come from the elites. <eob>
I didn't come from the Northeast <eol> or from San Francisco. <eob>
I came from a southern Ohio steel town, <eob> and it's a town <eol> that's really struggling in a lot of ways, <eob> ways that are indicative <eol> of the broader struggles <eob> of America's working class. <eob>
Heroin has moved in, <eob> killing a lot of people, people I know. <eob>
Family violence, domestic violence, <eol> and divorce have torn apart families. <eob>
And there's a very unique sense <eol> of pessimism that's moved in. <eob>
Think about rising mortality rates <eol> in these communities <eob> and recognize that for a lot of these folks, <eob> the problems that they're seeing <eob> are actually causing rising death rates <eol> in their own communities, <eob> so there's a very real sense of struggle. <eob>
I had a very front-row <eol> seat to that struggle. <eob>
My family has been part <eol> of that struggle for a very long time. <eob>
I come from a family <eol> that doesn't have a whole lot of money. <eob>
The addiction that plagued <eol> my community <eob> also plagued my family, <eol> and even, sadly, my own mom. <eob>
There were a lot of problems <eol> that I saw in my own family, <eob> problems caused sometimes <eol> by a lack of money, <eob> problems caused sometimes by a lack of access <eol> to resources and social capital <eob> that really affected my life. <eob>
If you had looked at my life <eol> when I was 14 years old <eob> and said, "Well, what's going <eol> to happen to this kid?" <eob> you would have concluded <eol> that I would have struggled <eob> with what academics call upward mobility. <eob>
So upward mobility is an abstract term, <eob> but it strikes at something <eol> that's very core <eob> at the heart of the American Dream. <eob>
It's the sense, <eob> and it measures whether kids like me <eob> who grow up in poor communities <eol> are going to live a better life, <eob> whether they're going to have a chance <eol> to live a materially better existence, <eob> or whether they're going to stay <eol> in the circumstances where they came from. <eob>
And one of the things <eol> we've learned, unfortunately, <eob> is that upward mobility isn't <eol> as high as we'd like it to be in this country, <eob> and interestingly, it's very geographically distributed. <eob>
So take Utah, for instance. <eob>
In Utah a poor kid <eol> is actually doing OK, <eob> very likely to live their share <eol> and their part in the American Dream. <eob>
But if you think <eol> of where I'm from, <eob> in the South, in Appalachia, <eol> in southern Ohio, <eob> it's very unlikely <eol> that kids like that will rise. <eob>
The American Dream in those <eol> parts of the country <eob> is in a very real sense <eol> just a dream. <eob>
So why is that happening? <eob>
So one reason is obviously <eol> economic or structural. <eob>
So you think of these areas. <eob>
They're beset by these terrible economic trends, <eob> built around industries <eol> like coal and steel <eob> that make it harder for folks to get ahead. <eob>
That's certainly one problem. <eob>
There's also the problem of brain drain, <eol> where the really talented people, <eob> because they can't find <eol> high-skilled work at home, <eob> end up moving elsewhere, <eob> so they don't build a business <eol> or non-profit where they're from, <eob> they end up going elsewhere <eol> and taking their talents with them. <eob>
There are failing schools <eol> in a lot of these communities, <eob> failing to give kids <eol> the educational leg up <eob> that really makes it possible for kids <eol> to have opportunities later in life. <eob>
These things are all important. <eob>
I don't mean to discount <eol> these structural barriers. <eob>
But when I look back <eol> at my life and my community, <eob> something else was going on, <eol> something else mattered. <eob>
It's difficult to quantify, <eol> but it was no less real. <eob>
So for starters, there was <eol> a very real sense of hopelessness <eob> in the community that I grew up in. <eob>
There was a sense that kids had <eol> that their choices didn't matter. <eob>
No matter what happened, no matter <eol> how hard they worked, <eob> no matter how hard they tried to get ahead, <eob> nothing good would happen. <eob>
So that's a tough feeling <eol> to grow up around. <eob>
That's a tough mindset <eol> to penetrate, <eob> and it leads sometimes to very <eol> conspiratorial places. <eob>
So let's just take one political issue <eol> that's pretty hot, <eob> affirmative action. <eob>
So depending on your politics, <eol> you might think that <eob> affirmative action <eob> is either a wise or an unwise <eol> way to promote diversity in the workplace <eob> or the classroom. <eob>
But if you grow up in an area like this, <eob> you see <eob> affirmative action <eob> as a tool to hold people like you back. <eob>
That's especially true <eol> if you're a member of the white working class. <eob>
You see it as something <eol> that isn't just about good or bad policy. <eob> You see it as something <eol> that's actively conspiring, <eob> where people with political and financial power <eob> are working against you. <eob>
And there are a lot of ways that you see <eol> that conspiracy against you -- <eob> perceived, real, but it's there, <eob> and it warps expectations. <eob>
So if you think about what do you do <eol> when you grow up in that world, <eob> you can respond <eol> in a couple of ways. <eob>
One, you can say, "I'm not going to work hard, <eob> because no matter how hard I work, <eol> it's not going to matter." <eob> Another thing you might do is say, <eob> "Well, I'm not going to go <eol> after the traditional markers of success, <eob> like a university education <eol> or a prestigious job, <eob> because the people who care <eol> about those things are unlike me. <eob>
They're never going to let me in. <eob> "When I got admitted to Yale, a family member asked me <eob> if I had pretended to be a liberal <eol> to get by the admissions committee. <eob> Seriously. <eob> And it's obviously not the case <eol> that there was a liberal box to check <eob> on the application, <eob> but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places <eob> that you have to pretend to be somebody you're not <eob> to get past these various social barriers. <eob>
It's a very significant problem. <eob>
Even if you don't give in <eol> to that hopelessness, <eob> even if you think, let's say, <eob> that your choices matter and you want <eol> to make the good choices, <eob> you want to do better for yourself <eol> and for your family, <eob> it's sometimes hard to even know <eol> what those choices are <eob> when you grow up in a community like I did. <eob>
I didn't know, for example, <eob> that you had to go to law <eol> school to be a lawyer. <eob>
I didn't know that elite universities, <eol> as research consistently tells us, <eob> are cheaper for low-income kids <eob> because these universities have bigger endowments, <eob> can offer more generous financial aid. <eob>
I remember I learned this <eob> when I got the financial aid letter <eol> from Yale for myself, <eob> tens of thousands of dollars <eol> in need-based aid, <eob> which is a term I had never heard before. <eob>
But I turned to my aunt <eol> when I got that letter and said, <eob> "You know, I think this just means <eol> that for the first time in my life, <eob> being poor has paid really well." <eob>
So I didn't have access <eol> to that information <eob> because the social networks <eol> around me didn't have access to that information. <eob>
I learned from my community how to shoot <eol> a gun, how to shoot it well. <eob>
I learned how to make <eol> a damn good biscuit recipe. <eob>
The trick, by the way, <eol> is frozen butter, not warm butter. <eob>
But I didn't learn how to get ahead. <eob>
I didn't learn how to make <eol> the good decisions <eob> about education and opportunity <eob> that you need to make <eob> to actually have a chance <eol> in this 21st century knowledge economy. <eob>
Economists call the value <eol> that we gain from our informal networks, <eob> from our friends and colleagues and family "social capital." <eob> The social capital that I had wasn't <eol> built for 21st century America, <eob> and it showed. <eob>
There's something else that's really <eol> important that's going on <eob> that our community doesn't like <eol> to talk about, <eob> but it's very real. <eob>
Working-class kids are much more likely <eob> to face what's called <eol> adverse childhood experiences, <eob> which is just a fancy word for childhood trauma: <eob> getting hit or yelled at, <eol> put down by a parent repeatedly, <eob> watching someone hit or beat your parent, <eob> watching someone do drugs <eol> or abuse alcohol. <eob> These are all instances of childhood trauma, <eob> and they're pretty commonplace <eol> in my family. <eob>
Importantly, they're not just commonplace <eol> in my family right now. <eob> They're also multigenerational. <eob>
So my grandparents, <eob> the very first time that they had kids, <eob> they expected that they were going <eol> to raise them in a way <eob> that was uniquely good. <eob> They were middle class, <eob> they were able to earn a good <eol> wage in a steel mill. <eob>
But what ended up happening <eob> is that they exposed their kids <eol> to a lot of the childhood trauma <eob> that had gone back many generations. <eob>
My mom was 12 when she saw <eol> my grandma set my grandfather on fire. <eob>
His crime was <eol> that he came home drunk <eob> after she told him, <eob> "If you come home drunk, <eol> I'm gonna kill you." <eob> And she tried to do it. <eob>
Think about the way <eol> that that affects a child's mind. <eob>
And we think of these things <eol> as especially rare, <eob> but a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund found <eob> that 40 percent of low-income kids face <eol> multiple instances of childhood trauma, <eob> compared to only 29 percent <eol> for upper-income kids. <eob>
And think about what that really means. <eob>
If you're a low-income kid, <eob> almost half of you face <eol> multiple instances of childhood trauma. <eob>
This is not an isolated problem. <eob>
This is a very significant issue. <eob>
We know what happens to the kids <eol> who experience that life. <eob>
They're more likely to do drugs, <eol> more likely to go to jail, <eob> more likely to drop out of high school, <eob> and most importantly, <eob> they're more likely to do <eol> to their children <eob> what their parents did to them. <eob>
This trauma, this chaos in the home, <eob> is our culture's very worst gift <eol> to our children, <eob> and it's a gift that keeps on giving. <eob>
So you combine all that, <eob> the hopelessness, the despair, <eob> the cynicism about the future, <eob> the childhood trauma, <eob> the low social capital, <eob> and you begin to understand why me, <eob> at the age of 14, <eob> was ready to become just another statistic, <eob> another kid who failed to beat the odds. <eob>
But something unexpected happened. <eob> I did beat the odds. <eob>
Things turned up for me. <eob>
I graduated from high school, from college, <eol> I went to law school, <eob> and I have a pretty good job now. <eob> So what happened? <eob>
Well, one thing that happened <eol> is that my grandparents, <eob> the same grandparents of setting someone <eol> on fire fame, <eob> they really shaped up by the time <eol> I came around. <eob>
They provided me a stable home, <eob> a stable family. <eob>
They made sure <eob> that when my parents weren't able <eol> to do the things that kids need, <eob> they stepped in and filled that role. <eob>
My grandma especially did two things <eol> that really matter. <eob>
One, she provided that peaceful <eol> home that allowed me to focus on homework <eob> and the things that kids <eol> should be focused on. <eob>
But she was also this <eol> incredibly perceptive woman, <eob> despite not even having a middle school education. <eob>
She recognized the message <eol> that my community had for me, <eob> that my choices didn't matter, <eob> that the deck was stacked against me. <eob>
She once told me, <eob> "JD, never be like those losers <eol> who think the deck is stacked against them. <eob>
You can do anything you want to." <eob>
And yet she recognized <eol> that life wasn't fair. <eob>
It's hard to strike that balance, <eob> to tell a kid that life isn't fair, <eob> but also recognize and enforce in them <eol> the reality that their choices matter. <eob>
But mamaw was able to strike that balance. <eob>
The other thing that really helped <eol> was the United States Marine Corps. <eob>
So we think of the Marine Corps <eol> as a military outfit, and of course it is, <eob> but for me, the US Marine Corps <eol> was a four-year crash course <eob> in character education. <eob>
It taught me how to make a bed, <eol> how to do laundry, <eob> how to wake up early, <eol> how to manage my finances. <eob>
These are things my community <eol> didn't teach me. <eob>
I remember when I went to go buy a car <eol> for the very first time, <eob> I was offered a dealer's low, low interest <eol> rate of 21.9 percent, <eob> and I was ready to sign on the dotted line. <eob>
But I didn't take that deal, <eob> because I went and took it <eol> to my officer <eob> who told me, "Stop being an idiot, <eob> go to the local credit union, <eol> and get a better deal." <eob> And so that's what I did. <eob>
But without the Marine Corps, <eob> I would have never had access <eol> to that knowledge. <eob>
I would have had <eol> a financial calamity, frankly. <eob>
The last thing I want to say <eol> is that I had a lot of good fortune <eob> in the mentors and people <eob> who have played an important <eol> role in my life. <eob>
From the Marines, from Ohio State, from Yale, <eob> from other places, <eob> people have really stepped in <eob> and ensured that they filled <eol> that social capital gap <eob> that it was pretty obvious, <eol> apparently, that I had. <eob>
That comes from good fortune, <eob> but a lot of children <eol> aren't going to have that good fortune, <eob> and I think that raises really important <eol> questions for all of us <eob> about how we're going to change that. <eob>
We need to ask questions <eol> about how we're going to give low-income kids <eob> who come from a broken home access <eol> to a loving home. <eob>
We need to ask questions <eob> about how we're going to teach <eol> low-income parents <eob> how to better interact <eol> with their children, <eob> with their partners. <eob>
We need to ask questions <eob> about how we give social capital, <eob> mentorship to low-income kids <eol> who don't have it. <eob>
We need to think <eol> about how we teach working class children <eob> about not just hard skills, <eob> like reading, mathematics, <eob> but also soft skills, <eob> like conflict resolution <eol> and financial management. <eob>
Now, I don't have all of the answers. <eob>
I don't know all of the solutions <eol> to this problem, <eob> but I do know this: <eob> in southern Ohio right now, <eob> there's a kid who is anxiously awaiting their dad, <eob> wondering whether, <eol> when he comes through the door, <eob> he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly. <eob>
There's a kid <eob> whose mom sticks <eol> a needle in her arm <eob> and passes out, <eob> and he doesn't know why <eol> she doesn't cook him dinner, <eob> and he goes to bed hungry that night. <eob>
There's a kid <eob> who has no hope for the future <eob> but desperately wants to live <eol> a better life. <eob>
They just want somebody <eol> to show it to them. <eob>
I don't have all the answers, <eob> but I know that unless our society <eol> starts asking better questions <eob> about why I was so lucky <eob> and about how to get that luck <eol> to more of our communities <eob> and our country's children, <eob> we're going to continue to have <eol> a very significant problem. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is the Bop. <eob>
The Bop is a type of social dance. <eob>
Dance is a language, <eob> and social dance <eol> is an expression that emerges from a community. <eob>
A social dance <eol> isn't choreographed by any one person. <eob>
It can't be traced to any one moment. <eob>
Each dance has steps that everyone can agree on, <eob> but it's about the individual <eol> and their creative identity. <eob>
Because of that, <eob> social dances bubble up, <eob> they change <eob> and they spread like wildfire. <eob>
They are as old as our remembered history. <eob>
In African-American social dances, <eob> we see over 200 years <eob> of how African and African-American <eol> traditions influenced our history. <eob>
The present always contains the past. <eob>
And the past shapes who we are <eob> and who we will be. <eob>
(Clapping) <eob>
The Juba dance was born <eol> from enslaved Africans' experience <eob> on the plantation. <eob>
Brought to the Americas, <eob> stripped of a common spoken language, <eob> this dance was a way <eob> for enslaved Africans to remember <eol> where they're from. <eob>
It may have looked something like this. <eob>
Slapping thighs, <eob> shuffling feet <eob> and patting hands: <eob> this was how they got around the slave owners' <eol> ban on drumming, <eob> improvising complex rhythms <eob> just like ancestors <eol> did with drums in Haiti <eob> or in the Yoruba communities of West Africa. <eob>
It was about keeping cultural traditions alive <eob> and retaining a sense <eol> of inner freedom <eob> under captivity. <eob>
It was the same subversive spirit <eol> that created this dance: <eob> the Cakewalk, <eob> a dance that parodied the mannerisms of Southern high society -- <eob> a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters. <eob>
The crazy thing about this dance <eob> is that <eob> the Cakewalk <eob> was performed for the masters, <eob> who never suspected they were being <eol> made fun of. <eob>
Now you might recognize this one. <eob> 1920s -- <eob> the Charleston. <eob>
The Charleston was all about improvisation <eol> and musicality, <eob> making its way into Lindy Hop, <eob> swing dancing <eob> and even the Kid n Play, <eob> originally called the Funky Charleston. <eob>
Started by a tight-knit Black community <eol> near Charleston, South Carolina, <eob> the Charleston <eob> permeated dance halls <eob> where young women suddenly had <eol> the freedom to kick their heels <eob> and move their legs. <eob>
Now, social dance <eol> is about community and connection; <eob> if you knew the steps, <eob> it meant you belonged <eol> to a group. <eob>
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? <eob> Enter the Twist. <eob> It's no surprise that the Twist <eol> can be traced back to the 19th century, <eob> brought to America <eol> from the Congo <eob> during slavery. <eob>
But in the late '50s, <eob> right before the Civil Rights Movement, <eob> the Twist is popularized by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. <eob>
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist: <eob> white teenagers, <eob> kids in Latin America, <eob> making its way into songs and movies. <eob>
Through social dance, <eob> the boundaries <eol> between groups become blurred. <eob>
The story continues in the 1980s and '90s. <eob>
Along with the emergence <eol> of hip-hop, <eob> African-American social dance <eol> took on even more visibility, <eob> borrowing from its long past, <eob> shaping culture and being shaped by it. <eob>
Today, these dances continue <eol> to evolve, grow and spread. <eob>
Why do we dance? <eob> To move, <eob> to let loose, <eob> to express. <eob> Why do we dance together? <eob> To heal, <eob> to remember, <eob> to say: "We speak a common language. <eob>
We exist <eob> and we are free." <eob>
I was recently traveling <eol> in the Highlands of New Guinea, <eob> and I was talking with a man <eol> who had three wives. <eob>
I asked him, "How many wives would you like to have?" <eob> And there was this long pause, <eob> and I thought to myself, <eob> "Is he going to say five? <eob>
Is he going to say 10? <eob> Is he going to say 25?" <eob> And he leaned towards me <eob> and he whispered, "None." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Eighty-six percent of human societies <eol> permit a man to have several wives: <eob> polygyny. <eob>
But in the vast majority of these cultures, <eob> only about five or ten percent of men <eol> actually do have several wives. <eob>
Having several partners <eol> can be a toothache. <eob>
In fact, co-wives can fight with each other, <eob> sometimes they can even poison <eol> each other's children. <eob>
And you've got to have a lot of cows, <eol> a lot of goats, <eob> a lot of money, a lot of land, <eob> in order to build a harem. <eob>
We are a pair-bonding species. <eob>
Ninety-seven percent of mammals <eol> do not pair up to rear their young; <eob> human beings do. <eob>
I'm not suggesting that we're not -- <eob> that we're necessarily <eol> sexually faithful to our partners. <eob>
I've looked at adultery <eol> in 42 cultures, <eob> I understand, actually, <eol> some of the genetics of it, <eob> and some of the brain circuitry of it. <eob>
It's very common around the world, <eob> but we are built to love. <eob>
How is technology changing love? <eob>
I'm going to say almost not at all. <eob> I study the brain. <eob>
I and my colleagues have put <eol> over 100 people into a brain scanner -- <eob> people who had just fallen happily in love, <eob> people who had just been rejected in love <eob> and people who are in love long-term. <eob>
And it is possible to remain <eol> "in love" long-term. <eob>
And I've long ago maintained <eob> that we've evolved three distinctly <eol> different brain systems <eob> for mating and reproduction: <eob> sex drive, <eob> feelings of intense romantic love <eob> and feelings of deep cosmic attachment <eol> to a long-term partner. <eob>
And together, these three brain systems -- <eob> with many other parts of the brain -- <eob> orchestrate our sexual, our romantic <eol> and our family lives. <eob>
But they lie way below the cortex, <eob> way below the limbic system <eol> where we feel our emotions, <eob> generate our emotions. <eob>
They lie in the most primitive parts <eol> of the brain, linked with energy, <eob> focus, craving, motivation, <eol> wanting and drive. <eob>
In this case, <eob> the drive to win life's greatest prize: <eob> a mating partner. <eob>
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago <eol> among our first ancestors, <eob> and they're not going to change <eol> if you swipe left or right on Tinder. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There's no question that technology <eol> is changing the way we court: <eob> emailing, texting, <eob> emojis to express your emotions, <eob> sexting, <eob> "liking" a photograph, selfies ... <eob> We're seeing new rules and taboos <eol> for how to court. <eob>
But, you know -- <eob> is this actually dramatically <eol> changing love? <eob>
What about the late 1940s, <eob> when the automobile became very popular <eob> and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How about the introduction <eol> of the birth control pill? <eob>
Unchained from the great threat <eol> of pregnancy and social ruin, <eob> women could finally express <eol> their primitive and primal sexuality. <eob>
Even dating sites are not changing love. <eob>
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com, <eob> I've been it for 11 years. <eob>
I keep telling them <eol> and they agree with me, <eob> that these are not dating sites, <eob> they are introducing sites. <eob>
When you sit down in a bar, <eob> in a coffee house, <eob> on a park bench, <eob> your ancient brain snaps <eol> into action like a sleeping cat awakened, <eob> and you smile <eob> and laugh <eob> and listen <eob> and parade the way our ancestors <eol> did 100,000 years ago. <eob>
We can give you various people -- <eob> all the dating sites can -- <eob> but the only real algorithm <eol> is your own human brain. <eob>
Technology is not going to change that. <eob>
Technology is also not going to change <eol> who you choose to love. <eob>
I study the biology of personality, <eob> and I've come to believe <eob> that we've evolved four very broad styles of thinking <eol> and behaving, <eob> linked with the dopamine, serotonin, <eob> testosterone and estrogen systems. <eob>
So I created a questionnaire <eol> directly from brain science <eob> to measure the degree to which <eol> you express the traits -- <eob> the constellation of traits -- <eob> linked with each of these four brain systems. <eob>
I then put that questionnaire <eol> on various dating sites <eob> in 40 countries. <eob>
Fourteen million or more people <eol> have now taken the questionnaire, <eob> and I've been able to watch <eol> who's naturally drawn to whom. <eob>
And as it turns out, <eob> those who were very expressive <eol> of the dopamine system <eob> tend to be curious, creative, <eol> spontaneous, energetic -- <eob> I would imagine there's an awful lot <eol> of people like that in this room -- <eob> they're drawn to people like themselves. <eob>
Curious, creative people <eol> need people like themselves. <eob>
People who are very expressive <eol> of the serotonin system <eob> tend to be traditional, conventional, <eol> they follow the rules, <eob> they respect authority, <eob> they tend to be religious -- religiosity is in the serotonin system -- <eob> and traditional people go for traditional people. <eob>
In that way, similarity attracts. <eob>
In the other two cases, opposites attract. <eob>
People very expressive of the testosterone system <eob> tend to be analytical, <eol> logical, direct, decisive, <eob> and they go for their opposite: <eob> they go for somebody <eol> who's high estrogen, <eob> somebody who's got very good <eol> verbal skills <eob> and people skills, <eob> who's very intuitive <eob> and who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive. <eob>
We have natural patterns of mate choice. <eob>
Modern technology is not going to change <eol> who we choose to love. <eob>
But technology is producing one modern trend <eob> that I find particularly important. <eob>
It's associated with the concept <eol> of paradox of choice. <eob>
For millions of years, <eob> we lived in little hunting <eol> and gathering groups. <eob>
You didn't have the opportunity to choose <eob> between 1,000 people on a dating site. <eob>
In fact, I've been studying this recently, <eob> and I actually think there's some <eol> sort of sweet spot in the brain; <eob> I don't know what it is, <eol> but apparently, from reading a lot of the data, <eob> we can embrace about five <eol> to nine alternatives, and after that, <eob> you get into what academics call <eol> "cognitive overload," <eob> and you don't choose any. <eob>
So I've come to think <eol> that due to this cognitive overload, <eob> we're ushering in a new form of courtship <eob> that I call "slow love." <eob> I arrived at this during my work with Match.com. <eob> Every year for the last six years, <eob> we've done a study called <eol> "Singles in America." <eob> We don't poll the Match population, <eob> we poll the American population. <eob>
We use 5,000-plus people, <eob> a representative sample of Americans <eol> based on the US census. <eob>
We've got data now on over 30,000 people, <eob> and every single year, <eob> I see some of the same patterns. <eob>
Every single year when I ask the question, <eob> over 50 percent of people <eol> have had a one-night stand -- <eob> not necessarily last year, <eol> but in their lives -- <eob> 50 percent have had a friends <eol> with benefits <eob> during the course of their lives, <eob> and over 50 percent have lived <eol> with a person long-term <eob> before marrying. <eob>
Americans think that this is reckless. <eob>
I have doubted that for a long time; <eob> the patterns are too strong. <eob>
There's got to be <eol> some Darwinian explanation -- <eob> Not that many people are crazy. <eob>
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic <eol> that really came home to me. <eob>
It was a very interesting academic article <eob> in which I found that 67 percent <eol> of singles in America today <eob> who are living long-term with somebody, <eob> have not yet married <eol> because they are terrified of divorce. <eob>
They're terrified of the social, <eob> legal, emotional, <eob> economic consequences of divorce. <eob>
So I came to realize that I don't think <eol> this is recklessness; <eob> I think it's caution. <eob>
Today's singles want to know <eol> every single thing about a partner <eob> before they wed. <eob>
You learn a lot between the sheets, <eob> not only about how somebody makes love, <eob> but whether they're kind, <eob> whether they can listen <eob> and at my age, <eob> whether they've got a sense of humor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And in an age where we have <eol> too many choices, <eob> we have very little fear <eol> of pregnancy and disease <eob> and we've got no feeling of shame <eol> for sex before marriage, <eob> I think people are taking <eol> their time to love. <eob>
And actually, what's happening is, <eob> what we're seeing is a real expansion <eol> of the precommitment stage <eob> before you tie the knot. <eob>
Where marriage used to be <eol> the beginning of a relationship, <eob> now it's the finale. <eob>
But the human brain -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The human brain always triumphs, <eob> and indeed, in the United States today, <eob> 86 percent of Americans <eol> will marry by age 49. <eob>
And even in cultures around the world <eol> where they're not marrying as often, <eob> they are settling down eventually <eol> with a long-term partner. <eob>
So it began to occur to me: <eob> during this long extension <eol> of the precommitment stage, <eob> if you can get rid of bad relationships <eol> before you marry, <eob> maybe we're going to see more happy marriages. <eob>
So I did a study of 1,100 married <eol> people in America -- <eob> not on Match.com, of course -- <eob> and I asked them a lot of questions. <eob>
But one of the questions was, <eob> "Would you re-marry the person <eol> you're currently married to?" <eob> And 81 percent said, "Yes." <eob>
In fact, the greatest change <eol> in modern romance and family life <eob> is not technology. <eob>
It's not even slow love. <eob>
It's actually women piling <eol> into the job market <eob> in cultures around the world. <eob>
For millions of years, <eob> our ancestors lived in little hunting <eol> and gathering groups. <eob>
Women commuted to work to gather <eol> their fruits and vegetables. <eob>
They came home with 60 <eol> to 80 percent of the evening meal. <eob>
The double-income family was the rule. <eob>
And women were regarded <eol> as just as economically, socially <eob> and sexually powerful as men. <eob>
Then the environment <eol> changed some 10,000 years ago, <eob> we began to settle down on the farm <eob> and both men and women <eol> became obliged, really, <eob> to marry the right person, <eob> from the right background, <eob> from the right religion <eob> and from the right kin <eol> and social and political connections. <eob>
Men's jobs became more important: <eob> they had to move the rocks, fell the trees, <eol> plow the land. <eob>
They brought the produce <eol> to local markets, and came home <eob> with the equivalent of money. <eob>
Along with this, <eob> we see a rise <eol> of a host of beliefs: <eob> the belief of virginity at marriage, <eob> arranged marriages -- strictly <eol> arranged marriages -- <eob> the belief that the man <eol> is the head of the household, <eob> that the wife's place <eol> is in the home <eob> and most important, <eob> honor thy husband, <eol> and 'til death do us part. <eob> These are gone. <eob> They are going, and in many places, <eob> they are gone. <eob>
We are right now in a marriage revolution. <eob>
We are shedding 10,000 years <eol> of our farming tradition <eob> and moving forward towards egalitarian <eol> relationships between the sexes -- <eob> something I regard as highly compatible <eol> with the ancient human spirit. <eob>
I'm not a Pollyanna; <eob> there's a great deal to cry about. <eob>
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures, <eob> I've studied, as I say, adultery in many -- <eob> there's a whole pile of problems. <eob>
As William Butler Yeats, <eol> the poet, once said, <eob> "Love is the crooked thing." <eob> I would add, "Nobody gets out alive." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We all have problems. <eob> But in fact, I think the poet Randall Jarrell really sums <eol> it up best. <eob>
He said, "The dark, uneasy world <eol> of family life -- <eob> where the greatest can fail, <eol> and the humblest succeed." <eob>
But I will leave you with this: <eob> love and attachment will prevail, <eob> technology cannot change it. <eob>
And I will conclude by saying <eob> any understanding of human relationships <eol> must take into account <eob> one the most powerful determinants <eol> of human behavior: <eob> the unquenchable, <eob> adaptable <eob> and primordial human drive to love. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Kelly Stoetzel: <eob> Thank you <eob> so much for that, Helen. <eob>
As you know, <eol> there's another speaker here with us <eob> that works in your same field. <eob>
She comes at it <eol> from a different perspective. <eob>
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist <eol> who works with couples. <eob>
You study data, <eob> Esther studies the stories <eol> the couples tell her <eob> when they come to her for help. <eob>
Let's have her join us on the stage. <eob> Esther? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So Esther, <eob> when you were watching Helen's talk, <eob> was there any part of it <eob> that resonated with you through <eol> the lens of your own work <eob> that you'd like to comment on? <eob>
Esther Perel: It's interesting, <eol> because on the one hand, <eob> the need for love is ubiquitous and universal. <eob>
But the way we love -- <eob> the meaning we make out of it -- <eob> the rules that govern our relationships, I think, <eob> are changing fundamentally. <eob>
We come from a model that, until now, <eob> was primarily regulated <eol> around duty and obligation, <eob> the needs of the collective and loyalty. <eob>
And we have shifted it <eob> to a model of free choice <eol> and individual rights, <eob> and self-fulfillment and happiness. <eob>
And so, that was the first thing I thought, <eob> that the need doesn't change, <eob> but the context and the way we regulate <eol> these relationships <eob> changes a lot. <eob>
On the paradox of choice -- <eob> you know, on the one <eol> hand we relish the novelty <eob> and the playfulness, I think, <eob> to be able to have <eol> so many options. <eob>
And at the same time, <eob> as you talk about this cognitive overload, <eob> I see many, many people who ... <eob> who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt <eob> that comes with this massa of choice, <eob> creating a case of "FOMO" <eob> and then leading us -- <eob> FOMO, fear of missed opportunity, <eol> or fear of missing out -- <eob> it's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' -- <eob> the right one?" <eob>
So we've created what I call this thing <eol> of "stable ambiguity." <eob> Stable ambiguity is when you <eol> are too afraid to be alone <eob> but also not really willing <eol> to engage in intimacy-building. <eob>
It's a set of tactics <eol> that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship <eob> but also the uncertainty of the breakup. <eob>
So, here on the internet <eol> you have three major ones. <eob>
One is icing and simmering, <eob> which are great stalling tactics <eob> that offer a kind of holding pattern <eob> that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship <eob> but at the same time gives you <eol> enough of a comforting consistency <eob> and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah? <eob>
And then comes ghosting. <eob> And ghosting is, basically, <eob> you disappear from this massa <eol> of texts on the spot, <eob> and you don't have to deal with the pain <eol> that you inflict on another, <eob> because you're making it <eol> invisible even to yourself. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah? <eob>
So I was thinking -- these words came up for me <eol> as I was listening to you, <eob> like how a vocabulary also creates a reality, <eob> and at the same time, <eob> that's my question to you: <eob> Do you think when the context changes, <eob> it still means that the nature <eol> of love remains the same? <eob>
You study the brain and I study <eol> people's relationships and stories, <eob> so I think it's everything <eol> you say, plus. <eob>
But I don't always know the degree <eol> to which a changing context ... <eob> Does it at some point begin to change -- <eob> If the meaning changes, does it change the need, <eob> or is the need clear of the entire context? <eob>
HF: Wow! Well -- <eob>
Well, I've got three points here, right? <eob>
First of all, to your first one: <eob> there's no question <eob> that we've changed, that we now <eol> want a person to love, <eob> and for thousands of years, we had <eob> to marry the right person <eob> from the right background <eob> and right kin connection. <eob>
And in fact, in my studies <eol> of 5,000 people every year, <eob> I ask them, "What are you looking for?" <eob> And every single year, <eol> over 97 percent say -- <eob>
EP: The list grows -- <eob>
HF: Well, no. <eob>
The basic thing is over 97 percent of people <eob> want somebody that respects them, <eob> somebody they can trust and confide in, <eob> somebody who makes them laugh, <eob> somebody who makes enough time for them <eob> and somebody who they find <eol> physically attractive. <eob> That never changes. <eob> And there's certainly -- <eol> you know, there's two parts -- <eob>
EP: But you know how I call that? <eob>
That's not what people used to say -- <eob>
HF: That's exactly right. <eob>
EP: They said they wanted somebody <eol> with whom they have companionship, <eob> economic support, children. <eob>
We went from a production economy <eol> to a service economy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We did it in the larger culture, <eol> and we're doing it in marriage. <eob>
HF: Right, no question about it. <eob>
But it's interesting, the millennials <eol> actually want to be very good parents, <eob> whereas the generation above them <eol> wants to have a very fine marriage <eob> but is not as focused on being a good parent. <eob>
You see all of these nuances. <eob>
There's two basic parts of personality: <eob> there's your culture -- <eol> everything you grew up to do and believe and say -- <eob> and there's your temperament. <eob>
Basically, what I've been talking <eol> about is your temperament. <eob>
And that temperament is certainly <eol> going to change with changing times <eob> and changing beliefs. <eob>
And in terms of the paradox of choice, <eob> there's no question about it <eol> that this is a pickle. <eob>
There were millions of years <eol> where you found that sweet boy <eob> at the other side of the water hole, <eob> and you went for it. <eob>
EP: Yes, but you -- <eob>
HF: I do want to say one more thing. <eob>
The bottom line is, <eol> in hunting and gathering societies, <eob> they tended to have two or three partners <eob> during the course of their lives. <eob>
They weren't square! <eob>
And I'm not suggesting that we do, <eob> but the bottom line is, <eol> we've always had alternatives. <eob>
Mankind is always -- <eob> in fact, the brain is well-built <eol> to what we call "equilibrate," <eob> to try and decide: <eob> Do I come, do I stay? <eol> Do I go, do I stay? <eob>
How do I handle this there? <eob> And so I think we're seeing <eol> another play-out of that now. <eob>
KS: Well, thank you both so much. <eob>
I think you're going to have <eol> a million dinner partners for tonight! <eob>
I'd like you to imagine the world anew. <eob>
I'd like to show you some maps, <eob> which have been drawn by Ben Hennig, <eob> of the planet in a way <eob> that most of you will never have seen <eol> the planet depicted before. <eob>
Here's an image that you're <eol> very familiar with. <eob>
I'm old enough that I was actually born <eol> before we saw this image. <eob>
Apparently some of my first words <eol> were "moona, moona," <eob> but I think that's my mom <eol> having a particular fantasy <eob> about what her baby boy could see <eob> on the flickering <eol> black and white TV screen. <eob>
It's only been a few centuries <eob> since we've actually, most of us, thought <eol> of our planet as spherical. <eob>
When we first saw these images <eol> in the 1960s, <eob> the world was changing at an incredible rate. <eob>
In my own little discipline of human geography, <eob> a cartographer <eol> called Waldo Tobler <eob> was drawing new maps of the planet, <eob> and these maps have now spread, <eob> and I'm going to show you one of them now. <eob>
This map is a map of the world, <eob> but it's a map which looks to you <eob> a little bit strange. <eob>
It's a map in which we stretched places, <eob> so that those areas which contain <eol> many people are drawn larger, <eob> and those areas, like the Sahara <eol> and the Himalayas, <eob> in which there are few people, <eol> have been shrunk away. <eob>
Everybody on the planet <eol> is given an equal amount of space. <eob>
The cities are shown shining bright. <eob>
The lines are showing you <eol> submarine cables and trade routes. <eob>
And there's one particular line that goes <eol> from the Chinese port of Dalian <eob> through past Singapore, <eob> through the Suez Canal, <eob> through the Mediterranean <eol> and round to Rotterdam. <eob>
And it's showing you the route <eob> of what was the world's largest <eol> ship just a year ago, <eob> a ship which was taking <eol> so many containers of goods <eob> that when they were unloaded, <eob> if the lorries had all gone <eol> in convoy, they would have been 100 kilometers long. <eob>
This is how our world is now connected. <eob>
This is the quantity of stuff <eol> we are now moving around the world, <eob> just on one ship, on one voyage, <eob> in five weeks. <eob>
We've lived in cities <eol> for a very long time, <eob> but most of us didn't live in cities. <eob>
This is Çatalhöyük, one of the world's first cities. <eob>
At its peak 9,000 years ago, <eob> people had to walk over the roofs of others' houses <eol> to get to their home. <eob>
If you look carefully <eol> at the map of the city, <eob> you'll see it has no streets, <eob> because streets are something we invented. <eob> The world changes. <eob> It changes by trial and error. <eob>
We work out slowly and gradually <eob> how to live in better ways. <eob>
And the world has changed incredibly <eol> quickly most recently. <eob>
It's only within the last six, <eol> seven, or eight generations <eob> that we have actually realized <eol> that we are a species. <eob>
It's only within the last few decades <eob> that a map like this could be drawn. <eob>
Again, the underlying map is the map <eol> of world population, <eob> but over it, you're seeing arrows <eol> showing how we spread out of Africa <eob> with dates showing you <eol> where we think we arrived <eob> at particular times. <eob>
I have to redraw this map every few months, <eob> because somebody makes a discovery <eol> that a particular date was wrong. <eob>
We are learning about ourselves <eol> at an incredible speed. <eob>
And we're changing. <eob>
A lot of change is gradual. <eob> It's accretion. <eob> We don't notice the change <eob> because we only have short lives, <eob> 70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years. <eob>
This graph is showing you <eob> the annual rate of population <eol> growth in the world. <eob>
It was very low until around about 1850, <eob> and then the rate of population growth <eob> began to rise <eob> so that around the time I was born, <eob> when we first saw those images <eol> from the moon of our planet, <eob> our global population <eol> was growing at two percent a year. <eob>
If it had carried on growing <eol> at two percent a year <eob> for just another couple of centuries, <eob> the entire planet would be covered <eob> with a seething mass of human bodies <eob> all touching each other. <eob>
And people were scared. <eob>
They were scared of population growth <eob> and what they called <eol> "the population bomb" in 1968. <eob>
But then, if you look at <eol> the end of the graph, <eob> the growth began to slow. <eob>
The decade -- <eob> the '70s, the '80s, <eol> the '90s, the noughties, <eob> and in this decade, even faster -- <eob> our population growth is slowing. <eob>
Our planet is stabilizing. <eob>
We are heading towards nine, <eol> 10, or 11 billion people <eob> by the end of the century. <eob>
Within that change, you can see tumult. <eob>
You can see the Second World War. <eob>
You can see the pandemic in 1918 <eol> from influenza. <eob>
You can see the great Chinese famine. <eob>
These are the events <eol> we tend to concentrate on. <eob>
We tend to concentrate <eol> on the terrible events in the news. <eob>
We don't tend to concentrate <eol> on the gradual change <eob> and the good news stories. <eob>
We worry about people. <eob> We worry about how many people there are. <eob>
We worry about how you can get away <eol> from people. <eob>
But this is the map of the world <eol> changed again to make area large, <eob> the further away people are from each area. <eob>
So if you want to know where <eol> to go to get away from everybody, <eob> here's the best places to go. <eob>
And every year, these areas <eol> get bigger, <eob> because every year, we are coming <eol> off the land globally. <eob>
We are moving into the cities. <eob>
We are packing in more densely. <eob>
There are wolves again in Europe, <eob> and the wolves are moving <eol> west across the continent. <eob>
Our world is changing. <eob>
You have worries. <eob> This is a map showing where the water <eol> falls on our planet. <eob>
We now know that. <eob>
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was, <eob> where three continents <eol> meet, Africa, Asia, and Europe, <eob> and you can see there are a large number <eol> of people living there <eob> in areas with very little water. <eob>
And you can see areas <eol> in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well. <eob>
And we can get a bit more sophisticated. <eob>
Instead of making the map <eol> be shaped by people, <eob> we can shape the map by water, <eob> and then we can change it every month <eob> to show the amount of water <eob> falling on every small part of the globe. <eob>
And you see the monsoons <eol> moving around the planet, <eob> and the planet almost appears <eol> to have a heartbeat. <eob>
And all of this only became possible <eob> within my lifetime <eob> to see this is where we are living. <eob>
We have enough water. <eob>
This is a map of where we grow <eol> our food in the world. <eob>
This is the areas that we will rely <eol> on most for rice and maize and corn. <eob>
People worry that there won't be enough food, <eol> but we know, <eob> if we just ate less meat <eol> and fed less of the crops to animals, <eob> there is enough food for everybody <eob> as long as we think of ourselves <eol> as one group of people. <eob>
And we also know <eob> about what we do <eob> so terribly badly nowadays. <eob>
You will have seen this map <eol> of the world before. <eob>
This is the map <eob> produced by taking satellite images, <eob> if you remember those satellites <eol> around the planet <eob> in the very first slide I showed, <eob> and producing an image of what <eol> the Earth looks like at night. <eob>
When you normally see that map, <eob> on a normal map, the kind of map <eol> that most of you will be used to, <eob> you think you are seeing a map <eol> of where people live. <eob>
Where the lights are shining up <eol> is where people live. <eob>
But here, on this image of the world, <eob> remember we've stretched the map again. <eob>
Everywhere has the same density <eol> of people on this map. <eob>
If an area doesn't have people, <eob> we've shrunk it away <eob> to make it disappear. <eob>
So we're showing everybody <eob> with equal prominence. <eob>
Now, the lights no longer show you <eol> where people are, <eob> because people are everywhere. <eob>
Now the lights on the map, <eob> the lights in London, the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo, <eob> the lights on the Eastern Seaboard <eol> of the United States, <eob> the lights show you where people live <eob> who are so profligate with energy <eob> that they can afford <eob> to spend money <eob> powering lights to shine up into the sky, <eob> so satellites can draw an image like this. <eob>
And the areas that are dark on the map <eob> are either areas where people <eol> do not have access to that much energy, <eob> or areas where people do, <eob> but they have learned to stop shining <eol> the light up into the sky. <eob>
And if I could show you <eol> this map animated over time, <eob> you would see that Tokyo <eol> has actually become darker, <eob> because ever since the tsunami in Japan, <eob> Japan has had to rely <eol> on a quarter less electricity <eob> because it turned the nuclear power <eol> stations off. <eob>
And the world didn't end. <eob>
You just shone less light <eob> up into the sky. <eob>
There are a huge number <eob> of good news stories in the world. <eob>
Infant mortality is falling <eob> and has been falling at <eol> an incredible rate. <eob>
A few years ago, <eob> the number of babies dying <eol> in their first year of life in the world <eob> fell by five percent in just one year. <eob>
More children are going to school <eob> and learning to read and write <eob> and getting connected to the Internet <eob> and going on to go to university <eob> than ever before at an incredible rate, <eob> and the highest number <eol> of young people going to university in the world <eob> are women, not men. <eob>
I can give you good news story <eol> after good news story <eob> about what is getting better in the planet, <eob> but we tend to concentrate <eob> on the bad news that is immediate. <eob>
Rebecca Solnit, I think, put it brilliantly, <eob> when she explained: "The accretion <eol> of incremental, imperceptible changes <eob> which can constitute progress <eol> and which render our era <eob> dramatically different from the past" -- <eob> the past was much more stable -- <eob> "a contrast obscured by the undramatic nature <eol> of gradual transformation, <eob> punctuated by occasional tumult." <eob> Occasionally, terrible things happen. <eob>
You are shown those terrible things <eob> on the news every night of the week. <eob>
You are not told about the population <eol> slowing down. <eob>
You are not told about the world <eol> becoming more connected. <eob>
You are not told about the incredible <eol> improvements in understanding. <eob>
You are not told about <eol> how we are learning to begin <eob> to waste less and consume less. <eob>
This is my last map. <eob> On this map, we have taken the seas <eob> and the oceans out. <eob>
Now you are just looking <eob> at about 7.4 billion people <eob> with the map drawn <eol> in proportion to those people. <eob>
You're looking at <eol> over a billion in China, <eob> and you can see the largest city <eol> in the world in China, <eob> but you do not know its name. <eob>
You can see that India <eob> is in the center of this world. <eob>
You can see that Europe is on the edge. <eob>
And we in Exeter today <eob> are on the far edge of the planet. <eob>
We are on a tiny scrap of rock <eob> off Europe <eob> which contains less than one percent <eob> of the world's adults, <eob> and less than half a percent <eob> of the world's children. <eob>
We are living in a stabilizing world, <eol> an urbanizing world, <eob> an aging world, <eob> a connecting world. <eob>
There are many, many things <eol> to be frightened about, <eob> but there is no need for us <eol> to fear each other as much as we do, <eob> and we need to see that we are now <eol> living in a new world. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to talk about <eol> a failure of intuition <eob> that many of us suffer from. <eob>
It's really a failure <eol> to detect a certain kind of danger. <eob>
I'm going to describe a scenario <eob> that I think is both terrifying <eob> and likely to occur, <eob> and that's not a good combination, <eob> as it turns out. <eob>
And yet rather than be scared, <eol> most of you will feel <eob> that what I'm talking <eol> about is kind of cool. <eob>
I'm going to describe <eol> how the gains we make <eob> in artificial intelligence <eob> could ultimately destroy us. <eob>
And in fact, I think it's very difficult <eol> to see how they won't destroy us <eob> or inspire us to destroy ourselves. <eob>
And yet if you're anything like me, <eob> you'll find that it's fun <eol> to think about these things. <eob>
And that response is part of the problem. <eob> OK? That response should worry you. <eob>
And if I were to convince you in this talk <eob> that we were likely to suffer <eol> a global famine, <eob> either because of climate change <eol> or some other catastrophe, <eob> and that your grandchildren, <eol> or their grandchildren, <eob> are very likely to live like this, <eob> you wouldn't think, <eob> "Interesting. <eob>
I like this TED Talk." <eob>
Famine isn't fun. <eob> Death by science fiction, <eol> on the other hand, is fun, <eob> and one of the things that worries me <eol> most about the development of AI at this point <eob> is that we seem unable to marshal <eol> an appropriate emotional response <eob> to the dangers that lie ahead. <eob>
I am unable to marshal this response, <eol> and I'm giving this talk. <eob>
It's as though we stand before two doors. <eob>
Behind door number one, <eob> we stop making progress <eol> in building intelligent machines. <eob>
Our computer hardware and software just stops <eol> getting better for some reason. <eob>
Now take a moment to consider <eol> why this might happen. <eob>
I mean, given how valuable intelligence <eol> and automation are, <eob> we will continue to improve <eol> our technology if we are at all able to. <eob>
What could stop us from doing this? <eob>
A full-scale nuclear war? <eob> A global pandemic? <eob> An asteroid impact? <eob> Justin Bieber becoming president <eol> of the United States? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The point is, something would have <eol> to destroy civilization as we know it. <eob>
You have to imagine <eol> how bad it would have to be <eob> to prevent us from making <eol> improvements in our technology <eob> permanently, <eob> generation after generation. <eob>
Almost by definition, this is the worst thing <eob> that's ever happened <eol> in human history. <eob>
So the only alternative, <eob> and this is what lies behind door <eol> number two, <eob> is that we continue to improve <eol> our intelligent machines <eob> year after year after year. <eob>
At a certain point, we will build <eol> machines that are smarter than we are, <eob> and once we have machines <eol> that are smarter than we are, <eob> they will begin to improve themselves. <eob>
And then we risk what the mathematician <eol> IJ Good called <eob> an "intelligence explosion," <eob> that the process could get away from us. <eob>
Now, this is often caricatured, <eol> as I have here, <eob> as a fear that armies <eol> of malicious robots <eob> will attack us. <eob>
But that isn't the most likely scenario. <eob>
It's not that our machines will become <eol> spontaneously malevolent. <eob>
The concern is really <eol> that we will build machines <eob> that are so much more competent than we are <eob> that the slightest divergence <eol> between their goals and our own <eob> could destroy us. <eob>
Just think about how we relate to ants. <eob> We don't hate them. <eob>
We don't go out of our way to harm them. <eob>
In fact, sometimes we take pains not <eol> to harm them. <eob> We step over them on the sidewalk. <eob> But whenever their presence <eob> seriously conflicts <eol> with one of our goals, <eob> let's say when constructing <eol> a building like this one, <eob> we annihilate them <eol> without a qualm. <eob>
The concern is that we will one day build machines <eob> that, whether they're conscious or not, <eob> could treat us with similar disregard. <eob>
Now, I suspect this seems far-fetched <eol> to many of you. <eob>
I bet there are those of you <eol> who doubt that superintelligent AI is possible, <eob> much less inevitable. <eob>
But then you must find something wrong <eol> with one of the following assumptions. <eob>
And there are only three of them. <eob>
Intelligence is a matter <eol> of information processing in physical systems. <eob>
Actually, this is a little bit <eol> more than an assumption. <eob>
We have already built narrow intelligence <eol> into our machines, <eob> and many of these machines perform <eob> at a level of superhuman intelligence already. <eob>
And we know that mere matter <eob> can give rise to what is called <eol> "general intelligence," <eob> an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains, <eob> because our brains have managed it. Right? <eob> I mean, there's just atoms in here, <eob> and as long as we continue <eol> to build systems of atoms <eob> that display more and more intelligent behavior, <eob> we will eventually, unless we are interrupted, <eob> we will eventually build general intelligence <eob> into our machines. <eob>
It's crucial to realize that the rate <eol> of progress doesn't matter, <eob> because any progress is enough <eol> to get us into the end zone. <eob>
We don't need Moore's law to continue. <eol> We don't need exponential progress. <eob>
We just need to keep going. <eob>
The second assumption <eol> is that we will keep going. <eob>
We will continue to improve <eol> our intelligent machines. <eob>
And given the value of intelligence -- <eob> I mean, intelligence is either <eol> the source of everything we value <eob> or we need it to safeguard <eol> everything we value. <eob>
It is our most valuable resource. <eob>
So we want to do this. <eob>
We have problems <eol> that we desperately need to solve. <eob>
We want to cure diseases <eol> like Alzheimer's and cancer. <eob>
We want to understand economic systems. <eob>
We want to improve our climate science. <eob>
So we will do this, if we can. <eob>
The train is already out of the station, <eol> and there's no brake to pull. <eob>
Finally, we don't stand <eol> on a peak of intelligence, <eob> or anywhere near it, likely. <eob>
And this really is the crucial insight. <eob>
This is what makes our situation <eol> so precarious, <eob> and this is what makes our intuitions <eol> about risk so unreliable. <eob>
Now, just consider the smartest person <eol> who has ever lived. <eob>
On almost everyone's shortlist here <eol> is John von Neumann. <eob>
I mean, the impression <eol> that von Neumann made on the people around him, <eob> and this included the greatest mathematicians <eol> and physicists of his time, <eob> is fairly well-documented. <eob>
If only half the stories about him <eol> are half true, <eob> there's no question <eob> he's one of the smartest people <eol> who has ever lived. <eob>
So consider the spectrum of intelligence. <eob>
Here we have John von Neumann. <eob>
And then we have you and me. <eob>
And then we have a chicken. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Sorry, a chicken. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There's no reason for me <eol> to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It seems overwhelmingly likely, however, <eol> that the spectrum of intelligence <eob> extends much further <eol> than we currently conceive, <eob> and if we build machines <eol> that are more intelligent than we are, <eob> they will very likely <eol> explore this spectrum <eob> in ways that we can't imagine, <eob> and exceed us in ways that we can't imagine. <eob>
And it's important to recognize <eol> that this is true by virtue of speed alone. <eob> Right? So imagine if we just built <eol> a superintelligent AI <eob> that was no smarter <eol> than your average team of researchers <eob> at Stanford or MIT. <eob>
Well, electronic circuits <eol> function about a million times faster <eob> than biochemical ones, <eob> so this machine should think <eol> about a million times faster <eob> than the minds that built it. <eob>
So you set it running for a week, <eob> and it will perform 20,000 years <eol> of human-level intellectual work, <eob> week after week after week. <eob>
How could we even understand, <eol> much less constrain, <eob> a mind making this sort <eol> of progress? <eob>
The other thing that's worrying, frankly, <eob> is that, imagine the best case scenario. <eob>
So imagine we hit upon a design <eol> of superintelligent AI <eob> that has no safety concerns. <eob>
We have the perfect design <eol> the first time around. <eob>
It's as though we've been handed an oracle <eob> that behaves exactly as intended. <eob>
Well, this machine would be <eol> the perfect labor-saving device. <eob>
It can design the machine <eol> that can build the machine <eob> that can do any physical work, <eob> powered by sunlight, <eob> more or less for the cost <eol> of raw materials. <eob>
So we're talking about the end <eol> of human drudgery. <eob>
We're also talking about the end <eol> of most intellectual work. <eob>
So what would apes like ourselves <eol> do in this circumstance? <eob>
Well, we'd be free to play Frisbee <eol> and give each other massages. <eob>
Add some LSD and some questionable <eol> wardrobe choices, <eob> and the whole world <eol> could be like Burning Man. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, that might sound pretty good, <eob> but ask yourself what would happen <eob> under our current economic and political order? <eob>
It seems likely that we would witness <eob> a level of wealth inequality <eol> and unemployment <eob> that we have never seen before. <eob>
Absent a willingness to immediately <eol> put this new wealth <eob> to the service of all humanity, <eob> a few trillionaires could grace the covers <eol> of our business magazines <eob> while the rest of the world <eol> would be free to starve. <eob>
And what would the Russians <eol> or the Chinese do <eob> if they heard that some company <eol> in Silicon Valley <eob> was about to deploy <eol> a superintelligent AI? <eob>
This machine would be capable <eol> of waging war, <eob> whether terrestrial or cyber, <eob> with unprecedented power. <eob>
This is a winner-take-all scenario. <eob>
To be six months ahead of the competition here <eob> is to be 500,000 years ahead, <eob> at a minimum. <eob>
So it seems that even mere rumors <eol> of this kind of breakthrough <eob> could cause our species to go berserk. <eob>
Now, one of the most frightening things, <eob> in my view, at this moment, <eob> are the kinds of things <eol> that AI researchers say <eob> when they want to be reassuring. <eob>
And the most common reason <eol> we're told not to worry is time. <eob>
This is all a long way off, <eol> don't you know. <eob>
This is probably 50 or 100 years away. <eob>
One researcher has said, <eob> "Worrying about AI safety <eob> is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars." <eob> This is the Silicon Valley version <eob> of "don't worry <eol> your pretty little head about it." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
No one seems to notice <eob> that referencing the time horizon <eob> is a total non sequitur. <eob>
If intelligence is just a matter <eol> of information processing, <eob> and we continue to improve <eol> our machines, <eob> we will produce some form of superintelligence. <eob>
And we have no idea <eol> how long it will take us <eob> to create the conditions to do <eol> that safely. <eob>
Let me say that again. <eob>
to create the conditions <eol> to do that safely. <eob> We have no idea how long it will take us <eob>
And if you haven't noticed, 50 years <eol> is not what it used to be. <eob>
This is 50 years in months. <eob>
This is how long we've had the iPhone. <eob>
This is how long "The Simpsons" <eol> has been on television. <eob>
Fifty years is not that much time <eob> to meet one of the greatest challenges <eol> our species will ever face. <eob>
Once again, we seem to be failing <eol> to have an appropriate emotional response <eob> to what we have every reason <eol> to believe is coming. <eob>
The computer scientist Stuart Russell <eol> has a nice analogy here. <eob>
He said, imagine that we received <eol> a message from an alien civilization, <eob> which read: <eob> "People of Earth, <eob> we will arrive on your planet <eol> in 50 years. <eob>
Get ready." <eob> And now we're just counting down the months <eol> until the mothership lands? <eob>
We would feel <eol> a little more urgency than we do. <eob>
Another reason we're told not to worry <eob> is that these machines can't help <eol> but share our values <eob> because they will be <eol> literally extensions of ourselves. <eob>
They'll be grafted onto our brains, <eob> and we'll essentially become <eol> their limbic systems. <eob>
Now take a moment to consider <eob> that the safest and only prudent path forward, <eob> recommended, <eob> is to implant this technology <eol> directly into our brains. <eob>
Now, this may in fact be the safest <eol> and only prudent path forward, <eob> but usually one's safety concerns <eol> about a technology <eob> have to be pretty much worked out <eol> before you stick it inside your head. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The deeper problem is that building <eol> superintelligent AI on its own <eob> seems likely to be easier <eob> than building superintelligent AI <eob> and having the completed neuroscience <eob> that allows us to seamlessly integrate our minds with it. <eob>
And given that the companies <eol> and governments doing this work <eob> are likely to perceive themselves <eol> as being in a race against all others, <eob> given that to win this race <eol> is to win the world, <eob> provided you don't destroy it <eol> in the next moment, <eob> then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do <eob> will get done first. <eob>
Now, unfortunately, <eol> I don't have a solution to this problem, <eob> apart from recommending <eol> that more of us think about it. <eob>
I think we need something <eol> like a Manhattan Project <eob> on the topic <eol> of artificial intelligence. <eob>
Not to build it, because I think <eol> we'll inevitably do that, <eob> but to understand how to avoid <eol> an arms race <eob> and to build it in a way that is aligned <eol> with our interests. <eob>
When you're talking about superintelligent AI <eob> that can make changes to itself, <eob> it seems that we only have one chance to get <eol> the initial conditions right, <eob> and even then we will need to absorb <eob> the economic and political consequences <eol> of getting them right. <eob>
But the moment we admit <eob> that information processing <eol> is the source of intelligence, <eob> that some appropriate computational system <eol> is what the basis of intelligence is, <eob> and we admit that we will improve <eol> these systems continuously, <eob> and we admit that the horizon <eol> of cognition very likely far exceeds <eob> what we currently know, <eob> then we have to admit <eob> that we are in the process <eol> of building some sort of god. <eob>
Now would be a good time <eob> to make sure it's a god we can live with. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR? <eob>
I would be shocked if you hadn't. <eob>
This is a technology -- <eol> it's for genome editing -- <eob> and it's so versatile and so controversial <eob> that it's sparking all sorts <eol> of really interesting conversations. <eob>
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth? <eob>
Should we edit a human embryo? <eob>
And my personal favorite: <eob> How can we justify <eol> wiping out an entire species <eob> that we consider harmful to humans <eob> off the face of the Earth, <eob> using this technology? <eob>
This type of science <eol> is moving much faster <eob> than the regulatory mechanisms <eol> that govern it. <eob>
And so, for the past six years, <eob> I've made it my personal mission <eob> to make sure that as many people <eol> as possible understand <eob> these types of technologies <eol> and their implications. <eob>
Now, CRISPR has been the subject <eol> of a huge media hype, <eob> and the words that are used most often <eol> are "easy" and "cheap." <eob> So what I want to do is drill down <eol> a little bit deeper <eob> and look into some of the myths <eol> and the realities around CRISPR. <eob>
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome, <eob> the first thing that you have to do <eol> is damage the DNA. <eob>
The damage comes in the form <eol> of a double-strand break <eob> through the double helix. <eob>
And then the cellular repair <eol> processes kick in, <eob> and then we convince <eol> those repair processes <eob> to make the edit that we want, <eob> and not a natural edit. <eob> That's how it works. <eob> It's a two-part system. <eob>
You've got a Cas9 protein <eol> and something called a guide RNA. <eob>
I like to think of it as a guided missile. <eob>
So the Cas9 -- <eol> I love to anthropomorphize -- <eob> so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing <eob> that wants to chew DNA, <eob> and the guide RNA is the leash <eol> that's keeping it out of the genome <eob> until it finds the exact spot <eol> where it matches. <eob>
And the combination of those two <eol> is called CRISPR. <eob>
It's a system that we stole <eob> from an ancient, ancient <eol> bacterial immune system. <eob>
The part that's amazing about it <eol> is that the guide RNA, <eob> only 20 letters of it, <eob> are what target the system. <eob>
This is really easy to design, <eob> and it's really cheap to buy. <eob>
So that's the part <eol> that is modular in the system; <eob> everything else stays the same. <eob>
This makes it a remarkably easy <eol> and powerful system to use. <eob>
The guide RNA and the Cas9 <eol> protein complex together <eob> go bouncing along the genome, <eob> and when they find a spot <eol> where the guide RNA matches, <eob> then it inserts between the two strands <eol> of the double helix, <eob> it rips them apart, <eob> that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut, <eob> and all of a sudden, <eob> you've got a cell that's in total panic <eob> because now it's got a piece <eol> of DNA that's broken. <eob>
What does it do? <eob> It calls its first responders. <eob>
There are two major repair pathways. <eob>
The first just takes the DNA <eol> and shoves the two pieces back together. <eob>
This isn't a very efficient system, <eob> because what happens is <eol> sometimes a base drops out <eob> or a base is added. <eob>
It's an OK way to maybe, like, <eol> knock out a gene, <eob> but it's not the way that we really want <eol> to do genome editing. <eob>
The second repair pathway <eol> is a lot more interesting. <eob>
In this repair pathway, <eob> it takes a homologous piece of DNA. <eob>
And now mind you, in a diploid <eol> organism like people, <eob> we've got one copy of our genome <eol> from our mom and one from our dad, <eob> so if one gets damaged, <eob> it can use the other <eol> chromosome to repair it. <eob> So that's where this comes from. <eob> The repair is made, <eob> and now the genome is safe again. <eob>
The way that we can hijack this <eob> is we can feed it a false piece of DNA, <eob> a piece that has homology on both ends <eob> but is different in the middle. <eob>
So now, you can put <eol> whatever you want in the center <eob> and the cell gets fooled. <eob>
So you can change a letter, <eob> you can take letters out, <eob> but most importantly, <eol> you can stuff new DNA in, <eob> kind of like a Trojan horse. <eob>
CRISPR is going to be amazing, <eob> in terms of the number of different <eol> scientific advances <eob> that it's going to catalyze. <eob>
The thing that's special about it <eol> is this modular targeting system. <eob>
I mean, we've been shoving DNA <eol> into organisms for years, right? <eob>
But because of the modular <eol> targeting system, <eob> we can actually put it <eol> exactly where we want it. <eob>
The thing is that there's <eol> a lot of talk about it being cheap <eob> and it being easy. <eob>
And I run a community lab. <eob>
I'm starting to get emails from people <eol> that say stuff like, <eob>
"Hey, can I come to your open night <eob> and, like, maybe use CRISPR <eol> and engineer my genome?" <eob>
(Laugher) <eob>
Like, seriously. <eob>
I'm, "No, you can't." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"But I've heard it's cheap. <eol> I've heard it's easy." <eob>
We're going to explore that a little bit. <eob>
So, how cheap is it? <eob>
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison. <eob>
It's going to take the cost of the average <eol> materials for an experiment <eob> from thousands of dollars <eol> to hundreds of dollars, <eob> and it cuts the time a lot, too. <eob>
It can cut it from weeks to days. <eob> That's great. <eob> You still need a professional lab <eol> to do the work in; <eob> you're not going to do anything meaningful <eol> outside of a professional lab. <eob>
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says <eob> you can do this sort of stuff <eol> on your kitchen table. <eob>
It's really not easy <eol> to do this kind of work. <eob>
Not to mention, <eol> there's a patent battle going on, <eob> so even if you do invent something, <eob> the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley <eol> are in this incredible patent battle. <eob>
It's really fascinating <eol> to watch it happen, <eob> because they're accusing each other <eol> of fraudulent claims <eob> and then they've got people saying, <eob> "Oh, well, I signed <eol> my notebook here or there." <eob> This isn't going to be settled for years. <eob>
And when it is, <eob> you can bet you're going to pay someone <eol> a really hefty licensing fee <eob> in order to use this stuff. <eob>
So, is it really cheap? <eob>
Well, it's cheap if you're doing <eol> basic research and you've got a lab. <eob>
How about easy? <eol> Let's look at that claim. <eob> The devil is always in the details. <eob>
We don't really know <eol> that much about cells. <eob>
They're still kind of black boxes. <eob>
For example, we don't know <eol> why some guide RNAs work really well <eob> and some guide RNAs don't. <eob>
We don't know why some cells <eol> want to do one repair pathway <eob> and some cells would rather do the other. <eob>
And besides that, <eob> there's the whole problem <eol> of getting the system into the cell <eob> in the first place. <eob>
In a petri dish, that's not that hard, <eob> but if you're trying to do it <eol> on a whole organism, <eob> it gets really tricky. <eob>
It's OK if you use something <eol> like blood or bone marrow -- <eob> those are the targets <eol> of a lot of research now. <eob>
There was a great story <eol> of some little girl <eob> who they saved from leukemia <eob> by taking the blood out, editing it, <eol> and putting it back <eob> with a precursor of CRISPR. <eob>
And this is a line of research <eol> that people are going to do. <eob>
But right now, if you want to get <eol> into the whole body, <eob> you're probably going <eol> to have to use a virus. <eob>
So you take the virus, <eol> you put the CRISPR into it, <eob> you let the virus infect the cell. <eob>
But now you've got this virus in there, <eob> and we don't know what the long-term <eol> effects of that are. <eob>
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects, <eob> a very small percentage, <eol> but they're still there. <eob>
What's going to happen <eol> over time with that? <eob>
These are not trivial questions, <eob> and there are scientists <eol> that are trying to solve them, <eob> and they will eventually, <eol> hopefully, be solved. <eob>
But it ain't plug-and-play, <eol> not by a long shot. <eob>
So: Is it really easy? <eob>
Well, if you spend a few years <eol> working it out in your particular system, <eob> yes, it is. <eob>
Now the other thing is, <eob> we don't really know that much about how <eol> to make a particular thing happen <eob> by changing particular spots <eol> in the genome. <eob>
We're a long way away from figuring out <eob> how to give a pig wings, for example. <eob>
Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle <eol> for an extra leg. <eob>
That would be kind of cool, right? <eob>
But what is happening <eob> is that CRISPR is being used <eol> by thousands and thousands of scientists <eob> to do really, really important work, <eob> like making better models <eol> of diseases in animals, for example, <eob> or for taking pathways <eol> that produce valuable chemicals <eob> and getting them into industrial <eol> production in fermentation vats, <eob> or even doing really basic research <eol> on what genes do. <eob>
This is the story of CRISPR <eol> we should be telling, <eob> and I don't like it <eol> that the flashier aspects of it <eob> are drowning all of this out. <eob>
Lots of scientists did a lot of work <eol> to make CRISPR happen, <eob> and what's interesting to me <eob> is that these scientists <eol> are being supported by our society. <eob>
Think about it. <eob> We've got an infrastructure that allows <eol> a certain percentage of people <eob> to spend all their time doing research. <eob>
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR, <eob> and I would say that makes us all <eol> the shepherds of CRISPR. <eob>
We all have a responsibility. <eob>
So I would urge you to really learn <eol> about these types of technologies, <eob> because, really, only in that way <eob> are we going to be able to guide <eol> the development of these technologies, <eob> the use of these technologies <eob> and make sure that, in the end, <eol> it's a positive outcome -- <eob> for both the planet and for us. <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When Dorothy was a little girl, <eob> she was fascinated by her goldfish. <eob>
Her father explained to her <eol> that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails <eob> to propel themselves through the water. <eob>
Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded, <eob> "Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards <eol> by wagging their heads." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> In her mind, it was a fact <eol> as true as any other. <eob>
Fish swim backwards <eol> by wagging their heads. <eob> She believed it. <eob>
Our lives are full of fish <eol> swimming backwards. <eob>
We make assumptions and faulty <eol> leaps of logic. <eob> We harbor bias. <eob> We know that we are right, <eol> and they are wrong. <eob>
We fear the worst. <eob>
We strive for unattainable perfection. <eob>
We tell ourselves <eol> what we can and cannot do. <eob>
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically <eol> wagging their heads <eob> and we don't even notice them. <eob>
I'm going to tell you <eol> five facts about myself. <eob>
One fact is not true. <eob>
One: I graduated from Harvard <eol> at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics. <eob>
Two: I currently run <eol> a construction company in Orlando. <eob>
Three: I starred on a television sitcom. <eob>
Four: I lost my sight <eol> to a rare genetic eye disease. <eob>
Five: I served as a law clerk <eol> to two US Supreme Court justices. <eob>
Which fact is not true? <eob>
Actually, they're all true. <eob> Yeah. They're all true. <eob>
At this point, most people really <eol> only care about the television show. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I know this from experience. <eob>
OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class." <eob> And I played Weasel Wyzell, <eob> who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show, <eob> which made it a very major acting challenge <eob> for me as a 13-year-old boy. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, did you struggle <eol> with number four, my blindness? <eob> Why is that? <eob> We make assumptions about <eol> so-called disabilities. <eob>
As a blind man, I confront <eol> others' incorrect assumptions <eob> about my abilities every day. <eob>
My point today is not <eol> about my blindness, however. <eob>
It's about my vision. <eob>
Going blind taught me to live <eol> my life eyes wide open. <eob>
It taught me to spot <eol> those backwards-swimming fish <eob> that our minds create. <eob>
Going blind cast them into focus. <eob>
What does it feel like to see? <eob>
It's immediate and passive. <eob>
You open your eyes and there's the world. <eob> Seeing is believing. Sight is truth. <eob> Right? <eob> Well, that's what I thought. <eob>
Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas <eol> progressively deteriorated. <eob>
My sight became an increasingly bizarre <eob> carnival funhouse hall <eol> of mirrors and illusions. <eob>
The salesperson I was relieved <eol> to spot in a store <eob> was really a mannequin. <eob>
Reaching down to wash my hands, <eob> I suddenly saw it was a urinal <eol> I was touching, not a sink, <eob> when my fingers felt its true shape. <eob>
A friend described the photograph in my hand, <eob> and only then I could see <eol> the image depicted. <eob>
Objects appeared, morphed <eol> and disappeared in my reality. <eob>
It was difficult and exhausting to see. <eob>
I pieced together <eol> fragmented, transitory images, <eob> consciously analyzed the clues, <eob> searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope, <eob> until I saw nothing at all. <eob>
I learned that what we see <eob> is not universal truth. <eob>
It is not objective reality. <eob>
What we see is a unique, <eol> personal, virtual reality <eob> that is masterfully constructed by our brain. <eob>
Let me explain with a bit <eol> of amateur neuroscience. <eob>
Your visual cortex takes up <eol> about 30 percent of your brain. <eob> That's compared <eol> to approximately eight percent for touch <eob> and two to three percent for hearing. <eob>
Every second, your eyes can send <eol> your visual cortex <eob> as many as two billion pieces <eol> of information. <eob>
The rest of your body can send your brain <eol> only an additional billion. <eob>
So sight is one third <eol> of your brain by volume <eob> and can claim about two thirds <eol> of your brain's processing resources. <eob>
It's no surprise then <eob> that the illusion <eol> of sight is so compelling. <eob>
But make no mistake about it: <eol> sight is an illusion. <eob>
Here's where it gets interesting. <eob>
To create the experience of sight, <eob> your brain references <eol> your conceptual understanding of the world, <eob> other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention. <eob>
All of these things and far more <eol> are linked in your brain to your sight. <eob>
These linkages work both ways, <eol> and usually occur subconsciously. <eob>
So for example, <eob> what you see impacts how you feel, <eob> and the way you feel <eol> can literally change what you see. <eob>
Numerous studies demonstrate this. <eob>
If you are asked to estimate <eob> the walking speed of a man <eol> in a video, for example, <eob> your answer will be different if you're told <eol> to think about cheetahs or turtles. <eob>
A hill appears steeper <eol> if you've just exercised, <eob> and a landmark appears <eol> farther away <eob> if you're wearing a heavy backpack. <eob>
We have arrived <eol> at a fundamental contradiction. <eob>
What you see is a complex <eol> mental construction of your own making, <eob> but you experience it passively <eob> as a direct representation of the world <eol> around you. <eob>
You create your own reality, <eol> and you believe it. <eob>
I believed mine until it broke apart. <eob> The deterioration of my eyes <eol> shattered the illusion. <eob>
You see, sight is just one way <eob> we shape our reality. <eob>
We create our own realities <eol> in many other ways. <eob>
Let's take fear as just one example. <eob>
Your fears distort your reality. <eob>
Under the warped logic of fear, <eol> anything is better than the uncertain. <eob>
Fear fills the void <eol> at all costs, <eob> passing off what you dread <eol> for what you know, <eob> offering up the worst in place <eol> of the ambiguous, <eob> substituting assumption for reason. <eob>
Psychologists have a great term <eol> for it: awfulizing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right? <eob> Fear replaces the unknown with the awful. <eob>
Now, fear is self-realizing. <eob>
When you face the greatest need <eob> to look outside yourself <eol> and think critically, <eob> fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind, <eob> shrinking and distorting your view, <eob> drowning your capacity <eol> for critical thought <eob> with a flood of disruptive emotions. <eob>
When you face a compelling opportunity <eol> to take action, <eob> fear lulls you into inaction, <eob> enticing you to passively <eol> watch its prophecies fulfill themselves. <eob>
When I was diagnosed <eol> with my blinding disease, <eob> I knew blindness would ruin my life. <eob>
Blindness was a death sentence <eol> for my independence. <eob>
It was the end of achievement for me. <eob>
Blindness meant I would live <eol> an unremarkable life, <eob> small and sad, <eob> and likely alone. <eob> I knew it. <eob> This was a fiction born <eol> of my fears, but I believed it. <eob>
It was a lie, but it was my reality, <eob> just like those backwards-swimming fish <eol> in little Dorothy's mind. <eob>
If I had not confronted <eol> the reality of my fear, <eob> I would have lived it. <eob>
I am certain of that. <eob>
So how do you live <eol> your life eyes wide open? <eob>
It is a learned discipline. <eob>
It can be taught. <eob>
It can be practiced. <eob>
I will summarize very briefly. <eob>
Hold yourself accountable <eob> for every moment, every thought, <eob> every detail. <eob>
See beyond your fears. <eob> Recognize your assumptions. <eob> Harness your internal strength. <eob>
Silence your internal critic. <eob>
Correct your misconceptions <eol> about luck and about success. <eob>
Accept your strengths <eol> and your weaknesses, and understand the difference. <eob>
Open your hearts <eob> to your bountiful blessings. <eob>
Your fears, your critics, <eob> your heroes, your villains -- <eob> they are your excuses, <eob> rationalizations, shortcuts, <eob> justifications, your surrender. <eob>
They are fictions you perceive as reality. <eob>
Choose to see through them. <eob>
Choose to let them go. <eob>
You are the creator of your reality. <eob>
With that empowerment comes <eol> complete responsibility. <eob>
I chose to step out of fear's tunnel <eol> into terrain uncharted and undefined. <eob> I chose to build there a blessed life. <eob>
Far from alone, <eob> I share my beautiful life <eol> with Dorothy, <eob> my beautiful wife, <eob> with our triplets, whom we call the Tripskys, <eob> and with the latest addition to the family, <eob> sweet baby Clementine. <eob>
What do you fear? <eob> What lies do you tell yourself? <eob>
How do you embellish your truth <eol> and write your own fictions? <eob>
What reality are you creating for yourself? <eob>
In your career and personal life, <eol> in your relationships, <eob> and in your heart and soul, <eob> your backwards-swimming fish <eol> do you great harm. <eob>
They exact a toll in missed opportunities <eol> and unrealized potential, <eob> and they engender insecurity and distrust <eob> where you seek fulfillment <eol> and connection. <eob>
I urge you to search them out. <eob>
Helen Keller said that the only thing <eol> worse than being blind <eob> is having sight <eol> but no vision. <eob>
For me, going blind <eol> was a profound blessing, <eob> because blindness gave me vision. <eob>
I hope you can see what I see. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Bruno Giussani: Isaac, <eol> before you leave the stage, just a question. <eob>
This is an audience <eol> of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators. <eob>
You are a CEO of a company <eol> down in Florida, <eob> and many are probably wondering, <eob> how is it to be a blind CEO? <eob>
What kind of specific challenges do you have, <eol> and how do you overcome them? <eob>
Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge <eol> became a blessing. <eob>
I don't get visual feedback from people. <eob>
BG: What's that noise there? <eol> IL: Yeah. <eob> So, for example, <eob> in my leadership team meetings, <eob> I don't see facial expressions <eol> or gestures. <eob>
I've learned to solicit <eol> a lot more verbal feedback. <eob>
I basically force people <eol> to tell me what they think. <eob>
And in this respect, <eob> it's become, like I said, a real blessing <eol> for me personally and for my company, <eob> because we communicate <eol> at a far deeper level, <eob> we avoid ambiguities, <eob> and most important, my team knows <eol> that what they think truly matters. <eob>
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED. <eob>
The language I'm speaking right now <eob> is on its way to becoming <eol> the world's universal language, <eob> for better or for worse. <eob>
Let's face it, <eob> it's the language of the internet, <eob> it's the language of finance, <eob> it's the language of air traffic control, <eob> of popular music, <eob> diplomacy -- <eob> English is everywhere. <eob>
Now, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people, <eob> but more Chinese people <eol> are learning English <eob> than English speakers are learning Chinese. <eob>
Last I heard, <eob> there are two dozen <eol> universities in China right now <eob> teaching all in English. <eob>
English is taking over. <eob>
And in addition to that, <eob> it's been predicted <eol> that at the end of the century <eob> almost all of the languages <eol> that exist now -- <eob> there are about 6,000 -- <eob> will no longer be spoken. <eob>
There will only be some hundreds left. <eob>
And on top of that, <eob> it's at the point where <eol> instant translation of live speech <eob> is not only possible, <eol> but it gets better every year. <eob>
The reason I'm reciting <eol> those things to you <eob> is because I can tell that <eol> we're getting to the point <eob> where a question is going to start being asked, <eob> which is: Why should we learn foreign languages -- <eob> other than if English happens <eol> to be foreign to one? <eob>
Why bother to learn another one <eol> when it's getting to the point <eob> where almost everybody in the world <eol> will be able to communicate in one? <eob>
I think there are a lot of reasons, <eob> but I first want to address <eob> the one that you're probably most likely <eol> to have heard of, <eob> because actually it's more dangerous <eol> than you might think. <eob>
And that is the idea <eob> that a language channels <eol> your thoughts, <eob> that the vocabulary and the grammar <eol> of different languages <eob> gives everybody a different kind <eol> of acid trip, <eob> so to speak. <eob>
That is a marvelously enticing idea, <eob> but it's kind of fraught. <eob>
So it's not that it's untrue completely. <eob>
So for example, in French and Spanish <eob> the word for table is, <eol> for some reason, marked as feminine. <eob>
So, "la table," "la mesa," <eol> you just have to deal with it. <eob>
It has been shown <eob> that if you are a speaker <eol> of one of those languages <eob> and you happen to be asked <eob> how you would imagine a table talking, <eob> then much more often <eol> than could possibly be an accident, <eob> a French or a Spanish speaker <eob> says that the table would talk <eol> with a high and feminine voice. <eob>
So if you're French or Spanish, to you, <eol> a table is kind of a girl, <eob> as opposed to if you are an English speaker. <eob>
It's hard not to love data like that, <eob> and many people will tell you that that means <eob> that there's a worldview that you have <eol> if you speak one of those languages. <eob>
But you have to watch out, <eob> because imagine <eol> if somebody put us under the microscope, <eob> the us being those of us <eol> who speak English natively. <eob> What is the worldview from English? <eob>
So for example, let's take <eol> an English speaker. <eob> Up on the screen, <eol> that is Bono. <eob> He speaks English. <eob> I presume he has a worldview. <eob>
Now, that is Donald Trump. <eob>
In his way, <eob> he speaks English as well. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And here is Ms. Kardashian, <eob> and she is an English speaker, too. <eob>
So here are three speakers <eol> of the English language. <eob>
What worldview do those three people <eol> have in common? <eob>
What worldview is shaped through the English <eol> language that unites them? <eob>
It's a highly fraught concept. <eob>
And so gradual consensus is becoming <eol> that language can shape thought, <eob> but it tends to be in rather darling, obscure <eol> psychological flutters. <eob>
It's not a matter of giving you a different <eol> pair of glasses on the world. <eob>
Now, if that's the case, <eob> then why learn languages? <eob>
If it isn't going to change the way you think, <eob> what would the other reasons be? <eob> There are some. <eob> One of them is that if you <eol> want to imbibe a culture, <eob> if you <eol> want to drink it in, <eob> if you <eol> want to become part of it, <eob> then whether or not the language <eol> channels the culture -- <eob> and that seems doubtful -- <eob> if you <eol> want to imbibe the culture, <eob> you have to control to some degree <eob> the language that the culture happens to be conducted in. <eob>
There's no other way. <eob>
There's an interesting <eol> illustration of this. <eob>
I have to go slightly obscure, <eol> but really you should seek it out. <eob>
There's a movie by the Canadian <eol> film director Denys Arcand -- <eob> read out in English on the page, <eol> "Dennis Ar-cand," <eob> if you want to look him up. <eob>
He did a film called "Jesus <eol> of Montreal." <eob> And many of the characters <eob> are vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian, <eob> French-speaking women. <eob>
There's one scene closest to the end, <eob> where they have to take <eol> a friend to an Anglophone hospital. <eob>
In the hospital, <eol> they have to speak English. <eob>
Now, they speak English but it's not <eol> their native language, <eob> they'd rather not speak English. <eob>
And they speak it more slowly, <eob> they have accents, they're not idiomatic. <eob>
Suddenly these characters <eol> that you've fallen in love with <eob> become husks of themselves, <eol> they're shadows of themselves. <eob>
To go into a culture <eob> and to only ever process people <eol> through that kind of skrim curtain <eob> is to never truly get the culture. <eob>
And so to the extent that hundreds <eol> of languages will be left, <eob> one reason to learn them <eob> is because they are tickets <eol> to being able to participate <eob> in the culture of the people who speak them, <eob> just by virtue of the fact <eol> that it is their code. <eob> So that's one reason. <eob>
Second reason: <eob> it's been shown <eob> that if you speak two languages, <eol> dementia is less likely to set in, <eob> and that you are probably <eol> a better multitasker. <eob>
And these are factors <eol> that set in early, <eob> and so that ought to give you some sense <eob> of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language. <eob> Bilingualism is healthy. <eob>
And then, third -- <eob> languages are just an awful lot of fun. <eob>
Much more fun than we're often told. <eob>
So for example, Arabic: <eol> "kataba," he wrote, <eob> "yaktubu," he writes, <eol> she writes. <eob> "Uktub," write, in the imperative. <eob>
What do those things have in common? <eob>
All those things have in common <eob> the consonants sitting <eol> in the middle like pillars. <eob>
They stay still, <eob> and the vowels <eol> dance around the consonants. <eob>
Who wouldn't want to roll <eol> that around in their mouths? <eob>
You can get that from Hebrew, <eob> you can get that from Ethiopia's <eol> main language, Amharic. <eob> That's fun. <eob>
Or languages have different word orders. <eob>
Learning how to speak <eol> with different word order <eob> is like driving on the different side of a street <eol> if you go to certain country, <eob> or the feeling that you get <eol> when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes <eob> and you feel the tingle. <eob>
A language can do that to you. <eob>
So for example, <eob> "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back," <eob> a book that I'm sure <eol> we all often return to, <eob> like "Moby Dick." <eob> One phrase in it is, "Do you know <eol> where I found him? <eob>
Do you know where he was? <eob>
He was eating cake in the tub, <eob> Yes he was! <eob> "Fine. <eob>
Now, if you learn <eol> that in Mandarin Chinese, <eob> then you have to master, <eob> "You can know, I did where him find? <eob>
He was tub inside gorging cake, <eob> No mistake gorging chewing!" <eob> That just feels good. <eob>
Imagine being able to do <eol> that for years and years at a time. <eob>
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian? <eob>
Me either, but if I did, <eob> I would get to roll around <eol> in my mouth not some baker's dozen of vowels <eob> like English has, <eob> but a good 30 different vowels <eob> scooching and oozing <eol> around in the Cambodian mouth <eob> like bees in a hive. <eob>
That is what a language can get you. <eob>
And more to the point, <eob> we live in an era <eob> when it's never been easier to teach yourself <eol> another language. <eob>
It used to be that you had <eol> to go to a classroom, <eob> and there would be some diligent teacher -- <eob> some genius teacher in there -- <eob> but that person was only in there <eol> at certain times <eob> and you had to go then, <eob> and then was not most times. <eob>
You had to go to class. <eob>
If you didn't have that, you had something <eol> called a record. <eob>
I cut my teeth on those. <eob>
There was only so much data on a record, <eob> or a cassette, <eob> or even that antique object known as a CD. <eob>
Other than that you had books <eol> that didn't work, <eob> that's just the way it was. <eob>
Today you can lay down -- <eob> lie on your living room floor, <eob> sipping bourbon, <eob> and teach yourself any language <eol> that you want to <eob> with wonderful sets <eol> such as Rosetta Stone. <eob>
I highly recommend <eol> the lesser known Glossika as well. <eob>
You can do it any time, <eob> therefore you can do it more and better. <eob>
You can give yourself your morning <eol> pleasures in various languages. <eob>
I take some "Dilbert" in various <eol> languages every single morning; <eob> it can increase your skills. <eob>
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago <eob> when the idea of having any language <eol> you wanted <eob> in your pocket, <eob> coming from your phone, <eob> would have sounded like science fiction <eol> to very sophisticated people. <eob>
So I highly recommend <eob> that you teach yourself languages <eol> other than the one that I'm speaking, <eob> because there's never been <eol> a better time to do it. <eob>
It's an awful lot of fun. <eob>
It won't change your mind, <eob> but it will most certainly blow your mind. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Good evening. <eob> My journey to this stage <eob> began when I came to America <eob> at the age of 17. <eob>
You see, I'm one <eol> of the 84 million Americans <eob> who are immigrants <eob> or children of immigrants. <eob>
Each of us has a dream when we come here, <eob> a dream that usually has to be rewritten <eob> and always has to be repurposed. <eob>
I was one of the lucky ones. <eob>
My revised dream <eol> led me to the work I do today: <eob> training immigrants <eol> to run for public office <eob> and leading a movement <eol> for inclusive democracy. <eob>
But I don't want you to think <eol> it was a cakewalk, <eob> that America opened its arms wide <eol> and welcomed me. <eob>
It's still not doing that. <eob>
And I've learned <eol> a few lessons along the way <eob> that I wanted to share with you, <eob> because I think that together <eob> we can make American democracy <eob> better and stronger. <eob>
I was born in India, <eob> the world's largest democracy, <eob> and when I was four, <eob> my family moved to Belize, <eob> the world's smallest democracy perhaps. <eob>
And <eob> at the age of 17, <eob> I moved to the United States, <eob> the world's greatest democracy. <eob>
I came because I wanted <eol> to study English literature. <eob>
You see, as a child, <eol> I buried my nose in books, <eob> and I thought, why not make a living <eol> doing that as an adult? <eob>
But after I graduated from college <eob> and got a graduate degree, <eob> I found myself moving <eol> from one less ideal job to another. <eob>
Maybe it was the optimism <eol> that I had about America <eob> that made me take a while to understand <eob> that things were not going to change. <eob>
The door that I thought was open <eob> was actually just slightly ajar -- <eob> this door of America <eob> that would open wide <eol> if you had the right name, <eob> the right skin color, <eob> the right networks, <eob> but could just slam in your face <eob> if you had the wrong religion, <eob> the wrong immigration status, <eob> the wrong skin color. <eob>
And I just couldn't accept that. <eob>
So I started a career <eol> as a social entrepreneur, <eob> starting an organization <eol> for young people like myself -- <eob> I was young at the time <eol> that I started it -- <eob> who traced their heritage <eol> to the Indian subcontinent. <eob>
In that work, I became and advocate <eol> for South Asians and other immigrants. <eob>
I lobbied members of Congress <eol> on policy issues. <eob>
I volunteered on election day <eol> to do exit polling. <eob>
But I couldn't vote, <eol> and I couldn't run for office. <eob>
So in 2000, when it was announced <eob> that the citizenship application fee <eol> was going to more than double <eob> from 95 dollars to 225 dollars, <eob> I decided it was time to apply <eol> before I could no longer afford it. <eob>
I filled out a long application, <eob> answering questions about <eol> my current and my past affiliations. <eob>
And once the application was submitted, <eob> there were fingerprints to be taken, <eob> a test to study for, <eob> endless hours of waiting in line. <eob>
You might call it extreme vetting. <eob>
And then in December of 2000, <eob> I joined hundreds of other immigrants <eob> in a hall in Brooklyn <eob> where we pledged our loyalty <eob> to a country that we had <eol> long considered home. <eob>
My journey from international student <eol> to American citizen took 16 years, <eob> a short timeline when you compare it <eol> to other immigrant stories. <eob>
And soon after I had taken <eol> that formal step <eob> to becoming an American, <eob> the attacks of September 11, 2001, <eob> changed the immigration landscape <eol> for decades to come. <eob>
My city, New York City, <eob> was reeling and healing, <eob> and in the midst of it, <eob> we were in an election cycle. <eob>
Two things happened <eob> as we coped with loss and recovery <eol> in New York City. <eob>
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg <eol> mayor of New York City. <eob>
We also adopted by ballot referendum <eob> the Office of Immigrant Affairs <eol> for the City of New York. <eob>
Five months after that election, <eob> the newly elected mayor <eob> appointed me the first Commissioner <eol> of Immigrant Affairs <eob> for this newly established office. <eob>
I want you to come back to that time. <eob>
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize. <eob>
I had basically floundered <eol> in various jobs in America <eob> before I started <eol> a community-based organization <eob> in a church basement in Queens. <eob>
The attacks of September 11 <eol> sent shock waves through my community. <eob>
People who were members of my family, <eol> young people I had worked with, <eob> were experiencing harassment <eob> at schools, at workplaces <eol> and in airports. <eob>
And now I was going <eol> to represent their concerns <eob> in government. <eob>
No job felt more perfect for me. <eob>
And here are two things I learned <eol> when I became Commissioner. <eob>
First, well-meaning New Yorkers <eob> who were in city government <eol> holding government positions <eob> had no idea how scared immigrants were <eob> of law enforcement. <eob>
Most of us don't really know <eol> the difference, do we, <eob> between a sheriff <eol> and local police and the FBI. <eob>
And most of us, <eol> when we see someone in uniform <eob> going through our neighborhoods <eob> feel curiosity, if not concern. <eob>
So if you're an undocumented parent, <eob> every day when you say <eol> goodbye to your child, <eob> send them off to school and go to work, <eob> you don't know what the chances are <eob> that you're going to see them <eol> at the end of the day. <eob>
Because a raid at your workplace, <eob> a chance encounter with local police <eob> could change the course <eol> of your life forever. <eob>
The second thing I learned <eol> is that when people like me, <eob> who understood that fear, <eob> who had learned a new language, <eol> who had navigated new systems, <eob> when people like us <eol> were sitting at the table, <eob> we advocated for our communities' needs <eol> in a way that no one else could or would. <eob>
I understood what that feeling <eol> of fear was like. <eob>
People in my family were experiencing it. <eob>
Young people I had worked with <eol> were being harassed, <eob> not just by classmates, <eob> but also by their teachers. <eob>
My husband, then boyfriend, <eob> thought twice before he put <eol> a backpack on or grew a beard <eob> because he traveled so much. <eob>
What I learned in 2001 <eol> was that my vote mattered <eob> but that my voice <eol> and vantage point also mattered. <eob>
And it's these three things -- <eob> immigrants' votes, <eol> voices and vantage points -- <eob> that I think can help <eol> make our democracy stronger. <eob>
We actually have the power <eob> to change the outcome of elections, <eob> to introduce new issues <eol> into the policy debate <eob> and to change the face <eol> of the pale, male, stale leadership <eob> that we have in our country today. <eob>
So how do we do that? <eob> Well, let's talk first about votes. <eob>
It will come as no surprise to you <eob> that the majority of voters <eol> in America are white. <eob>
But it might surprise you to know <eob> that one in three voters <eol> are black, Latino or Asian. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> it doesn't just matter who can vote, <eol> it matters who does vote. <eob>
So in 2012, half of the Latino <eol> and Asian-American voters <eob> did not vote. <eob>
And these votes matter <eol> not just in presidential elections. <eob>
They matter in local and state elections. <eob>
In 2015, Lan Diep, <eob> the eldest son of political <eol> refugees from Vietnam, <eob> ran for a seat <eol> in the San Jose City Council. <eob>
He lost that election by 13 votes. <eob>
This year, he dusted off <eol> those campaign shoes <eob> and went back to run for that seat, <eob> and this time he won, by 12 votes. <eob>
Every one of our votes matters. <eob>
And when people like Lan <eol> are sitting at the policy table, <eob> they can make a difference. <eob>
We need those voices. <eob>
We need those voices. <eob> in part because American leadership <eob> does not look like America's residents. <eob>
There are over 500,000 <eol> local and state offices in America. <eob>
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices <eol> are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos, <eob> the two largest immigrant groups <eol> in our country. <eob>
In the city of Yakima, Washington, <eob> where 49 percent <eol> of the population is Latino, <eob> there has never been a Latino <eol> on the city council until this year. <eob>
Three newly elected Latinas <eol> joined the Yakima City Council in 2016. <eob>
One of them is Carmen Méndez. <eob>
She is a first-generation college student. <eob>
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico, <eob> and partly in Yakima, Washington. <eob>
She's a single mother, <eol> a community advocate. <eob>
Her voice on the Yakima City Council <eob> is advocating on behalf <eol> of the Latino community <eob> and of all Yakima residents. <eob>
And she's a role model for her daughter <eob> and other Latinas. <eob>
But the third most untapped resource <eol> in American democracy <eob> is the vantage point <eol> that immigrants bring. <eob>
We have fought to be here. <eob> We have come for economic <eol> and educational opportunity. <eob>
We have come for political <eol> and religious freedom. <eob> We have come in the pursuit of love. <eob>
That dedication, <eob> that commitment to America <eob> we also bring to public service. <eob>
People like Athena Salman, <eob> who just last week won the primary <eob> for a seat in the Arizona State House. <eob>
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank <eob> and moved to Chicago, <eob> where he met her mother. <eob>
Her mother is part Italian, <eob> part Mexican and part German. <eob>
Together they moved to Arizona <eol> and built a life. <eob>
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse, <eob> is going to fight for things <eol> like education funding <eob> that will help give <eol> families like hers a leg up <eob> so they can achieve <eol> the financial stability <eob> that we all are looking for. <eob>
Immigrants' votes, <eol> voices and vantage points <eob> are what we all need to work <eol> to include in American democracy. <eob>
It's not just my work. It's also yours. <eob>
And it's not going to be easy. <eob>
We never know <eob> what putting a new factor <eol> into an equation will do. <eob>
And it's a little scary. <eob>
You're scared that I'm going <eol> to take away your place at the table, <eob> and I'm scared that I'm never <eol> going to get a place at the table. <eob>
And we're all scared <eob> that we're going to lose this country <eol> that we know and love. <eob>
I'm scared you're going <eol> to take it away from me, <eob> and you're scared <eol> I'm going to take it away from you. <eob>
Look, it's been a rough election year, <eob> a reminder that people <eol> with my immigration history <eob> could be removed at the whim of a leader. <eob>
But I have fought to be in this country <eob> and I continue to do so every day. <eob>
So my optimism never wavers, <eob> because I know that there are <eol> millions of immigrants just like me, <eob> in front of me, <eol> behind me and all around me. <eob>
It's our country, too. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It was April, last year. <eob>
I was on an evening out with friends <eob> to celebrate one of their birthdays. <eob>
We hadn't been all together <eol> for a couple of weeks; <eob> it was a perfect evening, <eol> as we were all reunited. <eob>
At the end of the evening, <eob> I caught the last underground train back <eol> to the other side of London. <eob>
The journey was smooth. <eob>
I got back to my local station <eob> and I began the 10-minute walk home. <eob>
As I turned the corner <eol> onto my street, <eob> my house in sight up ahead, <eob> I heard footsteps behind me <eob> that seemed to have approached out of nowhere <eob> and were picking up pace. <eob>
Before I had time to process <eol> what was happening, <eob> a hand was clapped around my mouth so that I could not breathe, <eob> and the young man <eol> behind me dragged me to the ground, <eob> beat my head repeatedly <eol> against the pavement <eob> until my face began to bleed, <eob> kicking me in the back and neck <eob> while he began to assault me, <eob> ripping off my clothes <eol> and telling me to "shut up," <eob> as I struggled to cry for help. <eob>
With each smack of my head <eol> to the concrete ground, <eob> a question echoed through my mind <eol> that still haunts me today: <eob> "Is this going to be how it all ends?" <eob>
Little could I have realized, <eol> I'd been followed the whole way <eob> from the moment I left the station. <eob>
And hours later, <eob> I was standing topless <eol> and barelegged in front of the police, <eob> having the cuts and bruises <eol> on my naked body photographed <eob> for forensic evidence. <eob>
Now, there are few words <eol> to describe the all-consuming feelings <eob> of vulnerability, shame, upset <eol> and injustice that I was ridden with <eob> in that moment and for the weeks to come. <eob>
But wanting to find a way <eol> to condense these feelings <eob> into something ordered <eol> that I could work through, <eob> I decided to do what felt most natural to me: <eob> I wrote about it. <eob>
It started out as a cathartic exercise. <eob>
I wrote a letter to my assaulter, <eob> humanizing him as "you," <eob> to identify him as part <eol> of the very community <eob> that he had so violently abused that night. <eob>
Stressing the tidal-wave <eol> effect of his actions, <eob> I wrote: <eob> "Did you ever think <eol> of the people in your life? <eob>
I don't know who the people <eol> in your life are. <eob>
I don't know anything about you. <eob>
But I do know this: <eob> you did not just attack me that night. <eob>
I'm a daughter, <eol> I'm a friend, <eob> I'm a sister, I'm a pupil, <eob> I'm a cousin, I'm a niece, <eob> I'm a neighbor; <eob> I'm the employee who served everyone coffee <eob> in the café <eol> under the railway. <eob>
And all the people <eol> who form these relations to me <eob> make up my community. <eob>
And you assaulted every single <eol> one of them. <eob>
You violated the truth <eol> that I will never cease to fight for, <eob> and which all of these people represent: <eob> that there are infinitely more good <eol> people in the world than bad." <eob>
But, determined not to let this one incident <eol> make me lose faith <eob> in the solidarity in my community <eol> or humanity as a whole, <eob> I recalled the 7 / 7 terrorist bombings in July 2005 on London transport, <eob> and how the mayor of London <eol> at the time, and indeed my own parents, <eob> had insisted that we all get back <eol> on the tubes the next day, <eob> so we wouldn't be defined or changed <eob> by those that had made us feel unsafe. <eob>
I told my attacker, <eob> "You've carried out your attack, <eob> but now I'm getting back on my tube. <eob>
My community will not feel <eol> we are unsafe walking home after dark. <eob>
We will get on the last tubes home, <eob> and we will walk up our streets alone, <eob> because we will not ingrain <eol> or submit to the idea <eob> that we are putting ourselves <eol> in danger in doing so. <eob>
We will continue to come together, <eol> like an army, <eob> when any member of our community is threatened. <eob>
And this is a fight you will not win." <eob>
At the time of writing this letter — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
At the time of writing this letter, <eob> I was studying for my exams in Oxford, <eob> and I was working <eol> on the local student paper there. <eob>
Despite being lucky enough <eol> to have friends and family supporting me, <eob> it was an isolating time. <eob>
I didn't know anyone <eol> who'd been through this before; <eob> at least I didn't think I did. <eob>
I'd read news reports, statistics, <eol> and knew how common sexual assault was, <eob> yet I couldn't actually name a single person <eob> that I'd heard speak out about an experience <eol> of this kind before. <eob>
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision, <eob> I decided that I would publish <eol> my letter in the student paper, <eob> hoping to reach out to others in Oxford <eob> that might have had a similar experience <eol> and be feeling the same way. <eob>
At the end of the letter, <eob> I asked others to write <eol> in with their experiences <eob> under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty," <eob> to emphasize that survivors <eol> of assault could express themselves <eob> without feeling shame <eol> or guilt about what happened to them -- <eob> to show that we could all stand up <eol> to sexual assault. <eob>
What I never anticipated <eol> is that almost overnight, <eob> this published letter would go viral. <eob>
Soon, we were receiving <eol> hundreds of stories <eob> from men and women across the world, <eob> which we began to publish <eol> on a website I set up. <eob>
And the hashtag became a campaign. <eob>
There was an Australian mother <eol> in her 40s who described how on an evening out, <eob> she was followed to the bathroom <eob> by a man who went to repeatedly <eol> grab her crotch. <eob>
There was a man in the Netherlands <eob> who described how he was date-raped <eol> on a visit to London <eob> and wasn't taken seriously by anyone <eol> he reported his case to. <eob>
I had personal Facebook messages <eol> from people in India and South America, <eob> saying, how can we bring <eol> the message of the campaign there? <eob> One of the first contributions <eol> we had was from a woman called Nikki, <eob> who described growing up, <eol> being molested my her own father. <eob>
And I had friends open up to me <eob> about experiences ranging <eol> from those that happened last week <eob> to those that happened years ago, <eol> that I'd had no idea about. <eob>
And the more we started <eol> to receive these messages, <eob> the more we also started <eol> to receive messages of hope -- <eob> people feeling empowered by this community <eol> of voices <eob> standing up to sexual assault and victim-blaming. <eob>
One woman called Olivia, <eob> after describing how she was attacked <eob> by someone she had trusted <eol> and cared about for a long time, <eob> said, "I've read many of the stories <eol> posted here, <eob> and I feel hopeful that if so many women <eol> can move forward, <eob> then I can, too. <eob>
I've been inspired by many, <eob> and I hope I can be as strong <eol> as them someday. <eob>
I'm sure I will." <eob>
People around the world <eol> began tweeting under this hashtag, <eob> and the letter was republished <eol> and covered by the national press, <eob> as well as being translated <eol> into several other languages worldwide. <eob>
But something struck me <eol> about the media attention <eob> that this letter was attracting. <eob>
For something to be front-page news, <eob> given the word "news" itself, <eob> we can assume it must be something <eol> new or something surprising. <eob>
And yet sexual assault <eol> is not something new. <eob>
Sexual assault, along with other <eol> kinds of injustices, <eob> is reported in the media all the time. <eob>
But through the campaign, <eob> these injustices were framed <eol> as not just news stories, <eob> they were firsthand experiences <eol> that had affected real people, <eob> who were creating, with the solidarity of others, <eob> what they needed and had previously lacked: <eob> a platform to speak out, <eob> the reassurance they weren't alone <eol> or to blame for what happened to them <eob> and open discussions that would help <eol> to reduce stigma around the issue. <eob>
The voices of those directly affected <eol> were at the forefront of the story -- <eob> not the voices of journalists <eol> or commentators on social media. <eob>
And that's why the story was news. <eob>
We live in an incredibly interconnected world <eob> with the proliferation <eol> of social media, <eob> which is of course a fantastic resource <eol> for igniting social change. <eob>
But it's also made us increasingly reactive, <eob> from the smallest annoyances of, <eol> "Oh, my train's been delayed," <eob> to the greatest injustices <eol> of war, genocides, terrorist attacks. <eob>
Our default response has become to leap <eol> to react to any kind of grievance <eob> by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging -- <eob> anything to show others that we, too, have reacted. <eob>
The problem with reacting <eol> in this manner en masse <eob> is it can sometimes mean <eol> that we don't actually react at all, <eob> not in the sense of actually <eol> doing anything, anyway. <eob>
It might make ourselves feel better, <eob> like we've contributed <eol> to a group mourning or outrage, <eob> but it doesn't actually change anything. <eob>
And what's more, <eob> it can sometimes drown out the voices <eob> of those directly affected by the injustice, <eob> whose needs must be heard. <eob>
Worrying, too, is the tendency <eol> for some reactions to injustice <eob> to build even more walls, <eob> being quick to point fingers with the hope <eol> of providing easy solutions <eob> to complex problems. <eob>
One British tabloid, <eol> on the publication of my letter, <eob> branded a headline stating, <eob> "Oxford Student Launches Online Campaign to Shame Attacker." <eob> But the campaign never meant <eol> to shame anyone. <eob>
It meant to let people <eol> speak and to make others listen. <eob>
Divisive Twitter trolls <eol> were quick to create even more injustice, <eob> commenting on my attacker's ethnicity or class <eob> to push their own prejudiced <eol> agendas. <eob>
And some even accused <eol> me of feigning the whole thing <eob> to push, and I quote, <eob> my "feminist agenda of man-hating." <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
I know, right? <eob> As if I'm going to be like, "Hey guys! <eob>
Sorry I can't make it, <eob> I'm busy trying to hate <eol> the entire male population <eob> by the time I'm 30. <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I'm almost sure <eob> that these people wouldn't say <eol> the things they say in person. <eob>
But it's as if because <eol> they might be behind a screen, <eob> in the comfort in their own home <eob> when on social media, <eob> people forget that <eol> what they're doing is a public act -- <eob> that other people will be reading <eol> it and be affected by it. <eob>
Returning to my analogy <eol> of getting back on our trains, <eob> another main concern I have <eol> about this noise that escalates <eob> from our online responses to injustice <eob> is that it can very easily slip <eol> into portraying us as the affected party, <eob> which can lead to a sense of defeatism, <eob> a kind of mental barrier <eol> to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change <eob> after a negative situation. <eob>
A couple of months <eol> before the campaign started <eob> or any of this happened to me, <eob> I went to a TEDx event in Oxford, <eob> and I saw Zelda la Grange speak, <eob> the former private secretary <eol> to Nelson Mandela. <eob>
One of the stories she told <eol> really struck me. <eob>
She spoke of when Mandela <eol> was taken to court <eob> by the South African Rugby Union <eob> after he commissioned an inquiry <eol> into sports affairs. <eob>
In the courtroom, <eob> he went up to the South African <eol> Rugby Union's lawyers, <eob> shook them by the hand <eob> and conversed with them, <eol> each in their own language. <eob>
And Zelda wanted to protest, <eob> saying they had no right to his respect <eob> after this injustice they had caused him. <eob>
He turned to her and said, <eob> "You must never allow the enemy <eol> to determine the grounds for battle." <eob>
At the time of hearing these words, <eob> I didn't really know why <eol> they were so important, <eob> but I felt they were, and <eob> I wrote <eob> them down in a notebook <eol> I had on me. <eob>
But I've thought about this line <eol> a lot ever since. <eob>
Revenge, or the expression <eol> of hatred <eob> towards those who have done us injustice <eob> may feel like a human instinct <eol> in the face of wrong, <eob> but we need to break out <eol> of these cycles <eob> if we are to hope <eol> to transform negative events of injustice <eob> into positive social change. <eob>
To do otherwise <eob> continues to let the enemy <eol> determine the grounds for battle, <eob> creates a binary, <eob> where we who have suffered <eol> become the affected, <eob> pitted against them, the perpetrators. <eob>
And just like we got back on our tubes, <eob> we can't let our platforms <eol> for interconnectivity and community <eob> be the places that we settle <eol> for defeat. <eob>
But I don't want to discourage <eol> a social media response, <eob> because I owe the development <eol> of the #NotGuilty campaign <eob> almost entirely to social media. <eob>
But I do want to encourage <eol> a more considered approach <eob> to the way we use it <eol> to respond to injustice. <eob>
The start, I think, <eol> is to ask ourselves two things. <eob>
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice? <eob>
In my case, <eol> there were several answers to this. <eob>
Someone had hurt me <eol> and those who I loved, <eob> under the assumption they wouldn't have <eol> to be held to account <eob> or recognize the damage <eol> they had caused. <eob>
Not only that, but thousands of men <eol> and women suffer every day <eob> from sexual abuse, often in silence, <eob> yet it's still a problem we don't give <eol> the same airtime to as other issues. <eob>
It's still an issue many people <eol> blame victims for. <eob>
Next, ask yourself: How, <eol> in recognizing these reasons, <eob> could I go about reversing them? <eob>
With us, this was holding my attacker <eol> to account -- and many others. <eob>
It was calling them out on the effect <eol> they had caused. <eob>
It was giving airtime to the issue <eol> of sexual assault, <eob> opening up discussions amongst friends, <eol> amongst families, in the media <eob> that had been closed for too long, <eob> and stressing that victims <eol> shouldn't feel to blame <eob> for what happened to them. <eob>
We might still have a long way <eol> to go in solving this problem entirely. <eob>
But in this way, <eob> we can begin to use social media <eol> as an active tool for social justice, <eob> as a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues, <eob> to make those in positions <eol> of authority aware of an issue <eob> by listening to those directly affected by it. <eob>
Because sometimes these questions <eol> don't have easy answers. <eob>
In fact, they rarely do. <eob>
But this doesn't mean we still can't give them <eol> a considered response. <eob>
In situations where you can't go about thinking <eob> how you'd reverse this feeling of injustice, <eob> you can still think, maybe not what you can do, <eob> but what you can not do. <eob>
You can not build further walls by fighting <eol> injustice with more prejudice, <eob> more hatred. <eob>
You can not speak over those directly <eol> affected by an injustice. <eob>
And you can not react to injustice, <eol> only to forget about it the next day, <eob> just because the rest of Twitter <eol> has moved on. <eob>
Sometimes not reacting instantly is, ironically, <eob> the best immediate course of action <eol> we can take. <eob>
Because we might be angry, upset <eol> and energized by injustice, <eob> but let's consider our responses. <eob>
Let us hold people to account, <eol> without descending into a culture <eob> that thrives off shaming <eol> and injustice ourselves. <eob>
Let us remember that distinction, <eob> so often forgotten by internet users, <eob> between criticism and insult. <eob>
Let us not forget to think before we speak, <eob> just because we might have <eol> a screen in front of us. <eob>
And when we create noise <eol> on social media, <eob> let it not drown out the needs of those affected, <eob> but instead let it amplify their voices, <eob> so the internet becomes a place <eol> where you're not the exception <eob> if you speak out about something <eol> that has actually happened to you. <eob>
All these considered approaches to injustice <eob> evoke the very keystones <eol> on which the internet was built: <eob> to network, to have signal, to connect -- <eob> all these terms that imply <eol> bringing people together, <eob> not pushing people apart. <eob>
Because if you look up the word "justice" <eol> in the dictionary, <eob> before punishment, <eob> before administration <eol> of law or judicial authority, <eob> you get: <eob> "The maintenance of what is right." <eob> And I think there are few things <eol> more "right" in this world <eob> than bringing people together, <eob> than unions. <eob>
And if we allow social media <eol> to deliver that, <eob> then it can deliver a very powerful form <eol> of justice, indeed. <eob>
Thank you <eob> very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
One hot October morning, <eob> I got off the all-night train <eob> in Mandalay, <eob> the old royal capital of Burma, <eob> now Myanmar. <eob>
And out on the street, <eol> I ran into a group of rough men <eob> standing beside their bicycle rickshaws. <eob>
And one of them came up <eob> and offered to show me around. <eob>
The price he quoted was outrageous. <eob>
It was less than I would pay <eol> for a bar of chocolate at home. <eob>
So I clambered into his trishaw, <eob> and he began pedaling us slowly <eol> between palaces and pagodas. <eob>
And as he did, he told me <eol> how he had come to the city from his village. <eob>
He'd earned a degree in mathematics. <eob>
His dream was to be a teacher. <eob>
But of course, life is hard <eol> under a military dictatorship, <eob> and so for now, this was the only way <eol> he could make a living. <eob>
Many nights, he told me, <eol> he actually slept in his trishaw <eob> so he could catch the first visitors <eol> off the all-night train. <eob>
And very soon, we found <eol> that in certain ways, <eob> we had so much in common -- <eob> we were both in our 20s, <eob> we were both fascinated <eol> by foreign cultures -- <eob> that he invited me home. <eob>
So we turned off the wide, <eol> crowded streets, <eob> and we began bumping down <eol> rough, wild alleyways. <eob>
There were broken shacks all around. <eob>
I really lost the sense of where I was, <eob> and I realized that anything <eol> could happen to me now. <eob>
I could get mugged or drugged <eob> or something worse. <eob> Nobody would know. <eob>
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut, <eob> which consisted of just one tiny room. <eob>
And then he leaned down, <eob> and reached under his bed. <eob>
And something in me froze. <eob>
I waited to see what he would pull out. <eob>
And finally he extracted a box. <eob>
Inside it was every single letter <eol> he had ever received <eob> from visitors from abroad, <eob> and on some of them he had pasted <eob> little black-and-white worn snapshots <eob> of his new foreign friends. <eob>
So when we said goodbye that night, <eob> I realized he had also shown me <eob> the secret point of travel, <eob> which is to take a plunge, <eob> to go inwardly as well as outwardly <eob> to places you would never go otherwise, <eob> to venture into uncertainty, <eob> ambiguity, <eob> even fear. <eob>
At home, it's dangerously easy <eob> to assume we're on top of things. <eob>
Out in the world, you are reminded <eol> every moment that you're not, <eob> and you can't get to the bottom <eol> of things, either. <eob>
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled," <eob> Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us, <eob> "but only insofar as we are unsettled <eob> is there any hope for us." <eob>
At this conference, we've been lucky enough <eob> to hear some exhilarating <eol> new ideas and discoveries <eob> and, really, about all the ways <eob> in which knowledge is being pushed <eol> excitingly forwards. <eob>
But at some point, knowledge gives out. <eob>
And that is the moment <eob> when your life is truly decided: <eob> you fall in love; <eob> you lose a friend; <eob> the lights go out. <eob>
And it's then, when you're lost <eol> or uneasy or carried out of yourself, <eob> that you find out who you are. <eob>
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss. <eob>
Science has unquestionably made our lives <eob> brighter and longer and healthier. <eob>
And I am forever grateful to the teachers <eol> who showed me the laws of physics <eob> and pointed out that three times <eol> three makes nine. <eob>
I can count that out on my fingers <eob> any time of night or day. <eob>
But when a mathematician tells me <eob> that minus three times minus <eol> three makes nine, <eob> that's a kind of logic <eol> that almost feels like trust. <eob>
The opposite of knowledge, in other words, <eol> isn't always ignorance. <eob>
It can be wonder. <eob> Or mystery. <eob> Possibility. <eob> And in my life, I've found it's the things I don't know <eob> that have lifted me up <eol> and pushed me forwards <eob> much more than the things I do know. <eob>
It's also the things I don't know <eob> that have often brought me closer <eol> to everybody around me. <eob>
For eight straight Novembers, recently, <eob> I traveled every year across Japan <eol> with the Dalai Lama. <eob>
And the one thing he said every day <eob> that most seemed to give people <eol> reassurance and confidence <eob> was, "I don't know." <eob>
"What's going to happen to Tibet?" <eob> "When are we ever <eol> going to get world peace?" <eob> "What's the best way to raise children?" <eob>
"Frankly," says this very wise man, <eob> "I don't know." <eob>
The Nobel Prize-winning economist <eol> Daniel Kahneman <eob> has spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior, <eob> and his conclusion is <eob> that we are always much more confident <eol> of what we think we know <eob> than we should be. <eob>
We have, as he memorably puts it, <eob> an "unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance." <eob> We know -- quote, unquote -- <eol> our team is going to win this weekend, <eob> and we only remember that knowledge <eob> on the rare occasions <eol> when we're right. <eob>
Most of the time, we're in the dark. <eob>
And that's where real intimacy lies. <eob>
Do you know what your lover <eol> is going to do tomorrow? <eob>
Do you want to know? <eob>
The parents of us all, <eol> as some people call them, <eob> Adam and Eve, <eob> could never die, so long as they were eating <eol> from the tree of life. <eob>
But the minute they began nibbling <eob> from the tree of the knowledge <eol> of good and evil, <eob> they fell from their innocence. <eob>
They grew embarrassed and fretful, <eob> self-conscious. <eob>
And they learned, a little too late, perhaps, <eob> that there are certainly some things <eol> that we need to know, <eob> but there are many, many more <eol> that are better left unexplored. <eob>
Now, when I was a kid, <eob> I knew it all, of course. <eob> I had been spending 20 years <eol> in classrooms collecting facts, <eob> and I was actually in the information business, <eob> writing articles for Time Magazine. <eob>
And I took my first real trip <eol> to Japan for two-and-a-half weeks, <eob> and I came back with a 40-page essay <eob> explaining every last detail <eol> about Japan's temples, <eob> its fashions, its baseball games, <eob> its soul. <eob>
But underneath all that, <eob> something that I couldn't understand <eob> so moved me for reasons I couldn't explain to you yet, <eob> that I decided to go and live in Japan. <eob>
And now that I've been there <eol> for 28 years, <eob> I really couldn't tell you very much at all <eob> about my adopted home. <eob>
Which is wonderful, <eob> because it means every day <eol> I'm making some new discovery, <eob> and in the process, <eob> looking around the corner <eol> and seeing the hundred thousand things <eob> I'll never know. <eob>
Knowledge is a priceless gift. <eob>
But the illusion of knowledge <eol> can be more dangerous than ignorance. <eob>
Thinking that you know your lover <eob> or your enemy <eob> can be more treacherous <eob> than acknowledging you'll never know them. <eob>
Every morning in Japan, as the sun <eol> is flooding into our little apartment, <eob> I take great pains not to consult <eol> the weather forecast, <eob> because if I do, <eob> my mind will be overclouded, distracted, <eob> even when the day is bright. <eob>
I've been a full-time writer <eol> now for 34 years. <eob>
And the one thing that I have learned <eob> is that transformation comes <eol> when I'm not in charge, <eob> when I don't know what's coming next, <eob> when I can't assume I am bigger <eol> than everything around me. <eob>
And the same is true in love <eob> or in moments of crisis. <eob>
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again <eob> and we're bumping off the broad, <eol> well-lit streets; <eob> and we're reminded, really, <eol> of the first law of travel <eob> and, therefore, of life: <eob> you're only as strong as your readiness <eol> to surrender. <eob>
In the end, perhaps, <eob> being human <eob> is much more important <eob> than being fully in the know. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"We're declaring war against cancer, <eob> and we will win this war by 2015." <eob>
This is what the US Congress <eol> and the National Cancer Institute declared <eob> just a few years ago, in 2003. <eob>
Now, I don't know about you, <eol> but I don't buy that. <eob>
I don't think we quite won this war yet, <eob> and I don't think anyone <eol> here will question that. <eob>
Now, I will argue that a primary reason <eob> why we're not winning <eol> this war against cancer <eob> is because we're fighting blindly. <eob>
I'm going to start by sharing with you <eol> a story about a good friend of mine. <eob>
His name is Ehud, <eob> and a few years ago, Ehud <eol> was diagnosed with brain cancer. <eob>
And not just any type of brain cancer: <eob> he was diagnosed with one <eol> of the most deadly forms of brain cancer. <eob>
In fact, it was so deadly <eob> that the doctors told him <eol> that they only have 12 months, <eob> and during those 12 months, <eol> they have to find a treatment. <eob>
They have to find a cure, <eob> and if they cannot find <eol> a cure, he will die. <eob>
Now, the good news, they said, <eob> is that there are tons <eol> of different treatments to choose from, <eob> but the bad news is <eob> that in order for them to tell <eol> if a treatment is even working or not, <eob> well, that takes them <eol> about three months or so. <eob>
So they cannot try that many things. <eob>
Well, Ehud is now going <eol> into his first treatment, <eob> and during that first treatment, <eol> just a few days into that treatment, <eob> I'm meeting with him, <eol> and he tells me, "Adam, I think this is working. <eob>
I think we really lucked out here. <eob>
Something is happening. " <eob>
And I ask him, "Really? <eob>
How do you know that, Ehud? " <eob>
And he says, "Well, I feel <eol> so terrible inside. <eob>
Something's gotta be working up there. <eob>
It just has to." <eob>
Well, unfortunately, three months later, <eol> we got the news, it didn't work. <eob>
And so Ehud goes <eol> into his second treatment. <eob>
And again, the same story. <eob> "It feels so bad, something's gotta be working there." <eob> And then three months later, <eol> again we get bad news. <eob>
Ehud is going into his third treatment, <eol> and then his fourth treatment. <eob>
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies. <eob>
Now, when someone really close <eol> to you is going through such a huge struggle, <eob> you get really swamped with emotions. <eob>
A lot of things <eol> are going through your head. <eob>
For me, it was mostly outrage. <eob>
I was just outraged that, how come <eol> this is the best that we can offer? <eob>
And I started looking more <eol> and more into this. <eob>
As it turns out, this is not just the best <eol> that doctors could offer Ehud. <eob> It's not just the best doctors could <eol> offer patients with brain cancer generally. <eob>
We're actually not doing that well <eol> all across the board with cancer. <eob>
I picked up one of those statistics, <eob> and I'm sure some of you <eol> have seen those statistics before. <eob>
This is going to show you here <eol> how many patients actually died of cancer, <eob> in this case females in the United States, <eob> ever since the 1930s. <eob>
You'll notice that there aren't <eol> that many things that have changed. <eob>
It's still a huge issue. <eob>
You'll see a few changes, though. <eob>
You'll see lung cancer, <eol> for example, on the rise. <eob> Thank you, cigarettes. <eob> And you'll also see <eol> that, for example, stomach cancer <eob> once used to be one of the biggest <eol> killers of all cancers, <eob> is essentially eliminated. <eob> Now, why is that? <eob>
Anyone knows, by the way? <eob> Why is it that humanity <eol> is no longer struck by stomach cancer? <eob>
What was the huge, huge medical technology breakthrough <eob> that came to our world <eol> that saved humanity from stomach cancer? <eob>
Was it maybe a new drug, <eol> or a better diagnostic? <eob> You guys are right, yeah. <eob> It's the invention of the refrigerator, <eob> and the fact that we're no longer <eol> eating spoiled meats. <eob>
So the best thing that happened <eol> to us so far <eob> in the medical arena in cancer research <eob> is the fact that the refrigerator was invented. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And so -- yeah, I know. <eob> We're not doing so well here. <eob>
I don't want to miniaturize the progress <eob> and everything that's been done in cancer research. <eob>
Look, there is like 50-plus years <eol> of good cancer research <eob> that discovered major, major things <eol> that taught us about cancer. <eob>
But all that said, <eob> we have a lot of heavy lifting <eol> to still do ahead of us. <eob>
Again, I will argue that the primary <eol> reason why this is the case, <eob> why we have not done <eol> that remarkably well, <eob> is really we're fighting blindly here. <eob>
And this is where medical <eol> imaging comes in. <eob> This is where my own work comes in. <eob>
And so to give you a sense <eol> of the best medical imaging <eob> that's offered today <eol> to brain cancer patients, <eob> or actually generally <eol> to all cancer patients, <eob> take a look at this PET scan right here. <eob> Let's see. There we go. <eob>
So this is a PET / CT scan, <eol> and what you'll see in this PET / CT scan <eob> is the CT scan <eob> will show you <eol> where the bones are, <eob> and the PET scan <eob> will show you <eol> where tumors are. <eob>
Now, what you can see here <eob> is essentially a sugar molecule <eob> that was added a small little tag <eob> that is signaling to us <eol> outside of the body, <eob> "Hey, I'm here." <eob> And those sugar molecules <eol> are injected into these patients by the billions, <eob> and they're going all over the body <eob> looking for cells that are hungry for sugar. <eob>
You'll see that the heart, <eol> for example, lights up there. <eob> That's because the heart needs <eol> a lot of sugar. <eob>
You'll also see that the bladder <eol> lights up there. <eob> That's because the bladder is the thing <eol> that's clearing <eob> the sugar away from our body. <eob>
And then you'll see a few other hot spots, <eob> and these are in fact the tumors. <eob>
Now, this is a really <eol> a wonderful technology. <eob>
For the first time it allowed us <eol> to look into someone's body <eob> without picking up each <eol> and every one of the cells <eob> and putting them under the microscope, <eob> but in a noninvasive way allowing us <eol> to look into someone's body <eob> and ask, "Hey, has the cancer metastasized? <eob>
Where is it?" <eob> And the PET scans here <eol> are showing you very clearly <eob> where are these hot spots, <eol> where is the tumor. <eob>
So as miraculous as this might seem, <eob> unfortunately, well, it's not that great. <eob>
You see, those small little <eol> hot spots there. <eob>
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells <eol> are in any one of these tumors? <eob>
So it's about 100 million cancer cells, <eob> and let me make sure <eol> that this number sunk in. <eob>
In each and every one <eol> of these small little blips <eob> that you're seeing on the image, <eob> there needs to be <eol> at least 100 million cancer cells <eob> in order for it to be detected. <eob>
Now, if that seemed to you <eol> like a very large number, <eob> it is a very large number. <eob>
This is in fact an incredibly large number, <eob> because what we really need <eol> in order to pick up something early enough <eob> to do something about it, <eol> to do something meaningful about it, <eob> well, we need to pick up tumors <eol> that are a thousand cells in size, <eob> and ideally just a handful <eol> of cells in size. <eob>
So we're clearly pretty <eol> far away from this. <eob>
So we're going to play <eol> a little experiment here. <eob>
I'm going to ask each of you <eol> to now play and imagine <eob> that you are brain surgeons. <eob>
And you guys are now at an operating room, <eob> and there's a patient <eol> in front of you, <eob> and your task is to make sure <eol> that the tumor is out. <eob>
So you're looking down at the patient, <eob> the skin and the skull <eol> have already been removed, <eob> so you're looking at the brain. <eob>
And all you know about this patient <eob> is that there's a tumor about the size <eol> of a golf ball or so <eob> in the right frontal lobe <eol> of this person's brain. <eob>
And that's more or less it. <eob>
So you're looking down, and unfortunately <eol> everything looks the same, <eob> because brain cancer tissue <eol> and healthy brain tissue <eob> really just look the same. <eob>
And so you're going in with your thumb, <eob> and you start to press <eol> a little bit on the brain, <eob> because tumors tend <eol> to be a little harder, stiffer, <eob> and so you go in and go <eol> a little bit like this and say, <eob> "It seems like the tumor is right there." <eob> Then you take out your knife <eol> and start cutting the tumor <eob> piece by piece by piece. <eob>
And as you're taking the tumor out, <eob> then you're getting to a stage <eol> where you think, <eob> "Alright, I'm done. <eob>
I took out everything. <eob> "And at this stage, if that's — <eob> so far everything sounded, like, pretty crazy — <eob> you're now about to face <eol> the most challenging decision of your life here. <eob>
Because now you need to decide, <eob> should I stop here and let this patient go, <eob> risking that there might be <eol> some leftover cancer cells behind <eob> that I just couldn't see, <eob> or should I take away <eol> some extra margins, <eob> typically about an inch or so around the tumor <eob> just to be sure that I removed everything? <eob>
So this is not a simple decision to make, <eob> and unfortunately this is the decision <eob> that brain cancer surgeons <eol> have to take every single day <eob> as they're seeing their patients. <eob>
And so I remember talking <eol> to a few friends of mine in the lab, <eob> and we say, "Boy, there's got to be a better way." <eob> But not just like you tell a friend <eol> that there's got to be a better way. <eob>
There's just got to be a better way here. <eob>
This is just incredible. <eob>
And so we looked back. <eob>
Remember those PET scans I told you <eol> about, the sugar and so on. <eob>
We said, hey, how about instead <eol> of using sugar molecules, <eob> let's maybe take tiny, tiny little particles <eol> made of gold, <eob> and let's program them <eol> with some interesting chemistry around them. <eob>
Let's program them <eol> to look for cancer cells. <eob>
And then we will inject these gold particles <eob> into these patients by the billions again, <eob> and we'll have them go all over the body, <eob> and just like secret agents, if you will, <eob> go and walk by every single cell in our body <eob> and knock on the door of that cell, <eob> and ask, "Are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell? <eob>
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on. <eob>
If you're a cancer cell, we're sticking <eol> in and shining out <eob> and telling us, "Hey, look at me, I'm here." <eob> And they'll do it through some interesting cameras <eob> that we developed in the lab. <eob>
And once we see that, maybe <eol> we can guide brain cancer surgeons <eob> towards taking only the tumor and leaving <eol> the healthy brain alone. <eob>
And so we've tested that, <eol> and boy, this works well. <eob>
So I'm going to show you an example now. <eob>
What you're looking at here <eob> is an image of a mouse's brain, <eob> and we've implanted into this mouse's brain <eob> a small little tumor. <eob>
And so this tumor is now growing <eol> in this mouse's brain, <eob> and then we've taken a doctor <eol> and asked the doctor <eob> to please operate on the mouse <eol> as if that was a patient, <eob> and take out piece by piece <eol> out of the tumor. <eob>
And while he's doing that, <eob> we're going to take images <eol> to see where the gold particles are. <eob>
And so we're going to first start <eob> by injecting these gold particles <eol> into this mouse, <eob> and we're going to see <eol> right here at the very left there <eob> that image at the bottom <eob> is the image that shows <eol> where the gold particles are. <eob>
The nice thing is that these gold particles <eob> actually made it all the way to the tumor, <eob> and then they shine out and tell us, <eol> "Hey, we're here. <eob>
Here's the tumor. " <eob>
So now we can see the tumor, <eob> but we're not showing this <eol> to the doctor yet. <eob>
We're asking the doctor, now <eol> please start cutting away the tumor, <eob> and you'll see here the doctor just took <eol> the first quadrant of the tumor <eob> and you see that first quadrant is now missing. <eob>
The doctor then took the second quadrant, the third, <eob> and now it appears to be everything. <eob>
And so at this stage, the doctor <eol> came back to us and said, <eob> "Alright, I'm done. <eob>
What do you want me to do? <eob>
Should I keep things as they are <eob> or do you want me to take <eol> some extra margins around?" <eob>
And then we said, "Well, hang on." <eob> We told the doctor, <eol> "You've missed those two spots, <eob> so rather than taking huge margins around, <eob> only take out those tiny little areas. <eob>
Take them out, and then <eol> let's take a look." <eob>
And so the doctor took them away, <eol> and lo and behold, <eob> the cancer is now completely gone. <eob>
Now, the important thing <eob> is that it's not just that the cancer <eol> is completely gone <eob> from this person's brain, <eob> or from this mouse's brain. <eob>
The most important thing <eob> is that we did not have to take <eol> huge amounts of healthy brain <eob> in the process. <eob>
And so now we can actually imagine a world <eob> where doctors and surgeons, <eol> as they take away a tumor, <eob> they actually know what to take out, <eob> and they no longer have to guess <eol> with their thumb. <eob>
Now, here's why it's extremely important <eol> to take those tiny little leftover tumors. <eob>
Those leftover tumors, even if it's just <eol> a handful of cells, <eob> they will grow to recur the tumor, <eob> for the tumor to come back. <eob>
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent <eob> of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail <eob> is because of those small little extra margins <eol> that were left positive, <eob> those small little leftover tumors <eol> that were left there. <eob>
So this is clearly very nice, <eob> but what I really want to share with you <eol> is where I think we're heading from here. <eob>
And so in my lab at Stanford, <eob> my students and I are asking, <eol> what should we be working on now? <eob>
And I think where medical <eol> imaging is heading to <eob> is the ability to look into the human body <eob> and actually see each and every one <eol> of these cells separately. <eob>
The ability like this would allow us <eob> to actually pick up tumors way, <eol> way earlier in the process, <eob> way before it's 100 million cells inside, <eol> so we can actually do something about it. <eob>
An ability to see each and every one <eol> of the cells might also allow us <eob> to ask insightful questions. <eob>
So in the lab, we are now <eol> getting to a point <eob> where we can actually start asking <eol> these cancer cells real questions, <eob> like, for example, are you responding <eol> to the treatment we are giving you or not? <eob>
So if you're not responding, we'll know <eol> to stop the treatment right away, <eob> days into the treatment, <eol> not three months. <eob>
And so also for patients like Ehud <eob> that are going through these nasty, <eol> nasty chemotherapy drugs, <eob> for them not to suffer <eob> through those horrendous side effects <eol> of the drugs <eob> when the drugs are in fact not even helping them. <eob>
So to be frank here, <eob> we're pretty far away from winning <eol> the war against cancer, <eob> just to be realistic. <eob>
But at least I am hopeful <eob> that we should be able to fight <eol> this war with better medical imaging techniques <eob> in the way that is not blind. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm a painter. <eob> I make large-scale figurative paintings, <eob> which means I paint people <eob> like this. <eob>
But I'm here tonight <eol> to tell you about something personal <eob> that changed my work <eol> and my perspective. <eob>
It's something we all go through, <eob> and my hope is that my experience <eol> may be helpful to somebody. <eob>
To give you some background on me, <eol> I grew up the youngest of eight. <eob>
Yes, eight kids in my family. <eob>
I have six older brothers and a sister. <eob>
To give you a sense of what that's like, <eob> when my family went on vacation, <eob> we had a bus. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My supermom would drive us all over town <eob> to our various after-school activities -- <eob> not in the bus. <eob>
We had a regular car, too. <eob>
She would take me to art classes, <eob> and not just one or two. <eob>
She took me to every available art class <eol> from when I was eight to 16, <eob> because that's all I wanted to do. <eob>
She even took a class <eol> with me in New York City. <eob>
Now, being the youngest of eight, <eol> I learned a few survival skills. <eob>
Rule number one: <eob> don't let your big brother <eol> see you do anything stupid. <eob>
So I learned to be quiet and neat <eob> and careful to follow the rules <eol> and stay in line. <eob>
But painting was where I made the rules. <eob>
That was my private world. <eob>
By 14, I knew I really wanted <eol> to be an artist. <eob>
My big plan was to be a waitress <eol> to support my painting. <eob>
So I continued honing my skills. <eob>
I went to graduate school <eol> and I got an MFA, <eob> and at my first solo show, <eol> my brother asked me, <eob> "What do all these red dots <eol> mean next to the paintings?" <eob> Nobody was more surprised than me. <eob>
The red dots meant <eol> that the paintings were sold <eob> and that I'd be able to pay my rent <eob> with painting. <eob>
Now, my apartment had four electrical outlets, <eob> and I couldn't use a microwave <eol> and a toaster at the same time, <eob> but still, I could pay my rent. <eob>
So I was very happy. <eob>
Here's a painting <eol> from back around that time. <eob>
I needed it to be <eol> as realistic as possible. <eob> It had to be specific and believable. <eob>
This was the place where I was isolated <eol> and in total control. <eob>
Since then, I've made a career <eol> of painting people in water. <eob>
Bathtubs and showers were <eol> the perfect enclosed environment. <eob>
It was intimate and private, <eob> and water was this complicated <eol> challenge that kept me busy for a decade. <eob>
I made about 200 of these paintings, <eob> some of them six to eight feet, <eob> like this <eob> one. <eob>
For this painting, I mixed flour <eol> in with the bathwater to make it cloudy <eob> and I floated cooking oil <eol> on the surface <eob> and stuck a girl in it, <eob> and when I lit it up, <eob> it was so beautiful <eol> I couldn't wait to paint it. <eob>
I was driven by this kind <eol> of impulsive curiosity, <eob> always looking for something new to add: <eob> vinyl, steam, glass. <eob>
I once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair <eob> just to see what that would look like. <eob>
Don't do that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So it was going well. <eob> I was finding my way. <eob>
I was eager and motivated <eob> and surrounded by artists, <eob> always going to openings and events. <eob>
I was having some success <eol> and recognition <eob> and I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets. <eob>
My mom and I would stay up very late <eob> talking about our latest ideas <eol> and inspiring each other. <eob>
She made beautiful pottery. <eob>
I have a friend named Bo who made this painting <eob> of his wife and I dancing <eol> by the ocean, <eob> and he called it "The Light Years." <eob> I asked him what that meant, and he said, <eob> "Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, <eol> you're no longer a child, <eob> but you're not yet weighed down <eol> by the responsibilities of life." <eob> That was it. <eob>
It was the light years. <eob> On October 8, 2011, <eob> the light years came to an end. <eob>
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer. <eob>
It had spread to her bones, <eol> and it was in her brain. <eob>
When she told me this, I fell to my knees. <eob>
I totally lost it. <eob>
And when I got myself together <eol> and I looked at her, <eob> I realized, this isn't about me. <eob> This is about figuring out how to help her. <eob>
My father is a doctor, <eob> and so we had a great advantage <eol> having him in charge, <eob> and he did a beautiful job taking care of her. <eob>
But I, too, wanted to do <eol> everything I could to help, <eob> so I wanted to try everything. <eob> We all did. <eob> I researched alternative medicines, <eob> diets, juicing, acupuncture. <eob>
Finally, I asked her, <eob> "Is this what you want me to do?" <eob> And she said, "No." <eob> She said, "Pace yourself. <eob>
I'm going to need you later. " <eob>
She knew what was happening, <eob> and she knew what the doctors <eob> and the experts and the internet didn't know: <eob> how she wanted to go through this. <eob>
I just needed to ask her. <eob>
I realized that if I tried to fix it, <eob> I would miss it. <eob>
So I just started to be with her, <eob> whatever that meant <eol> and whatever situation came up, <eob> just really listen to her. <eob>
If before I was resisting, <eol> then now I was surrendering, <eob> giving up trying to control the uncontrollable <eob> and just being there in it with her. <eob>
Time slowed down, <eob> and the date was irrelevant. <eob>
We developed a routine. <eob> Early each morning I would crawl <eol> into bed with her and sleep with her. <eob>
My brother would come for breakfast <eob> and we'd be so glad to hear his car <eol> coming up the driveway. <eob>
So I'd help her up and take both her hands <eob> and help her walk to the kitchen. <eob>
She had this huge mug she made <eob> she loved to drink her coffee out of, <eob> and she loved Irish soda <eol> bread for breakfast. <eob>
Afterwards was the shower, <eob> and she loved this part. <eob>
She loved the warm water, <eob> so I made this as indulgent as I could, <eob> like a spa. <eob>
My sister would help sometimes. <eob>
We had warm towels <eob> and slippers ready immediately <eob> so she never got cold for a second. <eob>
I'd blow-dry her hair. <eob>
My brothers would come in the evenings <eol> and bring their kids, <eob> and that was the highlight of her day. <eob>
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair, <eob> and she didn't want to eat so much, <eob> and she used the tiniest little teacup <eol> we could find to drink her coffee. <eob>
I couldn't support her myself anymore, <eob> so we hired an aide <eol> to help me with the showers. <eob>
These simple daily activities <eob> became our sacred ritual, <eob> and we repeated them day after day <eob> as the cancer grew. <eob>
It was humbling and painful <eob> and exactly where I wanted to be. <eob>
We called this time "the beautiful awful." <eob>
She died on October 26, 2012. <eob>
It was a year and three weeks <eol> after her diagnosis. <eob> She was gone. <eob> My brothers, sister, and father and I <eob> all came together in this supportive <eol> and attentive way. <eob>
It was as though our whole <eol> family dynamic <eob> and all our established roles vanished <eob> and we were just all together <eol> in this unknown, <eob> feeling the same thing <eob> and taking care of each other. <eob>
I'm so grateful for them. <eob>
As someone who spends most <eol> of my time alone in a studio working, <eob> I had no idea that this kind of connection <eob> could be so important, so healing. <eob>
This was the most important thing. <eob>
It was what I always wanted. <eob>
So after the funeral, it was time for me <eol> to go back to my studio. <eob>
So I packed up my car <eol> and I drove back to Brooklyn, <eob> and painting is what I've always done, <eol> so that's what I did. <eob>
And here's what happened. <eob>
It's like a release of everything <eol> that was unraveling in me. <eob>
That safe, very, very carefully <eol> rendered safe place <eob> that I created in all my other paintings, <eob> it was a myth. <eob>
It didn't work. <eob>
And I was afraid, <eol> because I didn't want to paint anymore. <eob>
So I went into the woods. <eob>
I thought, I'll try that, going outside. <eob>
I got my paints, and I wasn't <eol> a landscape painter, <eob> but I wasn't really much of any <eol> kind of painter at all, <eob> so I had no attachment, no expectation, <eob> which allowed me <eol> to be reckless and free. <eob>
I actually left one of these wet paintings <eob> outside overnight <eob> next to a light in the woods. <eob>
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs. <eob>
But I didn't care. <eob>
It didn't matter. It didn't matter. <eob>
I took all these paintings <eol> back to my studio, <eob> and scraped them, and carved into them, <eob> and poured paint thinner on them, <eob> put more paint on top, drew on them. <eob>
I had no plan, <eob> but I was watching what was happening. <eob>
This is the one with all the bugs in it. <eob>
I wasn't trying to represent a real space. <eob> It was the chaos and the imperfections <eol> that were fascinating me, <eob> and something started to happen. <eob>
I got curious again. <eob>
This is another one from the woods. <eob>
There was a caveat now, though. <eob>
I couldn't be controlling <eol> the paint like I used to. <eob>
It had to be <eol> about implying and suggesting, <eob> not explaining or describing. <eob>
And that imperfect, chaotic, <eol> turbulent surface <eob> is what told the story. <eob>
I started to be as curious <eol> as I was when I was a student. <eob>
So the next thing was I wanted <eol> to put figures in these paintings, people, <eob> and I loved this new environment, <eob> so I wanted to have both people <eol> and this atmosphere. <eob>
When the idea hit me of how to do this, <eob> I got kind of nauseous and dizzy, <eob> which is really just adrenaline, probably, <eob> but for me it's a really good sign. <eob>
And so now I want to show you <eol> what I've been working on. <eob>
It's something I haven't shown yet, <eol> and it's like a preview, I guess, <eob> of my upcoming show, <eob> what I have so far. <eob>
Expansive space <eob> instead of the isolated bathtub. <eob>
I'm going outside instead of inside. <eob>
Loosening control, <eob> savoring the imperfections, <eob> allowing the -- <eob> allowing the imperfections. <eob>
And in that imperfection, <eob> you can find a vulnerability. <eob>
I could feel my deepest intention, <eol> what matters most to me, <eob> that human connection <eob> that can happen in a space <eol> where there's no resisting or controlling. <eob>
I want to make paintings about that. <eob>
So here's what I learned. <eob>
We're all going to have <eol> big losses in our lives, <eob> maybe a job or a career, <eob> relationships, love, our youth. <eob>
We're going to lose our health, <eob> people we love. <eob>
These kinds of losses <eol> are out of our control. <eob>
They're unpredictable, <eob> and they bring us to our knees. <eob>
And so I say, let them. <eob>
Fall to your knees. Be humbled. <eob> Let go of trying to change it <eob> or even wanting it to be different. <eob> It just is. <eob> And then there's space, <eob> and in that space feel your vulnerability, <eob> what matters most to you, <eob> your deepest intention. <eob>
And be curious to connect <eob> to what and who is really here, <eob> awake and alive. <eob>
It's what we all want. <eob>
Let's take the opportunity <eol> to find something beautiful <eob> in the unknown, in the unpredictable, <eob> and even in the awful. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Have you ever noticed <eol> when you ask someone to talk <eob> about a change they're making <eol> for the better in their personal lives, <eob> they're often really energetic? <eob>
Whether it's training for a marathon, <eob> picking up an old hobby, <eob> or learning a new skill, <eob> for most people, <eob> self-transformation projects <eol> occupy a very positive emotional space. <eob>
Self-transformation is empowering, <eob> energizing, even exhilarating. <eob>
I mean just take a look at some <eol> of the titles of self-help books: <eob> "Awaken the Giant Within," <eob> "Practicing the Power of Now," <eob> or here's a great one we can all relate to, <eob> "You are a Badass: <eob> How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness <eol> and Start Living an Awesome Life." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When it comes to self-transformation, <eob> you can't help but get a sense <eol> of the excitement. <eob>
But there's another type of transformation <eob> that occupies a very different emotional space. <eob>
The transformation of organizations. <eob>
If you're like most people, <eob> when you hear the words "Our organization <eol> is going to start a transformation," <eob> you're thinking, "Uh-oh." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Layoffs." <eob> The blood drains from your face, <eob> your mind goes into overdrive, <eob> frantically searching for some <eol> place to run and hide. <eob>
Well, you can run, <eob> but you really can't hide. <eob>
Most of us spend <eol> the majority of our waking hours <eob> involved in organizations. <eob>
And due to changes in globalization, <eob> changes due to advances in technology <eob> and other factors, <eob> the reality is our organizations <eol> are constantly having to adapt. <eob>
In fact, <eob> I call this the era <eol> of "always-on" transformation. <eob>
When I shared this idea <eol> with my wife Nicola, <eob> she said, "Always-on transformation? <eob>
That sounds exhausting." <eob> And that may be exactly <eol> what you're thinking -- <eob> and you would be right. <eob>
Particularly if we continue <eol> to approach the transformation of organizations <eob> the way we always have been. <eob>
But because we can't hide, <eob> we need to sort out two things. <eob>
First, <eob> why is transformation so exhausting? <eob>
And second, how do we fix it? <eob>
First of all, <eob> let's acknowledge that change is hard. <eob>
People naturally resist change, <eob> especially when it's imposed on them. <eob>
But there are things that organizations <eol> do that make change even harder <eob> and more exhausting for people <eol> than it needs to be. <eob>
First of all, <eob> leaders often wait too long to act. <eob>
As a result, <eob> everything is happening in crisis mode. <eob>
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting. <eob>
Or, given the urgency, <eob> what they'll do is they'll just focus <eol> on the short-term results, <eob> but that doesn't give <eol> any hope for the future. <eob>
Or they'll just take <eol> a superficial, one-off approach, <eob> hoping that they can return back <eol> to business as usual <eob> as soon as the crisis is over. <eob>
This kind of approach <eob> is kind of the way some students <eol> approach preparing for standardized tests. <eob>
In order to get test scores to go up, <eob> teachers will end up teaching to the test. <eob>
Now, that approach can work; <eob> test results often do go up. <eob>
But it fails the fundamental goal <eol> of education: <eob> to prepare students to succeed <eol> over the long term. <eob>
So given these obstacles, <eob> what can we do <eob> to transform the way <eol> we transform organizations <eob> so rather than being exhausting, <eob> it's actually empowering and energizing? <eob>
To do that, we need to focus <eol> on five strategic imperatives, <eob> all of which have one thing in common: <eob> putting people first. <eob>
The first imperative for <eob> putting people first <eob> is to inspire through purpose. <eob>
Most transformations have financial <eol> and operational goals. <eob>
These are important <eol> and they can be energizing to leaders, <eob> but they tend not to be very motivating <eol> to most people in the organization. <eob>
To motivate more broadly, <eob> the transformation needs to connect <eol> with a deeper sense of purpose. <eob>
Take LEGO. <eob> The LEGO Group has become <eol> an extraordinary global company. <eob>
Under their very capable leadership, <eob> they've actually undergone <eol> a series of transformations. <eob>
While each of these has had <eol> a very specific focus, <eob> the North Star, <eob> linking and guiding all of them, <eob> has been Lego's powerful purpose: <eob> inspire and develop the builders <eol> of tomorrow. <eob> Expanding globally? <eob> It's not about increasing sales, <eob> but about giving millions of additional <eol> children access to LEGO building bricks. <eob> Investment and innovation? <eob> It's not about developing new products, <eob> but about enabling more children <eob> to experience the joy of learning through play. <eob>
Not surprisingly, <eob> that deep sense of purpose tends <eol> to be highly motivating to LEGO's people. <eob>
The second imperative for <eob> putting people first <eob> is to go all in. <eob>
Too many transformations <eob> are nothing more than head-count <eol> cutting exercises; <eob> layoffs under the guise of transformation. <eob>
In the face of relentless competition, <eob> it may well be that you will have <eol> to take the painful decision <eob> to downsize the organization, <eob> just as you may have to lose some weight <eol> in order to run a marathon. <eob>
But losing weight alone <eob> will not get you across the finish line <eol> with a winning time. <eob>
To win <eob> you need to go all in. <eob>
You need to go all in. <eob>
Rather than just cutting costs, <eob> you need to think about initiatives <eob> that will enable you to win <eol> in the medium term, <eob> initiatives to drive growth, <eob> actions that will fundamentally change <eol> the way the company operates, <eob> and very importantly, <eob> investments to develop the leadership <eol> and the talent. <eob>
The third imperative for <eob> putting people first <eob> is to enable people with the capabilities <eob> that they need to succeed <eol> during the transformation and beyond. <eob>
Over the years I've competed <eol> in a number of triathlons. <eob>
You know, frankly, I'm not that good, <eob> but I do have one distinct capability; <eob> I am remarkably fast at finding my bike. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
By the time I finish the swim, <eob> almost all the bikes are already gone. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Real triathletes know that each leg -- <eob> the swim, the bike, the run -- <eob> really requires different capabilities, <eob> different tools, <eob> different skills, different techniques. <eob>
Likewise when we transform organizations, <eob> we need to be sure that we're giving our people <eob> the skills and the tools <eol> they need along the way. <eob>
Chronos, <eob> a global software company, <eob> recognized the need to transfer <eol> from building products -- <eob> software products -- <eob> to building software as a service. <eob>
To enable its people <eol> to take that transformation, <eob> first of all they invested in new tools <eob> that would enable their employees <eol> to monitor the usage of the features <eob> as well as customer satisfaction <eol> with the new service. <eob>
They also invested in skill development, <eob> so that their employees would be able <eob> to resolve customer service problems on the spot. <eob>
And very importantly, <eob> they also reinforced <eol> the collaborative behaviors that would be required <eob> to deliver an end-to-end seamless customer experience. <eob>
Because of these investments, <eob> rather than feeling overwhelmed <eol> by the transformation, <eob> Chronos employees <eol> actually felt energized <eob> and empowered in their new roles. <eob>
In the era of "always-on" transformation, <eob> change is a constant. <eob>
My fourth imperative therefore <eob> is to instill a culture <eol> of continuous learning. <eob>
When Satya Nadella <eol> became the CEO of Microsoft <eob> in February 2014, <eob> he embarked on an ambitious <eol> transformation journey <eob> to prepare the company to compete <eol> in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. <eob>
This included changes to strategy, <eob> the organization <eob> and very importantly, <eob> the culture. <eob>
Microsoft's culture at the time <eol> was one of silos and internal competition -- <eob> not exactly conducive to learning. <eob>
Nadella took this head-on. <eob>
He rallied his leadership <eol> around his vision <eob> for a living, learning culture, <eob> shifting from a fixed mindset, <eob> where your role was to show up <eol> as the smartest person in the room, <eob> to a growth mindset, <eob> where your role was to listen, <eol> to learn and to bring out the best in people. <eob>
Well, early days, <eob> Microsoft employees already noticed <eol> this shift in the culture — <eob> clear evidence of Microsoft <eob> putting people first. <eob>
My fifth and final imperative <eol> is specifically for leaders. <eob>
In a transformation, <eob> a leader needs <eol> to have a vision, <eob> a clear road map with milestones, <eob> and then you need to hold people <eol> accountable for results. <eob>
In other words, you need to be directive. <eob>
But in order to capture <eol> the hearts and minds of people, <eob> you also need to be inclusive. <eob>
Inclusive leadership is critical to <eob> putting people first. <eob>
I live in the San Francisco Bay area. <eob>
And right now, <eob> our basketball team is the best <eol> in the league. <eob>
We won the 2015 championship, <eob> and we're favored to win again this year. <eob>
There are many explanations for this. <eob>
They have some fabulous players, <eob> but one of the key reasons <eob> is their head coach, Steve Kerr, <eol> is an inclusive leader. <eob>
When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014, <eob> the Warriors were looking <eol> for a major transformation. <eob>
They hadn't won a national champions <eol>hip since 1975. <eob>
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision, <eob> and he immediately got to work. <eob>
From the outset, <eob> he reached out and engaged the players <eol> and the staff. <eob>
He created an environment <eol> of open debate and solicited suggestions. <eob>
During games he would often ask, <eob> "What are you seeing that I'm missing?" <eob>
One the best examples of this came <eol> in game four of the 2015 finals. <eob>
The Warriors were down two games to one <eob> when Kerr made the decision <eol> to change the starting lineup; <eob> a bold move by any measure. <eob> The Warriors won the game <eol> and went on to win the championship. <eob>
And it is widely viewed <eob> that that move was the pivotal move <eol> in their victory. <eob>
Interestingly, it wasn't <eol> actually Kerr's idea. <eob>
It was the idea of his 28-year-old assistant, <eol> Nick U'Ren. <eob>
Because of Kerr's leadership style, <eob> U'Ren felt comfortable <eol> bringing the idea forward. <eob>
And Kerr not only listened, <eob> but he implemented the idea <eob> and then afterwards, <eob> gave U'Ren all the credit -- <eob> actions all consistent with Kerr's <eol> highly inclusive approach to leadership. <eob>
In the era of "always-on" transformation, <eob> organizations are always going to be transforming. <eob>
But doing so does not <eol> have to be exhausting. <eob>
We owe it to ourselves, <eob> to our organizations <eob> and to society more broadly <eob> to boldly transform <eol> our approach to transformation. <eob>
To do that, <eob> we need to start <eob> putting people first. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars" <eol> first hit the airwaves, <eob> that is not what it looked like. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And the next day they were telling us <eob> the finer points of a good feather step. <eob>
And this blew our minds. <eob>
I mean, all of the ballroom dance <eol> geeking out that we had always done <eob> on why salsa worked differently <eol> than the competitive rumba <eob> and why tango traveled unlike the waltz, <eob> all of that just hit the public consciousness, <eob> and it changed everything. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But running parallel <eol> to this excitement, <eob> the excitement that suddenly, somehow, we were cool -- <eob> there was also this reservation. <eob>
Why this and why now? <eob>
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I would get together <eol> for training seminars <eob> or just for fun, <eob> we'd toss each other <eol> around, mix it up, <eob> take a break from having <eol> to lead all the time. <eob>
We even came up with a system <eol> for switching lead and follow <eob> while we were dancing, <eob> as a way of taking turns and playing fair. <eob>
It wasn't until we used that system <eol> as part of a performance <eob> in a small festival <eob> that we got an important tap on the shoulder. <eob>
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge <eol> and director of a playwright center, <eob> pulled us aside after the show and said, <eob> "Do you have any idea <eol> how political that was?" <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So that began an eight-year collaboration <eol> to create a play <eob> which not only further developed <eol> our system for switching <eob> but also explored the impact <eol> of being locked into a single role, <eob> and what's worse, <eob> being defined by that single role. <eob>
TC: Because, of course, <eob> classic Latin and ballroom <eol> dancing isn't just a system of dancing; <eob> it's a way of thinking, of being, <eob> of relating to each other <eob> that captured a whole period's values. <eob>
There's one thing <eol> that stayed consistent, though: <eob> the man leads <eob> and the woman follows. <eob>
So street salsa, championship tango, <eol> it's all the same -- <eob> he leads, she follows. <eob>
So this was gender training. <eob>
You weren't just learning to dance -- <eob> you were learning to "man" and to "woman." <eob> It's a relic. <eob>
And in the way of relics, <eol> you don't throw it out, <eob> but you need to know <eol> that this is the past. <eob>
This isn't the present. <eob>
It's like Shakespeare: respect it, <eol> revive it -- great! <eob>
But know that this is history. <eob>
This doesn't represent how we think today. <eob>
So we asked ourselves: <eob> If you strip it all down, <eob> what is at the core of partner dancing? <eob>
JF: Well, the core principle <eol> of partner dancing <eob> is that one person leads, <eol> the other one follows. <eob>
The machine works the same, regardless of <eol> who's playing which role. <eob> The physics of movement doesn't <eol> really give a crap about your gender. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So if we were to update the existing form, <eob> we would need to make it <eol> more representative <eob> of how we interact here, now, in 2015. <eob>
When you watch ballroom, <eol> don't just watch what's there. <eob>
Watch what's not. <eob>
The couple is always only a man <eol> and a woman. <eob> Together. <eob> Only. <eob> Ever. <eob> So, same-sex <eol> and gender nonconformist couples just disappear. <eob>
In most mainstream international ballroom <eol> competitions, <eob> same-sex couples <eol> are rarely recognized on the floor, <eob> and in many cases, <eob> the rules prohibit them completely. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> TC: Try this: Google-image, <eol> "professional Latin dancer," <eob> and then look for an actual Latino person. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> There are no black people, <eol> there are no Asians, <eob> no mixed-race couples, <eob> so basically, non-white <eol> people just disappeared. <eob>
Even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm -- <eob> she can't be taller, <eob> he can't be shorter. <eob>
She can't be bolder, <eob> he can't be gentler. <eob>
If you were to take a ballroom dance <eob> and translate that into a conversation <eob> and drop that into a movie, <eob> we, as a culture, <eol> would never stand for this. <eob>
He dictates, she reacts. <eob>
No relationship -- gay, straight or anything -- <eob> that we would regard as remotely healthy <eol> or functional looks like that, <eob> and yet somehow, <eob> you put it on prime time, <eol> you slap some makeup on it, <eob> throw the glitter on, put it out there <eol> as movement, not as text, <eob> and we, as a culture, <eob> tune in and clap. <eob>
We are applauding our own absence. <eob>
(Music) <eob> (Applause) <eob> Too many people have disappeared <eol> from partner dancing. <eob> JF: Now, you just saw <eol> two men dancing together. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And you thought it looked ... <eob> a little strange. <eob> Interesting -- appealing, even -- <eob> but a little bit odd. <eob>
Even avid followers of the same-sex ballroom <eol> circuit can attest <eob> that while same-sex partner dancing <eol> can be dynamic and strong and exciting, <eob> it just doesn't quite seem to fit. <eob> Aesthetically speaking, <eob> if Alida and I take the classic closed ballroom hold ... <eob> this is considered beautiful. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> See, the standard image that <eol> the leader must be larger and masculine <eob> and the follower smaller and feminine -- <eob> this is a stumbling point. <eob>
TC: So we wanted to look at this <eol> from a totally different angle. <eob>
So, what if we could keep the idea <eol> of lead and follow <eob> but toss the idea <eol> that this was connected to gender? <eob>
Further, what if a couple <eol> could lead and follow each other <eob> and then switch? <eob> And then switch back? <eob> What if it could be like a conversation, <eob> taking turns listening and speaking, <eol> just like we do in life? <eob>
What if we could dance like that? <eob>
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing." <eob>
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance, <eob> salsa. <eob>
In salsa, there's a key transitional step, <eol> called the cross-body lead. <eob>
We use it as punctuation <eol> to break up the improvisation. <eob>
It can be a little tricky to spot <eol> if you're not used to looking for it, <eob> so here it is. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> One more time for the cheap seats. <eob> And here's the action one more time, <eob> nice and slow. <eob>
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking <eol> to this transitional step, <eob> the cross-body lead becomes a point <eob> where the lead and the follow can switch. <eob>
The person following <eol> can elect to take over the lead, <eob> or the person leading can choose <eol> to surrender it, <eob> essentially making it a counter-cross-body lead. <eob>
Here's how that looks in slow motion. <eob>
And here's how it looked when <eol> we danced it in the opening dance. <eob>
With this simple tweak, the dance <eol> moves from being a dictation <eob> to a negotiation. <eob> Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow. <eob> And more importantly, you can change your mind. <eob>
Now, this is only one example <eol> of how this applies, <eob> but once the blinkers come off, <eol> anything can happen. <eob>
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking could apply <eol> to a classic waltz. <eob>
Because, of course, <eob> it isn't just a system <eol> of switching leads; <eob> it's a way of thinking <eob> that can actually make the dance <eol> itself more efficient. <eob>
So: the waltz. <eob> The waltz is a turning dance. <eob>
This means that for the lead, <eob> you spend half of the dance <eol> traveling backwards, <eob> completely blind. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And because of the follower's position, <eob> basically, no one can see <eol> where they're going. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> TC: There are actually <eol> a lot of accidents out there <eob> that happen as a result <eol> of this blind spot. <eob>
But what if the partners were to just allow for <eob> a switch of posture for a moment? <eob>
A lot of accidents could be avoided. <eob>
Even if one person led the whole dance <eol> but allowed this switch to happen, <eob> it would be a lot safer, <eob> while at the same time, offering new aesthetics <eol> into the waltz. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Because physics doesn't give <eol> a damn about your gender. <eob> JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead in clubs, convention centers <eob> and as part of "First Dance," <eol> the play we created with Lisa, <eob> on stages in North America <eol> and in Europe. <eob>
And it never fails to engage. <eob>
I mean, beyond the unusual sight <eol> of seeing two men dancing together, <eob> it always evokes and engages. <eob> But why? <eob> The secret lies in what made Lisa see our initial demonstration <eob> as "political." <eob> It wasn't just that we were switching <eol> lead and follow; <eob> it's that we stayed consistent <eol> in our presence, our personality <eob> and our power, regardless of which role we were playing. <eob>
We were still us. <eob> And that's where the true <eol> freedom lies -- <eob> not just the freedom <eol> to switch roles, <eob> but the freedom from being defined <eol> by whichever role you're playing, <eob> the freedom to always remain true to yourself. <eob>
Forget what a lead <eol> is supposed to look like, or a follow. <eob>
Be a masculine follow <eob> or a feminine lead. <eob> Just be yourself. <eob> Obviously, this applies <eol> off the dance floor as well, <eob> but on the floor, it gives us <eol> the perfect opportunity <eob> to update an old paradigm, reinvigorate an old relic, <eob> and make it more representative <eol> of our era and our current way of being. <eob>
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing <eol> all the time with women and men <eob> and we love it. <eob>
But we dance with a consciousness <eol> that this is a historic form <eob> that can produce silence <eol> and produce invisibility <eob> across the spectrum of identity <eol> that we enjoy today. <eob>
(Music) <eob> We invented Liquid Lead <eob> as a way of stripping out all the ideas <eol> that don't belong to us <eob> and taking partner dancing back <eol> to what it really always was: <eob> the fine art of taking care <eol> of each other. <eob>
You are a high-ranking military service member <eob> deployed to Afghanistan. <eob>
You are responsible for the lives <eob> of hundreds of men and women, <eob> and your base is under attack. <eob>
Incoming mortar rounds <eol> are exploding all around you. <eob>
Struggling to see <eol> through the dust and the smoke, <eob> you do your best to assist the wounded <eob> and then crawl to a nearby bunker. <eob>
Conscious but dazed by the blasts, <eob> you lay on your side and attempt <eol> to process what has just happened. <eob>
As you regain your vision, <eob> you see a bloody face <eob> staring back at you. <eob>
The image is terrifying, <eob> but you quickly come to understand <eob> it's not real. <eob>
This vision continues to visit <eol> you multiple times a day and in your sleep. <eob>
You choose not to tell anyone <eol> for fear of losing your job <eob> or being seen as weak. <eob>
You give the vision a name, <eob> Bloody Face in Bunker, <eob> and call it BFIB for short. <eob>
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind, <eob> secretly haunting you, <eob> for the next seven years. <eob>
Now close your eyes. <eob> Can you see BFIB? <eob> If you can, you're beginning to see the face <eob> of the invisible wounds of war, <eob> commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder <eob> and traumatic brain injury. <eob>
While I can't say I have post-traumatic stress disorder, <eob> I've never been a stranger to it. <eob>
When I was a little girl, I would visit <eol> my grandparents every summer. <eob>
It was my grandfather <eob> who introduced me to the effects <eol> of combat on the psyche. <eob>
While my grandfather was serving <eol> as a Marine in the Korean War, <eob> a bullet pierced his neck <eol> and rendered him unable to cry out. <eob>
He watched as a corpsman passed him over, <eob> declaring him a goner, <eob> and then leaving him to die. <eob>
Years later, after his physical <eol> wounds had healed <eob> and he'd returned home, <eob> he rarely spoke of his experiences <eol> in waking life. <eob>
But at night I would hear him <eol> shouting obscenities <eob> from his room down the hall. <eob>
And during the day I would announce myself <eol> as I entered the room, <eob> careful not to startle or agitate him. <eob>
He lived out the remainder of his days <eob> isolated and tight-lipped, <eob> never finding a way to express himself, <eob> and I didn't yet have <eol> the tools to guide him. <eob>
I wouldn't have a name <eol> for my grandfather's condition <eob> until I was in my 20s. <eob>
Seeking a graduate degree <eol> in art therapy, <eob> I naturally gravitated <eol> towards the study of trauma. <eob>
And while sitting in class learning <eol> about post-traumatic stress disorder, <eob> or PTSD for short, <eob> my mission to help service <eol> members who suffered like my grandfather <eob> began to take form. <eob>
We've had various names <eol> for post-traumatic stress <eob> throughout the history of war: <eob> homesickness, <eob> soldier's heart, <eob> shell shock, <eob> thousand-yard stare, for instance. <eob>
And while I was pursuing my degree, <eol> a new war was raging, <eob> and thanks to modern body armor <eol> and military vehicles, <eob> service members were surviving blast injuries <eol> they wouldn't have before. <eob>
But the invisible wounds <eol> were reaching new levels, <eob> and this pushed military doctors and researchers <eob> to try and truly understand <eol> the effects that traumatic brain injury, or TBI, <eob> and PTSD have on the brain. <eob>
Due to advances in technology <eol> and neuroimaging, <eob> we now know there's an actual shutdown <eol> in the Broca's, <eob> or the speech-language area of the brain, <eol> after an individual experiences trauma. <eob>
This physiological change, <eob> or speechless terror <eol> as it's often called, <eob> coupled with mental health stigma, <eob> the fear of being judged <eob> or misunderstood, <eob> possibly even removed from their current duties, <eob> has led to the invisible <eol> struggles of our servicemen and women. <eob>
Generation after generation of veterans <eob> have chosen not to talk <eol> about their experiences, <eob> and suffer in solitude. <eob>
I had my work cut out for me <eol> when I got my first job <eob> as an art therapist <eol> at the nation's largest military medical center, <eob> Walter Reed. <eob>
After working for a few years <eol> on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit, <eob> I eventually transferred <eol> to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE, <eob> which leads TBI care <eol> for active duty service members. <eob>
Now, I believed in art therapy, <eob> but I was going to have <eol> to convince service members, <eob> big, tough, strong, <eol> manly military men, <eob> and some women too, <eob> to give art-making <eol> as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try. <eob>
The results have been <eol> nothing short of spectacular. <eob>
Vivid, symbolic artwork <eob> is being created by our servicemen and women, <eob> and every work of art <eol> tells a story. <eob>
We've observed that the process <eol> of art therapy bypasses <eob> the speech-language issue with the brain. <eob>
Art-making accesses the same sensory areas <eol> of the brain that encode trauma. <eob>
Service members can use the art-making <eol> to work through their experiences <eob> in a nonthreatening way. <eob>
They can then apply words <eol> to their physical creations, <eob> reintegrating the left and the right <eol> hemispheres of the brain. <eob>
Now, we've seen this can work <eol> with all forms of art -- <eob> drawing, painting, collage -- <eob> but what seems to have the most impact <eob> is mask-making. <eob>
Finally, these invisible wounds <eol> don't just have a name, <eob> they have a face. <eob>
And when service members create these masks, <eob> it allows them to come to grips, <eol> literally, with their trauma. <eob>
And it's amazing how often <eol> that enables them <eob> to break through the trauma <eol> and start to heal. <eob>
Remember BFIB? <eob> That was a real experience <eol> for one of my patients, <eob> and when he created his mask, <eob> he was able to let <eol> go of that haunting image. <eob>
Initially, it was a daunting process <eol> for the service member, <eob> but eventually he began to think of BFIB as the mask, <eob> not his internal wound, <eob> and he would go to leave each session, <eob> he would hand me the mask, and say, "Melissa, take care of him." <eob> Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box to further contain him, <eob> and when the service member went to leave the NICoE, <eob> he chose to leave BFIB behind. <eob>
A year later, he had only seen <eol> BFIB twice, <eob> and both times BFIB was smiling <eob> and the service member didn't feel anxious. <eob>
Now, whenever that service member <eol> is haunted by some traumatic memory, <eob> he continues to paint. <eob>
Every time he paints <eol> these disturbing images, <eob> he sees them less or not at all. <eob>
Philosophers have told us <eol> for thousands of years <eob> that the power to create <eob> is very closely linked <eol> to the power to destroy. <eob>
Now science is showing us <eol> that the part of the brain <eob> that registers a traumatic wound <eob> can be the part of the brain <eol> where healing happens too. <eob>
And art therapy is showing us <eol> how to make that connection. <eob>
We asked one of our service members <eob> to describe how mask-making <eol> impacted his treatment, <eob> and this is what he had to say. <eob>
(Video) Service Member: You sort of just zone <eol> out into the mask. <eob>
You zone out into the drawing, <eob> and for me, it just released the block, <eob> so I was able to do it. <eob>
And then when I looked at it <eol> after two days, I was like, <eob> "Holy crap, here's the picture, <eol> here's the key, here's the puzzle," <eob> and then from there it just soared. <eob>
I mean, from there my treatment <eol> just when out of sight, <eob> because they were like, Kurt, <eol> explain this, explain this. <eob>
And for the first time in 23 years, <eob> I could actually talk about stuff <eol> openly to, like, anybody. <eob>
I could talk to you about it <eol> right now if I wanted to, <eob> because it unlocked it. <eob>
It's just amazing. <eob>
And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD <eob> and TBI stuff together in one place <eob> that has never happened before. <eob> Sorry. <eob>
Melissa Walker: Over the past five years, <eob> we've had over 1,000 masks made. <eob>
It's pretty amazing, isn't it? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> I wish I could have shared <eol> this process with my grandfather, <eob> but I know that he would be thrilled <eob> that we are finding ways <eob> to help today's and tomorrow's service members heal, <eob> and finding the resources within them <eob> that they can call upon <eob> to heal themselves. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Let's talk about trust. <eob> We all know trust is fundamental, <eob> but when it comes to trusting people, <eob> something profound is happening. <eob>
Please raise your hand <eob> if you have ever been a host <eol> or a guest on Airbnb. <eob> Wow. That's a lot of you. <eob>
Who owns Bitcoin? <eob> Still a lot of you. OK. <eob>
And please raise your hand <eol> if you've ever used Tinder <eob> to help you find a mate. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This one's really hard to count <eol> because you're kind of going like this. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
These are all examples of how <eol> technology <eob> is creating new mechanisms <eob> that are enabling us <eol> to trust unknown people, companies and ideas. <eob>
And yet at the same time, <eob> trust in institutions -- <eob> banks, governments and even churches -- <eob> is collapsing. <eob>
So what's happening here, <eob> and who do you trust? <eob>
Let's start in France <eol> with a platform -- with a company, I should say -- <eob> with a rather funny-sounding name, <eob> BlaBlaCar. <eob>
It's a platform <eol> that matches drivers and passengers <eob> who want to share long-distance journeys together. <eob>
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers. <eob>
So it's a good idea to choose <eol> your fellow travelers wisely. <eob>
Social profiles and reviews help <eol> people make a choice. <eob>
You can see if someone's a smoker, <eol> you can see what kind of music they like, <eob> you can see if they're going to bring <eol> their dog along for the ride. <eob>
But it turns out that the key <eol> social identifier <eob> is how much you're going to talk in the car. <eob>
Bla, not a lot, <eob> bla bla, you want <eol> a nice bit of chitchat, <eob> and bla bla bla, you're not going <eol> to stop talking the entire way <eob> from London to Paris. <eob>
It's remarkable, right, <eol> that this idea works at all, <eob> because it's counter to the lesson <eol> most of us were taught as a child: <eob> never get in a car with a stranger. <eob>
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports <eol> more than four million people <eob> every single month. <eob>
To put that in context, <eol> that's more passengers <eob> than the Eurostar or JetBlue airlines carry. <eob>
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration <eol> of how technology is enabling <eob> millions of people across <eol> the world to take a trust leap. <eob>
A trust leap happens when we take <eol> the risk to do something new or different <eob> to the way that we've always done it. <eob>
Let's try to visualize this together. <eob> OK. I want you to close your eyes. <eob>
There is a man staring at me <eol> with his eyes wide open. <eob>
I'm on this big red circle. I can see. <eob> So close your eyes. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
I'll do it with you. <eob>
And I want you to imagine <eol> there exists a gap <eob> between you and something unknown. <eob>
That unknown can be someone <eol> you've just met. <eob> It can be a place <eol> you've never been to. <eob> It can be something <eol> you've never tried before. <eob> You got it? <eob> OK. You can open your eyes now. <eob>
For you to leap from a place <eol> of certainty, <eob> to take a chance on that someone <eol> or something unknown, <eob> you need a force to pull you <eol> over the gap, <eob> and that remarkable force is trust. <eob>
Trust is an elusive concept, <eob> and yet we depend on it <eol> for our lives to function. <eob>
I trust my children <eob> when they say they're going to turn <eol> the lights out at night. <eob>
I trusted the pilot who flew me <eol> here to keep me safe. <eob>
It's a word we use a lot, <eob> without always thinking <eol> about what it really means <eob> and how it works in different <eol> contexts of our lives. <eob>
There are, in fact, hundreds <eol> of definitions of trust, <eob> and most can be reduced <eol> to some kind of risk assessment <eob> of how likely it is that things <eol> will go right. <eob>
But I don't like <eol> this definition of trust, <eob> because it makes trust sound rational and predictable, <eob> and it doesn't really get <eol> to the human essence <eob> of what it enables us to do <eob> and how it empowers us <eob> to connect with other people. <eob>
So I define trust a little differently. <eob>
I define trust as a confident <eol> relationship to the unknown. <eob>
Now, when you view trust through this lens, <eob> it starts to explain why <eol> it has the unique capacity <eob> to enable us to cope with uncertainty, <eob> to place our faith in strangers, <eob> to keep moving forward. <eob>
Human beings are remarkable <eob> at taking trust leaps. <eob>
Do you remember the first time <eol> you put your credit card details <eob> into a website? <eob>
That's a trust leap. <eob>
I distinctly remember telling my dad <eob> that I wanted to buy <eol> a navy blue secondhand Peugeot on eBay, <eob> and he rightfully pointed out <eob> that the seller's name was "Invisible Wizard" <eob> and that this probably was not <eol> such a good idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So my work, my research <eol> focuses on how technology <eob> is transforming the social <eol> glue of society, <eob> trust between people, <eob> and it's a fascinating area to study, <eob> because there's still so much we do not know. <eob>
For instance, do men and women <eol> trust differently in digital environments? <eob>
Does the way we build trust <eol> face-to-face translate online? <eob> Does trust transfer? <eob> So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder, <eob> are you more likely to trust <eol> finding a ride on BlaBlaCar? <eob>
But from studying hundreds of networks <eol> and marketplaces, <eob> there is a common pattern <eol> that people follow, <eob> and I call it "climbing the trust stack." <eob> Let me use BlaBlaCar as an example <eol> to bring it to life. <eob>
On the first level, <eob> you have to trust the idea. <eob>
The second level is about having <eol> confidence in the platform, <eob> that BlaBlaCar will help you <eol> if something goes wrong. <eob>
And the third level is about <eol> using little bits of information <eob> to decide whether the other person <eol> is trustworthy. <eob>
Now, the first time we climb <eol> the trust stack, <eob> it feels weird, even risky, <eob> but we get to a point where these ideas <eol> seem totally normal. <eob>
Our behaviors transform, <eob> often relatively quickly. <eob>
In other words, trust <eol> enables change and innovation. <eob>
So an idea that intrigued me, <eol> and I'd like you to consider, <eob> is whether we can better understand <eob> major waves of disruption <eol> and change in individuals in society <eob> through the lens of trust. <eob>
Well, it turns out that trust <eol> has only evolved <eob> in three significant chapters <eol> throughout the course of human history: <eob> local, institutional <eob> and what we're now entering, distributed. <eob>
So for a long time, <eob> until the mid-1800s, <eob> trust was built around tight-knit relationships. <eob>
So say I lived in a village <eob> with the first five rows of this audience, <eob> and we all knew one another, <eob> and say I wanted to borrow money. <eob>
The man who had his eyes wide open, <eol> he might lend it to me, <eob> and if I didn't pay him back, <eob> you'd all know I was dodgy. <eob>
I would get a bad reputation, <eob> and you would refuse to do business <eol> with me in the future. <eob>
Trust was mostly local <eol> and accountability-based. <eob>
In the mid-19th century, <eob> society went through <eol> a tremendous amount of change. <eob>
People moved to fast-growing cities <eol> such as London and San Francisco, <eob> and a local banker here <eol> was replaced by large corporations <eob> that didn't know us as individuals. <eob>
We started to place our trust <eob> into black box systems of authority, <eob> things like legal contracts <eol> and regulation and insurance, <eob> and less trust directly <eol> in other people. <eob>
Trust became institutional <eol> and commission-based. <eob>
It's widely talked about how trust <eol> in institutions and many corporate brands <eob> has been steadily declining <eol> and continues to do so. <eob>
I am constantly stunned <eol> by major breaches of trust: <eob> the News Corp phone hacking, <eob> the Volkswagen emissions scandal, <eob> the widespread abuse in the Catholic Church, <eob> the fact that only one measly banker <eob> went to jail after the great financial crisis, <eob> or more recently the Panama Papers <eob> that revealed how the rich <eol> can exploit offshore tax regimes. <eob>
And the thing that really surprises me <eob> is why do leaders find it so hard <eob> to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize, <eob> when our trust is broken? <eob>
It would be easy to conclude <eol> that institutional trust isn't working <eob> because we are fed up <eob> with the sheer audacity <eol> of dishonest elites, <eob> but what's happening now <eob> runs deeper than the rampant questioning <eol> of the size and structure of institutions. <eob>
We're starting to realize <eob> that institutional trust <eob> wasn't designed for the digital age. <eob>
Conventions of how trust is built, <eob> managed, lost and repaired -- <eob> in brands, leaders and entire systems -- <eob> is being turned upside down. <eob>
Now, this is exciting, <eob> but it's frightening, <eob> because it forces many of us <eol> to have to rethink <eob> how trust is built <eol> and destroyed with our customers, with our employees, <eob> even our loved ones. <eob>
The other day, I was talking to the CEO <eol> of a leading international hotel brand, <eob> and as is often the case, <eol> we got onto the topic of Airbnb. <eob>
And he admitted to me <eol> that he was perplexed by their success. <eob>
He was perplexed at how a company <eob> that depends on the willingness <eol> of strangers to trust one another <eob> could work so well across 191 countries. <eob>
So I said to him <eol> that I had a confession to make, <eob> and he looked at me a bit strangely, <eob> and I said -- <eob> and I'm sure many of you do this as well -- <eob> I don't always bother <eol> to hang my towels up <eob> when I'm finished in the hotel, <eob> but I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb. <eob>
And the reason why I would never do <eol> this as a guest on Airbnb <eob> is because guests know <eol> that they'll be rated by hosts, <eob> and that those ratings <eol> are likely to impact their ability <eob> to transact in the future. <eob>
It's a simple illustration of how online <eol> trust will change our behaviors <eob> in the real world, <eob> make us more accountable <eob> in ways we cannot yet even imagine. <eob>
I am not saying we do not need hotels <eob> or traditional forms of authority. <eob>
But what we cannot deny <eob> is that the way trust flows <eol> through society is changing, <eob> and it's creating this big shift <eob> away from the 20th century <eob> that was defined by institutional trust <eob> towards the 21st century <eob> that will be fueled <eol> by distributed trust. <eob>
Trust is no longer top-down. <eob>
It's being unbundled and inverted. <eob>
It's no longer opaque and linear. <eob>
A new recipe for trust is emerging <eob> that once again is distributed <eol> amongst people <eob> and is accountability-based. <eob>
And this shift is only going to accelerate <eob> with the emergence <eol> of the blockchain, <eob> the innovative ledger technology <eol> underpinning Bitcoin. <eob>
Now let's be honest, <eob> getting our heads around the <eol> way blockchain works <eob> is mind-blowing. <eob>
And one of the reasons why <eol> is it involves processing <eob> some pretty complicated concepts <eob> with terrible names. <eob>
I mean, cryptographic algorithms and hash functions, <eob> and people called miners, <eol> who verify transactions -- <eob> all that was created <eol> by this mysterious person <eob> or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto. <eob>
Now, that is a massive trust <eol> leap that hasn't happened yet. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But let's try to imagine this. <eob>
So "The Economist" eloquently described <eol> the blockchain <eob> as the great chain <eol> of being sure about things. <eob>
The easiest way I can describe it <eol> is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets, <eob> and they are filled with assets. <eob>
So that could be a property title. <eob> It could be a stock trade. <eob> It could be a creative asset, <eol> such as the rights to a song. <eob>
Every time something moves <eob> from one place on the register <eol> to somewhere else, <eob> that asset transfer <eol> is time-stamped <eob> and publicly recorded on the blockchain. <eob>
It's that simple. Right. <eob>
So the real implication of the blockchain <eob> is that it removes <eol> the need for any kind of third party, <eob> such as a lawyer, <eob> or a trusted intermediary, <eol> or maybe not a government intermediary <eob> to facilitate the exchange. <eob>
So if we go back to the trust stack, <eob> you still have to trust the idea, <eob> you have to trust the platform, <eob> but you don't have to trust the other person <eob> in the traditional sense. <eob>
The implications are huge. <eob> In the same way the internet blew open <eol> the doors to an age of information <eob> available to everyone, <eob> the blockchain will revolutionize <eol> trust on a global scale. <eob>
Now, I've waited to the end <eol> intentionally to mention Uber, <eob> because I recognize that it is a contentious <eob> and widely overused example, <eob> but in the context of a new era of trust, <eol> it's a great case study. <eob>
Now, we will see cases of abuse <eol> of distributed trust. <eob>
We've already seen this, and it <eol> can go horribly wrong. <eob>
I am not surprised that we are seeing <eol> protests from taxi associations <eob> all around the world <eob> trying to get governments to ban Uber based on claims <eol> that it is unsafe. <eob>
I happened to be in London the day <eol> that these protests took place, <eob> and I happened to notice a tweet <eob> from Matt Hancock, who is a British minister <eol> for business. <eob>
And he wrote, <eob> "Does anyone have details <eol> of this #Uber app everyone's talking about? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'd never heard of it until today." <eob>
Now, the taxi associations, <eob> they legitimized the first layer <eol> of the trust stack. <eob>
They legitimized the idea that <eol> they were trying to eliminate, <eob> and sign-ups increased <eol> by 850 percent in 24 hours. <eob>
Now, this is a really strong illustration <eob> of how once a trust shift <eol> has happened around a behavior or an entire sector, <eob> you cannot reverse the story. <eob>
Every day, five million people <eol> will take a trust leap <eob> and ride with Uber. <eob>
In China, on Didi, the ride-sharing platform, <eob> 11 million rides taken every day. <eob>
That's 127 rides per second, <eob> showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon. <eob>
And the fascinating thing <eol> is that both drivers and passengers report <eob> that seeing a name <eob> and seeing someone's photo and their rating <eob> makes them feel safer, <eob> and as you may have experienced, <eob> even behave a little more nicely <eol> in the taxi cab. <eob>
Uber and Didi are early but powerful examples <eob> of how technology is creating <eob> trust between people <eob> in ways and on a scale <eol> never possible before. <eob>
Today, many of us are comfortable getting <eol> into cars driven by strangers. <eob>
We meet up with someone we swiped <eol> right to be matched with. <eob>
We share our homes with people <eol> we do not know. <eob>
This is just the beginning, <eob> because the real disruption happening <eob> isn't technological. <eob>
It's the trust shift it creates, <eob> and for my part, I want to help people <eol> understand this new era of trust <eob> so that we can get it right <eob> and we can embrace the opportunities <eol> to redesign systems <eob> that are more transparent, inclusive and accountable. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Please meet Jane. <eob> She has a high-risk pregnancy. <eob>
Within 24 weeks, <eob> she's on bed rest at the hospital, <eob> being monitored <eol> for her preterm contractions. <eob>
She doesn't look the happiest. <eob>
That's in part because it requires <eol> technicians and experts <eob> to apply these clunky belts on her <eol> to monitor her uterine contractions. <eob>
Another reason Jane is not so happy <eol> is because she's worried. <eob>
In particular, she's worried about what happens <eob> after her 10-day stay <eol> on bed rest at the hospital. <eob>
What happens when she's home? <eob>
If she were to give birth <eol> this early it would be devastating. <eob>
As an African-American woman, <eob> she's twice as likely to have <eol> a premature birth <eob> or to have a stillbirth. <eob>
So Jane basically has one of two options: <eob> stay at the hospital on bed rest, <eob> a prisoner to the technology <eol> until she gives birth, <eob> and then spend the rest of her life <eol> paying for the bill; <eob> or head home after her 10-day stay <eol> and hope for the best. <eob>
Neither of these two options <eol> seems appealing. <eob>
As I began to think about stories like this <eob> and hear about stories like this, <eob> I began to ask myself and imagine: <eob> Is there an alternative? <eob>
Is there a way we could have <eol> the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring <eob> that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital <eob> while someone is at home living <eol> their daily life? <eob>
With that in mind, <eob> I encouraged people in my research group <eob> to partner with some clever material scientists, <eob> and all of us came together <eol> and brainstormed. <eob>
And after a long process, <eob> we came up with a vision, an idea, <eob> of a wearable system <eol> that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry <eob> or you could apply to yourself <eol> like a Band-Aid. <eob>
And after many trials and tribulations <eol> and years of endeavors, <eob> we were able to come up <eol> with this flexible electronic patch <eob> that was manufactured <eol> using the same processes <eob> that they use to build computer chips, <eob> except the electronics are transferred <eol> from a semiconductor wafer <eob> onto a flexible material that can interface <eol> with the human body. <eob>
These systems are about the thickness <eol> of a human hair. <eob>
They can measure the types <eol> of information that we want, <eob> things such as: <eob> bodily movement, <eob> bodily temperature, <eob> electrical rhythms of the body <eob> and so forth. <eob>
We can also engineer these systems, <eob> so they can integrate energy sources, <eob> and can have wireless transmission <eol> capabilities. <eob>
So as we began to build <eol> these types of systems, <eob> we began to test them <eol> on ourselves in our research group. <eob>
But in addition, we began to reach out <eol> to some of our clinical partners <eob> in San Diego, <eob> and test these on different patients <eol> in different clinical conditions, <eob> including moms-to-be like Jane. <eob>
Here is a picture of a pregnant woman <eol> in labor at our university hospital <eob> being monitored for her uterine contractions <eol> with the conventional belt. <eob>
In addition, <eob> our flexible electronic patches are there. <eob>
This picture demonstrates waveforms pertaining <eol> to the fetal heart rate, <eob> where the red corresponds to what was acquired <eob> with the conventional belts, <eob> and the blue corresponds to our estimates <eob> using our flexible electronic systems <eol> and our algorithms. <eob>
At this moment, <eob> we gave ourselves a big mental high five. <eob>
Some of the things we had imagined <eol> were beginning to come to fruition, <eob> and we were actually seeing this <eol> in a clinical context. <eob>
But there was still a problem. <eob> The problem was, the way <eol> we manufactured these systems <eob> was very inefficient, <eob> had low yield <eob> and was very error-prone. <eob>
In addition, <eob> as we talked to some of the nurses <eol> in the hospital, <eob> they encouraged us to make sure <eob> that our electronics worked <eol> with typical medical adhesives <eob> that are used in a hospital. <eob>
We had an epiphany and said, <eol> "Wait a minute. <eob>
Rather than just making them work <eol> with adhesives, <eob> let's integrate them into adhesives, <eob> and that could solve our manufacturing <eol> problem." <eob>
This picture that you see here <eob> is our ability to embed these <eol> censors inside of a piece of Scotch tape <eob> by simply peeling it off of a wafer. <eob>
Ongoing work in our research group <eol> allows us to, in addition, <eob> embed integrated circuits <eol> into the flexible adhesives <eob> to do things like amplifying signals <eol> and digitizing them, <eob> processing them <eob> and encoding for wireless transmission. <eob>
All of this integrated <eol> into the same medical adhesives <eob> that are used in the hospital. <eob>
So when we reached this point, <eob> we had some other challenges, <eob> from both an engineering <eol> as well as a usability perspective, <eob> to make sure that we could <eol> make it used practically. <eob>
In many digital health discussions, <eob> people believe in and embrace the idea <eol> that we can simply digitize the data, <eob> wirelessly transmit it, <eob> send it to the cloud, <eob> and in the cloud, <eob> we can extract meaningful information <eol> for interpretation. <eob>
And indeed, you can do all of that, <eob> if you're not worried <eol> about some of the energy challenges. <eob>
Think about Jane for a moment. <eob>
She doesn't live in Palo Alto, <eob> nor does she live in Beverly Hills. <eob>
What that means is, <eob> we have to be mindful about her data plan <eol> and how much it would cost <eob> for her to be sending out <eol> a continuous stream of data. <eob>
There's another challenge <eob> that not everyone in the medical profession <eol> is comfortable talking about. <eob>
And that is, that Jane <eol> does not have the most trust <eob> in the medical establishment. <eob>
She, people like her, her ancestors, <eol> have not had the best experiences <eob> at the hands of doctors and the hospital <eob> or insurance companies. <eob>
That means that we have to be <eol> mindful of questions of privacy. <eob>
Jane might not feel that happy <eob> about all that data being processed <eol> into the cloud. <eob>
And Jane cannot be fooled; <eob> she reads the news. <eob>
She knows that if the federal <eol> government can be hacked, <eob> if the Fortune 500 can be hacked, <eob> so can her doctor. <eob>
And so with that in mind, <eob> we had an epiphany. <eob>
We cannot outsmart all <eol> the hackers in the world, <eob> but perhaps we can present them <eol> a smaller target. <eob>
What if we could actually, <eob> rather than have those algorithms <eol> that do data interpretation <eob> run in the cloud, <eob> what if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits <eob> embedded into those adhesives? <eob>
And so when we integrate <eol> these things together, <eob> what this means is that now <eol> we can think about the future <eob> where someone like Jane <eol> can still go about living her normal daily life, <eob> she can be monitored, <eob> it can be done in a way <eol> where she doesn't have to get another job <eob> to pay her data plan, <eob> and we can also address <eol> some of her concerns about privacy. <eob>
So at this point, <eob> we're feeling very good about ourselves. <eob>
We've accomplished this, <eob> we've begun to address <eol> some of these questions about privacy <eob> and we feel like, pretty much <eol> the chapter is closed now. <eob>
Everyone lived happily ever after, right? <eob>
Well, not so fast. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
One of the things we have to remember, <eol> as I mentioned earlier, <eob> is that Jane does not have the most trust <eob> in the medical establishment. <eob>
We have to remember <eob> that there are increasing <eol> and widening health disparities, <eob> and there's inequity <eol> in terms of proper care management. <eob>
And so what that means <eol> is that this simple picture <eob> of Jane and her data -- <eob> even with her being comfortable <eol> being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud, <eob> letting a doctor intervene if necessary -- <eob> is not the whole story. <eob>
So what we're beginning to do <eob> is to think about ways to have trusted parties <eol> serve as intermediaries <eob> between people like Jane <eol> and her health care providers. <eob>
For example, we've begun <eol> to partner with churches <eob> and to think about nurses <eol> that are church members, <eob> that come from that trusted community, <eob> as patient advocates and health coaches <eol> to people like Jane. <eob>
Another thing we have going for us <eob> is that insurance companies, increasingly, <eob> are attracted to some of these ideas. <eob>
They're increasingly realizing <eob> that perhaps it's better to pay <eol> one dollar now <eob> for a wearable device and a health coach, <eob> rather than paying 10 dollars later, <eob> when that baby is born prematurely <eob> and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit -- <eob> one of the most expensive <eol> parts of a hospital. <eob>
This has been a long learning process <eol> for us. <eob>
This iterative process of breaking <eol> through and attacking one problem <eob> and not feeling totally comfortable, <eob> and identifying the next problem, <eob> has helped us go along this path <eob> of actually trying to not only innovate <eol> with this technology <eob> but make sure it can be used for people <eol> who perhaps need it the most. <eob>
Another learning lesson <eol> we've taken from this process <eob> that is very humbling, <eob> is that as technology progresses <eol> and advances at an accelerating rate, <eob> we have to remember that human beings <eol> are using this technology, <eob> and we have to be mindful <eob> that these human beings -- they have a face, <eob> they have a name <eob> and a life. <eob>
And in the case of Jane, <eob> hopefully, two. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I started my first job <eol> as a computer programmer <eob> in my very first year of college -- <eob> basically, as a teenager. <eob>
Soon after I started working, <eob> writing software in a company, <eob> a manager who worked <eol> at the company came down to where I was, <eob> and he whispered to me, <eob> "Can he tell if I'm lying?" <eob> There was nobody else in the room. <eob>
"Can who tell if you're lying? <eob>
And why are we whispering? " <eob>
"Can he tell if I'm lying?" <eob> The manager pointed at the computer in the room. <eob> Well, that manager was having <eol> an affair with the receptionist. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I was still a teenager. <eob> So I whisper-shouted back to him, <eob> "Yes, the computer can tell <eol> if you're lying." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, I laughed, but actually, <eol> the laugh's on me. <eob>
Nowadays, there are computational systems <eob> that can suss out emotional <eol> states and even lying <eob> from processing human faces. <eob>
Advertisers and even governments <eol> are very interested. <eob>
I had become a computer programmer <eob> because I was one of those kids <eol> crazy about math and science. <eob>
But somewhere along the line <eol> I'd learned about nuclear weapons, <eob> and I'd gotten really concerned <eol> with the ethics of science. <eob> I was troubled. <eob> However, because of family circumstances, <eob> I also needed to start working <eol> as soon as possible. <eob>
So I thought to myself, hey, <eol> let me pick a technical field <eob> where I can get a job easily <eob> and where I don't have to deal <eol> with any troublesome questions of ethics. <eob> So I picked computers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, ha, ha, ha! <eob>
All the laughs are on me. <eob>
Nowadays, computer scientists <eol> are building platforms <eob> that control what a billion people <eol> see every day. <eob>
They're developing cars <eol> that could decide who to run over. <eob>
They're even building machines, weapons, <eob> that might kill human beings in war. <eob>
It's ethics all the way down. <eob>
Machine intelligence is here. <eob> We're now using computation <eol> to make all sort of decisions, <eob> but also new kinds of decisions. <eob>
We're asking questions <eol> to computation that have no single right answers, <eob> that are subjective <eob> and open-ended and value-laden. <eob>
We're asking questions like, <eob> "Who should the company hire?" <eob> "Which update from which friend should you be shown?" <eob> "Which convict is more likely to reoffend?" <eob> "Which news item or movie <eol> should be recommended to people?" <eob>
Look, yes, we've been using <eol> computers for a while, <eob> but this is different. <eob>
This is a historical twist, <eob> because we cannot anchor computation <eol> for such subjective decisions <eob> the way we can anchor computation for flying <eol> airplanes, building bridges, <eob> going to the moon. <eob> Are airplanes safer? Did the bridge <eol> sway and fall? <eob>
There, we have agreed-upon, <eol> fairly clear benchmarks, <eob> and we have laws of nature to guide us. <eob>
We have no such anchors and benchmarks <eob> for decisions in messy human affairs. <eob>
To make things more complicated, <eol> our software is getting more powerful, <eob> but it's also getting less transparent <eol> and more complex. <eob>
Recently, in the past decade, <eob> complex algorithms have made <eol> great strides. <eob>
They can recognize human faces. <eob> They can decipher handwriting. <eob> They can detect credit card fraud <eob> and block spam <eob> and they can translate between languages. <eob> They can detect tumors in medical imaging. <eob>
They can beat humans in chess and Go. <eob>
Much of this progress comes <eol> from a method called "machine learning." <eob> Machine learning is different <eol> than traditional programming, <eob> where you give the computer detailed, <eol> exact, painstaking instructions. <eob>
It's more like you take the system <eol> and you feed it lots of data, <eob> including unstructured data, <eob> like the kind we generate in <eol> our digital lives. <eob>
And the system learns <eol> by churning through this data. <eob>
And also, crucially, <eob> these systems don't operate <eol> under a single-answer logic. <eob>
They don't produce a simple answer; <eol> it's more probabilistic: <eob> "This one is probably more like <eol> what you're looking for." <eob>
Now, the upside is: <eol> this method is really powerful. <eob>
The head of Google's AI systems called it, <eob> "the unreasonable <eol> effectiveness of data." <eob> The downside is, <eob> we don't really understand <eol> what the system learned. <eob>
In fact, that's its power. <eob>
This is less like giving instructions <eol> to a computer; <eob> it's more like training <eol> a puppy-machine-creature <eob> we don't really understand or control. <eob> So this is our problem. <eob> It's a problem when this artificial intelligence <eol> system gets things wrong. <eob>
It's also a problem <eol> when it gets things right, <eob> because we don't even know which is which <eol> when it's a subjective problem. <eob>
We don't know what this thing is thinking. <eob>
So, consider a hiring algorithm -- <eob> a system used to hire people, <eol> using machine-learning systems. <eob>
Such a system would have been <eol> trained on previous employees' data <eob> and instructed to find and hire <eob> people like the existing <eol> high performers in the company. <eob> Sounds good. <eob> I once attended a conference <eob> that brought together human resources <eol> managers and executives, <eob> high-level people, <eob> using such systems in hiring. <eob>
They were super excited. <eob>
They thought that this would make <eol> hiring more objective, less biased, <eob> and give women and minorities <eol> a better shot <eob> against biased human managers. <eob>
And look -- human hiring is biased. <eob> I know. <eob> I mean, in one of my early jobs as a programmer, <eob> my immediate manager <eol> would sometimes come down to where I was <eob> really early in the morning <eol> or really late in the afternoon, <eob> and she'd say, "Zeynep, let's go to lunch!" <eob> I'd be puzzled by the weird timing. <eob> It's 4pm. Lunch? <eob> I was broke, so free lunch. I always went. <eob> I later realized what was happening. <eob>
My immediate managers <eol> had not confessed to their higher-ups <eob> that the programmer they hired <eol> for a serious job was a teen girl <eob> who wore jeans and sneakers to work. <eob>
I was doing a good job, I just looked wrong <eob> and was the wrong age and gender. <eob>
So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way <eob> certainly sounds good to me. <eob>
But with these systems, it is more complicated, <eol> and here's why: <eob> Currently, computational systems can infer <eol> all sorts of things about you <eob> from your digital crumbs, <eob> even if you have not disclosed <eol> those things. <eob>
They can infer your sexual orientation, <eob> your personality traits, <eob> your political leanings. <eob>
They have predictive power <eol> with high levels of accuracy. <eob>
Remember -- for things <eol> you haven't even disclosed. <eob> This is inference. <eob>
I have a friend who developed <eol> such computational systems <eob> to predict the likelihood <eol> of clinical or postpartum depression <eob> from social media data. <eob>
The results are impressive. <eob>
Her system can predict <eol> the likelihood of depression <eob> months before the onset <eol> of any symptoms -- <eob> months before. <eob>
No symptoms, there's prediction. <eob>
She hopes it will be used <eol> for early intervention. Great! <eob> But now put this <eol> in the context of hiring. <eob>
So at this human resources <eol> managers conference, <eob> I approached a high-level manager <eol> in a very large company, <eob> and I said to her, <eol> "Look, what if, unbeknownst to you, <eob> your system is weeding out people <eol> with high future likelihood of depression? <eob>
They're not depressed now, just maybe <eol> in the future, more likely. <eob>
What if it's weeding out women <eol> more likely to be pregnant <eob> in the next year or two <eol> but aren't pregnant now? <eob>
What if it's hiring aggressive people <eol> because that's your workplace culture?" <eob> You can't tell this by looking <eol> at gender breakdowns. <eob>
Those may be balanced. <eob>
And since this is machine learning, <eol> not traditional coding, <eob> there is no variable <eol> there labeled "higher risk of depression," <eob> "higher risk of pregnancy," <eob> "aggressive guy scale." <eob> Not only do you not know what your system <eol> is selecting on, <eob> you don't even know where to begin to look. <eob>
It's a black box. <eob>
It has predictive power, <eol> but you don't understand it. <eob>
"What safeguards," I asked, <eol> "do you have <eob> to make sure that your black box <eol> isn't doing something shady?" <eob> She looked at me as if I had just stepped on 10 puppy tails. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She stared at me and she said, <eob> "I don't want to hear <eol> another word about this." <eob> And she turned around and walked away. <eob>
Mind you -- she wasn't rude. <eob>
It was clearly: what I don't know isn't <eol> my problem, go away, death stare. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Look, such a system <eol> may even be less biased <eob> than human managers <eol> in some ways. <eob>
And it could make monetary sense. <eob>
But it could also lead <eob> to a steady but stealthy <eol> shutting out of the job market <eob> of people with higher risk of depression. <eob>
Is this the kind of society <eol> we want to build, <eob> without even knowing <eol> we've done this, <eob> because we turned decision-making <eol> to machines we don't totally understand? <eob>
Another problem is this: <eob> these systems are often trained on data <eol> generated by our actions, <eob> human imprints. <eob>
Well, they could just be reflecting <eol> our biases, <eob> and these systems could be picking up on our biases <eob> and amplifying them <eob> and showing them back to us, <eob> while we're telling ourselves, <eob> "We're just doing objective, <eol> neutral computation." <eob>
Researchers found that on Google, <eob> women are less likely <eol> than men to be shown job ads for high-paying jobs. <eob>
And searching for African-American names <eob> is more likely to bring up <eol> ads suggesting criminal history, <eob> even when there is none. <eob>
Such hidden biases <eol> and black-box algorithms <eob> that researchers uncover sometimes <eol> but sometimes we don't know, <eob> can have life-altering consequences. <eob>
In Wisconsin, a defendant was sentenced <eol> to six years in prison <eob> for evading the police. <eob>
You may not know this, <eob> but algorithms are increasingly used <eol> in parole and sentencing decisions. <eob>
He wanted to know: <eol> How is this score calculated? <eob>
It's a commercial black box. <eob>
The company refused to have its algorithm <eol> be challenged in open court. <eob>
But ProPublica, an investigative nonprofit, <eol> audited that very algorithm <eob> with what public data they could find, <eob> and found that its outcomes were biased <eob> and its predictive power was dismal, <eol> barely better than chance, <eob> and it was wrongly labeling black <eol> defendants as future criminals <eob> at twice the rate <eol> of white defendants. <eob>
So, consider this case: <eob> This woman was late picking up her godsister <eob> from a school in Broward County, Florida, <eob> running down the street <eol> with a friend of hers. <eob>
They spotted an unlocked kid's <eol> bike and a scooter on a porch <eob> and foolishly jumped on it. <eob>
As they were speeding off, <eol> a woman came out and said, <eob> "Hey! <eob>
That's my kid's bike! <eob> "They dropped it, they walked away, <eol> but they were arrested. <eob>
She was wrong, she was foolish, <eol> but she was also just 18. <eob>
She had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors. <eob>
Meanwhile, that man <eol> had been arrested for shoplifting in Home Depot -- <eob> 85 dollars' worth of stuff, <eol> a similar petty crime. <eob>
But he had two prior armed <eol> robbery convictions. <eob>
But the algorithm scored her <eol> as high risk, and not him. <eob>
Two years later, ProPublica found <eol> that she had not reoffended. <eob>
It was just hard to get a job <eol> for her with her record. <eob>
He, on the other hand, <eol> did reoffend <eob> and is now serving an eight-year prison <eol> term for a later crime. <eob>
Clearly, we need to audit our black boxes <eob> and not have them have this <eol> kind of unchecked power. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Audits are great and important, <eol> but they don't solve all our problems. <eob>
Take Facebook's powerful news feed algorithm -- <eob> you know, the one that ranks everything <eol> and decides what to show you <eob> from all the friends and pages you follow. <eob>
Should you be shown another baby picture? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A sullen note from an acquaintance? <eob>
An important but difficult news item? <eob>
There's no right answer. <eob>
Facebook optimizes for engagement <eol> on the site: <eob> likes, shares, comments. <eob>
In August of 2014, <eob> protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, <eob> after the killing of an African-American <eol> teenager by a white police officer, <eob> under murky circumstances. <eob>
The news of the protests was all over <eob> my algorithmically unfiltered Twitter feed, <eob> but nowhere on my Facebook. <eob>
Was it my Facebook friends? <eob>
I disabled Facebook's algorithm, <eob> which is hard because Facebook keeps <eol> wanting to make you <eob> come under the algorithm's control, <eob> and saw that my friends <eol> were talking about it. <eob>
It's just that the algorithm <eol> wasn't showing it to me. <eob>
I researched this and found <eol> this was a widespread problem. <eob>
The story of Ferguson wasn't <eol> algorithm-friendly. <eob>
It's not "likable." <eob> Who's going to click on "like?" <eob> It's not even easy to comment on. <eob>
Without likes and comments, <eob> the algorithm was likely <eol> showing it to even fewer people, <eob> so we didn't get to see this. <eob>
Instead, that week, <eob> Facebook's algorithm highlighted this, <eob> which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. <eob>
Worthy cause; dump ice water, <eol> donate to charity, fine. <eob>
But it was super algorithm-friendly. <eob>
The machine made this decision for us. <eob>
A very important but difficult conversation <eob> might have been smothered, <eob> had Facebook been the only channel. <eob>
Now, finally, these systems <eol> can also be wrong <eob> in ways that don't resemble human systems. <eob>
Do you guys remember Watson, IBM's <eol> machine-intelligence system <eob> that wiped the floor <eol> with human contestants on Jeopardy? <eob>
It was a great player. <eob>
But then, for Final Jeopardy, Watson was asked this question: <eob> "Its largest airport <eol> is named for a World War II hero, <eob> its second-largest <eol> for a World War II battle." <eob>
(Hums Final Jeopardy music) <eob>
Chicago. <eob> The two humans got it right. <eob>
Watson, on the other hand, <eol> answered "Toronto" -- <eob> for a US city category! <eob>
The impressive system <eol> also made an error <eob> that a human would never make, <eol> a second-grader wouldn't make. <eob>
Our machine intelligence can fail <eob> in ways that don't fit <eol> error patterns of humans, <eob> in ways we won't expect and be prepared for. <eob>
It'd be lousy not to get <eol> a job one is qualified for, <eob> but it would triple suck <eol> if it was because of stack overflow <eob> in some subroutine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In May of 2010, <eob> a flash crash on Wall Street fueled <eol> by a feedback loop <eob> in Wall Street's "sell" algorithm <eob> wiped a trillion dollars <eol> of value in 36 minutes. <eob>
I don't even want to think <eol> what "error" means <eob> in the context of lethal <eol> autonomous weapons. <eob>
So yes, humans have always made biases. <eob>
Decision makers <eol> and gatekeepers, <eob> in courts, in news, in war ... <eob> they make mistakes; <eol> but that's exactly my point. <eob>
We cannot escape these difficult questions. <eob>
We cannot outsource our responsibilities <eol> to machines. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Artificial intelligence <eol> does not give us a "Get out of ethics free" card. <eob>
Data scientist Fred Benenson calls <eol> this math-washing. <eob>
We need the opposite. <eob>
We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion, <eol> scrutiny and investigation. <eob>
We need to make sure <eol> we have algorithmic accountability, <eob> auditing and meaningful transparency. <eob>
We need to accept <eol> that bringing math and computation <eob> to messy, value-laden human affairs <eob> does not bring objectivity; <eob> rather, the complexity of human affairs <eol> invades the algorithms. <eob>
Yes, we can and we should use computation <eob> to help us make better decisions. <eob>
But we have to own up <eol> to our moral responsibility to judgment, <eob> and use algorithms within that framework, <eob> not as a means to abdicate <eol> and outsource our responsibilities <eob> to one another as human to human. <eob>
Machine intelligence is here. <eob> That means we must hold on ever tighter <eob> to human values and human ethics. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Today I stand before you as a man <eol> who lives life to the full <eob> in the here and now. <eob>
But for a long time, <eob> I lived for death. <eob>
I was a young man who believed <eob> that jihad is to be understood <eol> in the language of force and violence. <eob>
I tried to right wrongs <eol> through power and aggression. <eob>
I had deep concerns for the suffering <eol> of others <eob> and a strong desire to help <eol> and bring relief to them. <eob>
I thought violent jihad was noble, <eob> chivalrous <eob> and the best way to help. <eob>
At a time when so many of our people — <eob> young people especially — <eob> are at risk of radicalization <eob> through groups like al-Qaeda, <eob> Islamic State and others, <eob> when these groups are claiming <eob> that their horrific brutality and violence <eol> are true jihad, <eob> I want to say that their idea <eol> of jihad is wrong — <eob> completely wrong — <eob> as was mine, then. <eob>
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost. <eob>
It includes exertion and spirituality, <eob> self-purification <eob> and devotion. <eob>
It refers to positive transformation <eob> through learning, wisdom <eol> and remembrance of God. <eob>
The word jihad stands for all those <eol> meanings as a whole. <eob>
Jihad may at times <eol> take the form of fighting, <eob> but only sometimes, <eob> under strict conditions, <eob> within rules and limits. <eob>
In Islam, <eob> the benefit of an act must outweigh <eol> the harm or hardship it entails. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> the verses in the Koran <eol> that are connected to jihad or fighting <eob> do not cancel out the verses <eol> that talk about forgiveness, <eob> benevolence <eob> or patience. <eob>
But now I believe <eol> that there are no circumstances on earth <eob> where violent jihad <eol> is permissible, <eob> because it will lead <eol> to greater harm. <eob>
But now the idea of jihad <eol> has been hijacked. <eob>
It has been perverted to mean violent struggle <eob> wherever Muslims are undergoing difficulties, <eob> and turned into terrorism <eob> by fascistic Islamists <eol> like al-Qaeda, <eob> Islamic State and others. <eob>
But I have come to understand <eob> that true jihad means striving <eol> to the utmost <eob> to strengthen and live those qualities <eol> which God loves: <eob> honesty, trustworthiness, <eob> compassion, benevolence, <eob> reliability, respect, <eob> truthfulness -- <eob> human values that so many of us share. <eob>
I was born in Bangladesh, <eob> but grew up mostly in England. <eob>
And I went to school here. <eob>
My father was an academic, <eob> and we were in the UK through his work. <eob>
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh <eol> when everything changed. <eob>
The War of Independence impacted <eol> upon us terribly, <eob> pitting family against family, <eob> neighbor against neighbor. <eob>
And at the age of 12 <eol> I experienced war, <eob> destitution in my family, <eob> the deaths of 22 of my relatives <eol> in horrible ways, <eob> as well as the murder <eol> of my elder brother. <eob>
I witnessed killing ... <eob> animals feeding on corpses in the streets, <eob> starvation all around me, <eob> wanton, horrific violence -- <eob> senseless violence. <eob>
I was a young man, <eob> teenager, fascinated by ideas. <eob>
I wanted to learn, <eob> but I could not go to school <eol> for four years. <eob>
After the War of Independence, <eob> my father was put in prison <eol> for two and a half years, <eob> and I used to visit him <eol> every week in prison, <eob> and homeschooled myself. <eob>
My father was released in 1973 <eob> and he fled to England as a refugee, <eob> and we soon followed him. <eob> I was 17. <eob>
So these experiences gave me <eob> a sharp awareness of the atrocities <eol> and injustices in the world. <eob>
And I had a strong desire -- <eob> a very keen, deep desire -- <eob> to right wrongs <eob> and help the victims of oppression. <eob>
While studying at college in the UK, <eob> I met others who showed me <eol> how I could channel that desire <eob> and help through my religion. <eob>
And I was radicalized -- <eob> enough to consider violence correct, <eob> even a virtue under certain circumstances. <eob>
So I became involved <eol> in the jihad in Afghanistan. <eob>
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan population <eol> against the Soviet army. <eob>
And I thought that was jihad: <eob> my sacred duty, <eob> which would be rewarded by God. <eob>
I became a preacher. <eob> I was one of the pioneers <eol> of violent jihad in the UK. <eob>
I recruited, <eob> I raised funds, I trained. <eob>
I confused true jihad <eob> with this perversion <eol> as presented by the fascist Islamists — <eob> these people who use the idea of jihad <eob> to justify their lust for power, <eol> authority and control on earth: <eob> a perversion perpetuated today <eol> by fascist Islamist groups <eob> like al-Qaeda, <eob> Islamic State and others. <eob>
For a period of around 15 years, <eob> I fought for short periods of time <eob> in Kashmir and Burma, <eob> besides Afghanistan. <eob>
Our aim was to remove the invaders, <eob> to bring relief to the oppressed victims <eob> and of course <eol> to establish an Islamic state, <eob> a caliphate <eol> for God's rule. <eob>
And I did this openly. <eob>
I didn't break any laws. <eob>
I was proud and grateful to be British -- <eob> I still am. <eob>
And I bore no hostility <eol> against this, my country, <eob> nor enmity towards the non-Muslim citizens, <eob> and I still don't. <eob>
During one battle in Afghanistan, <eob> some British men <eol> and I formed a special bond <eob> with a 15-year-old Afghani boy, <eob> Abdullah, <eob> an innocent, loving and lovable kid <eob> who was always eager to please. <eob> He was poor. <eob> And boys like him did menial tasks in the camp. <eob>
And he seemed happy enough, <eob> but I couldn't help wonder -- <eob> his parents must have missed him dearly. <eob>
And they must have dreamt <eol> about a better future for him. <eob>
A victim of circumstance caught up in a war, <eob> cruelly thrust upon him <eob> by the cruel circumstances of the time. <eob>
One day I picked up <eol> this unexploded mortar shell in a trench, <eob> and I had it deposited <eol> in a makeshift mud hut lab. <eob>
And I went out on a short, <eol> pointless skirmish -- <eob> always pointless, <eob> And I came back a few hours <eol> later to discover he was dead. <eob>
He had tried to recover explosives <eol> from that shell. <eob>
It exploded, and he died a violent death, <eob> blown to bits by the very same device <eol> that had proved harmless to me. <eob>
So I started to question. <eob>
How did his death serve any purpose? <eob>
Why did he die and I lived? <eob>
I carried on. <eob> I fought in Kashmir. <eob>
I also recruited for the Philippines, <eob> Bosnia and Chechnya. <eob> And the questions grew. <eob>
Later in Burma, <eob> I came across Rohingya fighters, <eob> who were barely teenagers, <eob> born and brought up in the jungle, <eob> carrying machine guns and grenade <eol> launchers. <eob>
I met two 13-year-olds <eol> with soft manners and gentle voices. <eob>
Looking at me, <eob> they begged me to take them <eol> away to England. <eob>
They simply wanted to go to school -- <eob> that was their dream. <eob>
My family -- <eob> my children of the same age -- <eob> were living at home in the UK, <eob> going to school, <eob> living a safe life. <eob>
And I couldn't help wonder <eob> how much these young boys <eol> must have spoken to one another <eob> about their dreams for such a life. <eob>
Victims of circumstances: <eob> these two young boys, <eob> sleeping rough on the ground, <eol> looking up at the stars, <eob> cynically exploited <eol> by their leaders <eob> for their personal lust <eol> for glory and power. <eob>
I soon witnessed boys <eol> like them killing one another <eob> in conflicts between rival groups. <eob>
And it was the same everywhere ... <eob> Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma, <eob> Philippines, Chechnya; <eob> petty warlords got the young and vulnerable <eol> to kill one another <eob> in the name of jihad. <eob> Muslims against Muslims. <eob> Not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers; <eob> not bringing relief to the oppressed. <eob>
Children being used, <eob> cynically exploited; <eob> people dying in conflicts <eob> which I was supporting <eob> in the name of jihad. <eob>
And it still carries on today. <eob>
Realizing that the violent jihad <eob> I had engaged in abroad <eob> was so different -- <eob> such a chasm between what I had experienced <eob> and what I thought was sacred duty -- <eob> I had to reflect <eol> on my activities here in the UK. <eob>
I had to consider my preaching, <eob> recruiting, fund-raising, <eob> training, <eob> but most importantly, radicalizing -- <eob> sending young people to fight and die <eob> as I was doing -- <eob> all totally wrong. <eob>
So I got involved in violent jihad <eol> in the mid '80s, <eob> starting with Afghanistan. <eob>
And by the time I finished it <eol> was in the year 2000. <eob>
I was completely immersed in it. <eob>
All around me people supported, <eob> applauded, <eob> even celebrated what we were doing in their name. <eob>
But by the time I learned to get out, <eob> completely disillusioned in the year 2000, <eob> 15 years had passed. <eob>
So what goes wrong? <eob> We were so busy talking about virtue, <eob> and we were blinded by a cause. <eob>
And we did not give ourselves a chance <eol> to develop a virtuous character. <eob>
We told ourselves we were fighting <eol> for the oppressed, <eob> but these were unwinnable wars. <eob>
We became the very instrument <eol> through which more deaths occurred, <eob> complicit in causing further misery <eob> for the selfish benefit of the cruel few. <eob>
So over time, <eob> a very long time, <eob> I opened my eyes. <eob>
I began to dare <eob> to face the truth, <eob> to think, <eob> to face the hard questions. <eob>
I got in touch with my soul. <eob>
What have I learned? <eob> That people who engage in violent jihadism, <eob> that people who are drawn <eol> to these types of extremisms, <eob> are not that different to everyone else. <eob>
But I believe such people can change. <eob>
They can regain their hearts <eol> and restore them <eob> by filling them with human values <eol> that heal. <eob>
When we ignore the realities, <eob> we discover that we accept <eol> what we are told without critical reflection. <eob>
And we ignore the gifts and advantages <eol> that many of us would cherish <eob> even for a single moment in their lives. <eob>
I engaged in actions I thought <eol> were correct. <eob>
But now I began to question <eol> how I knew what I knew. <eob>
I endlessly told others <eol> to accept the truth, <eob> but I failed to give doubt <eol> its rightful place. <eob>
This conviction that people can change <eol> is rooted in my experience, <eob> my own journey. <eob>
Through wide reading, <eob> reflecting, <eob> contemplation, self-knowledge, <eob> I discovered, <eob> I realized that Islamists' world <eol> of us and them is false and unjust. <eob>
Through considering the uncertainties <eol> in all that we had asserted, <eob> to the inviolable truths, <eob> incontestable truths, <eob> I developed a more nuanced understanding. <eob>
I realized that in a world crowded <eol> with variation and contradiction, <eob> foolish preachers, <eob> only foolish preachers <eol> like I used to be, <eob> see no paradox in the myths and fictions <eol> they use to assert authenticity. <eob>
So I understood the vital importance <eol> of self-knowledge, <eob> political awareness <eob> and the necessity <eol> for a deep and wide understanding <eob> of our commitments <eol> and our actions, <eob> how they affect others. <eob>
So my plea today to everyone, <eob> especially those who sincerely believe <eol> in Islamist jihadism... <eob> refuse dogmatic authority; <eob> let go of anger, hatred and violence; <eob> learn <eob> to right wrongs <eob> without even attempting to justify cruel, <eol> unjust and futile behavior. <eob>
Instead create a few beautiful <eol> and useful things <eob> that outlive us. <eob>
Approach the world, life, <eob> with love. <eob>
Learn to develop <eob> or cultivate your hearts <eob> to see goodness, beauty and truth <eol> in others and in the world. <eob>
That way we do matter <eol> more to ourselves ... <eob> to each other, <eob> to our communities <eob> and, for me, to God. <eob>
This is jihad -- <eob> my true jihad. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
The great philosopher Aristotle said <eob> if something doesn't exist, <eol> there's no word for it, <eob> and if there's no word for something, <eob> that something doesn't exist. <eob>
So when we talk about elections, <eob> we in established democracies, <eol> we know what we're talking about. <eob>
We've got the words. <eol> We have the vocabulary. <eob>
We know what a polling station is. <eob> We know what a ballot paper is. <eob>
But what about countries where <eol> democracy doesn't exist, <eob> countries where there are no words <eol> to describe the concepts <eob> that underpin a democratic society? <eob>
I work in the field <eol> of electoral assistance, <eob> so that's to say we assist <eob> emerging democracies to organize <eob> what is often their first elections. <eob>
When people ask me what I do, <eob> quite often I get this answer. <eob> "Oh, so you're one of these people <eol> who goes around the world <eob> imposing Western democracy <eol> on countries that can't handle it." <eob> Well, the United Nations does not <eol> impose anything on anybody. <eob> It really doesn't, <eob> and also, what we do <eob> is firmly anchored in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, <eob> Article 21, that says <eob> that everybody should have the right <eol> to choose who governs them. <eob>
So that's the basis of the work. <eob>
I specialize in public outreach. <eob>
What does that mean? Another jargon. <eob> It actually means designing <eol> information campaigns <eob> so that candidates and voters <eob> who have never had the opportunity <eol> to participate or to vote <eob> understand where, when, how to register; <eob> where, when, how to vote; <eob> why, why it is important to take part. <eob>
So I'll probably devise <eol> a specific campaign to reach out to women <eob> to make sure that they can take part, <eob> that they can be part of the process. <eob>
Young people as well. <eob>
All sorts of people. <eob> Handicapped people. <eob> We try to reach everybody. <eob>
And it's not always easy, <eol> because very often in this work, <eob> I've noticed now over the years <eol> that I've been doing it <eob> that words are lacking, <eob> and so what do you do? <eob>
Afghanistan. <eob> It's a country with high levels <eol> of illiteracy, <eob> and the thing about that was, <eol> it was in 2005, <eob> and we organized two elections on the same day. <eob>
The reason was because the logistics <eol> are so incredibly difficult, <eob> it seemed to be more efficient to do that. <eob>
It was, <eob> but on the other hand, explaining <eol> two elections instead of one <eob> was even more complicated. <eob>
So we used a lot of images, <eob> and when it came <eol> to the actual ballot, <eob> we had problems, because so many people <eol> wanted to take part, <eob> we had 300 candidates for 52 seats <eob> in the Wolesi Jirga, which is the parliamentary elections. <eob>
And for the Provincial Council, <eol> we had even more candidates. <eob>
We had 330 for 54 seats. <eob>
So talking about ballot design, <eob> this is what the ballot looked like. <eob>
It's the size of a newspaper. <eob>
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Yeah, and — <eob> this was the Provincial Council ballot. <eob> Even more. <eob> So you see, we did use a lot <eol> of symbols and things like that. <eob>
And we had other problems <eol> in Southern Sudan. <eob>
Southern Sudan was a very different story. <eob>
We had so many people who had never, <eol> of course, voted, <eob> but we had extremely, extremely high levels <eol> of illiteracy, <eob> very, very poor infrastructure. <eob>
For example -- I mean, it's a country <eol> the size of Texas, more or less. <eob>
We had seven kilometers of paved roads, <eob> seven kilometers in the whole country, <eob> and that includes the tarmac <eol> where we landed the planes <eob> in Juba Airport. <eob>
So transporting electoral materials, etc., <eob> is exceedingly difficult. <eob>
People had no idea <eol> about what a box looked like. <eob>
It was <eob> very complicated, <eob> so using verbal communication <eol> was obviously the way to go, <eob> but there were 132 languages. <eob>
So that was extremely challenging. <eob>
Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011. <eob>
It was <eob> the Arab Spring. <eob>
A huge amount of hope <eol> was generated by that enormous movement <eob> that was going on in the region. <eob>
There was Libya, there was Egypt, <eol> there was Yemen. <eob>
It was <eob> an enormous, enormous historical moment. <eob>
And I was sitting with the election commission, <eob> and we were talking <eol> about various aspects of the election, <eob> and I was hearing them using words <eol> that I hadn't actually heard before, <eob> and I'd worked with Iraqis, <eol> I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians, <eob> and suddenly they were using these words, <eob> and I just thought, "This is strange." <eob> And what really gave rise to it was this word "observer." <eob> We were discussing election observers, <eob> and the election commissioner was talking <eol> about "mulahiz" in Arabic. <eob>
This means "to notice" <eol> in a passive sort of sense, <eob> as in, "I noticed <eol> he was wearing a light blue shirt." <eob> Did I go and check whether <eol> the shirt was light blue or not? <eob>
That is the role of an election observer. <eob>
It's very active, it's governed <eol> by all kinds of treaties, <eob> and it has got that control function in it. <eob>
And then I got wind of the fact <eol> that in Egypt, <eob> they were using this term "mutabi’," which means "to follow." <eob> So we were now having followers <eol> of an election. <eob>
So that's not quite right either, <eob> because there is a term <eol> that's already accepted and in use, <eob> which was the word "muraqib" which means "a controller." <eob> It's got that notion of control. <eob>
So I thought, three words <eol> for one concept. This is not good. <eob>
And with our colleagues, <eol> we thought perhaps it's our role <eob> to actually help make sure <eol> that the words are understood <eob> and actually create a work of reference <eob> that could be used <eol> across the Arab region. <eob>
And that's what we did. <eob>
So together with these colleagues, <eob> we launched the "Arabic Lexicon of Electoral Terminology," <eob> and we worked in eight different countries. <eob>
It meant actually defining 481 terms <eob> which formed the basis of everything <eol> you need to know <eob> if you're going to organize <eol> a democratic election. <eob>
And we defined these terms, <eob> and we worked with the Arab colleagues <eob> and came to an agreement <eol> about what would be the appropriate word <eob> to use in Arabic. <eob>
Because the Arabic language is very rich, <eol> and that's part of the problem. <eob>
But there are 22 countries that speak Arabic, <eob> and they use modern standard Arabic, <eob> which is the Arabic that is used <eol> across the whole region <eob> in newspapers and broadcasts, <eob> but of course, then from one country <eol> to the next in day to day language and use <eob> it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc. <eob>
So that was another added layer <eol> of complication. <eob> So in one sense you had the problem <eob> that language wasn't fully ripe, if you like, <eob> neologisms were coming up, <eol> new expressions. <eob>
And so we defined all these terms, <eob> and then we had eight correspondents <eol> in the region. <eob>
We submitted the draft to them, <eob> they responded back to us. <eob> "Yes, we understand the definition. <eob>
We agree with it, <eob> but this is what we say in our country." <eob> Because we were not going to harmonize <eol> or force harmonization. <eob>
We were trying to facilitate <eol> understanding among people. <eob>
So in yellow, you see <eol> the different expressions in use <eob> in the various countries. <eob>
So this, I'm happy to say, it took three years <eol> to produce this <eob> because we also finalized the draft <eol> and took it actually into the field, <eob> sat with the election commissions <eol> in all these different countries, <eob> debated and defined <eol> and refined the draft, <eob> and finally published it in November 2014 in Cairo. <eob> And it's gone a long way. <eob>
We published 10,000 copies. <eob>
To date, there's about 3,000 <eol> downloads off the internet in PDF form. <eob>
I heard just recently from a colleague that <eol> they've taken it up in Somalia. <eob>
They're going to produce <eol> a version of this in Somalia, <eob> because there's nothing in Somalia at all. <eob>
So that's very good to know. <eob>
And this newly formed Arab Organization <eol> for Electoral Management Bodies, <eob> which is trying to professionalize <eob> how elections are run in the region, <eob> they're using it as well. <eob>
And the Arab League have now built <eol> up a pan-Arab observation unit, <eob> and they're using it. <eob>
So that's all really good. <eob>
However, this work of reference <eol> is quite high-pitched. <eob>
It's complex, and a lot of the terms <eol> are quite technical, <eob> so the average person <eol> probably doesn't need to know at least a third of it. <eob>
But the people of the Middle East <eob> have been deprived of any form <eol> of what we know as civic education. <eob>
It's part of our curriculum at school. <eob>
It doesn't really exist <eol> in that part of the world, <eob> and I feel it's really the right <eol> of everybody <eob> to know how these things work. <eob>
And it's a good thing to think <eol> about producing a work of reference <eob> for the average person, <eob> and bearing in mind that now <eob> we have a basis to work with, <eob> but also we have technology, <eob> so we can reach out <eol> using telephone apps, <eob> video, animation. <eob>
There's all sorts of tools <eol> that can be used now <eob> to communicate these ideas to people <eob> for the first time in their own language. <eob>
We hear a lot of misery <eol> about the Middle East. <eob> We hear the chaos of war. We hear terrorism. <eob> We hear about sectarianism <eol> and all this horrible negative news <eob> that comes to us all the time. <eob>
What we're not hearing <eol> is what are the people, the everyday people, thinking? <eob> What are they aspiring to? <eob>
Let's give them the means, <eol> let's give them the words. <eob> The silent majority is silent <eob> because they don't have the words. <eob>
The silent majority needs to know. <eob>
It is time to provide people <eol> with the knowledge tools <eob> that they can inform themselves with. <eob>
The silent majority does not <eol> need to be silent. <eob>
Let's help them have a voice. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Some people are obsessed by French wines. <eob>
Others love playing golf <eob> or devouring literature. <eob>
One of my greatest pleasures <eol> in life is, I have to admit, <eob> a bit special. <eob>
I cannot tell you how much <eol> I enjoy watching cities from the sky, <eob> from an airplane window. <eob>
Some cities are calmly industrious, <eob> like Dusseldorf <eob> or Louisville. <eob>
Others project an energy <eol> that they can hardly contain, <eob> like New York <eob> or Hong Kong. <eob>
And then you have Paris <eob> or Istanbul, <eob> and their patina full of history. <eob>
I see cities as living beings. <eob>
And when I discover them from far above, <eob> I like to find those main streets <eol> and highways that structure their space. <eob>
Especially at night, <eob> when commuters make these arteries <eol> look dramatically red and golden: <eob> the city's vascular system <eol> performing its vital function <eob> right before your eyes. <eob>
But when I'm sitting in my car <eob> after an hour and a half <eol> of commute every day, <eob> that reality looks very different. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Nothing -- <eob> not public radio, <eob> no podcast -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Not even mindfulness meditation <eob> makes this time worth living. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Isn't it absurd <eob> that we created cars <eol> that can reach 130 miles per hour <eob> and we now drive them at the same speed <eol> as 19th-century horse carriages? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In the US alone, <eob> we spent 29.6 billion hours <eol> commuting in 2014. <eob>
With that amount of time, <eob> ancient Egyptians could have built <eol> 26 Pyramids of Giza. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We do that in one year. <eob>
A monumental waste of time, energy <eol> and human potential. <eob>
For decades, <eob> our remedy <eol> for congestion was simple: <eob> build new roads or enlarge existing ones. <eob> And it worked. <eob> It worked admirably for Paris, <eob> when the city tore down <eol> hundreds of historical buildings <eob> to create 85 miles <eob> of transportation-friendly boulevards. <eob>
And it still works today <eol> in fast-growing emerging cities. <eob>
But in more established urban centers, <eob> significant network expansions <eol> are almost impossible: <eob> habitat is just too dense, <eob> real estate, too expensive <eob> and public finances, too fragile. <eob>
Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, <eol> it's getting sick, <eob> and we should pay attention. <eob>
Our current way of thinking <eol> is not working. <eob>
For our transportation to flow, <eob> we need a new source of inspiration. <eob>
So after 16 years working in transportation, <eob> my "aha moment" happened <eol> when speaking with a biotech customer. <eob>
She was telling me how her treatment <eob> was leveraging specific properties <eol> of our vascular system. <eob> "Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system -- <eob> all the veins and arteries in our body <eob> making miracles of logistics every day." <eob> This is the moment I realized <eob> that biology has been <eol> in the transportation business <eob> for billions of years. <eob>
It has been testing countless solutions <eob> to move nutrients, gases and proteins. <eob>
It really is the world's most sophisticated <eol> transportation laboratory. <eob>
So, what if the solution to our traffic <eol> challenges was inside us? <eob>
I wanted to know: <eob> Why is it that blood flows <eol> in our veins most of our lives, <eob> when our big cities <eol> get clogged on a daily basis? <eob>
And the reality is that you're looking <eol> at two very different networks. <eob>
I don't know if you realize, <eob> but each of us has 60,000 miles <eol> of blood vessels in our bodies -- <eob> 60,000 miles. <eob>
That's two-and-a-half <eol> times the Earth's circumference, <eob> inside you. <eob>
What it means is that blood vessels <eol> are everywhere inside us, <eob> not just under the surface of our skin. <eob>
But if you look at our cities, <eob> yes, we have some <eol> underground subway systems <eob> and some tunnels and bridges, <eob> and also some helicopters in the sky. <eob>
But the vast majority of our traffic <eol> is focused on the ground, <eob> on the surface. <eob>
So in other words, <eob> while our vascular system <eol> uses the three dimensions inside us, <eob> our urban transportation <eol> is mostly two-dimensional. <eob>
And so what we need is to embrace <eol> that verticality. <eob>
If our surface grid is saturated, <eob> well, let's elevate our traffic. <eob>
This Chinese concept <eol> of a bus that can straddle traffic jams -- <eob> that was an eye-opener <eol> on new ways to think about space and movement <eob> inside our cities. <eob>
And we can go higher, <eob> and suspend our transportation <eol> like we did with our electrical grid. <eob>
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi <eol> are talking about testing <eob> these futuristic networks <eol> of suspended magnetic pods. <eob>
And we can keep climbing, and fly. <eob>
The fact that a company like Airbus <eob> is now seriously <eol> working on flying urban taxis <eob> is telling us something. <eob>
Flying cars are finally moving <eol> from science-fiction déjà vu <eob> to attractive business-case territory. <eob>
And that's an exciting moment. <eob>
So building this 3-D transportation network <eob> is one of the ways we can mitigate <eol> and solve traffic jams. <eob>
But it's not the only one. <eob>
We have to question <eob> other fundamental choices that we made, <eol> like the vehicles we use. <eob>
Just imagine a very familiar scene: <eob> You've been driving for 42 minutes. <eob>
The two kids behind <eol> you are getting restless. <eob>
And you're late. <eob>
Do you see that slow car in front of you? <eob>
Always comes when you're late, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That driver is looking for parking. <eob>
There is no parking spot <eol> available in the area, <eob> but how would he know? <eob>
It is estimated that up to 30 percent <eol> of urban traffic is generated <eob> by drivers looking for parking. <eob>
Do you see the 100 cars around you? <eob>
Eighty-five of them <eol> only have one passenger. <eob>
Those 85 drivers could all fit <eol> in one Londonian red bus. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> Why are we wasting so much space <eol> if it is what we need the most? <eob>
Why are we doing this to ourselves? <eob>
Biology would never do this. <eob>
Space inside our arteries <eol> is fully utilized. <eob>
At every heartbeat, <eob> a higher blood pressure literally compacts <eol> millions of red blood cells <eob> into massive trains of oxygen <eob> that quickly flow <eol> throughout our body. <eob>
And the tiny space inside our red blood cells <eol> is not wasted, either. <eob>
In healthy conditions, <eob> more than 95 percent of their <eol> oxygen capacity is utilized. <eob>
Can you imagine <eol> if the vehicles we used in our cities <eob> were 95 percent full, <eob> all the additional space <eol> you would have to walk, to bike <eob> and to enjoy our cities? <eob>
The reason blood <eol> is so incredibly efficient <eob> is that our red blood cells <eol> are not dedicated <eob> to specific organs or tissues; <eob> otherwise, we would probably <eol> have traffic jams in our veins. <eob>
No, they're shared. <eob>
They're shared by all <eol> the cells of our body. <eob>
And because our network is so extensive, <eob> each one of our 37 trillion cells gets <eol> its own deliveries of oxygen <eob> precisely when it needs them. <eob>
Blood is both a collective <eol> and individual form of transportation. <eob>
But for our cities, <eob> we've been stuck. <eob>
We've been stuck in an endless debate <eob> between creating a car-centric society <eol> or extensive mass-transit systems. <eob>
I think we should transcend this. <eob>
I think we can create vehicles <eol> that combine the convenience of cars <eob> and the efficiencies of trains and buses. <eob> Just imagine. <eob> You're comfortably sitting <eol> in a fast and smooth urban train, <eob> along with 1,200 passengers. <eob>
The problem with urban trains <eob> is that sometimes you have to stop <eol> five, ten, fifteen times <eob> before your final destination. <eob>
What if in this train <eol> you didn't have to stop? <eob>
In this train, <eob> wagons can detach dynamically <eol> while you're moving <eob> and become express, driverless buses <eob> that move on a secondary road network. <eob>
And so without a single stop, <eob> nor a lengthy transfer, <eob> you are now sitting in a bus <eol> that is headed toward your suburb. <eob>
And when you get close, <eob> the section you're sitting <eol> in detaches <eob> and self-drives you right to your doorstep. <eob>
It is collective <eol> and individual at the same time. <eob>
This could be one of the shared, <eol> modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow. <eob>
Now... <eob> as if walking in a city buzzing with drones, <eob> flying taxis, modular buses <eol> and suspended magnetic pods <eob> was not exotic enough, <eob> I think there is another force in action <eob> that will make urban traffic mesmerizing. <eob>
If you think about it, <eob> the current generation of driverless cars <eol> is just trying to earn its way <eob> into a traffic grid made by and for humans. <eob>
They're trying to learn traffic rules, <eol> which is relatively simple, <eob> and coping with human unpredictability, <eob> which is more challenging. <eob>
But what would happen <eol> when whole cities become driverless? <eob>
Would we need traffic lights? <eob>
Would we need lanes? <eob>
How about speed limits? <eob>
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes. <eob>
They never stop at red lights. <eob>
In the first driverless cities, <eob> you would have no red lights and no lanes. <eob>
And when all the cars <eol> are driverless and connected, <eob> everything is predictable <eol> and reaction time, minimum. <eob>
They can drive much faster <eob> and can take any rational initiative <eol> that can speed them up <eob> or the cars around them. <eob>
So instead of rigid traffic rules, <eob> flow will be regulated <eob> by a mesh of dynamic <eol> and constantly self-improving algorithms. <eob>
The result: a strange traffic <eob> that mixes the fast <eol> and smooth rigor of German autobahns <eob> and the creative vitality <eol> of the intersections of Mumbai. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Traffic will be functionally exuberant. <eob> It will be liquid like our blood. <eob>
And by a strange paradox, <eob> the more robotized our traffic grid <eol> will be, <eob> the more organic and alive <eol> its movement will feel. <eob>
So yes, <eob> biology has all the attributes <eol> of a transportation genius today. <eob>
But this process <eol> has taken billions of years, <eob> and went through all sorts <eol> of iterations and mutations. <eob>
We can't wait billions of years <eol> to evolve our transportation system. <eob>
We now have the dreams, <eob> the concepts <eob> and the technology <eob> to create 3-D transportation networks, <eob> invent new vehicles <eob> and change the flow in our cities. <eob>
Let's do it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to start by doing an experiment. <eob>
I'm going to play <eol> three videos of a rainy day. <eob>
But I've replaced the audio <eol> of one of the videos, <eob> and instead of the sound of rain, <eob> I've added the sound of bacon frying. <eob>
So I want you think carefully which one <eol> the clip with the bacon is. <eob>
All right. <eob> Actually, I lied. <eob>
They're all bacon. <eob>
(Bacon sizzles) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My point here isn't really <eol> to make you hungry <eob> every time you see a rainy scene, <eob> but it's to show that our brains <eol> are conditioned to embrace the lies. <eob>
We're not looking for accuracy. <eob>
So on the subject of deception, <eob> I wanted to quote <eol> one of my favorite authors. <eob>
In "The Decay of Lying," <eol> Oscar Wilde establishes the idea <eob> that all bad art comes from copying nature <eol> and being realistic; <eob> and all great art comes from lying and deceiving, <eob> and telling beautiful, untrue things. <eob>
So when you're watching a movie <eob> and a phone rings, <eob> it's not actually ringing. <eob>
It's been added later in postproduction <eol> in a studio. <eob>
All of the sounds you hear are fake. <eob>
Everything, apart from the dialogue, <eob> is fake. <eob>
When you watch a movie and you see <eol> a bird flapping its wings -- <eob>
(Wings flap) <eob>
They haven't really recorded the bird. <eob>
It sounds a lot more realistic <eol> if you record a sheet <eob> or shaking kitchen gloves. <eob>
(Flaps) <eob>
The burning of a cigarette up close -- <eob>
(Cigarette burns) <eob>
It actually sounds a lot more authentic <eob> if you take a small Saran Wrap ball <eob> and release it. <eob>
(A Saran Warp ball being released) <eob>
Punches? <eob>
That's often done by sticking <eol> a knife in vegetables, <eob> usually cabbage. <eob>
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife) <eob>
The next one -- it's breaking bones. <eob>
(Bones break) <eob>
Well, no one was really harmed. <eob>
It's actually ... <eob> breaking celery or frozen lettuce. <eob>
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery) <eob>
Making the right sounds <eol> is not always as easy <eob> as a trip to the supermarket <eob> and going to the vegetable section. <eob>
But it's often a lot more <eol> complicated than that. <eob>
So let's reverse-engineer together <eob> the creation of a sound effect. <eob>
One of my favorite stories comes <eol> from Frank Serafine. <eob>
He's a contributor to our library, <eob> and a great sound designer for "Tron" <eol> and "Star Trek" and others. <eob>
He was part of the Paramount team <eol> that won the Oscar for best sound <eob> for "The Hunt for Red October." <eob> In this Cold War classic, <eol> in the '90s, <eob> they were asked to produce <eol> the sound of the propeller of the submarine. <eob>
So they had a small problem: <eob> they couldn't really find <eol> a submarine in West Hollywood. <eob>
So basically, what they did is, <eob> they went to a friend's swimming pool, <eob> and Frank performed a cannonball, or bomba. <eob>
They placed an underwater mic <eob> and an overhead mic outside <eol> the swimming pool. <eob>
So here's what the underwater <eol> mic sounds like. <eob>
(Underwater plunge) <eob>
Adding the overhead mic, <eob> it sounded a bit like this: <eob>
(Water splashes) <eob>
So now they took the sound and pitched <eol> it one octave down, <eob> sort of like slowing down a record. <eob>
(Water splashes <eob> at lower octave) <eob> And then they removed a lot <eol> of the high frequencies. <eob>
(Water splashes) <eob> And pitched it down another octave. <eob>
(Water splashes <eob> at lower octave) <eob> And then they added a little bit <eol> of the splash <eob> from the overhead microphone. <eob>
(Water splashes) <eob> And by looping and repeating that sound, <eob> they got this: <eob>
(Propeller churns) <eob>
So, creativity and technology put together <eol> in order to create the illusion <eob> that we're inside the submarine. <eob>
But once you've created your sounds <eob> and you've synced them to the image, <eob> you want those sounds to live <eol> in the world of the story. <eob>
And one the best ways to do <eol> that is to add reverb. <eob>
So this is the first audio tool <eol> I want to talk about. <eob>
Reverberation, or reverb, is the persistence <eol> of the sound <eob> after the original sound has ended. <eob>
So it's sort of like the -- <eob> all the reflections from the materials, <eob> the objects and the walls <eol> around the sound. <eob>
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot. <eob>
The original sound <eol> is less than half a second long. <eob>
(Gunshot) <eob> By adding reverb, <eob> we can make it sound like it <eol> was recorded inside a bathroom. <eob>
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom) <eob> Or like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church. <eob>
(Gunshot reverbs church) <eob>
Or in a canyon. <eob>
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon) <eob>
So reverb gives us a lot of information <eob> about the space between the listener <eol> and the original sound source. <eob>
If the sound is the taste, <eob> then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound. <eob>
But reverb can do a lot more. <eob>
Listening to a sound with a lot <eol> less reverberation <eob> than the on-screen action <eob> is going to immediately signify to us <eob> that we're listening to a commentator, <eob> to an objective narrator <eol> that's not participating in the on-screen action. <eob>
Also, emotionally intimate moments in cinema <eob> are often heard with zero reverb, <eob> because that's how it would sound <eol> if someone was speaking inside our ear. <eob>
On the completely other side, <eob> adding a lot of reverb to a voice <eob> is going to make us think <eol> that we're listening to a flashback, <eob> or perhaps that we're inside the head <eol> of a character <eob> or that we're listening <eol> to the voice of God. <eob>
Or, even more powerful in film, <eob> Morgan Freeman. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But what are some other tools or hacks <eob> that sound designers use? <eob>
Well, here's a really big one. <eob> It's silence. <eob> A few moments of silence <eol> is going to make us pay attention. <eob>
And in the Western world, <eob> we're not really used to verbal silences. <eob>
They're considered awkward or rude. <eob>
So silence preceding verbal communication <eob> can create a lot of tension. <eob>
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie, <eob> where it's full of explosions <eol> and automatic guns. <eob>
Loud stops being loud anymore, <eol> after a while. <eob>
So in a yin-yang way, <eob> silence needs loudness <eol> and loudness needs silence <eob> for either of them <eol> to have any effect. <eob>
But what does silence mean? <eob>
Well, it depends how it's used <eol> in each film. <eob>
Silence can place us inside <eol> the head of a character <eob> or provoke thought. <eob>
We often relate silences with ... <eob> contemplation, <eob> meditation, <eob> being deep in thought. <eob>
But apart from having one meaning, <eob> silence becomes a blank canvas <eob> upon which the viewer is invited <eol> to the paint their own thoughts. <eob>
But I want to make it clear: <eol> there is no such thing as silence. <eob>
And I know this sounds like the most <eol> pretentious TED Talk statement ever. <eob>
But even if you were to enter a room <eol> with zero reverberation <eob> and zero external sounds, <eob> you would still be able to hear <eol> the pumping of your own blood. <eob>
And in cinema, traditionally, <eol> there was never a silent moment <eob> because of the sound of the projector. <eob>
And even in today's Dolby world, <eob> there's not really any moment of silence <eol> if you listen around you. <eob>
There's always some sort of noise. <eob>
Now, since there's no such thing as silence, <eob> what do filmmakers <eol> and sound designers use? <eob>
Well, as a synonym, <eol> they often use ambiences. <eob>
Ambiences are the unique background sounds <eob> that are specific to each location. <eob>
Each location has a unique sound, <eob> and each room has a unique sound, <eob> which is called room tone. <eob>
So here's a recording of a market <eol> in Morocco. <eob>
(Voices, music) <eob>
And here's a recording <eol> of Times Square in New York. <eob>
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices) <eob>
Room tone is the addition <eol> of all the noises inside the room: <eob> the ventilation, the heating, the fridge. <eob>
Here's a recording <eol> of my apartment in Brooklyn. <eob>
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler, <eol> the fridge and street traffic) <eob>
Ambiences work in a most primal way. <eob>
They can speak directly <eol> to our brain subconsciously. <eob>
So, birds chirping outside <eol> your window may indicate normality, <eob> perhaps because, as a species, <eob> we've been used to that sound every morning <eol> for millions of years. <eob>
(Birds chirp) <eob> On the other hand, industrial sounds <eol> have been introduced to us <eob> a little more recently. <eob>
Even though I really like them personally -- <eob> they've been used by one of my heroes, David Lynch, <eob> and his sound designer, Alan Splet -- <eob> industrial sounds often carry negative <eol> connotations. <eob>
(Machine noises) <eob>
Now, sound effects can tap <eol> into our emotional memory. <eob>
Occasionally, they can be so significant <eob> that they become a character in a movie. <eob>
The sound of thunder may indicate <eol> divine intervention or anger. <eob>
(Thunder) <eob>
Church bells can remind us <eol> of the passing of time, <eob> or perhaps our own mortality. <eob>
(Bells ring) <eob>
And breaking of glass can indicate <eol> the end of a relationship <eob> or a friendship. <eob>
(Glass breaks) <eob>
Scientists believe <eol> that dissonant sounds, <eob> for example, brass <eol> or wind instruments played very loud, <eob> may remind us of animal howls in nature <eob> and therefore create <eol> a sense of irritation or fear. <eob>
(Brass and wind instruments play) <eob>
So now we've spoken about <eol> on-screen sounds. <eob>
But occasionally, the source <eol> of a sound cannot be seen. <eob>
That's what we call offscreen sounds, <eob> or "acousmatic." <eob> Acousmatic sounds -- <eob> well, the term "acousmatic" comes from Pythagoras <eol> in ancient Greece, <eob> who used to teach behind a veil <eol> or curtain for years, <eob> not revealing himself to his disciples. <eob>
I think the mathematician <eol> and philosopher thought that, <eob> in that way, <eob> his students might focus <eol> more on the voice, <eob> and his words and its meaning, <eob> rather than the visual of him speaking. <eob>
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz, <eob> or "1984's" Big Brother, <eob> separating the voice <eol> from its source, <eob> separating cause and effect <eob> sort of creates a sense of ubiquity <eol> or panopticism, <eob> and therefore, authority. <eob>
There's a strong tradition <eol> of acousmatic sound. <eob>
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice used to sing in rooms <eob> up in galleries close to the ceiling, <eob> creating the illusion <eol> that we're listening to angels up in the sky. <eob>
Richard Wagner famously created <eol> the hidden orchestra <eob> that was placed in a pit between the stage <eol> and the audience. <eob>
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin, famously hid in dark corners of clubs. <eob>
I think what all these masters <eol> knew is that by hiding the source, <eob> you create a sense of mystery. <eob>
This has been seen in cinema over and over, <eob> with Hitchcock, and Ridley Scott in "Alien." <eob> Hearing a sound without knowing its source <eob> is going to create some sort of tension. <eob>
Also, it can minimize certain visual <eol> restrictions that directors have <eob> and can show something that wasn't <eol> there during filming. <eob>
And if all this sounds <eol> a little theoretical, <eob> I wanted to play a little video. <eob>
(Toy squeaks) <eob>
(Typewriter) <eob>
(Drums) <eob>
(Ping-pong) <eob>
What I'm sort of trying <eol> to demonstrate with these tools <eob> is that sound is a language. <eob>
It can trick us by transporting <eol> us geographically; <eob> it can change the mood; <eob> it can set the pace; <eob> it can make us laugh or it can make us scared. <eob>
On a personal level, <eol> I fell in love with that language <eob> a few years ago, <eob> and somehow managed to make it <eol> into some sort of profession. <eob>
And I think with our work <eol> through the sound library, <eob> we're trying to kind <eol> of expand the vocabulary of that language. <eob>
And <eob> in that way, <eob> we want to offer the right tools <eob> to sound designers, <eob> filmmakers, <eob> and video game and app designers, <eob> to keep telling even better stories <eob> and creating even more beautiful lies. <eob>
So thanks for listening. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm here today to talk to you <eol> about a very powerful little word, <eob> one that people will do almost anything <eob> to avoid becoming. <eob>
Billion-dollar industries thrive <eob> because of the fear of it, <eob> and those of us who undeniably are it <eob> are left to navigate a relentless storm <eob> surrounding it. <eob>
I'm not sure if any of you have noticed, <eob> but I'm fat. <eob>
Not the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind, <eob> or the seemingly harmless <eol> chubby or cuddly. <eob>
I'm not even the more sophisticated <eol> voluptuous or curvaceous kind. <eob>
Let's not sugarcoat it. <eob>
I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat. <eob>
I am the elephant in the room. <eob>
When I walked out on stage, <eob> some of you may have been thinking, <eob> "Aww, this is going to be hilarious, <eob> because everybody knows <eol> that fat people are funny." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or you may have been thinking, <eol> "Where does she get her confidence from?" <eob> Because a confident fat woman <eol> is almost unthinkable. <eob>
The fashion-conscious members of the audience <eob> may have been thinking how fabulous I look <eob> in this Beth Ditto dress -- <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
thank you very much. <eob> Whereas some of you might have thought, <eob> "Hmm, black would have been so much more slimming." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You may have wondered, consciously or not, <eob> if I have diabetes, or a partner, <eob> or if I eat carbs after 7pm. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You may have worried that you ate carbs <eol> after 7pm last night, <eob> and that you really should renew <eol> your gym membership. <eob>
These judgments are insidious. <eob> They can be directed <eol> at individuals and groups, <eob> and they can also be directed at ourselves. <eob>
And this way of thinking <eol> is known as fatphobia. <eob>
Like any form of systematic oppression, <eob> fatphobia is deeply rooted <eol> in complex structures <eob> like capitalism, patriarchy and racism, <eob> and that can make it really difficult to see, <eob> let alone challenge. <eob>
We live in a culture <eob> where being fat <eol> is seen as being a bad person -- <eob> lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible <eob> and morally suspect. <eob>
And we tend to see thinness <eob> as being universally good -- <eob> responsible, successful, <eob> and in control of our appetites, <eol> bodies and lives. <eob>
We see these ideas again and again <eob> in the media, in public health policy, <eob> doctors' offices, <eob> in everyday conversations <eob> and in our own attitudes. <eob>
We may even blame fat people themselves <eob> for the discrimination they face <eob> because, after all, <eol> if we don't like it, we should just lose weight. <eob> Easy. <eob> This antifat bias has become <eol> so integral, so ingrained <eob> to how we value ourselves and each other <eob> that we rarely question why we have <eol> such contempt for people of size <eob> and where that disdain comes from. <eob>
But we must question it, <eob> because the enormous value <eol> we place on how we look <eob> affects every one of us. <eob>
And do we really want to live in a society <eob> where people are denied <eol> their basic humanity <eob> if they don't subscribe to some <eol> arbitrary form of acceptable? <eob>
So when I was six years old, <eob> my sister used to teach ballet <eol> to a bunch of little girls in our garage. <eob>
I was about a foot taller and a foot wider <eol> than most of the group. <eob>
When it came to doing <eol> our first performance, <eob> I was so excited about wearing <eol> a pretty pink tutu. <eob> I was going to sparkle. <eob> As the other girls slipped easily <eol> into their Lycra and tulle creations, <eob> not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me. <eob>
I was determined not to be <eol> excluded from the performance, <eob> so I turned to my mother <eob> and loud enough for everyone <eol> to hear <eob> said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu. <eob>
I need a fourfour." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thanks, Mom. <eob>
And although I didn't recognize it at the time, <eob> claiming space for myself <eol> in that glorious fourfour <eob> was the first step <eol> towards becoming a radical fat activist. <eob>
Now, I'm not saying <eol> that this whole body-love thing <eob> has been an easy skip along a glittering path <eol> of self-acceptance <eob> since that day in class. <eob> Far from it. <eob> I soon learned that living <eol> outside what the mainstream considers normal <eob> can be a frustrating <eol> and isolating place. <eob>
I've spent the last 20 years unpacking <eol> and deprogramming these messages, <eob> and it's been quite the roller coaster. <eob>
I've been openly laughed <eol> at, abused from passing cars <eob> and been told that I'm delusional. <eob>
I also receive smiles <eol> from strangers <eob> who recognize what it takes <eol> to walk down the street <eob> with a spring in your step <eol> and your head held high. <eob>
(Cheer) <eob>
Thanks. <eob> And through it all, that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me, <eob> and she has helped me stand before you today <eob> as an unapologetic fat person, <eob> a person that simply refuses <eol> to subscribe <eob> to the dominant narrative <eob> about how I should move through the world <eol> in this body of mine. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I'm not alone. <eob>
I am part of an international community of people <eob> who choose to, rather <eol> than passively accepting <eob> that our bodies are and probably <eol> always will be big, <eob> we actively choose to flourish <eol> in these bodies as they are today. <eob>
People who honor our strength <eol> and work with, not against, <eob> our perceived limitations, <eob> people who value health <eob> as something much more holistic <eob> than a number on an outdated BMI chart. <eob>
Instead, we value mental health, <eol> self-worth and how we feel in our bodies <eob> as vital aspects <eol> to our overall well-being. <eob>
People who refuse to believe <eol> that living in these fat bodies <eob> is a barrier to anything, really. <eob>
There are doctors, academics and bloggers <eob> who have written countless volumes <eob> on the many facets <eol> of this complex subject. <eob>
There are fatshionistas <eol> who reclaim their bodies and their beauty <eob> by wearing fatkinis and crop tops, <eob> exposing the flesh <eol> that we're all taught to hide. <eob>
There are fat athletes <eob> who run marathons, teach yoga <eol> or do kickboxing, <eob> all done with a middle finger firmly <eol> held up to the status quo. <eob>
And these people have taught me <eol> that radical body politics <eob> is the antidote <eol> to our body-shaming culture. <eob>
But to be clear, I'm not saying that people <eol> shouldn't change their bodies <eob> if that's what they want to do. <eob>
Reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts <eol> of self-love <eob> and can look like a million different things, <eob> from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring <eob> to hormones to surgery <eol> and yes, even weight loss. <eob>
It's simple: it's your body, <eob> and you decide what's best to do with it. <eob>
My way of engaging in activism <eob> is by doing all the things <eol> that we fatties aren't supposed to do, <eob> and there's a lot of them, <eob> inviting other people to join me <eol> and then making art about it. <eob>
The common thread through most of this work <eob> has been reclaiming spaces <eol> that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies, <eob> from the catwalk to club shows, <eob> from public swimming pools <eol> to prominent dance stages. <eob>
And reclaiming spaces en masse <eol> is not only a powerful artistic statement <eob> but a radical community-building approach. <eob>
This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
the fat fem synchronized swim team <eob> I started with a group of friends <eol> in Sydney. <eob>
The impact of seeing a bunch <eol> of defiant fat women <eob> in flowery swimming caps and bathers <eob> throwing their legs in the air without a care <eob> should not be underestimated. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Throughout my career, I have learned <eol> that fat bodies are inherently political, <eob> and unapologetic fat bodies <eob> can blow people's minds. <eob>
When director Kate Champion, <eob> of acclaimed dance <eol> theater company Force Majeure, <eob> asked me to be the artistic associate <eob> on a work featuring all fat dancers, <eob> I literally jumped at the opportunity. <eob>
And I mean literally. <eob> "Nothing to Lose" is a work made <eol> in collaboration with performers of size <eob> who drew from their lived experiences <eob> to create a work as varied <eol> and authentic as we all are. <eob>
And it was as far from ballet <eol> as you could imagine. <eob>
The very idea of a fat dance <eol> work by such a prestigious company <eob> was, to put it mildly, controversial, <eob> because nothing like it had ever been done <eol> on mainstream dance stages before <eob> anywhere in the world. <eob>
People were skeptical. <eob> "What do you mean, 'fat dancers?' <eob> Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat? <eob>
Where did they do their dance training? <eob>
Are they going to have the stamina <eol> for a full-length production?" <eob>
But despite the skepticism, <eob> "Nothing to Lose" became a sellout <eol> hit of Sydney Festival. <eob>
We received rave reviews, toured, <eob> won awards and were written <eol> about in over 27 languages. <eob>
These incredible images <eol> of our cast were seen worldwide. <eob>
I've lost count of how many times <eol> people of all sizes <eob> have told me that the show <eol> has changed their lives, <eob> how it helped them shift their relationship <eob> to their own and other people's bodies, <eob> and how it made them <eol> confront their own bias. <eob>
But of course, work <eol> that pushes people's buttons <eob> is not without its detractors. <eob>
I have been told <eol> that I'm glorifying obesity. <eob>
I have received violent death threats <eob> and abuse for daring to make work <eol> that centers fat people's bodies and lives <eob> and treats us as worthwhile <eol> human beings with valuable stories to tell. <eob>
I've even been called <eob> "the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
a comment so absurd that it is funny. <eob>
But it also speaks to the panic, <eob> the literal terror, <eob> that the fear of fat can evoke. <eob>
It is this fear <eol> that's feeding the diet industry, <eob> which is keeping so many of us <eol> from making peace with our own bodies, <eob> for waiting to be the after-photo <eob> before we truly start <eol> to live our lives. <eob>
Because the real elephant in the room <eol> here is fatphobia. <eob>
Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear. <eob>
By advocating for self-determination <eol> and respect for all of us, <eob> we can shift society's reluctance to embrace diversity <eob> and start to celebrate the myriad ways <eol> there are to have a body. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In the spring of 2016, <eob> a legal battle between Apple <eol> and the Federal Bureau of Investigation <eob> captured the world's attention. <eob>
Apple has built security features <eol> into its mobile products <eob> which protect data on its devices <eol> from everyone but the owner. <eob>
That means that criminals, hackers <eol> and yes, even governments <eob> are all locked out. <eob>
For Apple's customers, <eol> this is a great thing. <eob>
But governments are not so happy. <eob>
You see, Apple has made <eol> a conscious decision <eob> to get out of the surveillance business. <eob>
Apple has tried to make surveillance <eol> as difficult as possible <eob> for governments and any other actors. <eob>
There are really two smartphone operating systems <eob> in the global smartphone market: <eob> iOS and Android. <eob> iOS is made by Apple. <eol> Android is made by Google. <eob>
Apple has spent a lot of time and money <eob> to make sure that its products <eol> are as secure as possible. <eob>
Apple encrypts all data <eol> stored on iPhones by default, <eob> and text messages sent from one Apple customer <eol> to another Apple customer <eob> are encrypted by default <eob> without the user having to take any actions. <eob>
What this means is that, <eob> if the police seize an iPhone <eol> and it has a password, <eob> they'll have a difficult time getting <eol> any data off of it, <eob> if they can do it at all. <eob>
In contrast, the security of Android <eol> just really isn't as good. <eob>
Android phones, or at least most <eol> of the Android phones <eob> that have been sold to consumers, <eob> do not encrypt data stored <eol> on the device by default, <eob> and the built-in text messaging app <eol> in Android does not use encryption. <eob>
So if the police seize an Android phone, <eob> chances are, they'll be able to get <eol> all the data they want <eob> off of that device. <eob>
Two smartphones <eob> from two of the biggest companies <eol> in the world; <eob> one that protects data by default, <eob> and one that doesn't. <eob>
Apple is a seller of luxury goods. <eob>
It dominates the high end of the market. <eob>
And we would expect a manufacturer <eol> of luxury goods to have products <eob> that include more features. <eob>
But not everyone can afford an iPhone. <eob>
That's where Android really, <eol> really dominates: <eob> at the middle and low end of the market, <eob> smartphones for the billion <eol> and a half people <eob> who cannot or will not spend <eob> 600 dollars on a phone. <eob>
But the dominance of Android <eol> has led to what I call <eob> the "digital security divide." <eob> That is, there is now increasingly a gap <eob> between the privacy and security of the rich, <eob> who can afford devices <eol> that secure their data by default, <eob> and of the poor, <eob> whose devices do very little to protect them by default. <eob>
So, think of the average Apple customer: <eob> a banker, a lawyer, <eol> a doctor, a politician. <eob>
These individuals now increasingly <eol> have smartphones in their pockets <eob> that encrypt their calls, <eol> their text messages, <eob> all the data on the device, <eob> without them doing really anything <eol> to secure their information. <eob>
In contrast, the poor <eol> and the most vulnerable in our societies <eob> are using devices that leave them <eol> completely vulnerable to surveillance. <eob>
In the United States, where I live, <eob> African-Americans are more likely <eol> to be seen as suspicious <eob> or more likely to be profiled, <eob> and are more likely to be targeted <eol> by the state with surveillance. <eob>
But African-Americans are also <eol> disproportionately likely <eob> to use Android devices <eol> that do nothing at all <eob> to protect them from that surveillance. <eob>
This is a problem. <eob>
We must remember <eol> that surveillance is a tool. <eob>
It's a tool used by those in power <eob> against those who have no power. <eob>
And while I think it's absolutely great <eob> that companies like Apple <eol> are making it easy for people to encrypt, <eob> if the only people who can protect themselves <eob> from the gaze of the government <eob> are the rich and powerful, <eob> that's a problem. <eob>
And it's not just a privacy <eol> or a cybersecurity problem. <eob>
It's a civil rights problem. <eob>
So the lack of default <eol> security in Android <eob> is not just a problem <eol> for the poor and vulnerable users <eob> who are depending on these devices. <eob>
This is actually a problem <eol> for our democracy. <eob>
I'll explain what I mean. <eob>
Modern social movements <eol> rely on technology -- <eob> from Black Lives Matter <eol> to the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street. <eob>
The organizers of these movements <eol> and the members of these movements <eob> increasingly communicate <eol> and coordinate with smartphones. <eob>
And so, naturally governments <eol> that feel threatened by these movements <eob> will also target the organizers <eol> and their smartphones. <eob>
Now, it's quite possible <eob> that a future Martin Luther King <eol> or a Mandela or a Gandhi <eob> will have an iPhone <eol> and be protected from government surveillance. <eob>
But chances are, <eob> they'll probably have a cheap, $20 Android phone in their pocket. <eob>
And so if we do nothing to address <eob> the digital security divide, <eob> if we do nothing to ensure <eol> that everyone in our society <eob> gets the same benefits <eol> of encryption <eob> and is equally able to protect <eol> themselves from surveillance by the state, <eob> not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance, <eob> but future civil rights movements <eol> may be crushed <eob> before they ever reach their full potential. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much. <eob>
I have a question for you. <eob>
We saw recently in the press <eob> that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook <eol> covers over his camera <eob> and does something with his headphone mic jack. <eob>
So I wanted to ask you a personal question, <eol> which is: <eob> Do you do that? <eob>
And, on behalf of everyone here, <eol> particularly myself, <eob> Should we be doing that? <eob>
Should we be covering these things? <eob>
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker -- <eol> actually, I like Band-Aids, <eob> because you can remove them <eol> and put them back on <eob> whenever you want to make a call <eol> or a Skype call. <eob>
Putting a sticker over your web cam <eob> is probably the best thing <eol> you can do for your privacy <eob> in terms of bang for buck. <eob> There really is malware, <eol> malicious software out there <eob> that can take over your web cam, <eob> even without the light turning on. <eob>
This is used by criminals. <eol> This is used by stalkers. <eob>
You can buy $19.99 "spy on your ex-girlfriend" <eol> software online. <eob> It's really terrifying. <eob>
And then, of course, <eol> it's used by governments. <eob>
And there's obviously <eol> a sexual violence component to this, <eob> which is that this kind of surveillance <eol> can be used most effectively <eob> against women and other people <eol> who can be shamed in our society. <eob>
Even if you think you have <eol> nothing to hide, <eob> at the very least, if you have children, <eol> teenagers in your lives, <eob> make sure you put a sticker <eol> on their camera and protect them. <eob>
HW: Wow. <eob> Thank you <eob> so much. CS: Thank you. <eob>
HW: Thanks, Chris. <eob>
For over a decade, <eob> I have studied young people <eol> that have been pushed out of school, <eob> so called "dropouts." <eob> As they end up failed by the education system, <eob> they're on the streets <eol> where they're vulnerable to violence, <eob> police harassment, <eob> police brutality <eob> and incarceration. <eob>
I follow these young people <eol> for years at a time, <eob> across institutional settings, <eob> to try to understand what some <eol> of us call the "school-to-prison pipeline." <eob>
When you look at a picture like this, <eob> of young people who are in my study ... <eob> you might see trouble. <eob>
I mean one of the boys <eol> has a bottle of liquor in his hand, <eob> he's 14 years old <eob> and it's a school day. <eob>
Other people, when they see this picture, <eob> might see gangs, <eob> thugs, delinquents -- <eob> criminals. <eob>
But I see it different. <eob>
I see these young people <eol> through a perspective <eob> that looks at the assets <eol> that they bring to the education system. <eob>
So will you join me in changing the way <eol> we label young people <eob> from "at-risk" to "at-promise?" <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How do I know that these young people <eob> have the potential and the promise <eol> to change? <eob>
I know this because I am one of them. <eob>
You see, I grew up in dire poverty in the inner city, <eob> without a father -- <eob> he abandoned me before I was even born. <eob>
We were on welfare, <eob> sometimes homeless, <eob> many times hungry. <eob>
By the time I was 15 years old, <eob> I had been incarcerated <eol> in juvy three times for three felonies. <eob>
My best friend had already been killed. <eob>
And soon after, <eob> while I'm standing next to my uncle, <eob> he gets shot. <eob>
And as I'm waiting for the ambulance <eol> to arrive <eob> for over an hour ... <eob> he bleeds to death on the street. <eob>
I had lost faith and hope in the world, <eob> and I had given up on the system <eol> because the system had failed me. <eob>
I had nothing to offer <eob> and no one had anything to offer me. <eob> I was fatalistic. <eob> I didn't even think I could make it <eol> to my 18th birthday. <eob>
The reason I'm here today <eob> is because a teacher that cared reached out <eob> and managed to tap into my soul. <eob>
This teacher, <eob> Ms. Russ ... <eob> she was the kind of teacher <eol> that was always in your business. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
She was the kind of teacher <eol> that was like, <eob> "Victor, I'm here <eol> for you whenever you're ready." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I wasn't ready. <eob> But she understood one basic principle <eol> about young people like me. <eob>
We're like oysters. <eob>
We're only going to open up <eol> when we're ready, <eob> and if you're not there <eol> when we're ready, <eob> we're going to clam back up. <eob>
Ms. Russ was there for me. <eob>
She was culturally relevant, <eob> she respected my community, <eol> my people, my family. <eob>
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben. <eob>
He would take me to work with him <eol> because I was broke, <eob> and he knew I needed some money. <eob>
He collected glass bottles for a living. <eob>
Four in the morning on a school day, <eob> we'd throw the glass bottles <eol> in the back of his van, <eob> and the bottles would break. <eob>
And my hands and arms <eol> would start to bleed <eob> and my tennis shoes and pants <eol> would get all bloody. <eob>
And I was terrified and in pain, <eol> and I would stop working. <eob>
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes <eol> and he would say to me, <eob> "Mijo, <eob> estamos buscando vida." <eob> "We're searching for a better life, <eob> we're trying to make something <eol> out of nothing." <eob>
Ms. Russ listened to my story, <eob> welcomed it into the classroom and said, <eob> "Victor, this is your power. <eob>
This is your potential. <eob>
Your family, your culture, <eol> your community have taught you a hard-work ethic <eob> and you will use it to empower yourself <eol> in the academic world <eob> so you can come back <eol> and empower your community." <eob>
With Ms. Russ's help, <eob> I ended up returning to school. <eob>
I even finished my credits on time <eob> and graduated with my class. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But Ms. Russ said to me <eol> right before graduation, <eob> "Victor, I'm so proud of you. <eob>
I knew you could do it. <eob>
Now it's time to go to college." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
College, me? <eob> Man, what is this teacher smoking <eol> thinking I'm going to college? <eob>
I applied with the mentors <eol> and support she provided, <eob> got a letter of acceptance, <eob> and one of the paragraphs read, <eob> "You've been admitted <eol> under probationary status." <eob> I said, "Probation? <eob>
I'm already on probation, <eob> that don't matter? <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was academic probation, <eol> not criminal probation. <eob>
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ do to succeed <eol> with young people <eob> like the ones I study? <eob>
I propose three strategies. <eob>
The first: <eob> let's get rid of our deficit <eol> perspective in education. <eob> "These people come from a culture of violence, <eob> a culture of poverty. <eob>
These people are at-risk; <eol> these people are truant. <eob>
These people are empty containers <eol> for us to fill with knowledge. <eob>
They have the problems, <eob> we have the solutions." <eob> Number two. <eob> Let's value the stories <eol> that young people bring to the schoolhouse. <eob>
Their stories of overcoming insurmountable odds <eol> are so powerful. <eob> And I know you know <eol> some of these stories. <eob>
These very same stories and experiences <eob> already have grit, character <eol> and resilience in them. <eob>
So let's help young people <eol> refine those stories. <eob>
Let's help them be proud of who they are, <eob> because our education <eol> system welcomes their families, their cultures, <eob> their communities <eob> and the skill set <eol> they've learned to survive. <eob>
And of course the third strategy <eol> being the most important: <eob> resources. <eob>
We have to provide adequate resources <eol> to young people. <eob>
Grit alone isn't going to cut it. <eob>
You can sit there and tell me all you want, <eob> "Hey man, pick yourself <eol> up by the bootstraps." <eob> But if I was born <eol> without any straps on my boots -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
How am I supposed to pick myself up? <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Job training, <eob> mentoring, <eob> counseling... <eob> Teaching young people <eol> to learn from their mistakes <eob> instead of criminalizing them, <eob> and dragging them out of their classrooms <eol> like animals. <eob> How about this? <eob> I propose that we implement restorative justice <eol> in every high school in America. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So we went out to test these ideas <eol> in the community of Watts in LA <eob> with 40 young people <eol> that had been pushed out of school. <eob>
William was one of them. <eob>
William was the kind of kid <eol> that had been given every label. <eob>
He had dropped out, he was a gang member, <eob> a criminal. <eob>
And when we met him he was very resistant. <eob>
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say. <eob> "Hey, I'm here <eol> for you whenever you're ready." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So over time -- <eob> over time he began to open up. <eob>
And I remember the day <eol> that he made the switch. <eob>
We were in a large group <eob> and a young lady in our program <eol> was crying <eob> because she told us her powerful story <eob> of her dad being killed <eob> and then his body being shown <eol> in the newspaper the next day. <eob>
And as she's crying, <eol> I don't know what to do, <eob> so I give her her space, <eob> and William had enough. <eob>
He slammed his hands on the desk and he said, <eob> "Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!" <eob>
This young lady's tears and pain <eol> turned into joy and laughter <eob> knowing that her community <eol> had her back, <eob> and William had now learned <eol> that he did have a purpose in life: <eob> to help to heal the souls <eol> of people in his own community. <eob>
He told us his story. <eob>
We refined his story <eob> to go from being the story of a victim <eol> to being the story of a survivor <eob> that has overcome adversity. <eob>
We placed high value on it. <eob>
William went on to finish high school, <eob> get his security guard certificate <eol> to become a security guard, <eob> and is now working at a local school district. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Ms. Russ's mantra — <eob> her mantra was always, <eob> "when you teach to the heart, <eol> the mind will follow." <eob> The great writer Khalil Gibran says, <eob> "Out of suffering have emerged <eol> the greatest souls. <eob>
The massive characters <eol> are seared with scars." <eob> I believe that in this education revolution <eol> that we're talking about <eob> we need to invite the souls <eol> of the young people that we work with, <eob> and once they're able to refine -- <eob> identify their grit, resilience and character <eob> that they've already developed -- <eob> their academic performance will improve. <eob>
Let's believe in young people. <eob>
Let's provide them the right kinds of <eob> resources. <eob>
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me. <eob>
She believed in me so much <eob> that she tricked me into believing <eol> in myself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want to talk to you about my kids. <eob>
Now, I know everyone thinks <eol> that their kid is the most fantastic, <eob> the most beautiful kid <eol> that ever lived. <eob>
But mine really are. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> I have 696 kids, <eob> and they are the most intelligent, <eol> inventive, innovative, <eob> brilliant and powerful kids <eol> that you'll ever meet. <eob>
Any student I've had the honor <eol> of teaching in my classroom is my kid. <eob>
However, because their "real" parents <eol> aren't rich <eob> and, I argue, <eol> because they are mostly of color, <eob> they will seldom get <eol> to see in themselves <eob> the awesomeness that I see in them. <eob>
Because what I see in them is myself -- <eob> or what would have been myself. <eob>
I am the daughter of two hardworking, <eob> college-educated, African-American parents <eob> who chose careers as public servants: <eob> my father, a minister; <eol> my mother, an educator. <eob>
Wealth was never the primary <eol> ambition in our house. <eob>
Because of this lack of wealth, <eob> we lived in a neighborhood <eol> that lacked wealth, <eob> and henceforth a school <eol> system that lacked wealth. <eob>
Luckily, however, we struck <eol> the educational jackpot <eob> in a voluntary desegregation program <eob> that buses inner-city kids -- <eol> black and brown -- <eob> out to suburban schools -- rich and white. <eob>
At five years old, I had to take <eol> an hour-long bus ride <eob> to a faraway place <eob> to get a better education. <eob>
At five years old, I thought everyone <eol> had a life just like mine. <eob>
I thought everyone went to school <eob> and were the only ones <eol> using the brown crayons <eob> to color in their family portraits, <eob> while everyone else was using <eol> the peach-colored ones. <eob>
At five years old, I thought everyone <eol> was just like me. <eob>
But as I got older, <eol> I started noticing things, like: <eob> How come my neighborhood <eol> friend don't have to wake up <eob> at five o'clock in the morning, <eob> and go to a school <eol> that's an hour away? <eob>
How come I'm learning <eol> to play the violin <eob> while my neighborhood friends <eol> don't even have a music class? <eob>
Why were my neighborhood friends <eol> learning and reading material <eob> that I had done two to three years prior? <eob>
See, as I got older, <eob> I started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly, <eob> like I was doing something <eol> that I wasn't supposed to be doing; <eob> taking something that wasn't mine; <eob> receiving a gift, <eob> but with someone else's name on it. <eob>
All these amazing things <eol> that I was being exposed to <eob> and experiencing, <eob> I felt I wasn't really <eol> supposed to have. <eob>
I wasn't supposed to have a library, <eol> fully equipped athletic facilities, <eob> or safe fields to play in. <eob> I wasn't supposed to have <eol> theatre departments <eob> with seasonal plays and concerts -- <eob> digital, visual, performing arts. <eob>
I wasn't supposed to have <eol> fully resourced biology or chemistry labs, <eob> school buses that brought me door-to-door, <eob> freshly prepared school lunches <eob> or even air conditioning. <eob>
These are things my kids don't get. <eob>
You see, as I got older, <eob> while I was grateful <eol> for this amazing opportunity <eob> that I was being given, <eob> there was this ever-present pang of: <eob> But what about everyone else? <eob>
There are thousands of other kids <eol> just like me, <eob> who deserve this, too. <eob>
Why doesn't everyone get this? <eob>
Why is a high-quality education <eol> only exclusive to the rich? <eob>
It was like I had some sort <eol> of survivor's remorse. <eob>
All of my neighborhood friends were experiencing <eob> an educational train wreck <eob> that I was saved from through a bus ride. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I was like an educational Moses screaming, <eob> "Let my people go ... <eob> to high-quality schools!" <eob> I'd seen firsthand how the other half <eol> was being treated and educated. <eob>
I'd seen the educational promised land, <eob> and I could not for the life <eol> of me justify the disparity. <eob>
I now teach in the very same school system <eol> from which I sought refuge. <eob>
I know firsthand the tools <eol> that were given to me as a student, <eob> and now as a teacher, <eol> I don't have access to those same tools <eob> to give my students. <eob>
There have been countless nights <eol> when I've cried in frustration, <eob> anger <eob> and sorrow, <eob> because I can't teach my kids <eol> the way that I was taught, <eob> because I don't have access <eol> to the same resources or tools <eob> that were used to teach me. <eob>
My kids deserve so much better. <eob>
We sit and we keep banging <eol> our heads against this term: <eob> "Achievement gap, <eol> achievement gap!" <eob> Is it really that hard to understand <eob> why these kids perform well and these kids don't? <eob> I mean, really. <eob> I think we've got it all wrong. <eob>
I think we, <eob> as Gloria Ladson-Billings says, <eob> should flip our paradigm <eol> and our language and call it what it really is. <eob>
It's not an achievement gap; <eob> it's an education debt, <eob> for all of the foregone schooling resources <eol> that were never invested <eob> in the education of the black <eol> and brown child over time. <eob>
A little-known secret in American history <eob> is that the only American institution <eol> created specifically for people of color <eob> is the American slave trade — <eob> and some would argue the prison system, <eob> but that's another topic <eol> for another TED Talk. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> The public school system of this country <eol> was built, bought and paid for <eob> using commerce generated from the slave trade <eol> and slave labor. <eob>
While African-Americans were enslaved <eol> and prohibited from schooling, <eob> their labor established the very institution <eob> from which they were excluded. <eob>
Ever since then, every court case, <eol> educational policy, reform, <eob> has been an attempt to retrofit the design, <eob> rather than just stopping <eol> and acknowledging: <eob> we've had it all wrong <eol> from the beginning. <eob>
An oversimplification of American <eol> educational history. <eob>
All right, just bear with me. <eob> Blacks were kept out -- you know, <eol> the whole slavery thing. <eob>
With the help of philanthropic white people, <eob> they built their own schools. <eob>
Separate but equal was OK. <eob>
But while we all know things <eol> were indeed separate, <eob> they were in no ways equal. <eob>
Enter Brown v. the Board <eol> of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954; <eob> legal separation of the races <eol> is now illegal. <eob>
But very few people pay attention <eol> to all of the court cases since then, <eob> that have undone the educational promised <eol> land for every child <eob> that Brown v. Board intended. <eob>
Some argue that today our schools <eol> are now more segregated <eob> than they ever were before <eol> we tried to desegregate them in the first place. <eob>
Teaching my kids about desegregation, <eol> the Little Rock Nine, <eob> the Civil Rights Movement, <eob> is a real awkward <eol> moment in my classroom, <eob> when I have to hear the voice <eol> of a child ask, <eob> "If schools were desegregated in 1954, <eob> how come there are no white kids here?" <eob> (Laughter) <eob> These kids aren't dumb. <eob>
They know exactly what's happening, <eob> and what's not. <eob>
They know that when it comes to schooling, <eob> black lives don't matter <eob> and they never have. <eob>
For years, I tried desperately to cultivate <eol> in my kids a love of reading. <eob>
I'd amassed <eol> a modest classroom library <eob> of books I'd accumulated <eol> from secondhand shops, <eob> thrift stores, <eol> attics -- you know. <eob>
But whenever I said those dreadful words, <eob> "Take out a book and read," <eob> you'd think I'd just declared war. <eob> It was torture. <eob> One day, <eob> after I'd heard about this website <eol> called DonorsChoose, <eob> where classroom teachers create wish lists <eob> of items they need for their classroom <eob> and anonymous donors fulfill them, <eob> I figured I'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list <eob> of the teenager's dream library. <eob>
Over 200 brand-new books were <eol> sent to my room piece by piece. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> To which I'd reply, <eob> "You deserve brand-new books." <eob> The whole experience hit home <eol> for me when one of my girls, <eob> as she peeled open a crisp paperback said, <eob> "Ms. Sumner -- you know, <eol> I figured you bought these books, <eob> 'cause you teachers are always <eol> buying us stuff. <eob>
But to know that a stranger, <eol> someone I don't even know, <eob> cares this much about me <eob> is pretty cool." <eob> Knowing that strangers <eol> will take care of you <eob> is a privilege <eol> my kids aren't afforded. <eob>
Ever since the donation, <eob> there has been a steady stream of kids <eol> signing out books to take home, <eob> and then returning them <eol> with the exclamation, <eob> "This one was good!" <eob> (Laughter) Now when I say, <eob> "Take out a book and read," <eob> kids rush to my library. <eob>
It wasn't that they didn't want to read, <eob> but instead, they'd gladly read <eol> if the resources were there. <eob>
Institutionally speaking, <eob> our public school system has never done <eol> right by the black and brown child. <eob>
We keep focusing on the end results <eob> or test results, <eob> and getting frustrated. <eob>
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder, <eob> "How did it get so bad? <eob>
How did we get here? "Really? <eob>
If you neglect a child long enough, <eob> you no longer have the right <eol> to be surprised <eob> when things don't turn out well. <eob>
Stop being perplexed <eob> or confused <eob> or befuddled <eob> by the achievement gap, <eob> the income gap, <eob> the incarceration rates, <eob> or whatever socioeconomic disparity <eol> is the new "it" term for the moment. <eob>
The problems we have as a country <eob> are the problems we created as a country. <eob>
The quality of your education <eol> is directly proportionate <eob> to your access to college, <eob> your access to jobs, <eob> your access to the future. <eob>
Until we live in a world where every kid <eol> can get a high-quality education <eob> no matter where they live, <eob> or the color of their skin, <eob> there are things we can do <eol> on a macro level. <eob>
School funding should not be decided <eol> by property taxes <eob> or some funky economic equation <eob> where rich kids continue <eol> to benefit from state aid, <eob> while poor kids are continuously having <eol> food and resources <eob> taken from their mouths. <eob>
Governors, senators, mayors, city council members -- <eob> if we're going to call public education <eol> public education, <eob> then it should be just that. <eob>
Otherwise, we should call it <eol> what it really is: <eob> poverty insurance. <eob> "Public education: <eob> keeping poor kids poor since 1954." <eob> (Laughter) <eob> If we really, as a country, <eol> believe that education is the "great equalizer," <eob> then it should be just that: <eob> equal and equitable. <eob>
Until then, there's no democracy <eol> in our democratic education. <eob>
On a mezzo level: <eob> historically speaking, <eol> the education of the black and brown child <eob> has always depended on the philanthropy of others. <eob>
And unfortunately, today it still does. <eob>
If your son or daughter <eol> or niece or nephew or neighbor <eob> or little Timmy down the street <eob> goes to an affluent school, <eob> challenge your school committee <eol> to adopt an impoverished school <eob> or an impoverished classroom. <eob>
Close the divide by engaging <eol> in communication <eob> and relationships that matter. <eob>
When resources are shared, <eob> they're not divided; <eob> they're multiplied. <eob>
And on a micro level: <eob> if you're a human being, <eob> donate. <eob>
Time, money, resources, opportunities -- <eob> whatever is in your heart. <eob>
There are websites like DonorsChoose <eob> that recognize the disparity <eob> and actually want to do something about it. <eob>
What is a carpenter with no tools? <eob>
What is an actress with no stage? <eob>
What is a scientist with no laboratory? <eob>
What is a doctor with no equipment? <eob>
I'll tell you: <eob> they're my kids. <eob>
Shouldn't they be your kids, too? <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
June 2010. <eob> I landed for the first time <eol> in Rome, Italy. <eob>
I wasn't there to sightsee. <eob>
I was there to solve world hunger. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's right. <eob> I was a 25-year-old PhD student <eob> armed with a prototype tool <eol> developed back at my university, <eob> and I was going to help <eol> the World Food Programme fix hunger. <eob>
So I strode into the headquarters building <eob> and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags, <eob> and I smiled as I thought to myself, <eob> "The engineer is here." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Give me your data. <eob> I'm going to optimize everything. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Tell me the food that you've purchased, <eob> tell me where it's going <eol> and when it needs to be there, <eob> and I'm going to tell you the shortest, fastest, cheapest, <eob> best set of routes <eol> to take for the food. <eob>
We're going to save money, <eob> we're going to avoid delays <eol> and disruptions, <eob> and bottom line, we're <eol> going to save lives. <eob> You're welcome. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I thought it was going to take 12 months, <eob> OK, maybe even 13. <eob>
This is not quite how it panned out. <eob>
Just a couple of months into the project, <eol> my French boss, he told me, <eob> "You know, Mallory, <eob> it's a good idea, <eob> but the data you need for your algorithms <eol> is not there. <eob>
It's the right idea but at the wrong time, <eob> and the right idea at the wrong time <eob> is the wrong idea." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Project over. <eob> I was crushed. <eob>
When I look back now <eob> on that first summer in Rome <eob> and I see how much has changed <eol> over the past six years, <eob> it is an absolute transformation. <eob>
It's a coming of age for bringing <eol> data into the humanitarian world. <eob> It's exciting. It's inspiring. <eob> But we're not there yet. <eob>
And brace yourself, executives, <eob> because I'm going to be putting companies <eob> on the hot seat to step up and play <eol> the role that I know they can. <eob>
My experiences back in Rome prove <eob> using data you can save lives. <eob>
OK, not that first attempt, <eob> but eventually we got there. <eob>
Let me paint the picture for you. <eob>
Imagine that you have to plan <eol> breakfast, lunch and dinner <eob> for 500,000 people, <eob> and you only have <eol> a certain budget to do it, <eob> say 6.5 million dollars per month. <eob> Well, what should you do? <eol> What's the best way to handle it? <eob>
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil? <eob> How much? <eob> It sounds simple. It's not. <eob> You have 30 possible foods, <eol> and you have to pick five of them. <eob>
That's already over 140,000 <eol> different combinations. <eob>
Then for each food that you pick, <eob> you need to decide how much you'll buy, <eob> where you're going to get it from, <eob> where you're going to store it, <eob> how long it's going to take to get there. <eob>
You need to look at all of the different <eol> transportation routes as well. <eob>
And that's already <eol> over 900 million options. <eob>
If you considered each option <eol> for a single second, <eob> that would take you over 28 years <eol> to get through. <eob> 900 million options. <eob>
So we created a tool <eol> that allowed decisionmakers <eob> to weed through all <eob> 900 million options <eob> in just a matter of days. <eob>
It turned out to be incredibly successful. <eob>
In an operation in Iraq, <eob> we saved 17 percent of the costs, <eob> and this meant that you had the ability <eol> to feed an additional 80,000 people. <eob>
It's all thanks to the use <eol> of data and modeling complex systems. <eob>
But we didn't do it alone. <eob>
The unit that I worked <eol> with in Rome, they were unique. <eob>
They believed in collaboration. <eob>
They brought in the academic world. <eob> They brought in companies. <eob>
And if we really want to make big changes <eol> in big problems like world hunger, <eob> we need everybody to the table. <eob>
We need the data people <eol> from humanitarian organizations <eob> leading the way, <eob> and orchestrating just the <eol> right types of engagements <eob> with academics, with governments. <eob>
And there's one group that's not being leveraged <eol> in the way that it should be. <eob> Did you guess it? Companies. <eob>
Companies have a major role <eol> to play in fixing the big problems in our world. <eob>
I've been in the private sector <eol> for two years now. <eob>
I've seen what companies can do, <eol> and I've seen what companies aren't doing, <eob> and I think there's three main ways <eol> that we can fill that gap: <eob> by donating data, by donating decision scientists <eob> and by donating technology <eol> to gather new sources of data. <eob>
This is data philanthropy, <eob> and it's the future of corporate <eol> social responsibility. <eob>
Bonus, it also makes good business sense. <eob>
Companies today, they collect mountains of data, <eob> so the first thing they can do <eol> is start donating that data. <eob>
Some companies are already doing it. <eob>
Take, for example, <eol> a major telecom company. <eob>
They opened up their data in Senegal <eol> and the Ivory Coast <eob> and researchers discovered <eob> that if you look at the patterns in the pings <eol> to the cell phone towers, <eob> you can see where people are traveling. <eob>
And that can tell you things like <eob> where malaria might spread, <eol> and you can make predictions with it. <eob>
Or take for example <eol> an innovative satellite company. <eob>
They opened up their data and donated it, <eob> and with that data you could track <eob> how droughts are impacting <eol> food production. <eob>
With that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen. <eob>
This is a great start. <eob>
There's important insights just locked away <eol> in company data. <eob>
And yes, you need to be very careful. <eob>
You need to respect privacy concerns, <eol> for example by anonymizing the data. <eob>
But even if the floodgates opened up, <eob> and even if all companies donated their data <eob> to academics, to NGOs, <eol> to humanitarian organizations, <eob> it wouldn't be enough to harness <eol> that full impact of data <eob> for humanitarian goals. <eob> Why? <eob> To unlock insights in data, you need decision scientists. <eob>
Decision scientists are people like me. <eob>
They take the data, they clean it up, <eob> transform it and put it <eol> into a useful algorithm <eob> that's the best choice <eol> to address the business need at hand. <eob>
In the world of humanitarian aid, <eol> there are very few decision scientists. <eob>
Most of them work for companies. <eob>
So that's the second thing <eol> that companies need to do. <eob>
In addition to donating their data, <eob> they need to donate <eol> their decision scientists. <eob>
Now, companies will say, "Ah! <eob>
Don't take our decision <eol> scientists from us. <eob>
We need every spare second of their time." <eob> But there's a way. <eob>
If a company was going to donate <eol> a block of a decision scientist's time, <eob> it would actually make more sense <eol> to spread out that block of time <eob> over a long period, say <eol> for example five years. <eob>
This might only amount <eol> to a couple of hours per month, <eob> which a company would hardly miss, <eob> but what it enables is really important: <eol> long-term partnerships. <eob>
Long-term partnerships <eol> allow you to build relationships, <eob> to get to know the data, <eol> to really understand it <eob> and to start to understand <eol> the needs and challenges <eob> that the humanitarian organization is facing. <eob>
In Rome, at the World Food Programme, <eol> this took us five years to do, <eob> five years. <eob>
That first three years, OK, that was just <eol> what we couldn't solve for. <eob>
Then there was two years after that <eol> of refining and implementing the tool, <eob> like in the operations <eol> in Iraq and other countries. <eob>
I don't think that's an unrealistic timeline <eob> when it comes to using data <eol> to make operational changes. <eob>
It's an investment. It requires patience. <eob> But the types of results <eol> that can be produced are undeniable. <eob>
In our case, it was the ability <eol> to feed tens of thousands more people. <eob>
So we have donating data, <eol> we have donating decision scientists, <eob> and there's actually a third way <eol> that companies can help: <eob> donating technology to capture <eol> new sources of data. <eob>
You see, there's a lot of things <eol> we just don't have data on. <eob>
Right now, Syrian refugees are flooding into Greece, <eob> and the UN refugee agency, <eol> they have their hands full. <eob>
The current system for tracking people <eol> is paper and pencil, <eob> and what that means is <eob> that when a mother and her <eol> five children walk into the camp, <eob> headquarters is essentially blind <eol> to this moment. <eob>
That's all going to change <eol> in the next few weeks, <eob> thanks to private sector collaboration. <eob>
There's going to be a new system <eol> based on donated package tracking technology <eob> from the logistics company <eol> that I work for. <eob>
With this new system, <eol> there will be a data trail, <eob> so you know exactly the moment <eob> when that mother and her children <eol> walk into the camp. <eob>
And even more, you know <eol> if she's going to have supplies <eob> this month and the next. <eob>
Information visibility drives efficiency. <eob>
For companies, using technology <eol> to gather important data, <eob> it's like bread and butter. <eob>
They've been doing it for years, <eob> and it's led to major operational efficiency improvements. <eob>
Just try to imagine <eol> your favorite beverage company <eob> trying to plan their inventory <eob> and not knowing how many bottles <eol> were on the shelves. <eob> It's absurd. <eob> Data drives better decisions. <eob>
Now, if you're representing a company, <eob> and you're pragmatic <eol> and not just idealistic, <eob> you might be saying to yourself, <eol> "OK, this is all great, Mallory, <eob> but why should I want to be involved?" <eob> Well for one thing, beyond the good PR, <eob> humanitarian aid is a 24-billion-dollar sector, <eob> and there's over five billion people, <eol> maybe your next customers, <eob> that live in the developing world. <eob>
Further, companies that are engaging <eol> in data philanthropy, <eob> they're finding new insights <eol> locked away in their data. <eob>
Take, for example, a credit card company <eob> that's opened up a center <eob> that functions as a hub for academics, <eol> for NGOs and governments, <eob> all working together. <eob>
They're looking at information <eol> in credit card swipes <eob> and using that to find insights <eol> about how households in India <eob> live, work, earn and spend. <eob>
For the humanitarian world, this provides information <eob> about how you might bring people <eol> out of poverty. <eob>
But for companies, it's providing insights <eol> about your customers <eob> and potential customers in India. <eob>
It's a win all around. <eob>
Now, for me, what I find exciting <eol> about data philanthropy -- <eob> donating data, donating decision <eol> scientists and donating technology -- <eob> it's what it means for young professionals like me <eob> who are choosing to work at companies. <eob>
Studies show that the next generation <eol> of the workforce <eob> care about having their work <eol> make a bigger impact. <eob>
We want to make a difference, <eob> and so through data philanthropy, <eob> companies can actually help engage <eol> and retain their decision scientists. <eob>
And that's a big deal for a profession <eol> that's in high demand. <eob>
Data philanthropy makes good <eol> business sense, <eob> and it also can help revolutionize <eol> the humanitarian world. <eob>
If we coordinated the planning and logistics <eob> across all of the major facets <eol> of a humanitarian operation, <eob> we could feed, clothe and shelter <eol> hundreds of thousands more people, <eob> and companies need to step up <eol> and play the role that I know they can <eob> in bringing about this revolution. <eob>
You've probably heard <eol> of the saying "food for thought." <eob> Well, this is literally thought for food. <eob>
It finally is the right idea <eol> at the right time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Très magnifique. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When you come to TEDx, <eol> you always think about technology, <eob> the world changing, becoming more innovative. <eob>
You think about the driverless. <eob>
Everyone's talking <eol> about driverless cars these days, <eob> and I love the concept <eol> of a driverless car, <eob> but when I go in one, you know, <eob> I want it really slow, <eob> I want access to the steering <eol> wheel and the brake, just in case. <eob>
I don't know about you, but I am not ready <eol> for a driverless bus. <eob>
I am not ready for a driverless airplane. <eob>
How about a driverless world? <eob>
And I ask you that <eob> because we are increasingly in one. <eob>
It's not supposed to be that way. <eob>
We're number one, <eob> the United States is large and in charge. <eob>
Americanization and globalization <eol> for the last several generations <eob> have basically been the same thing. <eob> Right? Whether it's the World Trade Organization <eob> or it's the IMF, the World Bank, <eob> the Bretton Woods Accord on currency, <eob> these were American institutions, <eob> our values, our friends, our allies, <eol> our money, our standards. <eob>
That was the way the world worked. <eob>
So it's sort of interesting, <eol> if you want to look at how the US looks, <eob> here it is. <eob>
This is our view of how the world is run. <eob>
President Obama has got the red carpet, <eob> he goes down Air Force One, <eob> and it feels pretty good, <eol> it feels pretty comfortable. <eob>
Well, I don't know how many of you saw <eol> the China trip last week <eob> and the G20. <eob> Oh my God. Right? <eob> This is how we landed <eob> for the most important meeting <eol> of the world's leaders in China. <eob>
The National Security Advisor <eol> was actually spewing expletives <eob> on the tarmac -- <eob> no red carpet, <eob> kind of left out the bottom of the plane <eob> along with all the media <eol> and everybody else. <eob>
Later on in the G20, <eob> well, there's Obama. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Hi, George. <eob> Hi, Norman. <eob> They look like they're about <eol> to get into a cage match, right? <eob> And they did. It was 90 minutes long, <eol> and they talked about Syria. <eob>
That's what Putin wanted to talk about. <eob>
He's increasingly calling the shots. <eob>
He's the one willing to do stuff there. <eob>
There's not a lot of mutual <eol> like or trust, <eob> but it's not as if the Americans <eol> are telling him what to do. <eob>
How about when the whole 20 <eol> are getting together? <eob>
Surely, when the leaders <eol> are all onstage, <eob> then the Americans are pulling <eol> their weight. <eob> Uh-oh. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Xi Jinping seems fine. <eob> Angela Merkel has -- she always does -- <eob> that look, she always does that. <eob>
But Putin is telling Turkish president <eol> Erdogan what to do, <eob> and Obama is like, <eol> what's going on over there? <eob>
You see. And the problem is <eol> it's not a G20, <eob> the problem is <eob> it's a G-Zero world <eol> that we live in, <eob> a world order where there is no single country <eol> or alliance <eob> that can meet the challenges <eol> of global leadership. <eob>
The G20 doesn't work, <eob> the G7, all of our friends, <eol> that's history. <eob>
So globalization is continuing. <eob>
Goods and services and people <eol> and capital are moving across borders <eob> faster and faster than ever before, <eob> but Americanization is not. <eob>
So if I've convinced you of that, <eob> I want to do two things <eol> with the rest of this talk. <eob>
I want to talk <eol> about the implications of that <eob> for the whole world. <eob>
I'll go around it. <eob>
And then I want to talk about <eob> what we think right here <eob> in the United States and in New York. <eob>
So why? What are the implications. <eol> Why are we here? <eob>
Well, we're here <eob> because the United States, <eob> we spent two trillion dollars <eol> on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan <eob> that were failed. <eob>
We don't want to do that anymore. <eob>
We have large numbers <eol> of middle and working classes <eob> that feel like they've not benefited <eol> from promises of globalization, <eob> so they don't want to see it particularly. <eob>
And we have an energy revolution <eob> where we don't need OPEC or the Middle East <eol> the way we used to. <eob>
We produce all that right here <eol> in the United States. <eob>
So the Americans don't want <eol> to be the global sheriff for security <eob> or the architect of global trade. <eob>
The Americans don't want to even be <eol> the cheerleader of global values. <eob>
Well, then you look to Europe, <eob> and the most important <eol> alliance in the world <eob> has been the transatlantic relationship. <eob>
But it is now weaker than it has been <eol> at any point since World War II, <eob> all of the crises, <eol> the Brexit conversations, <eob> the hedging going on between the French <eol> and the Russians, <eob> or the Germans and the Turks, <eol> or the Brits and the Chinese. <eob>
China does want to do more leadership. <eob>
They do, but only in the economic sphere, <eob> and they want their own values, <eol> standards, currency, <eob> in competition with that of the US. <eob>
The Russians want to do more leadership. <eob>
You see that in Ukraine, <eob> in the Baltic states, in the Middle East, <eob> but not with the Americans. <eob>
They want their own preferences and order. <eob>
That's why we are where we are. <eob>
So what happens going forward? <eob>
Let's start easy, <eob> with the Middle East. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, I left a little out, <eob> but you get the general idea. <eob>
Look, there are three reasons <eob> why the Middle East has had stability <eol> such as it is. Right? <eob> One is because there was a willingness to provide <eob> some level of military security <eol> by the US and allies. <eob>
Number two, it was easy to take <eol> a lot of cheap money out of the ground <eob> because oil was expensive. <eob>
And number three <eob> was no matter how bad the leaders <eol> were, the populations were relatively quiescent. <eob>
They didn't have the ability, <eol> and many didn't have the will <eob> to really rise up against. <eob>
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world, <eob> all three of those things <eol> are increasingly not true, <eob> and so failed states, <eob> terrorism, refugees and the rest. <eob>
Does the entire Middle East fall apart? <eob>
No, the Kurds will do better, <eol> and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time. <eob>
But generally speaking, <eol> it's not a good look. <eob>
OK, how about this guy? <eob> He's playing a poor hand very well. <eob>
There's no question he's hitting <eol> above his weight. <eob>
But long term -- I didn't mean that. <eob>
But long term, long term, <eob> if you think that the Russians <eob> were antagonized by the US <eol> and Europe expanding NATO right up to their borders <eob> when we said they weren't going to, <eob> and the EU encroaching them, <eob> just wait until the Chinese <eol> put hundreds of billions of dollars <eob> in every country around Russia <eol> they thought they had influence in. <eob>
The Chinese are going to dominate it. The Russians <eol> are picking up the crumbs. <eob>
In a G-Zero world, this is going <eol> to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin. <eob>
It's not all bad. Right? <eob> Asia actually looks a lot better. <eob>
There are real leaders across Asia, <eob> they have a lot of political stability. <eob>
They're there for a while. <eob>
Mr. Modi in India, <eob> Mr. Abe, who is probably <eol> about to get a third term written in <eob> in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, <eob> of course Xi Jinping <eol> who is consolidating enormous power, <eob> the most powerful leader in China <eob> since Mao. <eob>
Those are the three most <eol> important economies in Asia. <eob>
Now look, there are problems in Asia. <eob>
We see the sparring over the South China Sea. <eob>
We see that Kim Jong Un, <eol> just in the last couple of days, <eob> tested yet another nuclear weapon. <eob>
But the leaders in Asia <eol> do not feel the need <eob> to wave the flag, <eob> to go xenophobic, <eob> to actually allow escalation <eob> of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions. <eob>
They want to focus on long-term <eol> economic stability and growth. <eob>
And that's what they're actually doing. <eob>
Let's turn to Europe. <eob> Europe does look a little scared <eol> in this environment. <eob>
So much of what is happening <eol> in the Middle East <eob> is washing up quite literally <eol> onto European shores. <eob>
You see Brexit and you see <eol> the concerns of populism <eob> across all of the European states. <eob>
Let me tell you <eol> that over the long term, <eob> in a G-Zero world, <eob> European expansion will be seen <eol> to have gone too far. <eob>
Europe went right up to Russia, <eol> went right down to the Middle East, <eob> and if the world were truly becoming <eol> more flat and more Americanized, <eob> that would be less of a problem, <eob> but <eob> in a G-Zero world, <eob> those countries nearest Russia <eob> and nearest the Middle East <eob> actually have different economic capabilities, <eob> different social stability <eob> and different political preferences <eol> and systems than core Europe. <eob>
So Europe was able to truly expand <eob> under the G7, <eob> but under the G-Zero, <eol> Europe will get smaller. <eob>
Core Europe around Germany and France <eol> and others <eob> will still work, be functional, stable, <eol> wealthy, integrated. <eob>
But the periphery, <eob> countries like Greece <eol> and Turkey and others, <eob> will not look that good at all. <eob>
Latin America, a lot of populism, <eob> made the economies not go so well. <eob>
They had been more opposed <eol> to the United States for decades. <eob>
Increasingly, they're coming back. <eob>
We see that in Argentina. <eob> We see it with the openness in Cuba. <eob>
We will see it in Venezuela <eol> when Maduro falls. <eob>
We will see it in Brazil <eol> after the impeachment <eob> and when we finally see <eol> a new legitimate president elected there. <eob>
The only place you see <eol> that is moving in another direction <eob> is the unpopularity <eol> of Mexican president Peña Nieto. <eob>
There you could actually see a slip away <eol> from the United States <eob> over the coming years. <eob>
The US election matters a lot <eol> on that one, too. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Africa, right? <eob> A lot of people have said <eol> it's going to be Africa's decade, finally. <eob>
In a G-Zero world, <eol> it is absolutely an amazing time <eob> for a few African countries, <eob> those governed well with a lot of urbanization, <eob> a lot of smart people, women <eol> really getting into the workforce, <eob> entrepreneurship taking off. <eob>
But for most of the countries in Africa, <eob> it's going to be a lot more dicey: <eob> extreme climate conditions, <eob> radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity, <eob> very poor governance, <eob> borders you can't defend, <eol> lots of forced migration. <eob>
Those countries can fall off the map. <eob>
So you're really going to see <eol> an extreme segregation going on <eob> between the winners <eol> and the losers across Africa. <eob>
Finally, back to the United States. <eob> What do I think about us? <eob>
Because there are a lot of upset people, <eob> not here at TEDx, I know, <eob> but in the United States, my God, <eob> after 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset. <eob> I understand that. <eob> But a lot of people are upset <eol> because they say, "Washington's broken, <eob> we don't trust the establishment, <eol> we hate the media." <eob> Heck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin. <eob>
Look, I do think we have to recognize, <eob> my fellow campers, <eob> that when you are being chased by the bear, <eob> in the global context, <eol> you need not outrun the bear, <eob> you need to only outrun <eol> your fellow campers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I just told you <eob> about our fellow campers. <eob> Right? And from that perspective, <eob> we look OK. <eob>
A lot of people in that context say, <eob> "Let's go dollar. <eob>
Let's go New York real estate. <eob>
Let's send our kids <eol> to American universities." <eob> You know, our neighbors <eol> are awesome: <eob> Canada, Mexico and two big bodies of water. <eob>
You know how much Turkey <eol> would love to have neighbors like that? <eob>
Those are awesome neighbors. <eob>
Terrorism is a problem <eol> in the United States. <eob>
God knows we know it here in New York. <eob>
But it's a much bigger problem <eol> in Europe than the US. <eob>
It's a much bigger problem <eol> in the Middle East <eob> than it is in Europe. <eob>
These are factors of large magnitude. <eob>
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, <eol> and we're complaining bitterly about it. <eob> You know why? Because they can't swim here. <eob> Right? I mean, the Turks would love <eol> to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees. <eob>
The Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right? <eob> That's not the situation. <eob>
That's the reality of the United States. <eob>
Now, that sounds pretty good. <eob>
Here's the challenge. <eob> In a G-Zero world, the way you lead <eob> is by example. <eob>
If we know we don't want <eob> to be <eol> the global cop anymore, <eob> if we know we're not going <eob> to be <eol> the architect of global trade, <eob> we're not going <eob> to be <eol> the cheerleader of global values, <eob> we're not going <eob> to do it <eol> the way we used to, <eob> the 21st century is changing, <eob> we need to lead by example -- <eol> be so compelling <eob> that all these other people are going <eol> to still say, <eob> it's not just they're faster campers. <eob> Even when the bear is not chasing us, <eol> this is a good place to be. <eob> We want <eol> to emulate them. <eob>
The election process this year <eol> is not proving a good option <eob> for leading by example. <eob>
Hillary Clinton says it's going <eol> to be like the '90s. <eob>
We can still be <eol> that cheerleader on values. <eob> We can still be the architect <eol> of global trade. <eob> We can still be the global sheriff. <eob>
And Donald Trump wants to bring <eol> us back to the '30s. <eob>
He's saying, "Our way or the highway. <eol> You don't like it, lump it." Right? <eob> Neither are recognizing a fundamental <eol> truth of the G-Zero, <eob> which is that even though <eol> the US is not in decline, <eob> it is getting objectively harder <eob> for the Americans to impose their will, <eob> even have great influence, <eob> on the global order. <eob>
Are we prepared to truly lead by example? <eob>
What would we have to do to fix this <eob> after November, <eob> after the next president comes in? <eob>
Well, either we have to have another crisis <eol> that forces us to respond. <eob> A depression would do that. <eob> Another global financial crisis could do this. <eob> God forbid, another 9 / 11 <eol> could do that. <eob>
Or, absent crisis, <eob> we need to see <eob> that the hollowing out, the inequality, <eol> the challenges <eob> that are growing and growing <eol> in the United States, <eob> are themselves urgent enough <eob> to force our leaders to change, <eob> and that we have those voices. <eob>
Through our cell phones, individually, <eob> we have those voices <eol> to compel them to change. <eob>
There is, of course, a third choice, <eob> perhaps the most likely one, <eob> which is that we do neither of those things, <eob> and in four years time <eol> you invite me back, <eob> and I will give this speech yet again. <eob>
Thank you very, very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Half of the human workforce <eol> is expected to be replaced <eob> by software and robots <eol> in the next 20 years. <eob>
And many corporate leaders welcome <eol> that as a chance to increase profits. <eob>
Machines are more efficient; <eob> humans are complicated <eol> and difficult to manage. <eob>
Well, I want our organizations <eol> to remain human. <eob>
In fact, I want them to become beautiful. <eob>
Because as machines take our jobs <eol> and do them more efficiently, <eob> soon the only work left <eol> for us humans will be the kind of work <eob> that must be done beautifully <eol> rather than efficiently. <eob>
To maintain our humanity <eol> in the this second Machine Age, <eob> we may have no other choice <eol> than to create beauty. <eob>
Beauty is an elusive concept. <eob>
For the writer Stendhal it was <eol> the promise of happiness. <eob>
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So bear with me <eob> as I am proposing four admittedly <eol> very subjective principles <eob> that you can use to build <eol> a beautiful organization. <eob>
First: do the unnecessary. <eob>
[Do the Unnecessary] <eob>
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya, <eob> the CEO and founder of the yogurt company Chobani, <eob> made headlines when he decided to grant stock <eol> to all of his 2,000 employees. <eob>
Some called it a PR stunt, <eob> others -- a genuine act of giving back. <eob>
But there is something else <eol> that was remarkable about it. <eob> It came completely out of the blue. <eob>
There had been no market <eol> or stakeholder pressure, <eob> and employees were so surprised <eob> that they burst into tears <eol> when they heard the news. <eob>
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful <eol> because they catch us off guard. <eob>
They create something out of nothing <eob> because they're completely unnecessary. <eob>
I once worked at a company <eob> that was the result of a merger <eob> of a large IT outsourcing firm <eol> and a small design firm. <eob> We were merging 9,000 software engineers <eob> with 1,000 creative types. <eob>
And to unify these immensely different cultures, <eob> we were going to launch a third, new brand. <eob> And the new brand color <eol> was going to be orange. <eob>
And as we were going <eol> through the budget for the rollouts, <eob> we decided last minute <eob> to cut the purchase <eol> of 10,000 orange balloons, <eob> which we had meant to distribute <eol> to all staff worldwide. <eob>
They just seemed unnecessary <eol> and cute in the end. <eob>
I didn't know back then <eob> that our decision <eol> marked the beginning of the end -- <eob> that these two organizations <eol> would never become one. <eob>
And sure enough, <eol> the merger eventually failed. <eob>
Now, was it because <eol> there weren't any orange balloons? <eob>
No, of course not. <eob>
But the kill-the-orange-balloons <eol> mentality permeated everything else. <eob>
You might not always realize it, <eol> but when you cut the unnecessary, <eob> you cut everything. <eob>
Leading with beauty means rising <eol> above what is merely necessary. <eob>
So do not kill your orange balloons. <eob>
The second principle: <eob> create intimacy. <eob>
[Create Intimacy] <eob>
Studies show that how we feel <eol> about our workplace <eob> very much depends on the relationships <eol> with our coworkers. <eob>
And what are relationships other <eol> than a string of microinteractions? <eob>
There are hundreds of these every day <eol> in our organizations <eob> that have the potential to distinguish a good life <eol> from a beautiful one. <eob>
The marriage researcher John Gottman says <eob> that the secret of a healthy relationship <eob> is not the great gesture <eol> or the lofty promise, <eob> it's small moments of attachment. <eob> In other words, intimacy. <eob>
In our networked organizations, <eob> we tout the strength <eol> of weak ties <eob> but we underestimate the strength <eol> of strong ones. <eob>
We forget the words of the writer <eol> Richard Bach who once said, <eob> "Intimacy -- <eob> not connectedness -- <eob> intimacy is the opposite <eol> of loneliness." <eob>
So how do we design <eol> for organizational intimacy? <eob>
The humanitarian organization CARE <eob> wanted to launch a campaign <eol> on gender equality <eob> in villages in northern India. <eob>
But it realized quickly <eob> that it had to have this conversation <eol> first with its own staff. <eob>
So it invited all 36 team <eol> members and their partners <eob> to one of the Khajuraho Temples, <eob> known for their famous <eol> erotic sculptures. <eob>
And there they openly <eol> discussed their personal relationships -- <eob> their own experiences <eol> of gender equality <eob> with the coworkers and the partners. <eob>
It was eye-opening for the participants. <eob>
Not only did it allow them to relate <eol> to the communities they serve, <eob> it also broke down invisible barriers <eob> and created a lasting bond amongst themselves. <eob>
Not a single team member <eol> quit in the next four years. <eob>
So this is how you <eob> create intimacy. <eob>
No masks ... <eob> or lots of masks. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When Danone, the food company, <eob> wanted to translate its new company <eol> manifesto into product initiatives, <eob> it gathered the management team <eob> and 100 employees from across different departments, <eob> seniority levels and regions <eob> for a three-day strategy retreat. <eob>
And it asked everybody to wear costumes <eol> for the entire meeting: <eob> wigs, crazy hats, feather boas, <eob> huge glasses and so on. <eob> And they left with concrete outcomes <eob> and full of enthusiasm. <eob>
And when I asked the woman <eol> who had designed this experience <eob> why it worked, <eob> she simply said, "Never underestimate the power <eol> of a ridiculous wig." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Because wigs erase hierarchy, <eob> and hierarchy kills intimacy -- <eob> both ways, <eob> for the CEO and the intern. <eob>
Wigs allow us to use <eol> the disguise of the false <eob> to show something true about ourselves. <eob>
And that's not easy <eol> in our everyday work lives, <eob> because the relationship <eol> with our organizations <eob> is often like that of a married couple <eol> that has grown apart, <eob> suffered betrayals and disappointments, <eob> and is now desperate to be beautiful <eol> for one another once again. <eob>
And for either of us the first step <eol> towards beauty involves a huge risk. <eob>
The risk to be ugly. <eob>
[Be Ugly] <eob>
So many organizations these days are keen <eol> on designing beautiful workplaces <eob> that look like anything but work: <eob> vacation resorts, coffee shops, <eol> playgrounds or college campuses -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Based on the promises <eol> of positive psychology, <eob> we speak of play and gamification, <eob> and one start-up even says <eol> that when someone gets fired, <eob> they have graduated. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That kind of beautiful language <eol> only goes "skin deep, <eob> but ugly cuts clean to the bone," <eob> as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it. <eob>
To be authentic is to be ugly. <eob>
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun <eol> or must give in to the vulgar or cynical, <eob> but it does mean that you speak <eol> the actual ugly truth. <eob>
Like this manufacturer <eob> that wanted to transform <eol> one of its struggling business units. <eob>
It identified, named and pinned on large <eol> boards all the issues -- <eob> and there were hundreds of them -- <eob> that had become obstacles to better performance. <eob>
They put them on boards, <eol> moved them all into one room, <eob> which they called "the ugly room." <eob> The ugly became visible for everyone to see -- <eob> it was celebrated. <eob>
And the ugly room served as a mix <eol> of mirror exhibition and operating room -- <eob> a biopsy on the living flesh <eol> to cut out all the bureaucracy. <eob>
The ugliest part <eol> of our body is our brain. <eob> Literally and neurologically. <eob> Our brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar ... <eob> modern art, atonal music, <eob> jazz, maybe -- <eob> VR goggles for that matter -- <eob> strange objects, sounds and people. <eob>
But we've all been ugly once. <eob>
We were a weird-looking baby, <eob> a new kid on the block, a foreigner. <eob>
And we will be ugly again <eol> when we don't belong. <eob>
The Center for Political Beauty, <eob> an activist collective in Berlin, <eob> recently staged an extreme artistic intervention. <eob>
With the permission of relatives, <eob> it exhumed the corpses <eol> of refugees who had drowned at Europe's borders, <eob> transported them all the way to Berlin, <eob> and then reburied them <eol> at the heart of the German capital. <eob>
The idea was to allow them <eol> to reach their desired destination, <eob> if only after their death. <eob>
Such acts of beautification may not be pretty, <eob> but they are much needed. <eob> Because things tend to get ugly <eol> when there's only one meaning, one truth, <eob> only answers and no questions. <eob>
Beautiful organizations <eol> keep asking questions. <eob> They remain incomplete, <eob> which is the fourth and the last <eol> of the principles. <eob>
[Remain Incomplete] <eob>
Recently I was in Paris, <eob> and a friend of mine took me <eol> to Nuit Debout, <eob> which stands for "up all night," <eob> the self-organized protest movement <eob> that had formed in response to the <eol> proposed labor laws in France. <eob>
Every night, hundreds gathered <eol> at the Place de la République. <eob> Every night they set up <eol> a small, temporary village <eob> to deliberate their own vision <eol> of the French Republic. <eob>
And at the core of this adhocracy <eob> was a general assembly where anybody could speak <eob> using a specially <eol> designed sign language. <eob>
Like Occupy Wall Street <eol> and other protest movements, <eob> Nuit Debout was born <eol> in the face of crisis. <eob>
It was messy -- <eob> full of controversies and contradictions. <eob>
But whether you agreed with <eol> the movement's goals or not, <eob> every gathering was a beautiful lesson <eol> in raw humanity. <eob>
And how fitting that Paris -- <eob> the city of ideals, the city of beauty -- <eob> was it's stage. <eob>
It reminds us that like great cities, <eob> the most beautiful organizations <eol> are ideas worth fighting for -- <eob> even and especially when their outcome is uncertain. <eob>
They are movements; <eob> they are always imperfect, <eol> never fully organized, <eob> so they avoid ever becoming banal. <eob>
They have something <eol> but we don't know what it is. <eob>
They remain mysterious; <eol> we can't take our eyes off them. <eob>
We find them beautiful. <eob>
So to do the unnecessary, <eob> to <eob> create intimacy, <eob> to be ugly, <eob> to remain incomplete — <eob> these are not only the qualities <eol> of beautiful organizations, <eob> these are inherently human characteristics. <eob>
And these are also the qualities <eol> of what we call home. <eob>
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted, <eob> the least we can do is to ensure <eob> that we still feel at home in our organizations, <eob> and that we use our organizations <eol> to create that feeling for others. <eob>
Beauty can save the world <eol> when we embrace these principles <eob> and design for them. <eob>
In the face of artificial intelligence <eol> and machine learning, <eob> we need a new radical humanism. <eob>
We must acquire and promote a new aesthetic <eol> and sentimental education. <eob>
Because if we don't, <eob> we might end up feeling like aliens <eob> in organizations and societies <eol> that are full of smart machines <eob> that have no appreciation whatsoever <eob> for the unnecessary, <eob> the intimate, <eob> the incomplete <eob> and definitely not for the ugly. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Hi. <eob> I want to talk about understanding, <eol> and the nature of understanding, <eob> and what the essence of understanding is, <eob> because understanding is something <eol> we aim for, everyone. <eob>
We want to understand things. <eob>
My claim is that understanding has to do <eob> with the ability to change <eol> your perspective. <eob>
If you don't have that, <eol> you don't have understanding. <eob> So that is my claim. <eob> And I want to focus on mathematics. <eob>
Many of us think of mathematics <eol> as addition, subtraction, <eob> multiplication, division, <eob> fractions, percent, geometry, <eol> algebra -- all that stuff. <eob>
But actually, I want to talk about <eol> the essence of mathematics as well. <eob>
And my claim is that mathematics <eol> has to do with patterns. <eob>
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern, <eob> and this pattern actually emerges <eol> just from drawing circles <eob> in a very particular way. <eob>
So my day-to-day definition <eol> of mathematics that I use every day <eob> is the following: <eob> First of all, it's about finding patterns. <eob>
And by "pattern," I mean a connection, <eol> a structure, some regularity, <eob> some rules that govern what we see. <eob>
Second of all, <eob> I think it is about representing <eol> these patterns with a language. <eob>
We make up language if we don't have it, <eob> and in mathematics, this is essential. <eob>
It's also about making assumptions <eob> and playing around with these assumptions <eol> and just seeing what happens. <eob>
We're going to do that very soon. <eob>
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff. <eob>
Mathematics enables us <eol> to do so many things. <eob> So let's have a look at these patterns. <eob> If you want to tie a tie knot, <eob> there are patterns. <eob>
Tie knots have names. <eob>
And you can also do <eol> the mathematics of tie knots. <eob>
This is a left-out, right-in, <eol> center-out and tie. <eob>
This is a left-in, right-out, <eol> left-in, center-out and tie. <eob>
This is a language we made <eol> up for the patterns of tie knots, <eob> and a half-Windsor is all that. <eob>
This is a mathematics book <eol> about tying shoelaces <eob> at the university level, <eob> because <eob> there are patterns <eob> in shoelaces. <eob>
You can do it in so many different ways. <eob>
We can analyze it. <eob>
We can make up languages for it. <eob>
And representations <eol> are all over mathematics. <eob>
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675. <eob>
He invented a language <eol> for patterns in nature. <eob>
When we throw something up in the air, <eob> it falls down. <eob> Why? <eob> We're not sure, but we can represent <eol> this with mathematics in a pattern. <eob>
This is also a pattern. <eob>
This is also an invented language. <eob>
Can you guess for what? <eob>
It is actually a notation system <eol> for dancing, for tap dancing. <eob>
That enables him as a choreographer <eol> to do cool stuff, to do new things, <eob> because he has represented it. <eob>
I want you to think about how amazing <eol> representing something actually is. <eob>
Here it says the word "mathematics." <eob> But actually, they're just dots, right? <eob>
So how in the world <eol> can these dots represent the word? <eob>
Well, they do. <eob> They represent the word "mathematics," <eob> and these symbols also represent that word <eob> and this we can listen to. <eob>
It sounds like this. <eob> (Beeps) <eob> Somehow these sounds represent <eol> the word and the concept. <eob>
How does this happen? <eob>
There's something amazing going <eol> on about representing stuff. <eob>
So I want to talk about that magic that happens <eob> when we actually represent something. <eob>
Here you see just lines <eol> with different widths. <eob>
They stand for numbers <eol> for a particular book. <eob>
And I can actually recommend this book, <eol> it's a very nice book. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Just trust me. <eob>
OK, so let's just do an experiment, <eob> just to play around <eol> with some straight lines. <eob>
This is a straight line. <eob> Let's make another one. <eob> So every time we move, we move <eol> one down and one across, <eob> and we draw a new straight line, right? <eob>
We do this over and over and over, <eob> and we look for patterns. <eob>
So this pattern emerges, <eob> and it's a rather nice pattern. <eob>
It looks like a curve, right? <eob>
Just from drawing simple, straight lines. <eob>
Now I can change my perspective <eol> a little bit. I can rotate it. <eob>
Is it a part of a circle? <eob> It's actually not a part of a circle. <eob>
So I have to continue my investigation <eol> and look for the true pattern. <eob>
Perhaps if I copy it <eol> and make some art? <eob> Well, no. <eob> Perhaps I should extend the lines like this, <eob> and look for the pattern there. <eob>
Let's make more lines. <eob> We do this. <eob> And then let's zoom out <eol> and change our perspective again. <eob>
Then we can actually see that what started out <eol> as just straight lines <eob> is actually a curve called a parabola. <eob>
This is represented by a simple equation, <eob> and it's a beautiful pattern. <eob>
So this is the stuff that we do. <eob>
We find patterns, and we represent them. <eob>
And I think this is a nice day-to-day definition. <eob>
But today I want to go a little bit deeper, <eob> and think about what <eol> the nature of this is. <eob>
What makes it possible? <eob>
There's one thing <eol> that's a little bit deeper, <eob> and that has to do <eob> with the ability to change your perspective. <eob>
And I claim that when you <eol> change your perspective, <eob> and if you take another point of view, <eob> you learn something new <eol> about what you are watching <eob> or looking at or hearing. <eob>
And I think this is a really important <eol> thing that we do all the time. <eob>
So let's just look at <eol> this simple equation, <eob> x + x = 2 • x. <eob> This is a very nice pattern, <eol> and it's true, <eob> because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc. <eob> We've seen this over and over, <eol> and we represent it like this. <eob>
But think about it: this is an equation. <eob>
It says that something <eol> is equal to something else, <eob> and that's two different <eol> perspectives. <eob>
One perspective is, it's a sum. <eob>
It's something you plus together. <eob>
On the other hand, it's a multiplication, <eob> and those are two different perspectives. <eob>
And I would go as far as to say <eol> that every equation is like this, <eob> every mathematical equation where you <eol> use that equality sign <eob> is actually a metaphor. <eob>
It's an analogy between two things. <eob>
You're just viewing something <eol> and taking two different points of view, <eob> and you're expressing that in a language. <eob> Have a look at this equation. <eob> This is one of the most beautiful <eol> equations. <eob>
It simply says that, well, <eob> two things, they're both -1. <eob>
This thing on the left-hand side <eol> is -1, and the other one is. <eob>
And that, I think, is one <eol> of the essential parts <eob> of mathematics -- you take different <eol> points of view. <eob> So let's just play around. <eob> Let's take a number. <eob> We know four-thirds. We know <eol> what four-thirds is. <eob>
It's 1.333, but we have <eol> to have those three dots, <eob> otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds. <eob>
But this is only in base 10. <eob>
You know, the number system, <eol> we use 10 digits. <eob>
If we change that around <eol> and only use two digits, <eob> that's called the binary system. <eob>
It's written like this. <eob>
So we're now talking about the number. <eob>
The number is four-thirds. <eob>
We can write it like this, <eob> and we can change the base, <eol> change the number of digits, <eob> and we can write it differently. <eob>
So these are all representations <eol> of the same number. <eob>
We can even write it <eol> simply, like 1.3 or 1.6. <eob>
It all depends on how many digits <eol> you have. <eob>
Or perhaps we just simplify <eol> and write it like this. <eob>
I like this one, because this says <eol> four divided by three. <eob>
And this number expresses <eol> a relation between two numbers. <eob>
You have four on the one hand <eol> and three on the other. <eob>
And you can visualize <eol> this in many ways. <eob> What I'm doing now is viewing that number <eol> from different perspectives. <eob>
We can take a grid. <eob> If it's four across and three up, <eol> this line equals five, always. <eob> It has to be like this. <eob>
This is a beautiful pattern. <eob>
Four and three and five. <eob>
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3, <eob> you've seen a lot of times. <eob>
This is your average computer screen. <eob>
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 <eob> is a television or a computer screen. <eob>
So these are all nice representations, <eob> but I want to go a little bit further <eol> and just play more with this number. <eob>
Here you see two circles. <eob>
I'm going to rotate them like this. <eob>
Observe the upper-left one. <eob>
It goes a little bit faster, right? <eob>
You can see this. <eob>
It actually goes exactly <eol> four-thirds as fast. <eob>
That means that when it goes <eol> around four times, <eob> the other one goes around three times. <eob>
Now let's make two lines, and draw <eol> this dot where the lines meet. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> We get this dot dancing around. <eob>
And this dot comes from that number. <eob> Right? Now we should trace it. <eob>
Let's trace it and see what happens. <eob>
This is what mathematics is all about. <eob>
It's about seeing what happens. <eob>
And this emerges from four-thirds. <eob>
I like to say that this is the image <eol> of four-thirds. <eob>
It's much nicer -- (Cheers) <eob> Thank you! <eob> (Applause) <eob> This is not new. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> This has been known for a long time, but -- <eob> But this is four-thirds. <eob>
Let's do another experiment. <eob>
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep) <eob> This is a perfect A, 440Hz. <eob> Let's multiply it by two. <eob> We get this sound. (Beep) <eob>
When we play them together, <eol> it sounds like this. <eob>
This is an octave, right? <eob>
We can do this game. We can play <eol> a sound, play the same A. <eob> We can multiply it by three-halves. <eob> (Beep) <eob>
(Beep) <eob> They sound really nice together. <eob>
Let's multiply this sound by four-thirds. <eob> (Beep) <eob>
What happens? <eob> You get this sound. <eob> (Beep) <eob>
This is the perfect fourth. <eob>
If the first one is an A, this is a D. <eob> They sound like this together. <eob> (Beeps) <eob>
This is the sound of four-thirds. <eob>
What I'm doing now, <eol> I'm changing my perspective. <eob>
I'm just viewing a number <eol> from another perspective. <eob>
I can even do this with rhythms, right? <eob>
I can take a rhythm and play <eol> three beats at one time (Drumbeats) <eob> in a period of time, <eob> and I can play another sound four times <eol> in that same space. <eob> (Clanking sounds) <eob> Sounds kind of boring, <eol> but listen to them together. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Drumbeats and clanking sounds) <eob>
(Drumbeats and cymbals) <eob> Can you hear this? <eob> So, this is the sound of four-thirds. <eob>
Again, this is as a rhythm. <eob> (Drumbeats and cowbell) <eob> And I can keep doing this <eol> and play games with this number. <eob>
Four-thirds is a really great number. <eol> I love four-thirds! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Truly -- it's an undervalued number. <eob>
So if you take a sphere and look <eol> at the volume of the sphere, <eob> it's actually four-thirds <eol> of some particular cylinder. <eob>
So four-thirds is in the sphere. <eol> It's the volume of the sphere. <eob>
OK, so why am I doing all this? <eob>
Well, I want to talk about <eol> what it means to understand something <eob> and what we mean by understanding something. <eob> That's my aim here. <eob>
How do you know that? <eob> Well, as a matter of fact, <eol> you've seen a bunch of R's, <eob> and you've generalized <eob> and abstracted all of these <eol> and found a pattern. <eob>
So you know that this is an R. <eob> So what I'm aiming for here is saying something <eob> about how understanding <eol> and changing your perspective <eob> are linked. <eob>
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer, <eob> and I can actually use this to teach something, <eob> because when I give someone else <eol> another story, a metaphor, an analogy, <eob> if I tell a story <eol> from a different point of view, <eob> I enable understanding. <eob>
I make understanding possible, <eob> because you have to generalize <eol> over everything you see and hear, <eob> and if I give you another perspective, <eol> that will become easier for you. <eob>
Let's do a simple example again. <eob>
This is four and three. <eob>
This is four triangles. <eob>
So this is also four-thirds, in a way. <eob> Let's just join them together. <eob> Now we're going to play a game; <eol> we're going to fold it up <eob> into a three-dimensional structure. <eob> I love this. <eob> This is a square pyramid. <eob>
And let's just take two of them <eol> and put them together. <eob>
So this is what is called an octahedron. <eob>
It's one of the five platonic solids. <eob>
Now we can quite literally <eol> change our perspective, <eob> because we can rotate it <eol> around all of the axes <eob> and view it from different perspectives. <eob>
And I can change the axis, <eob> and then I can view it <eol> from another point of view, <eob> but it's the same thing, <eol> but it looks a little different. <eob>
I can do it even one more time. <eob>
Every time I do this, something else appears, <eob> so I'm actually learning more <eol> about the object <eob> when I change my perspective. <eob>
I can use this as a tool <eol> for creating understanding. <eob>
I can take two of these <eol> and put them together like this <eob> and see what happens. <eob>
And it looks a little bit <eol> like the octahedron. <eob>
What happens? <eob> Have a look at it if I spin it around like this. <eob> Well, if you take two of these, join them <eol> together and spin it around, <eob> there's your octahedron again, <eob> a beautiful structure. <eob>
If you lay it out flat on the floor, <eob> this is the octahedron. <eob>
This is the graph structure <eol> of an octahedron. <eob>
And I can continue doing this. <eob>
You can draw three great circles <eol> around the octahedron, <eob> and you rotate around, <eob> so actually three great circles is related <eol> to the octahedron. <eob>
And if I take a bicycle pump <eol> and just pump it up, <eob> you can see that this is also a little bit <eol> like the octahedron. <eob>
Do you see what I'm doing here? <eob>
I am changing the perspective every time. <eob>
So let's now take a step back -- <eob> and that's actually a metaphor, <eol> stepping back -- <eob> and have a look at what we're doing. <eob>
I'm playing around <eob> with metaphors. <eob>
I'm playing around <eob> with perspectives and analogies. <eob>
I'm telling one story in different ways. <eob>
I'm telling stories. <eob>
I'm making a narrative; <eol> I'm making several narratives. <eob>
And I think all of these things <eol> make understanding possible. <eob>
I think this actually is the essence <eol> of understanding something. <eob>
I truly believe this. <eob>
So this thing about changing your perspective -- <eob> it's absolutely fundamental for humans. <eob>
Let's play around with the Earth. <eob>
Let's zoom into the ocean, <eol> have a look at the ocean. <eob>
We can do this with anything. <eob>
We can take the ocean <eol> and view it up close. <eob>
We can look at the waves. <eob> We can go to the beach. <eob> We can view the ocean <eol> from another perspective. <eob>
Every time we do this, we learn <eol> a little bit more about the ocean. <eob>
If we go to the shore, we can kind of smell it, right? <eob> We can hear the sound of the waves. <eob> We can feel salt on our tongues. <eob>
So all of these are different <eol> perspectives. <eob>
And this is the best one. <eob>
We can go into the water. <eob> We can see the water from the inside. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
This is absolutely essential <eol> in mathematics and computer science. <eob>
If you're able to view <eol> a structure from the inside, <eob> then you really learn something about it. <eob>
That's somehow the essence of something. <eob>
So when we do this, <eol> and we've taken this journey <eob> into the ocean, <eob> we use our imagination. <eob>
And I think this is one level deeper, <eob> and it's actually a requirement <eol> for changing your perspective. <eob>
We can do a little game. <eob>
You can imagine that you're sitting there. <eob>
You can imagine that you're up here, <eol> and that you're sitting here. <eob>
You can view yourselves from the outside. <eob>
That's really a strange thing. <eob>
You're changing your perspective. <eob>
You're using your imagination, <eob> and you're viewing yourself <eol> from the outside. <eob> That requires imagination. <eob>
Mathematics and computer science are <eol> the most imaginative art forms ever. <eob>
And this thing about changing perspectives <eob> should sound a little bit familiar to you, <eob> because we do it every day. <eob>
And then it's called empathy. <eob>
When I view the world <eol> from your perspective, <eob> I have empathy with you. <eob>
That requires imagination. <eob> If I really, truly understand <eob> what the world looks like from your perspective, <eob> I am empathetic. <eob> And that is how we obtain understanding. <eob>
And this is all over mathematics <eol> and this is all over computer science, <eob> and there's a really deep connection <eol> between empathy and these sciences. <eob>
So my conclusion <eob> is the following: <eob> understanding something really deeply <eob> has to do <eob> with the ability to change your perspective. <eob>
So my advice to you is: <eol> try to change your perspective. <eob>
You can study mathematics. <eob>
It's a wonderful way to train your brain. <eob>
Changing your perspective <eol> makes your mind more flexible. <eob> It makes you open to new things, <eob> and it makes you able to understand things. <eob>
Thank you! <eob> And to use yet another metaphor: <eob> have a mind like water. <eob> That's nice. <eob>
I feel incredibly lucky <eob> to be from a country <eob> that's generally considered <eol> to be the best place in the world <eob> to be a woman. <eob>
In 1975, when I was seven years old, <eob> women in Iceland went on a strike. <eob>
They did no work that day, <eob> whether they held professional jobs <eob> or had the work of the home. <eob>
They marched into the center <eol> of Reykjavík -- <eob> 90 percent of women participated -- <eob> and peacefully and in solidarity <eob> asked for equality. <eob>
Nothing worked in Iceland that day, <eob> because nothing works when women <eol> are not at work. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Five years later, Icelanders <eol> had the courage <eob> to be the first country in the world <eob> to democratically elect a woman <eol> as their president. <eob>
I will never forget this day, <eob> that President Vigdís, as we know <eol> her by her first name, <eob> stepped out on the balcony of her own home, <eob> a single mom with her daughter <eol> by her side as she had won. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This woman was an incredible role model <eob> for me and everyone growing up <eol> at that time, <eob> including boys. <eob>
She frequently shares the story <eol> of how a young boy approached her <eob> after a couple of terms in office <eob> and asked, "Can boys really grow up <eol> to be president?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Role models really matter, <eob> but even with such strong role models <eob> who I am so grateful for, <eob> when I was encouraged <eol> to run for president, <eob> my first reaction was, <eol> "Who am I to run for president? <eob>
Who am I to be president?" <eob>
It turns out that women <eob> are less likely to consider <eol> running than men. <eob>
So a study done in the US in 2011 <eob> showed that 62 percent of men <eol> had considered running for office, <eob> but 45 percent of women. <eob>
That's gap of 16 percentage points, <eob> and it's the same gap <eol> that existed a decade earlier. <eob>
And it really is a shame, <eob> because I am so convinced that the world <eol> is in real need for women leaders <eob> and more principle-based leadership <eob> in general. <eob>
So my decision to run <eob> ultimately came down to the fact <eob> that I felt <eob> that I had to do my bit, <eob> even if I had no political experience, <eob> to step up and try to be part of creating the world <eob> that will make sense and be sustainable <eob> for our kids, <eob> and a world where we truly allow <eol> both our boys and girls <eob> to be all they can be. <eob>
And it was the journey of my life. <eob> It was amazing. <eob> The journey started with potentially <eol> as many as 20 candidates. <eob>
It boiled down <eol> to nine candidates qualifying, <eob> and ultimately the race <eol> came down to four of us, <eob> three men and me. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But that's not all the drama yet. <eob>
You may think you have drama in the US, <eob> but I can -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I can assure you we had <eol> our own drama in Iceland. <eob>
So our sitting president of 20 years <eob> announced initially that he was not <eol> going to run, <eob> which is probably what gave rise <eob> to so many candidates considering running. <eob>
Then later he changed his mind <eob> when our prime minister resigned <eob> following the infamous Panama Papers <eob> that implicated him and his family. <eob>
And there was a popular protest in Iceland, <eob> so the sitting president <eol> thought they needed a trusted leader. <eob>
A few days later, relations <eol> to his wife and her family's companies <eob> were also discovered <eol> in the Panama Papers, <eob> and so he withdrew <eol> from the race again. <eob>
Before doing so, he said he was doing that <eob> because now there were <eol> two qualified men <eob> who he felt could fill his shoes <eol> running for office. <eob>
So on May 9, 45 days before election day, <eob> it was not looking too good for me. <eob>
I did not even make the graph <eol> in the newspaper. <eob>
The polls had me at 1 percent, <eob> but that was still the highest <eob> that any woman announcing her candidacy <eol> had earned. <eob>
So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard <eob> to get my seat at the table <eob> and access to television, <eob> because the network decided <eol> that they would only include <eob> those with 2.5 percent <eol> or more in the polls <eob> in the first TV debate. <eob>
I found out on the afternoon <eol> of the first TV debate <eob> that I would participate <eol> along with the three men, <eob> and I found out on live TV <eob> that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent <eol> on the day of the first TV debate. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, challenges. <eob> The foremost challenges I had to face <eol> and overcome on this journey <eob> had to do with media, muscle and money. <eob>
Let's start with media. <eob>
There are those who say <eol> gender doesn't matter <eob> when it comes to media and politics. <eob>
I can't say that I agree. <eob>
It proved harder for me to both get <eol> access and airtime in media. <eob>
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate <eol> appeared in broadcast media <eob> 87 times in the months <eol> leading up to the elections, <eob> whereas I appeared 31 times. <eob>
And I am not saying media <eol> is doing this consciously. <eob>
I think largely this has to do with unconscious bias, <eob> because in media, much like everywhere else, <eob> we have both conscious and unconscious bias, <eob> and we need to have the courage <eol> to talk about it if we want to change it. <eob>
When I finally got access to TV, <eob> the first question I got was, <eol> "Are you going to quit?" <eob> And that was a hard one. <eob>
But of course, with 1 percent <eol> to 2.5 percent in the polls, <eob> maybe it's understandable. <eob>
But media really matters, <eol> and every time I appeared on TV, <eob> we saw and experienced <eol> a rise in the polls, <eob> so I know firsthand <eol> how much this matters <eob> and why we have to talk about it. <eob>
I was the only one out <eol> of the final four candidates <eob> that never got a front page interview. <eob>
I was sometimes left out of the questions <eol> asked of all other candidates <eob> and out of coverage about the elections. <eob>
So I did face this, <eob> but I will say this to compliment <eol> the Icelandic media. <eob> I got few if any comments about my hair <eol> and pantsuit. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So kudos to them. <eob> But there is another experience <eol> that's very important. <eob>
I ran as an independent candidate, <eob> not with any political party <eol> or muscle behind me. <eob>
That lack of experience <eob> and lack of access <eol> to resources <eob> probably came at a cost to our campaign, <eob> but it also allowed us to innovate <eol> and do politics differently. <eob>
We ran a positive campaign, <eob> and we probably changed the tone <eol> of the election for others by doing that. <eob>
It may be the reason <eol> why I had less airtime on TV, <eob> because I wanted to show <eol> other contenders respect. <eob>
When access to media <eol> proved to be so difficult, <eob> we ran our own media. <eob>
I ran live Facebook sessions <eob> where I took questions from voters <eol> on anything and responded on the spot. <eob>
And we put all the questions <eol> I got and all the answers on an open Facebook <eob> because we thought transparency is important <eob> if you want to establish trust. <eob>
And when reaching young voters <eol> proved to be challenging, <eob> I became a Snapchatter. <eob>
I got young people <eol> to teach me how to do that, <eob> and I used every filter on Snapchat <eol> during the last part of the campaign. <eob>
And I actually had to use a lot of humor <eol> and humility, as I was very bad at it. <eob>
But we grew the following <eol> amongst young people by doing that. <eob>
So it's possible to run <eol> a different type of campaign. <eob>
But unfortunately, one cannot talk about politics <eol> without mentioning money. <eob>
I am sad that it is that way, <eol> but it's true, <eob> and we had less financial resources <eol> than the other candidates. <eob>
This probably was partly due to the fact <eob> that I think I had a harder time asking <eol> for financial support. <eob>
And maybe I also had the ambition <eol> to do more with less. <eob>
Some would call <eol> that very womanly of me. <eob> But even with one third the media, <eol> one third the financial resources, <eob> and only an entrepreneurial team, <eol> but an amazing team, <eob> we managed to surprise everyone <eol> on election night, <eob> when the first numbers came in. <eob>
I surprised myself, as you may see <eol> in that photo. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the first numbers, <eob> I came in neck to neck <eol> to the leading candidate. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
Well, too early, because <eol> I didn't quite pull that, <eob> but I came in second, <eob> and we went a long way from the one percent, <eob> with nearly a third of the vote, <eob> and we beat the polls <eol> by an unprecedented margin, <eob> or 10 percentage points above <eol> what the last poll came in at. <eob>
Some people call me the real winner <eol> of the election because of this, <eob> and there are many people <eol> who encouraged me to run again. <eob>
But what really makes me proud <eob> is to know that I earned <eob> proportionately higher percentage <eol> support from the young people, <eob> and a lot of people encouraged <eol> my daughter to run in 2040. <eob>
She is 13, <eob> and she had never been on TV before. <eob>
And on election day, <eol> I observed her on TV repeatedly, <eob> and she was smart, she was self-confident, <eob> she was sincere, <eol> and she was supportive of her mother. <eob>
This was probably the highlight <eol> of my campaign. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But there was another one. <eob>
These are preschool girls <eol> out on a walk, <eob> and they found a poster of me <eol> on a bus stop, <eob> and they saw the need to kiss it. <eob>
Audience: Aw! <eob>
This picture was really enough <eol> of a win for me. <eob>
What we see, we can be. <eob>
So screw fear and challenges. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It matters that women run, <eob> and it's time for women <eol> to run for office, <eob> be it the office of the CEO <eol> or the office of the president. <eob>
I also managed to put an impression <eol> on your very own "New Yorker." <eob> I earned a new title, <eol> "A living emoji of sincerity." <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
It is possibly my proudest title yet, <eob> and the reason is that women <eol> too often get penalized <eob> for using what I call their emotional capital, <eob> but I know from experience <eol> that we become so good <eob> when we do just that. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And we need more of that. <eob>
We celebrated as if we had <eol> won on election night, <eob> because that's how we felt. <eob>
So you don't necessarily <eol> have to reach that office. <eob>
You just have to go for it, <eob> and you, your family, your friends, <eol> everyone working with you, <eob> if you do it well, you will grow <eol> beyond anything you will experience before. <eob>
So we had a good time, <eob> and I learned a lot on this journey, <eob> probably more lessons than I can share here <eob> in the time we have today. <eob>
But rest assured, it was hard work. <eob>
I lost a lot of sleep during those months. <eob>
It took resilience and perseverance to not quit, <eob> but I learned something <eol> that I knew before on the one percent day, <eob> and that is that you can only be good <eob> when you are truly, authentically <eol> listening to your own voice <eob> and working in alignment with that. <eob>
As a good sister of mine sometimes says, <eob> you may cheat on your intuition, <eob> but your intuition never cheats on you. <eob>
I think it's also very important, <eol> and you all know this, <eob> that on any journey you go on, <eob> it's the team you take along. <eob>
It's having people around you <eol> who share your values, your vision, <eob> but are different in every other way. <eob>
That's the formula for success for me, <eob> and I am blessed with an amazing husband, <eob> here today, <eob> an incredible family -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
and great friends, <eob> and we came together as entrepreneurs <eol> in the political arena, <eob> and pulled something off that everyone said <eol> would be impossible. <eob>
As a matter of fact, <eol> the leading PR expert told me <eob> before I made my decision <eob> that I would do well to get seven percent. <eob>
I appreciated his perspective, <eol> because he was probably right, <eob> and he was basing it <eol> on valuable experience. <eob>
But on the one percent day, <eob> I decided here to show him <eol> that he was wrong. <eob>
It's very important to mention this, <eol> because I did lose a lot of sleep, <eob> and I worked hard, <eol> and so did the people with me. <eob> We can never go the distance if we forget <eol> to take care of ourselves. <eob>
And it's two things that I think <eol> are very important in that, <eob> in surrounding yourself with people <eol> and practices that nourish you, <eob> but it's equally important, <eol> maybe even more important, <eob> to have the courage <eol> to get rid of people and practices <eob> that take away your energy, <eob> including the wonderful bloggers and commentators. <eob>
I took a lot of support from others in doing this, <eob> and I made the decision to go high <eol> when others went low, <eob> and that's partly how I kept my energy <eol> going throughout all of this. <eob>
And when I lost my energy for a moment -- <eob> and I did from time to time, <eol> it wasn't easy -- <eob> I went back to why I decided to run, <eob> and how I had decided <eol> to run my own race. <eob>
I called it a 4G campaign, <eob> the G's representing the Icelandic words. <eob>
And the first one is called "Gagn." <eob> I ran to do good, <eob> to be of service, <eob> and I wanted servant leadership <eob> to be at the center of how I worked <eol> and everybody else in the campaign. <eob>
Second one is "Gleði," or joy. <eob>
I decided to enjoy the journey. <eob>
There was a lot to be taken <eol> out of the journey, <eob> no matter if the destination <eol> was reached or not. <eob>
And I tried my utmost to inspire <eol> others to do so as well. <eob>
Third is "Gagnsæi." <eob> I was open to any questions. <eob>
I kept no secrets, <eob> and it was all open, <eol> on Facebook and websites. <eob>
Because I think if you're <eol> choosing your president, <eob> you deserve answers <eol> to your questions. <eob>
Last but not least, <eob> I don't need to explain that in this room, <eob> we ran on the principle of Girlpower. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
I am incredibly glad <eob> that I had the courage to run, <eob> to risk failure but receive success <eob> on so many levels. <eob>
I can't tell you <eol> that it was easy, <eob> but I can tell you, <eob> and I think my entire team <eol> will agree with me, <eob> that it was worth it. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet. <eob>
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd. <eob>
PM: I can't let you go without saying <eob> that probably everybody in the room <eol> is ready to move to Iceland <eob> and vote for you. <eob>
But of course we probably <eol> can't vote there, <eob> but one thing we can get from Iceland <eob> and have always gotten <eol> is inspiration. <eob>
I mean, I'm old enough <eol> to remember 1975 <eob> when all the Icelandic women walked out, <eob> and that really was a very big factor <eol> in launching the women's movement. <eob>
You made a reference to it earlier. <eob>
I'd love to bring the picture back up <eob> and just have us remember <eol> what it was like when a country came to a standstill. <eob>
And then what you may not know <eob> because our American media <eol> did not report it, <eob> the Icelandic women walked out <eol> again on Monday. Right? <eob>
HT: Yes, they did. <eob>
PM: Can you tell us about that? <eob>
HT: Yes, so 41 years <eol> after the original strike, <eob> we may be the best place in the world <eob> to be a woman, <eob> but our work isn't done. <eob>
So at 2: 38pm on Monday, <eob> women in Iceland left work, <eob> because that's when they had earned <eol> their day's salary. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What's really cool about this <eob> is that young women and men participated <eob> in greater numbers than before, <eob> because it is time that we close the pay gap. <eob>
PM: So I'm not going <eol> to ask Halla to commit right now <eob> to what she's doing next, <eob> but I will say that you'd have <eol> a very large volunteer army <eob> should you decide to do that again. <eob> Thank you Halla. <eob>
HT: <eob> Thank you <eob> all. <eob>
Last year, <eob> three of my family members <eol> were gruesomely murdered <eob> in a hate crime. <eob>
It goes without saying that it's really difficult <eob> for me to be here today, <eob> but my brother Deah, <eob> his wife Yusor, <eob> and her sister Razan <eob> don't give me much of a choice. <eob>
I'm hopeful that by the end <eol> of this talk you will make a choice, <eob> and join me in standing up <eol> against hate. <eob>
It's December 27, 2014: <eob> the morning of my brother's wedding day. <eob>
He asks me to come <eol> over and comb his hair <eob> in preparation for his wedding <eol> photo shoot. <eob>
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball, <eol> particularly Steph Curry, fanatic -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
An American kid <eol> in dental school ready to take on the world. <eob>
When Deah and Yusor have their first dance, <eob> I see the love in his eyes, <eob> her reciprocated joy, <eob> and my emotions begin to overwhelm me. <eob>
I move to the back of the hall <eol> and burst into tears. <eob>
And the second the song finishes playing, <eob> he beelines towards me, <eob> buries me into his arms <eob> and rocks me back and forth. <eob>
Even in that moment, <eob> when everything was so distracting, <eob> he was attuned to me. <eob>
He cups my face and says, <eob> "Suzanne, <eob> I am who I am because of you. <eob> Thank you for everything. <eob>
I love you." <eob>
About a month later, I'm back home <eol> in North Carolina for a short visit, <eob> and on the last evening, <eol> I run upstairs to Deah's room, <eob> eager to find out how he's feeling <eol> being a newly married man. <eob>
With a big boyish smile he says, <eob> "I'm so happy. I love her. <eol> She's an amazing girl." <eob> And she is. <eob>
At just 21, she'd recently <eol> been accepted to join Deah <eob> at UNC dental school. <eob>
She shared his love for basketball, <eol> and at her urging, <eob> they started their honeymoon off <eol> attending their favorite team of the NBA, <eob> the LA Lakers. <eob> I mean, check out that form. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'll never forget that moment <eol> sitting there with him -- <eob> how free he was in his happiness. <eob>
My littler brother, a basketball-obsessed kid, <eob> had become and transformed <eol> into an accomplished young man. <eob>
He was at the top of his dental school class, <eob> and alongside Yusor and Razan, <eob> was involved in local <eol> and international community service projects <eob> dedicated to the homeless and refugees, <eob> including a dental relief trip they were planning <eob> for Syrian refugees in Turkey. <eob>
Razan, at just 19, <eob> used her creativity <eol> as an architectural engineering student <eob> to serve those around her, <eob> making care packages <eol> for the local homeless, <eob> among other projects. <eob>
That is who they were. <eob>
Standing there that night, <eob> I take a deep breath and look <eol> at Deah and tell him, <eob> "I have never been more proud of you <eol> than I am in this moment." <eob> He pulls me into his tall frame, <eob> hugs me goodnight, <eob> and I leave the next morning <eol> without waking him <eob> to go back to San Francisco. <eob>
That is the last time I ever hug him. <eob>
Ten days later, I'm on call <eol> at San Francisco General Hospital <eob> when I receive a barrage of vague text messages <eol> expressing condolences. <eob>
Confused, I call my father, <eol> who calmly intones, <eob> "There's been a shooting in Deah's neighborhood <eol> in Chapel Hill. <eob>
It's on lock-down. <eob>
That's all we know. <eob> "I hang up and quickly Google," <eol> shooting in Chapel Hill. <eob> "One hit comes up. <eob> Quote:" <eob> Three people were shot in the back of the head <eob> and confirmed dead on the scene. <eob> "Something in me just knows. <eob>
I fling out of my chair and faint <eol> onto the gritty hospital floor, <eob> wailing. <eob>
I take the first red-eye out <eol> of San Francisco, <eob> numb and disoriented. <eob>
I walk into my childhood home <eol> and faint into my parents' arms, <eob> sobbing. <eob>
I then run up to Deah's room <eol> as I did so many times before, <eob> just looking for him, <eob> only to find a void <eol> that will never be filled. <eob>
Investigation <eol> and autopsy reports eventually revealed <eob> the sequence of events. <eob>
Deah had just gotten <eol> off the bus from class, <eob> Razan was visiting for dinner, <eob> already at home with Yusor. <eob>
As they began to eat, <eol> they heard a knock on the door. <eob>
When Deah opened it, <eob> their neighbor proceeded to fire <eol> multiple shots at him. <eob>
According to 911 calls, <eob> the girls were heard screaming. <eob>
The man turned towards the kitchen <eol> and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip, <eob> immobilizing her. <eob>
He then approached her from behind, <eob> pressed the barrel <eol> of his gun against her head, <eob> and with a single bullet, <eol> lacerated her midbrain. <eob>
He then turned towards Razan, <eol> who was screaming for her life, <eob> and, execution-style, <eol> with a single bullet <eob> to the back of the head, <eob> killed her. <eob>
On his way out, <eob> he shot Deah one last time -- <eol> a bullet in the mouth -- <eob> for a total of eight bullets: <eob> two lodged in the head, <eob> two in his chest <eob> and the rest in his extremities. <eob>
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed <eob> in a place that was meant to be safe: <eol> their home. <eob>
For months, this man <eol> had been harassing them: <eob> knocking on their door, <eob> brandishing his gun on a couple <eol> of occasions. <eob>
His Facebook was cluttered <eol> with anti-religion posts. <eob>
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him. <eob>
As she was moving in, <eob> he told Yusor and her mom <eol> that he didn't like the way they looked. <eob>
In response, Yusor's mom <eol> told her to be kind to her neighbor, <eob> that as he got to know them, <eob> he'd see them for who they were. <eob>
I guess we've all become <eol> so numb to the hatred <eob> that we couldn't have ever imagined it <eol> turning into fatal violence. <eob>
The man who murdered my brother <eol> turned himself in to the police <eob> shortly after the murders, <eob> saying he killed three kids, <eob> execution-style, <eob> over a parking dispute. <eob>
The police issued a premature public <eol> statement that morning, <eob> echoing his claims without bothering <eol> to question it <eob> or further investigate. <eob>
It turns out there was no parking dispute. <eob>
There was no argument. <eob> No violation. <eob> But the damage was already done. <eob>
In a 24-hour media cycle, <eob> the words "parking dispute" <eol> had already become the go-to sound bite. <eob>
I am who I am because of you. <eob> I sit on my brother's bed <eol> and remember his words, <eob> the words he gave me so freely <eol> and with so much love, <eob> That's what it takes for me <eol> to climb through my crippling grief <eob> and speak out. <eob>
I cannot let my family's deaths <eol> be diminished to a segment <eob> that is barely discussed on local news. <eob>
They were murdered by their neighbor <eol> because of their faith, <eob> because of a piece of cloth <eol> they chose to don on their heads, <eob> because they were visibly Muslim. <eob>
Some of the rage I felt at the time <eob> was that if roles were reversed, <eob> and an Arab, Muslim or Muslim-appearing person <eob> had killed three white American college students <eob> execution-style, <eob> in their home, <eob> what would we have called it? <eob> A terrorist attack. <eob> When white men commit acts <eol> of violence in the US, <eob> they're lone wolves, <eob> mentally ill <eob> or driven by a parking dispute. <eob>
I know that I have <eol> to give my family voice, <eob> and I do the only thing I know how: <eob> I send a Facebook message <eol> to everyone I know in media. <eob>
A couple of hours later, <eob> in the midst of a chaotic house <eol> overflowing with friends and family, <eob> our neighbor Neal comes over, <eol> sits down next to my parents <eob> and asks, "What can I do?" <eob> Neal had over two decades <eol> of experience in journalism, <eob> but he makes it clear that he's not there <eol> in his capacity as journalist, <eob> but as a neighbor who wants to help. <eob>
I ask him what he thinks we should do, <eob> given the bombardment of local media <eol> interview requests. <eob>
He offers to set up a press conference <eol> at a local community center. <eob>
Even now I don't have <eol> the words to thank him. <eob> "Just tell me when, and I'll have <eol> all the news channels present," he said. <eob>
He did for us what <eol> we could not do for ourselves <eob> in a moment of devastation. <eob>
I delivered the press statement, <eob> still wearing scrubs <eol> from the previous night. <eob>
And in under 24 hours from the murders, <eob> I'm on CNN being interviewed <eol> by Anderson Cooper. <eob>
The following day, major newspapers -- <eob> including the New York Times, Chicago Tribune -- <eob> published stories about Deah, <eol> Yusor and Razan, <eob> allowing us to reclaim the narrative <eob> and call attention the mainstreaming <eol> of anti-Muslim hatred. <eob>
These days, <eob> it feels like Islamophobia is a socially <eol> acceptable form of bigotry. <eob>
We just have to put up with it and smile. <eob>
The nasty stares, <eob> the palpable fear when boarding a plane, <eob> the random pat downs at airports <eol> that happen 99 percent of the time. <eob>
It doesn't stop there. <eob>
We have politicians reaping political <eol> and financial gains off our backs. <eob>
Here in the US, <eob> we have presidential candidates like Donald Trump, <eob> casually calling to register <eol> American Muslims, <eob> and ban Muslim immigrants <eol> and refugees from entering this country. <eob>
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise <eob> in parallel with election cycles. <eob>
Just a couple months ago, <eol> Khalid Jabara, <eob> a Lebanese-American Christian, <eob> was murdered in Oklahoma by his neighbor -- <eob> a man who called him <eol> a "filthy Arab." <eob> This man was previously jailed <eol> for a mere 8 months, <eob> after attempting run over Khalid's mother with his car. <eob>
Chances are you haven't heard <eol> Khalid's story, <eob> because it didn't make it <eol> to national news. <eob>
The least we can do is call it what it is: <eob> a hate crime. <eob>
The least we can do <eol> is talk about it, <eob> because violence and hatred <eol> doesn't just happen in a vacuum. <eob>
Not long after coming back to work, <eob> I'm the senior <eol> on rounds in the hospital, <eob> when one of my patients <eol> looks over at my colleague, <eob> gestures around her face and says, <eol> "San Bernardino," <eob> referencing a recent terrorist attack. <eob>
Here I am having just lost three <eol> family members to Islamophobia, <eob> having been a vocal advocate <eol> within my program <eob> on how to deal with such <eol> microaggressions, <eob> and yet -- <eob> silence. <eob> I was disheartened. <eob> Humiliated. <eob>
silence. <eob> Days later rounding on the same patient, <eob> she looks at me and says, <eob> "Your people are killing <eol> people in Los Angeles." <eob> I look around expectantly. <eob> Again: <eob> I realize that yet again, <eob> I have to speak up for myself. <eob>
I sit on her bed and gently ask her, <eob> "Have I ever done anything <eol> but treat you with respect and kindness? <eob>
Have I done anything <eol> but give you compassionate care?" <eob> She looks down and realizes <eol> what she said was wrong, <eob> and in front of the entire team, <eob> she apologizes and says, <eob> "I should know better. <eol> I'm Mexican-American. <eob> I receive this kind of treatment all the time." <eob>
Many of us experience <eol> microaggressions on a daily basis. <eob>
Odds are you may have experienced it, <eob> whether for your race, <eob> gender, <eob> sexuality <eob> or religious beliefs. <eob>
We've all been in situations <eol> where we've witnessed something wrong <eob> and didn't speak up. <eob>
Maybe we weren't equipped <eol> with the tools to respond in the moment. <eob>
Maybe we weren't even aware <eol> of our own implicit biases. <eob>
We can all agree <eol> that bigotry is unacceptable, <eob> but when we see it, <eob> we're silent, <eob> because it makes us uncomfortable. <eob>
But stepping right into that discomfort <eob> means you are also stepping <eol> into the ally zone. <eob>
There may be over three million <eol> Muslims in America. <eob>
That's still just one percent <eol> of the total population. <eob>
Martin Luther King once said, <eob> "In the end, <eob> we will remember not the words <eol> of our enemies, <eob> but the silence of our friends." <eob>
So what made my neighbor Neal's <eol> allyship so profound? <eob> A couple of things. <eob> He was there as a neighbor who cared, <eob> but he was also bringing in <eol> his professional expertise and resources <eob> when the moment called for it. <eob>
Others have done the same. <eob>
Larycia Hawkins <eol> drew on her platform <eob> as the first tenured African-American <eol> professor at Wheaton College <eob> to wear a hijab in solidarity <eob> with Muslim women who face <eol> discrimination every day. <eob>
As a result, she lost her job. <eob>
Within a month, <eob> she joined the faculty at the University <eol> of Virginia, <eob> where she now works on pluralism, <eol> race, faith and culture. <eob>
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian, <eob> demonstrated that not all active <eol> allyship needs to be so serious. <eob>
He stepped up to support <eol> a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission <eob> to introduce a hijab <eol> emoji. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's a simple gesture, <eob> but it has a significant subconscious impact <eob> on normalizing and humanizing Muslims, <eob> including the community as a part of an "us" <eob> instead of an "other." <eob> The editor in chief of Women's Running magazine <eob> just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover <eol> of a US fitness magazine. <eob>
These are all very different examples <eob> of people who drew upon <eol> their platforms and resources <eob> in academia, tech and media, <eob> to actively express their allyship. <eob>
What resources and expertise <eol> do you bring to the table? <eob>
Are you willing <eol> to step into your discomfort <eob> and speak up when you witness hateful bigotry? <eob> Will you be Neal? <eob>
Many neighbors appeared in this story. <eob>
And you, in your respective communities, <eol> all have a Muslim neighbor, <eob> colleague <eob> or friend your child plays with at school. <eob> Reach out to them. <eob> Let them know you stand with them <eol> in solidarity. <eob>
It may feel really small, <eob> but I promise you it makes a difference. <eob>
Nothing will ever bring back Deah, <eol> Yusor and Razan. <eob>
But when we raise our collective voices, <eob> that is when we stop the hate. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I design engineering projects <eob> for middle school and high school students, <eob> often using materials <eol> that are pretty unexpected. <eob>
My inspiration comes from problems <eol> in my daily life. <eob>
For example, <eob> one time I needed a costume <eol> to go to a comic convention, <eob> but I didn't want to spend too much money, <eob> so I made my own ... <eob> with a light-up crown and skirt. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Another time, <eob> I was devastated because <eol> my favorite mobile game, <eob> Flappy Bird, <eob> was being taken off the app store. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I was faced with the dilemma <eob> to either never update <eol> my phone or never play <eob> Flappy Bird <eob> again. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Unhappy with both options, <eob> I did the only thing <eol> that made sense to me. <eob>
I made a physical version of <eob> Flappy Bird <eob> that could never be taken off the app store. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So a few of my friends were also <eol> pretty addicted to the game, <eob> and I invited them to play as well. <eob>
(Video) Friend: What the heck? <eob>
And they told me that it was just as infuriating <eol> as the original game. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I uploaded a demo of this project online, <eob> and to my surprise it went viral. <eob>
It had over two million views <eol> in just a few days. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And what's more interesting <eol> are people's comments. <eob>
A lot of people <eol> wanted to make it their own, <eob> or asked me how it was made. <eob>
So this kind of confirmed my idea <eol> that through a creative project, <eob> we can teach people about engineering. <eob>
With the money made from the viral video, <eob> we were able to let students in our classroom <eob> all make their own game in a box. <eob>
Although it was pretty challenging, <eob> they learned a lot of new concepts <eol> in engineering and programming. <eob>
And they were all eager to learn so <eol> they could finish the game as well. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So before <eob> Flappy Bird <eob> Box, <eob> I had the idea of using creative <eol> engineering projects to teach students. <eob>
When I was teaching at a middle school, <eob> we asked our students to build a robot <eol> from a standard technology kit. <eob>
And I noticed that a lot of them <eol> seemed bored. <eob>
Then a few of them started <eol> taking pieces of paper <eob> and decorating their robots. <eob>
And then more of them got into it, <eob> and they became more interested <eol> in the project. <eob>
So I started looking for more creative ways <eob> to introduce technology to students. <eob>
What I found was that most <eol> technology kits available in school <eob> look a little intimidating. <eob>
They're all made of plastic parts <eol> that you can't customize. <eob>
On top of that, they're all very expensive, <eob> costing hundreds of dollars per kit. <eob>
So that's certainly not very affordable <eol> for most classroom budgets. <eob>
Since I didn't find anything, <eob> I decided to make something on my own. <eob>
I started with paper and fabric. <eob>
After all, we all played with those <eol> since we were kids, <eob> and they are also pretty cheap <eob> and can be found anywhere around the house. <eob>
And I prototyped a project <eob> where students can create <eol> a light-up creature <eob> using fabric <eol> and googly eyes. <eob>
They were all helping <eol> each other in classrooms, <eob> and were laughing and discussing the project. <eob>
And most importantly, <eob> they were able to insert <eol> their own creativity into the project. <eob>
So because of the success of this project, <eob> I continued to create <eol> more engineering projects <eob> to challenge my students. <eob>
And I also started to take <eol> these workshops outside of school <eob> and into the community. <eob>
And something really interesting happened. <eob>
I noticed a lot of people <eol> from very diverse backgrounds <eob> started coming to our workshops. <eob>
And specifically, <eob> there were a lot more women <eol> and minorities than I expected, <eob> and that you wouldn't usually see <eol> at a traditional engineering workshop. <eob>
Now take a look at this employee report <eol> at a major technology company in 2016. <eob>
Women make up only 19 percent <eol> of the technology workforce. <eob>
And underrepresented minorities <eol> make up only four percent. <eob>
This statistic might look familiar <eob> if you walked into <eol> a high school robotics club, <eob> or a college engineering class. <eob>
Now, there's a wide variety <eol> of problems <eob> that contribute to the lack of diversity <eol> in the technology force. <eob>
Perhaps one solution could be <eob> to introduce technology to students <eob> through creative projects. <eob>
I'm not saying <eol> that this could solve everything, <eob> but it could introduce technology <eob> to people who originally wouldn't be interested in it <eob> because of how it has been portrayed <eol> and taught in school. <eob>
So how do we start to change <eol> the perception of technology? <eob>
Most students think <eol> that it's boring or unwelcoming, <eob> so I have always designed projects <eol> following three principles. <eob>
First is having a low floor, <eob> and that means this project <eol> is easy to get started. <eob> So take a look at this tutorial. <eob> The first project we asked students to learn <eob> is to make a circuit on paper. <eob>
As you can see, <eol> it doesn't take very long to learn, <eob> and it's pretty easy even for beginners. <eob>
And having a low floor also means <eol> that we're removing the financial barrier <eob> that prevents people <eol> from completing a project. <eob>
So with paper, copper tape, lightbulb and a battery, <eob> people can complete this project <eol> for under a dollar. <eob>
So second principle is having <eol> a high ceiling. <eob>
This means that there's a lot of room to grow, <eob> and students are constantly <eol> being challenged. <eob>
At first it might just be <eol> a light-up creature, <eob> but then you can add sensors <eol> and microcontrollers, <eob> and start to program the creature <eol> to interact with its environment. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And finally, <eob> the third principle is customization. <eob>
This means that we can make <eol> this project relevant to anyone. <eob>
That's the beauty <eol> of using everyday materials; <eob> it's very easy to customize <eol> using paper and fabric. <eob>
So even if you don't like <eob> Flappy Bird, <eob> you can still make your own game. <eob>
(Video) Student: So our game <eol> is about Justin Bieber, <eob> because he's been speeding, <eob> and the object is to prevent him <eol> from getting caught by the LAPD -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Video) Student: Yeah, <eol> but he's changing so -- <eob> we're a part of his posse. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Carlos, <eob> the Vietnam vet Marine <eob> who volunteered for three tours <eol> and got shot up in every one. <eob>
In 1971, he was medically retired <eob> because he had so much shrapnel in his body <eob> that he was setting off metal detectors. <eob>
For the next 42 years, <eol> he suffered from nightmares, <eob> extreme anxiety in public, <eob> isolation, depression. <eob>
He self-medicated with alcohol. <eob>
He was married and divorced three times. <eob>
Carlos <eob> had post-traumatic stress disorder. <eob>
Now, I became a psychologist <eol> to help mitigate human suffering, <eob> and for the past 10 years, my target has been the suffering <eol> caused by PTSD, <eob> as experienced by veterans like Carlos. <eob>
Until recently, the science of PTSD <eol> just wasn't there. <eob>
And so, we didn't know what to do. <eob>
We put some veterans on heavy drugs. <eob>
Others we hospitalized <eol> and gave generic group therapy, <eob> and others still we simply said to them, <eob> "Just go home and try <eol> to forget about your experiences." <eob> More recently, we've tried therapy dogs, <eol> wilderness retreats -- <eob> many things which may temporarily relieve stress, <eob> but which don't actually eliminate PTSD symptoms over the long term. <eob>
But things have changed. <eob> And I am here to tell you that we can <eol> now eliminate PTSD, <eob> not just manage the symptoms, <eob> and in huge numbers of veterans. <eob>
Because new scientific research <eol> has been able to show, <eob> objectively, repeatedly, <eob> which treatments actually get rid <eol> of symptoms and which do not. <eob>
Now as it turns out, <eob> the best treatments for PTSD use many <eol> of the very same training principles <eob> that the military uses in preparing <eol> its trainees for war. <eob>
Now, making war -- <eob> this is something that we are good at. <eob>
We humans have been making war <eol> since before we were even fully human. <eob>
And since then, we have gone <eol> from using stone and sinew <eob> to developing the most sophisticated <eol> and devastating weapon systems imaginable. <eob>
And to enable our warriors <eol> to use these weapons, <eob> we employ the most cutting-edge <eol> training methods. <eob>
We are good at making war. <eob>
And we are good at training <eol> our warriors to fight. <eob>
Yet, when we consider the experience <eol> of the modern-day combat veteran, <eob> we begin to see <eol> that we have not been as good <eob> at preparing them to come home. <eob> Why is that? <eob> Well, our ancestors <eol> lived immersed in conflict, <eob> and they fought right where they lived. <eob>
So until only very recently <eol> in our evolutionary history, <eob> there was hardly a need <eol> to learn how to come home from war, <eob> because we never really did. <eob>
But thankfully, today, <eob> most of humanity lives <eol> in far more peaceful societies, <eob> and when there is conflict, <eol> we, especially in the United States, <eob> now have the technology to put our warriors <eol> through advanced training, <eob> drop them in to fight <eol> anywhere on the globe <eob> and when they're done, <eob> jet them back to peacetime suburbia. <eob>
But just imagine for a moment <eol> what this must feel like. <eob>
I've spoken with veterans <eol> who've told me <eob> that one day they're <eol> in a brutal firefight in Afghanistan <eob> where they saw carnage and death, <eob> and just three days later, <eol> they found themselves <eob> toting an ice chest <eol> to their kid's soccer game. <eob> "Mindfuck" is the most common term. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's the most common term <eol> I've heard to describe that experience. <eob>
And that's exactly what that is. <eob>
Because while our warriors <eol> spend countless hours training for war, <eob> we've only recently come to understand <eob> that many require training on how to return <eol> to civilian life. <eob>
Now, like any training, the best PTSD <eol> treatments require repetition. <eob>
In the military, <eob> we don't simply hand trainees Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers <eob> and say, "Here's the trigger, <eol> here's some ammo and good luck." <eob> No. We train them, on the range <eol> and in specific contexts, <eob> over and over and over <eob> until lifting their weapon <eol> and engaging their target <eob> is so engrained into muscle memory <eob> that it can be performed without even thinking, <eob> even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine. <eob>
Now, the same holds <eol> for training-based treatments. <eob>
The first of these treatments <eol> is cognitive therapy, <eob> and this is a kind of mental recalibration. <eob>
When veterans come home from war, <eob> their way of mentally framing the world <eol> is calibrated <eob> to an immensely more dangerous environment. <eob>
So when you try to overlay that mind <eol> frame onto a peacetime environment, <eob> you get problems. <eob>
You begin drowning in worries <eol> about dangers that aren't present. <eob>
You begin not trusting family or friends. <eob>
Which is not to say there are <eol> no dangers in civilian life; there are. <eob> It's just that the probability <eol> of encountering them <eob> compared to combat <eob> is astronomically lower. <eob>
So we never advise veterans <eol> to turn off caution completely. <eob>
We do train them, however, <eol> to adjust caution <eob> according to where they are. <eob>
If you find yourself <eol> in a bad neighborhood, <eob> you turn it up. <eob>
Out to dinner with family? <eob>
You turn it way down. <eob>
We train veterans to be fiercely rational, <eob> to systematically gauge <eol> the actual statistical probability <eob> of encountering, say, an IED here <eol> in peacetime America. <eob>
With enough practice, <eol> those recalibrations stick. <eob>
The next of these treatments <eol> is exposure therapy, <eob> and this is a kind of field training, <eob> and the fastest of the proven <eol> effective treatments out there. <eob>
You remember Carlos? <eob> This was the treatment that he chose. <eob>
And so we started off <eol> by giving him exercises, <eob> for him, challenging ones: <eob> going to a grocery store, <eob> going to a shopping mall, <eol> going to a restaurant, <eob> sitting with his back to the door. <eob>
And, critically -- <eob> staying in these environments. <eob>
Now, at first he was very anxious. <eob>
He wanted to sit where <eol> he could scan the room, <eob> where he could plan escape routes, <eob> where he could get his hands <eol> on a makeshift weapon. <eob>
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't. <eob>
He remembered his training <eol> in the Marine Corps, <eob> and he pushed through his discomfort. <eob>
And every time he did this, <eol> his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit, <eob> and then a little bit more <eol> and then a little bit more, <eob> until in the end, <eob> he had effectively relearned how <eol> to sit in a public space <eob> and just enjoy himself. <eob>
over and over and over <eob> He also listened to recordings <eol> of his combat experiences, <eob>
He listened until those memories <eol> no longer generated any anxiety. <eob>
He processed his memories so much <eob> that his brain no longer <eol> needed to return to those experiences <eob> in his sleep. <eob>
And when I spoke with him <eol> a year after treatment had finished, <eob> he told me, <eob> "Doc, this is the first time in 43 years <eob> that I haven't had nightmares." <eob>
Now, this is different <eol> than erasing a memory. <eob>
Veterans will always remember <eol> their traumatic experiences, <eob> but with enough practice, <eob> those memories are no longer <eol> as raw or as painful as they once were. <eob>
They don't feel emotionally <eol> like they just happened yesterday, <eob> and that is an immensely better place to be. <eob>
But it's often difficult. <eob>
And, like any training, <eol> it may not work for everybody. <eob>
And there are trust issues. <eob>
Sometimes I'm asked, <eob> "If you haven't been there, <eol> Doc, how can you help me?" <eob> Which is understandable. <eob>
But at the point of returning <eol> to civilian life, <eob> you do not require <eol> somebody who's been there. <eob>
You don't require training <eol> for operations on the battlefield; <eob> you require training <eol> on how to come home. <eob>
For the past 10 years of my work, <eob> I have been exposed to detailed accounts <eob> of the worst experiences <eol> that you can imagine, <eob> daily. <eob>
And it hasn't always been easy. <eob>
There have been times <eol> where I have just felt my heart break <eob> or that I've absorbed too much. <eob>
But these training-based treatments work so well, <eob> that whatever this work takes out of me, <eol> it puts back even more, <eob> because I see people get better. <eob>
I see people's lives transform. <eob>
Carlos can now enjoy outings <eol> with his grandchildren, <eob> which is something he couldn't even do <eol> with his own children. <eob>
And what's amazing to me is that after 43 years <eol> of suffering, <eob> it only took him 10 weeks <eol> of intense training to get his life back. <eob>
And when I spoke with him, <eob> he told me, <eob> "I know that I can't get those years back. <eob>
But at least now, whatever days <eol> that I have left on this Earth, <eob> I can live them in peace." <eob> He also said, "I hope that these younger <eol> veterans don't wait <eob> to get the help they need." <eob> And that's my hope, too. <eob>
Because... <eob> this life is short, <eob> and if you are fortunate <eol> enough to have survived war <eob> or any kind of traumatic experience, <eob> you owe it to yourself <eol> to live your life well. <eob>
And you shouldn't wait <eol> to get the training you need <eob> to make that happen. <eob>
Now, the best way of ending <eol> human suffering caused by war <eob> is to never go to war. <eob>
But we are just not there <eol> yet as a species. <eob>
Until we are, <eob> the mental suffering <eol> that we create in our sons and in our daughters <eob> when we send them off to fight <eob> can be alleviated. <eob>
But we must ensure that the science, <eol> the energy level, the value <eob> that we place on sending them off to war <eob> is at the very least mirrored <eob> in how well we prepare them <eol> to come back home to us. <eob>
This much, we owe them. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary. <eob>
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah. <eob>
CA: It feels like the world is in a place <eob> that we haven't seen for a long time. <eob>
People don't just disagree in the way <eol> that we're familiar with, <eob> on the left-right political divide. <eob>
There are much deeper differences afoot. <eob>
What on earth is going on, <eol> and how did we get here? <eob>
JH: This is different. <eob>
There's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling. <eob>
Survey research by Pew Research shows <eob> that the degree to which <eol> we feel that the other side is not just -- <eob> we don't just dislike them; <eol> we strongly dislike them, <eob> and we think that they are <eol> a threat to the nation. <eob>
Those numbers have been going up and up, <eob> and those are over 50 percent <eol> now on both sides. <eob>
People are scared, <eob> because it feels like this is different than before; <eol> it's much more intense. <eob>
Whenever I look at any sort <eol> of social puzzle, <eob> I always apply the three basic principles <eol> of moral psychology, <eob> and I think they'll help us here. <eob>
So the first thing <eol> that you have to always keep in mind <eob> when you're thinking about politics <eob> is that we're tribal. <eob>
We evolved for tribalism. <eob>
One of the simplest <eol> and greatest insights into human social nature <eob> is the Bedouin proverb: <eob> "Me against my brother; <eob> me and my brother against our cousin; <eob> me and my brother and cousins against the stranger." <eob> And that tribalism allowed us <eol> to create large societies <eob> and to come together in order to compete with others. <eob>
That brought us out of the jungle <eol> and out of small groups, <eob> but it means that we have <eol> eternal conflict. <eob>
The question you have to look at is: <eob> What aspects of our society <eol> are making that more bitter, <eob> and what are calming them down? <eob>
CA: That's a very dark proverb. <eob>
You're saying that that's actually baked <eol> into most people's mental wiring <eob> at some level? <eob>
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just a basic aspect <eol> of human social cognition. <eob>
But we can also live together <eol> really peacefully, <eob> and we've invented all kinds <eol> of fun ways of, like, playing war. <eob>
I mean, sports, politics -- <eob> these are all ways that we get to exercise <eol> this tribal nature <eob> without actually hurting anyone. <eob>
We're also really good at trade <eol> and exploration and meeting new people. <eob>
So you have to see our tribalism <eol> as something that goes up or down -- <eob> it's not like we're doomed <eol> to always be fighting each other, <eob> but we'll never have world peace. <eob>
CA: The size of that tribe <eol> can shrink or expand. <eob>
JH: Right. <eob>
CA: The size of what we consider "us" <eob> and what we consider "other" or "them" <eob> can change. <eob>
And some people believed <eol> that process could continue indefinitely. <eob>
JH: That's right. <eob>
CA: And we were indeed expanding <eol> the sense of tribe for a while. <eob>
JH: So this is, I think, <eob> where we're getting at what's possibly <eol> the new left-right distinction. <eob>
I mean, the left-right as <eol> we've all inherited it, <eob> comes out of the labor versus capital distinction, <eob> and the working class, and Marx. <eob>
But I think what we're seeing now, increasingly, <eob> is a divide in all the Western democracies <eob> between the people who <eol> want to stop at nation, <eob> the people who are more parochial -- <eob> and I don't mean that in a bad way -- <eob> people who have much more of a sense of being rooted, <eob> they care about their town, their community and their nation. <eob>
And then those who are anti-parochial and who -- <eob> whenever I get confused, <eol> I just think of the John Lennon song "Imagine." <eob> "Imagine there's no countries, <eol> nothing to kill or die for." <eob> And so these are the people <eol> who want more global governance, <eob> they don't like nation states, <eol> they don't like borders. <eob>
You see this all over Europe as well. <eob>
There's a great metaphor guy -- <eol> actually, his name is Shakespeare -- <eob> writing ten years ago in Britain. <eob> He had a metaphor: <eob> "Are we drawbridge-uppers <eol> or drawbridge-downers?" <eob> And Britain is divided 52-48 on that point. <eob>
And America is divided on that point, too. <eob>
CA: And so, those of us <eol> who grew up with The Beatles <eob> and that sort of hippie philosophy <eol> of dreaming of a more connected world -- <eob> it felt so idealistic and "how <eol> could anyone think badly about that?" <eob> And what you're saying is that, actually, <eob> millions of people today feel <eol> that that isn't just silly; <eob> it's actually dangerous and wrong, <eol> and they're scared of it. <eob>
JH: I think the big issue, <eol> especially in Europe but also here, <eob> is the issue of immigration. <eob>
And I think this is where <eol> we have to look very carefully <eob> at the social science <eol> about diversity and immigration. <eob>
Once something becomes politicized, <eob> once it becomes something <eol> that the left loves and the right -- <eob> then even the social scientists <eol> can't think straight about it. <eob>
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways. <eob>
It clearly creates more innovation. <eob>
The American economy <eol> has grown enormously from it. <eob>
Diversity and immigration do <eol> a lot of good things. <eob>
But what the globalists, I think, don't see, <eob> what they don't want to see, <eob> is that ethnic diversity <eol> cuts social capital and trust. <eob>
There's a very important <eol> study by Robert Putnam, <eob> the author of "Bowling Alone," <eob> looking at social capital databases. <eob>
And basically, the more people <eol> feel that they are the same, <eob> the more they trust each other, <eob> the more they can have a redistribution <eol>ist welfare state. <eob>
Scandinavian countries <eol> are so wonderful <eob> because they have this legacy of being small, <eol> homogenous countries. <eob>
And that leads to a progressive <eol> welfare state, <eob> a set of progressive <eol> left-leaning values, which says, <eob> "Drawbridge down! <eob>
The world is a great place. <eob>
People in Syria are suffering -- <eol> we must welcome them in." <eob> And it's a beautiful thing. <eob>
But if, and I was in Sweden this summer, <eob> if the discourse in Sweden <eol> is fairly politically correct <eob> and they can't talk about the downsides, <eob> you end up bringing a lot of people in. <eob>
That's going to cut social capital, <eob> it makes it hard to have <eol> a welfare state <eob> and they might end up, as we have in America, <eob> with a racially divided, <eol> visibly racially divided, society. <eob>
So this is all very uncomfortable <eol> to talk about. <eob>
But I think this is the thing, especially in Europe <eol> and for us, too, <eob> we need to be looking at. <eob>
CA: You're saying <eol> that people of reason, <eob> people who would consider <eol> themselves not racists, <eob> but moral, upstanding people, <eob> have a rationale that says humans <eol> are just too different; <eob> that we're in danger <eol> of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of, <eob> by mixing in people who are too different. <eob>
JH: Yes, but I can make it <eol> much more palatable <eob> by saying it's not necessarily <eol> about race. <eob>
It's about culture. <eob>
There's wonderful work <eol> by a political scientist named Karen Stenner, <eob> who shows that when people have a sense <eob> that we are all united, <eol> we're all the same, <eob> there are many people who have <eol> a predisposition to authoritarianism. <eob>
Those people aren't particularly racist <eob> when they feel as through <eol> there's not a threat <eob> to our social and moral order. <eob>
But if you prime them experimentally <eob> by thinking we're coming apart, <eol> people are getting more different, <eob> then they get more racist, homophobic, <eol> they want to kick out the deviants. <eob>
So it's in part that you get <eol> an authoritarian reaction. <eob>
The left, following <eol> through the Lennonist line -- <eob> the John Lennon line -- <eob> does things that create <eol> an authoritarian reaction. <eob>
We're certainly seeing that in America <eol> with the alt-right. <eob>
We saw it in Britain, <eol> we've seen it all over Europe. <eob>
But the more positive part of that <eob> is that I think the localists, <eol> or the nationalists, are actually right -- <eob> that, if you emphasize our cultural similarity, <eob> then race doesn't actually matter very much. <eob>
So an assimilationist <eol> approach to immigration <eob> removes a lot of these problems. <eob>
And if you value having <eol> a generous welfare state, <eob> you've got to emphasize <eol> that we're all the same. <eob>
CA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that <eob> are one of the causes <eol> of the current divide. <eob>
What are other causes? <eob>
JH: The next principle <eol> of moral psychology <eob> is that intuitions <eol> come first, strategic reasoning second. <eob>
You've probably heard <eol> the term "motivated reasoning" <eob> or "confirmation bias." <eob> There's some really interesting work <eob> on how our high intelligence <eol> and our verbal abilities <eob> might have evolved not to help <eol> us find out the truth, <eob> but to help <eob> us manipulate each other, <eol> defend our reputation ... <eob> We're really, really good at justifying ourselves. <eob>
And when you bring group interests into account, <eob> so it's not just me, <eol> it's my team versus your team, <eob> whereas if you're evaluating <eol> evidence that your side is wrong, <eob> we just can't accept that. <eob>
So this is why you can't win <eol> a political argument. <eob>
If you're debating something, <eob> you can't persuade the person <eol> with reasons and evidence, <eob> because that's not the way <eol> reasoning works. <eob>
So now, give us the internet, <eol> give us Google: <eob> "I heard that Barack Obama <eol> was born in Kenya. <eob>
Let me Google that -- oh my God! <eol> 10 million hits! Look, he was!" <eob>
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant surprise <eol> to a lot of people. <eob>
Social media has often been framed <eol> by techno-optimists <eob> as this great connecting force <eol> that would bring people together. <eob>
And there have been <eol> some unexpected counter-effects to that. <eob>
JH: That's right. <eob>
That's why I'm very enamored <eol> of yin-yang views <eob> of human nature and left-right -- <eob> that each side is right <eol> about certain things, <eob> but then it goes blind <eol> to other things. <eob>
And so the left generally believes <eol> that human nature is good: <eob> bring people together, knock down the walls <eol> and all will be well. <eob>
The right -- social conservatives, not libertarians -- <eob> social conservatives generally believe <eol> people can be greedy <eob> and sexual and selfish, <eob> and we need regulation, <eol> and we need restrictions. <eob>
So, yeah, if you knock <eol> down all the walls, <eob> allow people to communicate <eol> all over the world, <eob> you get a lot of porn <eol> and a lot of racism. <eob>
CA: So help us understand. <eob>
These principles of human nature <eol> have been with us forever. <eob>
What's changed that's deepened <eol> this feeling of division? <eob>
JH: You have to see six <eol> to ten different threads all coming together. <eob>
I'll just list a couple of them. <eob>
So in America, one of the big -- <eol> actually, America and Europe -- <eob> one of the biggest ones is World War II. <eob>
There's interesting research <eol> from Joe Henrich and others <eob> that says if your country was at war, <eob> especially when you were young, <eob> then we test you 30 years <eol> later in a commons dilemma <eob> or a prisoner's dilemma, <eob> you're more cooperative. <eob>
Because of our tribal nature, <eol> if you're -- <eob> my parents were teenagers <eol> during World War II, <eob> and they would go out looking for scraps <eol> of aluminum <eob> to help the war effort. <eob>
I mean, everybody pulled together. <eob>
And so then these people go on, <eob> they rise up through business <eol> and government, <eob> they take leadership positions. <eob>
They're really good at compromise <eol> and cooperation. <eob>
They all retire by the '90s. <eob>
So we're left with baby boomers <eol> by the end of the '90s. <eob>
And their youth was spent fighting each other <eol> within each country, <eob> in 1968 and afterwards. <eob>
The loss of the World War II generation, <eol> "The Greatest Generation," <eob> is huge. <eob>
So that's one. <eob>
Another, in America, is the purification <eol> of the two parties. <eob>
There used to be liberal Republicans <eol> and conservative Democrats. <eob>
So America had a mid-20th century <eol> that was really bipartisan. <eob>
But because of a variety of factors <eol> that started things moving, <eob> by the 90's, we had a purified <eol> liberal party and conservative party. <eob>
So now, the people <eol> in either party really are different, <eob> and we really don't want our children <eol> to marry them, <eob> which, in the '60s, didn't matter very much. <eob>
So, the purification of the parties. <eob>
Third is the internet <eol> and, as I said, <eob> it's just the most amazing stimulant <eol> for post-hoc reasoning and demonization. <eob>
CA: The tone of what's happening <eol> on the internet now is quite troubling. <eob>
I just did a quick search <eol> on Twitter about the election <eob> and saw two tweets <eol> next to each other. <eob>
One, against a picture of racist graffiti: <eob> "This is disgusting! <eob>
Ugliness in this country, brought <eol> to us by # Trump. <eob> "And then the next one is:" <eob> Crooked Hillary dedication page. <eob>
Disgusting! <eob> "So this idea of" disgust "is troubling to me. <eob>
Because you can have an argument <eol> or a disagreement about something, <eob> you can get angry at someone. <eob>
Disgust, I've heard you say, <eol> takes things to a much deeper level. <eob>
JH: That's right. <eob> Disgust is different. <eob> Anger — you know, I have kids. <eob>
They fight 10 times a day, <eob> and they love each other 30 times a day. <eob>
You just go back and forth: <eol> you get angry, you're not angry; <eob> you're angry, you're not angry. <eob>
But disgust is different. <eob>
Disgust paints the person <eol> as subhuman, monstrous, <eob> deformed, morally deformed. <eob>
Disgust is like indelible ink. <eob>
There's research from John Gottman <eol> on marital therapy. <eob>
If you look at the faces -- <eol> if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt, <eob> that's a predictor that they're going <eol> to get divorced soon, <eob> whereas if they show anger, <eol> that doesn't predict anything, <eob> because if you deal with anger well, <eol> it actually is good. <eob>
So this election is different. <eob> Donald Trump personally <eol> uses the word "disgust" a lot. <eob>
He's very germ-sensitive, so disgust does matter a lot -- <eob> more for him, that's something unique to him -- <eob> but as we demonize each other more, <eob> and again, through the Manichaean worldview, <eob> the idea that the world is a battle <eol> between good and evil <eob> as this has been ramping up, <eob> we're more likely not just to say <eol> they're wrong or I don't like them, <eob> but we say <eol> they're evil, they're satanic, <eob> they're disgusting, they're revolting. <eob>
And then we want nothing to do with them. <eob>
And that's why I think we're seeing it, <eol> for example, on campus now. <eob> We're seeing more the urge <eol> to keep people off campus, <eob> silence them, keep them away. <eob>
I'm afraid that this whole generation <eol> of young people, <eob> if their introduction to politics <eol> involves a lot of disgust, <eob> they're not going to want to be involved <eol> in politics as they get older. <eob>
CA: So how do we deal with that? <eob> Disgust. How do you defuse disgust? <eob>
JH: You can't do it with reasons. <eob>
I think ... <eob> I studied disgust for many years, <eol> and I think about emotions a lot. <eob>
And I think that the opposite <eol> of disgust is actually love. <eob>
Love is all about, like ... <eob> Disgust is closing off, borders. <eob>
Love is about dissolving walls. <eob>
So personal relationships, I think, <eob> are probably the most powerful <eol> means we have. <eob>
You can be disgusted <eol> by a group of people, <eob> but then you meet a particular person <eob> and you genuinely discover <eol> that they're lovely. <eob>
And then gradually that chips away <eol> or changes your category as well. <eob>
The tragedy is, Americans used to be much more <eol> mixed up in the their towns <eob> by left-right or politics. <eob>
And now that it's become <eol> this great moral divide, <eob> there's a lot of evidence <eol> that we're moving to be near people <eob> who are like us politically. <eob>
It's harder to find somebody <eol> who's on the other side. <eob>
So they're over there, they're far away. <eob>
It's harder to get to know them. <eob>
CA: What would you say <eol> to someone or say to Americans, <eob> people generally, <eob> about what we should understand <eol> about each other <eob> that might help us rethink for a minute <eob> this "disgust" instinct? <eob>
JH: Yes. <eob> A really important thing <eol> to keep in mind -- <eob> there's research by political <eol> scientist Alan Abramowitz, <eob> showing that American democracy <eol> is increasingly governed <eob> by what's called "negative partisanship." <eob> That means you think, OK <eol> there's a candidate, <eob> you like the candidate, <eol> you vote for the candidate. <eob>
But with the rise of negative advertising <eob> and social media and all sorts <eol> of other trends, <eob> increasingly, the way elections are done <eob> is that each side tries <eol> to make the other side so horrible, so awful, <eob> that you'll vote for my guy by default. <eob>
And so as we more and more vote <eol> against the other side <eob> and not for our side, <eob> you have to keep in mind <eol> that if people are on the left, <eob> they think, "Well, I used to think <eol> that Republicans were bad, <eob> but now Donald Trump proves it. <eob>
And now every Republican, <eol> I can paint with all the things <eob> that I think about Trump. <eob> "And that's not necessarily true. <eob>
They're generally not very happy <eol> with their candidate. <eob>
This is the most negative partisanship <eol> election in American history. <eob>
So you have to first separate <eol> your feelings about the candidate <eob> from your feelings about the people <eol> who are given a choice. <eob>
And then you have to realize that, <eob> because we all live <eol> in a separate moral world -- <eob> the metaphor I use in the book is that we're all trapped <eol> in "The Matrix," <eob> or each moral community is a matrix, <eol> a consensual hallucination. <eob>
And so if you're within the blue matrix, <eob> everything's completely compelling <eol> that the other side -- <eob> they're troglodytes, <eol> they're racists, they're the worst people in the world, <eob> and you have all the facts to back that up. <eob>
But somebody in the next house from yours <eob> is living in a different moral matrix. <eob>
They live in a different video game, <eob> and they see a completely different <eol> set of facts. <eob>
And each one sees different threats <eol> to the country. <eob>
And what I've found <eol> from being in the middle <eob> and trying to understand <eol> both sides is: both sides are right. <eob>
There are a lot of threats to this country, <eob> and each side is constitutionally <eol> incapable of seeing them all. <eob>
CA: So, are you saying that we almost <eol> need a new type of empathy? <eob>
Empathy is traditionally framed as: <eob> "Oh, I feel your pain. <eob>
I can put myself in your shoes. <eob> "And we apply it to the poor, <eol> the needy, the suffering. <eob>
We don't usually apply it to people <eol> who we feel as other, <eob> or we're disgusted by. <eob>
JH: No. That's right. <eob>
CA: What would it look like to build <eol> that type of empathy? <eob>
JH: Actually, I think ... <eob> Empathy is a very, <eol> very hot topic in psychology, <eob> and it's a very popular word on the left in particular. <eob>
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy <eol> for the preferred classes of victims. <eob>
So it's important to empathize <eob> with the groups that we on the <eol> left think are so important. <eob>
That's easy to do, <eol> because you get points for that. <eob>
But empathy really should get you points <eol> if you do it when it's hard to do. <eob>
And, I think ... <eob> You know, we had a long 50-year period <eol> of dealing with our race problems <eob> and legal discrimination, <eob> and that was our top priority <eol> for a long time <eob> and it still is important. <eob>
But I think this year, <eob> I'm hoping it will make people see <eob> that we have an existential threat on our hands. <eob>
Our left-right divide, I believe, <eob> is by far the most important <eol> divide we face. <eob>
We still have issues about race <eol> and gender and LGBT, <eob> but this is the urgent need <eol> of the next 50 years, <eob> and things aren't going <eol> to get better on their own. <eob>
So we're going to need to do <eol> a lot of institutional reforms, <eob> and we could talk about that, <eob> but that's like a whole long, <eol> wonky conversation. <eob>
But I think it starts with people realizing <eol> that this is a turning point. <eob>
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy. <eob>
We need to realize: <eob> this is what our country needs, <eob> and this is what you need <eol> if you don't want to -- <eob> Raise your hand if you want <eol> to spend the next four years <eob> as angry and worried <eol> as you've been for the last year -- raise your hand. <eob>
So if you want to escape from this, <eob> read Buddha, read Jesus, <eol> read Marcus Aurelius. <eob>
They have all kinds of great advice <eol> for how to drop the fear, <eob> reframe things, <eob> stop seeing other people <eol> as your enemy. <eob>
There's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom <eol> for this kind of empathy. <eob>
CA: Here's my last question: <eob> Personally, what can people do <eol> to help heal? <eob>
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide <eol> to overcome your deepest prejudices. <eob>
And there's research showing <eob> that political prejudices <eol> are deeper and stronger than race prejudices <eob> in the country now. <eob>
So I think you have to make an effort — <eol> that's the main thing. <eob>
Make an effort to actually meet somebody. <eob>
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law, <eob> somebody who's on the other side. <eob>
So, after this election -- <eob> wait a week or two, <eob> because it's probably going <eol> to feel awful for one of you -- <eob> but wait a couple weeks, <eol> and then reach out and say you want to talk. <eob>
And before you do it, <eob> read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win Friends <eol> and Influence People" -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm totally serious. <eob> You'll learn techniques <eol> if you start by acknowledging, <eob> if you start by saying, <eob> "You know, we don't agree on a lot, <eob> but one thing I really respect <eol> about you, Uncle Bob," <eob> or "... about you conservatives, is ... " <eob> And you can find something. <eob>
If you start with some appreciation, <eol> it's like magic. <eob>
This is one of the main things <eol> I've learned <eob> that I take into my human relationships. <eob>
I still make lots of stupid mistakes, <eob> but I'm incredibly good <eol> at apologizing now, <eob> and at acknowledging what somebody <eol> was right about. <eob>
And if you do that, <eob> then the conversation goes really well, <eol> and it's actually really fun. <eob>
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating <eol> speaking with you. <eob>
It really does feel like the ground <eol> that we're on <eob> is a ground populated by deep questions <eol> of morality and human nature. <eob>
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant. <eob>
Thank you so much <eol> for sharing this time with us. <eob>
JH: Thanks, Chris. <eob>
JH: Thanks, everyone. <eob>
Economists have been exploring <eol> people's behavior for hundreds of years: <eob> how we make decisions, <eob> how we act individually and in groups, <eob> how we exchange value. <eob>
They've studied the institutions <eol> that facilitate our trade, <eob> like legal systems, <eob> corporations, <eob> marketplaces. <eob>
But there is a new, technological institution <eob> that will fundamentally change <eob> how we exchange value, <eob> and it's called the blockchain. <eob>
Now, that's a pretty <eol> bold statement, <eob> but if you take nothing else away from this talk, <eob> I actually want you to remember <eob> that while blockchain technology <eol> is relatively new, <eob> it's also a continuation <eol> of a very human story, <eob> and the story is this. <eob>
As humans, we find ways <eob> to lower uncertainty about one another <eob> so that we can exchange value. <eob>
Now, one of the first people <eol> to really explore the idea <eob> of institutions as a tool in economics <eob> to lower our uncertainties about one another <eob> and be able to do trade <eob> was the Nobel economist <eol> Douglass North. <eob>
He passed away at the end of 2015, <eob> but North pioneered what's called <eol> "new institutional economics." <eob> And what he meant by institutions <eol> were really just formal rules <eob> like a constitution, <eob> and informal constraints, like bribery. <eob>
These institutions are really the grease <eob> that allow our economic wheels <eol> to function, <eob> and we can see this play out <eol> over the course of human history. <eob>
If we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies, <eob> we really just traded within our village <eol> structure. <eob>
We had some informal constraints in place, <eob> but we enforced all of our trade <eol> with violence <eob> or social repercussions. <eob>
As our societies grew more complex <eob> and our trade routes grew more distant, <eob> we built up more formal institutions, <eob> institutions like banks for currency, <eob> governments, corporations. <eob>
These institutions helped us manage our trade <eob> as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, <eob> and our personal control was much lower. <eob>
Eventually with the internet, <eol> we put these same institutions online. <eob>
We built platform marketplaces <eol> like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, <eob> just faster institutions <eol> that act as middlemen <eob> to facilitate human economic activity. <eob>
As Douglass North saw it, <eob> institutions are a tool <eol> to lower uncertainty <eob> so that we can connect <eol> and exchange all kinds of value in society. <eob>
And I believe we are now entering <eob> a further and radical evolution <eob> of how we interact and trade, <eob> because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty <eob> not just with political <eol> and economic institutions, <eob> like our banks, our <eob> corporations, <eob> our governments, <eob> but we can do it with technology alone. <eob>
So what is the blockchain? <eob>
Blockchain technology <eol> is a decentralized database <eob> that stores a registry <eol> of assets and transactions <eob> across a peer-to-peer network. <eob>
It's basically a public registry <eob> of who owns what and who transacts what. <eob>
The transactions are secured <eol> through cryptography, <eob> and over time, that transaction history <eol> gets locked in blocks of data <eob> that are then cryptographically linked <eol> together and secured. <eob>
This creates an immutable, unforgeable record <eob> of all of the transactions <eol> across this network. <eob>
This record is replicated on every computer <eol> that uses the network. <eob>
It's not an app. <eob>
It's not a company. <eob>
I think it's closest in description <eol> to something like Wikipedia. <eob>
We can see everything on Wikipedia. <eob>
It's a composite view that's constantly <eol> changing and being updated. <eob>
We can also track those <eol> changes over time on Wikipedia, <eob> and we can create our own wikis, <eob> because at their core, <eol> they're just a data infrastructure. <eob>
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform <eol> that stores words and images <eob> and the changes to that data over time. <eob>
On the blockchain, <eob> you can think of it <eol> as an open infrastructure <eob> that stores many kinds of assets. <eob>
It stores the history of custodianship, <eob> ownership and location <eob> for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin, <eob> other digital assets <eob> like a title of ownership of IP. <eob>
It could be a certificate, a contract, <eob> real world objects, <eob> even personal identifiable information. <eob>
There are of course other <eol> technical details to the blockchain, <eob> but at its core, that's how it works. <eob>
It's this public registry <eol> that stores transactions in a network <eob> and is replicated so <eol> that it's very secure and hard to tamper with. <eob>
Which brings me to my point <eob> of how blockchains <eol> lower uncertainty <eob> and how they therefore promise <eol> to transform our economic systems <eob> in radical ways. <eob>
So uncertainty is kind of a big term <eob> in economics, <eob> but I want to go through three forms of it <eob> that we face in almost all <eol> of our everyday transactions, <eob> where blockchains <eol> can play a role. <eob>
We face uncertainties like not knowing <eol> who we're dealing with, <eob> not having visibility into a transaction <eob> and not having recourse <eol> if things go wrong. <eob>
So let's take the first example, <eol> not knowing who we're dealing with. <eob>
Say I want to buy <eol> a used smartphone on eBay. <eob>
The first thing I'm going to do <eol> is look up who I'm buying from. <eob>
Are they a power user? <eob>
Do they have great reviews <eol> and ratings, or do they have no profile at all? <eob>
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks: <eob> these are the attestations <eol> about our identities <eob> that we cobble together today <eob> and use to lower uncertainty <eol> about who we're dealing with. <eob>
But the problem is <eol> they're very fragmented. <eob>
Think about how many profiles you have. <eob>
Blockchains allow for us <eol> to create an open, global platform <eob> on which to store any attestation <eol> about any individual <eob> from any source. <eob>
This allows us to create a user-controlled <eob> portable identity. <eob>
More than a profile, <eob> it means you can selectively reveal <eob> the different attributes about you <eob> that help facilitate trade or interaction, <eob> for instance that a government <eol> issued you an ID, <eob> or that you're over 21, <eob> by revealing the cryptographic proof <eob> that these details exist and are signed off on. <eob>
Having this kind of <eob> portable identity <eob> around the physical world <eol> and the digital world <eob> means we can do all kinds of human trade <eob> in a totally new way. <eob>
So I've talked about how blockchains <eol> could lower uncertainty <eob> in who we're dealing with. <eob>
The second uncertainty that we often face <eob> is just not having transparency <eol> into our interactions. <eob>
Say you're going to send me <eol> that smartphone by mail. <eob>
I want some degree of transparency. <eob>
I want to know that the product I bought is the same <eol> one that arrives in the mail <eob> and that there's some record <eol> for how it got to me. <eob>
This is true not just for electronics <eol> like smartphones, <eob> but for many kinds of goods and data, <eob> things like medicine, luxury goods, <eob> any kind of data or product <eol> that we don't want tampered with. <eob>
The problem in many companies, <eob> especially those that produce <eol> something complicated like a smartphone, <eob> is they're managing all of these different vendors <eob> across a horizontal supply chain. <eob>
All of these people <eol> that go into making a product, <eob> they don't have the same database. <eob>
They don't use the same infrastructure, <eob> and so it becomes really hard <eol> to see transparently a product evolve over time. <eob>
Using the blockchain, we can create <eob> a shared reality <eol> across nontrusting entities. <eob>
By this I mean <eob> all of these nodes in the network <eol> do not need to know each other <eob> or trust each other, <eob> because they each have the ability <eob> to monitor and validate the chain <eol> for themselves. <eob> Think back to Wikipedia. <eob> It's a shared database, <eob> and even though it has multiple readers <eob> and multiple writers at the same time, <eob> it has one single truth. <eob>
So we can create that using blockchains. <eob>
We can create a decentralized database <eol> that has the same efficiency of a monopoly <eob> without actually creating that central authority. <eob>
So all of these vendors, <eol> all sorts of companies, <eob> can interact using the same database <eol> without trusting one another. <eob>
It means for consumers, we can have <eol> a lot more transparency. <eob>
As a real-world object travels along, <eob> we can see its digital certificate <eol> or token move on the blockchain, <eob> adding value as it goes. <eob>
This is a whole new world <eol> in terms of our visibility. <eob>
So I've talked about how blockchains <eol> can lower our uncertainties about identity <eob> and how they change what we mean <eol> about transparency <eob> in long distances and complex trades, <eol> like in a supply chain. <eob>
The last uncertainty that we often face <eob> is one of the most open-ended, <eol> and it's reneging. <eob>
What if you don't send me the smartphone? <eob>
Can I get my money back? <eob>
Blockchains allow us to write code, <eob> binding contracts, <eob> between individuals <eob> and then guarantee that those contracts <eol> will bear out <eob> without a third party enforcer. <eob>
So if we look at the smartphone example, <eol> you could think about escrow. <eob>
You are financing that phone, <eob> but you don't need <eol> to release the funds <eob> until you can verify that all the conditions <eol> have been met. <eob> You got the phone. <eob>
I think this is one <eol> of the most exciting ways <eob> that blockchains <eol> lower our uncertainties, <eob> because it means to some degree <eob> we can collapse institutions <eol> and their enforcement. <eob>
It means a lot of human economic activity <eob> can get collateralized and automated, <eob> and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, <eob> the places where information moves <eol> from the real world to the blockchain. <eob>
I think what would probably floor Douglass North <eob> about this use of technology <eob> is the fact that the very thing <eol> that makes it work, <eob> the very thing that keeps the blockchain <eol> secure and verified, <eob> is our mutual distrust. <eob>
So rather than all of our uncertainties <eob> slowing us down <eob> and requiring institutions <eob> like banks, our governments, our <eob> corporations, <eob> we can actually harness all of that <eol> collective uncertainty <eob> and use it to collaborate <eol> and exchange more and faster and more open. <eob>
Now, I don't want you <eol> to get the impression <eob> that the blockchain is the solution <eol> to everything, <eob> even though the media has said <eol> that it's going to end world poverty, <eob> it's also going to solve <eol> the counterfeit drug problem <eob> and potentially save the rainforest. <eob>
The truth is, this technology <eol> is in its infancy, <eob> and we're going to need to see <eol> a lot of experiments take place <eob> and probably fail <eob> before we truly understand <eol> all of the use cases <eob> for our economy. <eob>
But there are tons of people <eol> working on this, <eob> from financial institutions <eob> to technology companies, <eol> start-ups and universities. <eob>
And one of the reasons is that <eol> it's not just an economic evolution. <eob>
It's also an innovation in computer science. <eob>
in a totally new way. <eob> Blockchains give us <eol> the technological capability <eob> of creating a record <eol> of human exchange, <eob> of exchange of currency, <eob> of all kinds of digital <eol> and physical assets, <eob> even of our own personal attributes, <eob>
So in some ways, <eob> they become a technological institution <eob> that has a lot of the benefits <eob> of the traditional institutions <eol> we're used to using in society, <eob> but it does this in a decentralized way. <eob>
It does this by converting <eol> a lot of our uncertainties <eob> into certainties. <eob>
So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, <eob> because we are about <eol> to face a world <eob> where distributed, autonomous institutions <eob> have quite a significant role. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Bruno Giussani: <eob> Thank you, <eob> Bettina. <eob>
I think I understood that it's coming, <eob> it offers a lot of potential, <eob> and it's complex. <eob>
What is your estimate <eol> for the rate of adoption? <eob>
Bettina Warburg: I think <eol> that's a really good question. <eob>
My lab is pretty much focused <eob> on going the enterprise and government <eol> route first, <eob> because in reality, blockchain <eol> is a complex technology. <eob>
How many of you actually understand <eol> how the internet works? <eob>
But you use it every day, <eob> so I think we're sort of facing <eol> the same John Sculley idea <eob> of technology should either be invisible or beautiful, <eob> and blockchain is kind of neither <eol> of those things right now, <eob> so it's better suited <eol> for either really early adopters <eob> who kind of get it and can tinker around <eob> or for finding those best use cases <eob> like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts <eob> that can be used at that level <eol> of an enterprise or government. <eob>
BG: <eob> Thank you. <eob> Thanks for coming to TED. <eob>
Hi. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So, five years ago, this was me. <eob>
I was a PhD student at Harvard, <eob> and I loved to travel. <eob>
I had just gotten engaged <eol> to marry the love of my life. <eob>
I was 28, and like so many of us <eol> when we are in good health, <eob> I felt like I was invincible. <eob>
Then one day I had <eol> a fever of 104.7 degrees. <eob>
I probably should have gone to the doctor, <eob> but I'd never really been sick in my life, <eob> and I knew that usually, <eol> if you have a virus, <eob> you stay home and you make <eol> some chicken soup, <eob> and in a few days, <eol> everything will be fine. <eob>
But this time it wasn't fine. <eob>
After the fever broke, <eob> for three weeks I was so dizzy, <eol> I couldn't leave my house. <eob>
I would walk straight into door frames. <eob>
I had to hug the walls <eol> just to make it to the bathroom. <eob>
That spring I got infection <eol> after infection, <eob> and every time I went to the doctor, <eob> he said there was absolutely <eol> nothing wrong. <eob>
He had his laboratory tests, <eob> which always came back normal. <eob>
All I had were my symptoms, <eob> which I could describe, <eob> but no one else can see. <eob>
I know it sounds silly, <eob> but you have to find a way <eol> to explain things like this to yourself, <eob> and so I thought maybe I was just aging. <eob>
Maybe this is what it's like <eol> to be on the other side of 25. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Then the neurological symptoms started. <eob>
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't <eol> draw the right side of a circle. <eob>
Other times I wouldn't be able <eol> to speak or move at all. <eob>
I saw every kind of specialist: <eob> infectious disease doctors, <eol> dermatologists, endocrinologists, <eob> cardiologists. <eob>
I even saw a psychiatrist. <eob>
My psychiatrist said, <eol> "It's clear you're really sick, <eob> but not with anything psychiatric. <eob>
I hope they can find out <eol> what's wrong with you. <eob> " <eob>
The next day, my neurologist <eol> diagnosed me with conversion disorder. <eob>
He told me that everything -- <eob> the fevers, the sore throats, <eol> the sinus infection, <eob> all of the gastrointestinal, <eol> neurological and cardiac symptoms -- <eob> were being caused <eol> by some distant emotional trauma <eob> that I could not remember. <eob>
The symptoms were real, he said, <eob> but they had no biological cause. <eob>
I was training to be a social scientist. <eob> I had studied statistics, <eol> probability theory, <eob> mathematical modeling, <eol> experimental design. <eob>
I felt like I couldn't just reject <eol> my neurologist's diagnosis. <eob>
It didn't feel true, <eob> but I knew from my training <eol> that the truth is often counterintuitive, <eob> so easily obscured <eol> by what we want to believe. <eob>
So I had to consider the possibility <eol> that he was right. <eob>
That day, I ran a small experiment. <eob>
I walked back the two miles <eol> from my neurologist's office to my house, <eob> my legs wrapped in this strange, <eol> almost electric kind of pain. <eob>
I meditated on that pain, <eob> contemplating how my mind <eol> could have possibly generated all this. <eob>
As soon as I walked through the door, <eob> I collapsed. <eob>
My brain and my spinal cord were burning. <eob>
My neck was so stiff <eol> I couldn't touch my chin to my chest, <eob> and the slightest sound -- <eob> the rustling of the sheets, <eob> my husband walking barefoot <eol> in the next room -- <eob> could cause excruciating pain. <eob>
I would spend most <eol> of the next two years in bed. <eob>
How could my doctor <eol> have gotten it so wrong? <eob>
I thought I had a rare disease, <eob> something doctors had never seen. <eob>
And then I went online <eob> and found thousands of people <eol> all over the world <eob> living with the same symptoms, <eob> similarly isolated, <eob> similarly disbelieved. <eob>
Some could still work, <eob> but had to spend their evenings <eol> and weekends in bed, <eob> just so they could show up <eol> the next Monday. <eob>
On the other end of the spectrum, <eob> some were so sick <eob> they had to live in complete darkness, <eob> unable to tolerate <eol> the sound of a human voice <eob> or the touch of a loved one. <eob>
I was diagnosed <eol> with myalgic encephalomyelitis. <eob>
You've probably heard it called <eol> "chronic fatigue syndrome." <eob> For decades, that's a name <eob> that's meant that this <eob> has been the dominant image <eob> of a disease that can be <eol> as serious as this. <eob>
The key symptom we all share <eob> is that whenever we exert ourselves -- <eol> physically, mentally -- <eob> we pay and we pay hard. <eob>
If my husband goes for a run, <eol> he might be sore for a couple of days. <eob>
If I try to walk half a block, <eol> I might be bedridden for a week. <eob>
It is a perfect custom prison. <eob>
I know ballet dancers who can't dance, <eob> accountants who can't add, <eob> medical students who never became doctors. <eob>
It doesn't matter what you once were; <eob> you can't do it anymore. <eob>
It's been four years, <eob> and I've still never been as well as I was <eob> the minute before I walked home <eol> from my neurologist's office. <eob>
It's estimated that about 15 <eol> to 30 million people around the world <eob> have this disease. <eob>
In the US, where I'm from, <eol> it's about one million people. <eob>
That makes it roughly twice as common <eol> as multiple sclerosis. <eob>
Patients can live for decades <eol> with the physical function <eob> of someone with congestive heart failure. <eob>
Twenty-five percent of us <eol> are homebound or bedridden, <eob> and 75 to 85 percent of us <eol> can't even work part-time. <eob>
Yet doctors do not treat us <eob> and science does not study us. <eob>
How could a disease this common <eol> and this devastating <eob> have been forgotten by medicine? <eob>
When my doctor diagnosed me <eol> with conversion disorder, <eob> he was invoking a lineage <eol> of ideas about women's bodies <eob> that are over 2,500 years old. <eob>
The Roman physician Galen thought <eob> that hysteria was caused <eol> by sexual deprivation <eob> in particularly passionate women. <eob>
The Greeks thought the uterus <eol> would literally dry up <eob> and wander around the body <eol> in search of moisture, <eob> pressing on internal organs -- <eob> yes -- <eob> causing symptoms from extreme emotions <eob> to dizziness and paralysis. <eob>
The cure was marriage and motherhood. <eob>
These ideas went largely unchanged <eol> for several millennia until the 1880s, <eob> when neurologists tried to modernize <eol> the theory of hysteria. <eob>
Sigmund Freud developed a theory <eob> that the unconscious mind <eol> could produce physical symptoms <eob> when dealing with memories or emotions <eob> too painful for the conscious <eol> mind to handle. <eob>
It converted these emotions <eol> into physical symptoms. <eob>
This meant that men <eol> could now get hysteria, <eob> but of course women were still <eol> the most susceptible. <eob>
When I began investigating <eol> the history of my own disease, <eob> I was amazed to find how deep <eol> these ideas still run. <eob>
In 1934, <eob> 198 doctors, nurses and staff <eol> at the Los Angeles County General Hospital <eob> became seriously ill. <eob>
They had muscle weakness, stiffness <eol> in the neck and back, fevers -- <eob> all of the same symptoms <eol> I had when I first got diagnosed. <eob>
Doctors thought <eol> it was a new form of polio. <eob>
Since then, there have been more <eol> than 70 outbreaks documented <eob> around the world, <eob> of a strikingly similar <eol> post-infectious disease. <eob>
All of these outbreaks have tended <eol> to disproportionately affect women, <eob> and in time, when doctors failed to find <eol> the one cause of the disease, <eob> they thought that these outbreaks <eol> were mass hysteria. <eob>
Why has this idea had such staying power? <eob>
I do think it has to do with sexism, <eob> but I also think that fundamentally, <eol> doctors want to help. <eob>
They want to know the answer, <eob> and this category allows doctors to treat <eol> what would otherwise be untreatable, <eob> to explain illnesses <eol> that have no explanation. <eob>
The problem is that this <eol> can cause real harm. <eob>
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist <eol> named Eliot Slater <eob> studied a cohort of 85 patients <eol> who had been diagnosed with hysteria. <eob>
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead <eol> and 30 had become disabled. <eob>
Many had undiagnosed conditions <eol> like multiple sclerosis, <eob> epilepsy, brain tumors. <eob>
In 1980, hysteria was officially <eol> renamed "conversion disorder." <eob> When my neurologist gave me <eol> that diagnosis in 2012, <eob> he was echoing Freud's words verbatim, <eob> and even today, <eob> women are 2 to 10 times more likely <eol> to receive that diagnosis. <eob>
The problem with the theory of hysteria <eol> or psychogenic illness <eob> is that it can never be proven. <eob>
It is by definition <eol> the absence of evidence, <eob> and in the case of ME, <eob> psychological explanations <eol> have held back biological research. <eob>
All <eob> around the world, <eob> ME is one of the least funded diseases. <eob>
In the US, we spend each year <eol> roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient, <eob> 250 dollars per MS patient <eob> and just 5 dollars per year <eol> per ME patient. <eob>
This was not just lightning. <eob>
I was not just unlucky. <eob>
The ignorance surrounding my disease <eol> has been a choice, <eob> a choice made by the institutions <eol> that were supposed to protect us. <eob>
We don't know why ME <eol> sometimes runs in families, <eob> why you can get it <eol> after almost any infection, <eob> from enteroviruses <eol> to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever, <eob> or why it affects women <eol> at two to three times the rate of men. <eob>
This issue is much bigger <eol> than just my disease. <eob>
When I first got sick, <eob> old friends were reaching out to me. <eob>
I soon found myself a part <eol> of a cohort of women in their late 20s <eob> whose bodies were falling apart. <eob>
What was striking was just how <eol> much trouble we were having <eob> being taken seriously. <eob>
I learned of one woman with scleroderma, <eob> an autoimmune connective tissue disease, <eob> who was told for years <eol> that it was all in her head. <eob>
Between the time of onset and diagnosis, <eob> her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged, <eob> she will never be able to eat again. <eob>
Another woman with ovarian cancer, <eob> who for years was told <eol> that it was just early menopause. <eob>
A friend from college, <eob> whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed <eol> for years as anxiety. <eob>
Here's why this worries me: <eob> since the 1950s, rates of many <eol> autoimmune diseases <eob> have doubled to tripled. <eob>
Forty-five percent of patients <eol> who are eventually diagnosed <eob> with a recognized autoimmune disease <eob> are initially told they're hypochondriacs. <eob>
Like the hysteria of old, <eol> this has everything to do with gender <eob> and with whose stories we believe. <eob>
Seventy-five percent <eol> of autoimmune disease patients are women, <eob> and in some diseases, <eol> it's as high as 90 percent. <eob>
Even though these diseases <eol> disproportionately affect women, <eob> they are not women's diseases. <eob>
ME affects children <eol> and ME affects millions of men. <eob>
And as one patient told me, <eob> we get it coming and going -- <eob> if you're a woman, you're told <eol> you're exaggerating your symptoms, <eob> but if you're a guy, you're told <eol> to be strong, to buck up. <eob>
And men may even have <eol> a more difficult time getting diagnosed. <eob>
My brain is not what it used to be. <eob>
Here's the good part: <eob> despite everything, I still have hope. <eob>
So many diseases were once <eol> thought of as psychological <eob> until science uncovered <eol> their biological mechanisms. <eob>
Patients with epilepsy <eol> could be forcibly institutionalized <eob> until the EEG was able to measure <eol> abnormal electrical activity in the brain. <eob>
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed <eol> as hysterical paralysis <eob> until the CAT scan and the MRI <eol> discovered brain lesions. <eob>
And recently, we used to think <eob> that stomach ulcers <eol> were just caused by stress, <eob> until we discovered <eol> that H. pylori was the culprit. <eob>
ME has never benefited <eol> from the kind of science <eob> that other diseases have had, <eob> but that's starting to change. <eob>
In Germany, scientists are starting <eol> to find evidence of autoimmunity, <eob> and in Japan, of brain inflammation. <eob>
In the US, scientists at Stanford <eol> are finding abnormalities <eob> in energy metabolism <eob> that are 16 standard deviations <eol> away from normal. <eob>
And in Norway, researchers <eol> are running a phase-3 clinical trial <eob> on a cancer drug that in some patients <eol> causes complete remission. <eob>
What also gives me hope <eob> is the resilience of patients. <eob>
Online we came together, <eob> and we shared our stories. <eob>
We devoured what research there was. <eob>
We experimented on ourselves. <eob>
We became our own scientists <eol> and our own doctors <eob> because we had to be. <eob>
And slowly I added five percent here, <eol> five percent there, <eob> until eventually, on a good day, <eob> I was able to leave my home. <eob>
I still had to make ridiculous choices: <eob> Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes, <eol> or will I wash my hair today? <eob>
But it gave me hope <eol> that I could be treated. <eob>
I had a sick body; that was all. <eob>
And with the right kind of help, <eol> maybe one day I could get better. <eob>
I came together with patients <eob> around the world, <eob> and we started to fight. <eob>
We have filled the void <eol> with something wonderful, <eob> but it is not enough. <eob>
I still don't know if I will ever <eol> be able to run again, <eob> or walk at any distance, <eob> or do any of those kinetic things <eol> that I now only get to do in my dreams. <eob>
But I am so grateful <eol> for how far I have come. <eob>
Progress is slow, <eob> and it is up <eob> and it is down, <eob> but I am getting a little better each day. <eob>
I remember what it was like <eol> when I was stuck in that bedroom, <eob> when it had been months <eol> since I had seen the sun. <eob>
I thought that I would die there. <eob>
But here I am today, <eob> with you, <eob> and that is a miracle. <eob>
I don't know what would have happened <eol> had I not been one of the lucky ones, <eob> had I gotten sick before the internet, <eob> had I not found my community. <eob>
I probably would have already <eol> taken my own life, <eob> as so many others have done. <eob>
How many lives could <eol> we have saved, decades ago, <eob> if we had asked the right questions? <eob>
How many lives could we save today <eob> if we decide to make a real start? <eob>
Even once the true cause <eol> of my disease is discovered, <eob> if we don't change <eol> our institutions and our culture, <eob> we will do this again to another disease. <eob>
Living with this illness has taught me <eob> that science and medicine <eol> are profoundly human endeavors. <eob>
Doctors, scientists and policy makers <eob> are not immune to the same biases <eob> that affect all of us. <eob>
We need to think in more nuanced ways <eol> about women's health. <eob>
Our immune systems are just as much <eol> a battleground for equality <eob> as the rest of our bodies. <eob>
We need to listen to patients' stories, <eob> and we need to be willing <eol> to say, "I don't know." <eob> "I don't know" is a beautiful thing. <eob> "I don't know" is where discovery starts. <eob>
And if we can do that, <eob> if we can approach the great vastness <eol> of all that we do not know, <eob> and then, rather than fear uncertainty, <eob> maybe we can greet it <eol> with a sense of wonder. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
I am so excited to be here. <eob>
Everything in America is so much <eol> bigger than in Europe. <eob>
Look at me -- I am huge! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's fantastic! <eob> And TED Talks -- TED Talks are where <eol> everybody has great ideas. <eob>
So the question is: Where do <eol> those great ideas come from? <eob>
Well, it's a little bit of debate, <eob> but it's generally reckoned <eol> that the average person -- <eob> that's me -- <eob> has about 50,000 thoughts a day. <eob>
Which is a lot, <eob> until you realize that 95 percent of them <eob> are the same ones you had the day before. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK? <eob>
I think things like, <eob> "Oh! <eob>
I know — I must clean the floor. <eob> Oh! I forgot to walk the dog. <eob> "My most popular:" <eob> Don't eat that cookie. <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, 95 percent repetition. <eob>
That leaves us with just a five percent window <eol> of opportunity each day <eob> to actually think something new. <eob>
And some of my new thoughts are useless. <eob>
The other day I was watching <eol> some sports on television, <eob> and I was trying to decide <eol> why I just don't engage with it. <eob>
Some of it I find curious. <eob> This is odd. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Do you think it would be <eol> worth being that flexible <eob> just to be able to see <eol> your heel at that angle? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And here's the thing: <eob> I'm never going to be able <eol> to relate to that, <eob> because I'm never going <eol> to be able to do it, OK? <eob>
Well, not twice, anyway. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I'll tell you the truth. <eob> The truth is I have never been <eol> any good at sport, OK? <eob>
I've reached that wonderful age <eol> when all my friends say, <eob> "Oh, I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18." <eob> And I always feel rather smug then. <eob>
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I couldn't run then. <eob>
I'm certainly not going to do it now. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So then I had my new idea: <eob> Why not engage people like me in sport? <eob>
I think what the world needs now <eob> is the Olympics for people <eol> with zero athletic ability. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Oh, it would be so much more fun. <eob>
We'd have three basic rules, OK? <eob>
Obviously no drugs; <eol> no corruption, no skills. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It would be -- <eob> No, it's a terrible idea. <eob>
And I also know why I don't engage with sport <eol> when I watch it on television. <eob>
It's because probably 97 percent <eol> of it is about men running <eob> and men kicking things, <eob> men trying to look neatly packaged <eol> in Lycra. <eob> There is -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is -- <eob> Not always successfully. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There is so little female sport <eol> on television, <eob> that a young woman watching <eol> might be forgiven for thinking, <eob> and how can I put this nicely, <eob> that the male member is the very lever <eol> you need <eob> to get yourself off the couch <eol> and onto a sports ground. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The inequalities <eol> in sport are breathtaking. <eob>
So this is what happens to me: <eob> I have a brand new idea, <eob> and immediately I come back to an old one. <eob>
The fact is, there is not now, <eob> nor has there ever been <eol> in the whole of history, <eob> a single country in the world <eol> where women have equality with men. <eob> Not one. <eob> 196 countries, <eob> it hasn't happened <eol> in the whole of evolution. <eob> So, here is a picture of evolution. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We women are not even in it! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's a wonder men have been able <eol> to evolve quite so brilliantly. <eob> So -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It bugs me, and I know <eol> I should do something about it. <eob>
But I'm busy, OK? <eob>
I have a full-on career, <eob> I've got three kids, <eol> I've got an elderly mom. <eob>
In fact, if I'm honest with you, <eob> one of the reasons I came out here <eob> is because TED Talks said <eol> I could have 15 minutes to myself, <eob> and I never have that much time -- <eob>
So I'm busy. <eob> And anyway, I already had <eol> a go at changing the world. <eob>
Here's the thing, OK? <eob>
Everybody has inside themselves <eol> what I call an "activation button." <eob> It's the button <eol> that gets pressed when you think, <eob> "I must do something about this." <eob> It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons. <eob>
Maybe you face some kind of inequality, <eob> or you've come across <eol> an injustice of some kind, <eob> sometimes an illness strikes, <eob> or you're born in some way disadvantaged, <eob> or perhaps underprivileged. <eob>
So I was born gay, OK? <eob>
I've always known, <eob> I don't think my family <eol> were the least bit surprised. <eob>
Here is a picture of me aged four. <eob>
I look cute, <eob> but inside I genuinely believed <eol> that I looked like Clint Eastwood. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So my activation button was pressed <eol> when I had my kids — <eob> three wonderful kids, born <eol> to my then-partner. <eob>
Now here's the thing: <eol> I work on television in Britain. <eob>
By the time they were born, <eol> I was already hosting my own shows <eob> and working in the public eye. <eob>
I love what I do, <eob> but I love my kids more. <eob>
And I didn't want them <eol> to grow up with a secret. <eob>
1994, when my son, <eol> my youngest was born, <eob> there was not, as far as I was aware, <eob> a single out, gay woman <eol> in British public life. <eob>
I don't think secrets are a good thing. <eob>
I think they are a cancer of the soul. <eob>
So I decided to come out. <eob>
Everybody warned me <eol> that I would never work again, <eob> but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk. <eob>
Well, it was hell. <eob>
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious section <eol> of the right-wing press, <eob> and they went nuts. <eob>
And their hatred stirred up <eol> the less stable elements of society, <eob> and we got death threats -- <eob> enough death threats that I had to take <eol> the kids into hiding, <eob> and we had to have <eol> police protection. <eob>
And I promise you there were many moments <eol> in the still of the night <eob> when I was terrified <eol> by what I had done. <eob>
Eventually the dust settled. <eob> Against all expectation <eol> I carried on working, <eob> and my kids were and continue <eol> to be absolutely fantastic. <eob>
I remember when my son was six, <eol> he had a friend over to play. <eob>
They were in the next room; <eol> I could hear them chatting. <eob>
The friend said to my son, <eol> "What's it like having two mums?" <eob> I was a little anxious to hear, so I leant in <eol> to hear and my son said, <eob> "It's fantastic, <eol> because if one of them's sick, <eob> you've still got another one to cook for you." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So my activation button <eol> for gay equality was pressed, <eob> and along with many, many others, <eob> I campaigned for years <eol> for gay rights, <eob> and in particular, the right <eol> to marry the person that I love. <eob>
In the end, we succeeded. <eob>
And in 2014, on the day <eol> that the law was changed, <eob> I married my wife, <eol> who I love very much, indeed. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We didn't do it in a quiet way -- <eol> we did it on the stage <eob> at the Royal Festival Hall in London. <eob> It was a great event. <eob> The hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people. <eob>
We invited 150 family and friends, <eol> then I let it be known to the public: <eob> anybody who wanted to come and celebrate, <eol> please come and join us. <eob>
It would be free to anybody <eol> who wanted to come. <eob>
Two-and-half thousand people turned up. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Every kind of person you can imagine: <eob> gays, straights, rabbis, <eol> nuns, married people, <eob> black, white -- the whole <eol> of humanity was there. <eob>
And I remember standing on that stage <eol> thinking, "How fantastic. <eob> Job done. <eob> Love triumphs. <eob> Law changed." <eob> And I -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And I genuinely thought <eol> my activation days were over, OK? <eob>
So every year in that same hall, <eob> I host a fantastic concert to celebrate <eol> International Women's Day. <eob>
We gather the world's only all-female orchestra, <eob> we play fantastic music by forgotten <eol> or overlooked women composers, <eob> we have amazing conductors -- <eob> it's Marin Alsop there <eol> from Baltimore conducting, <eob> Petula Clark singing -- <eob> and I give a lecture <eol> on women's history. <eob>
I love to gather inspirational stories <eol> from the past and pass them on. <eob>
Too often, I think history's what I call <eol> the Mount Rushmore model. <eob>
It looks majestic, but the women <eol> have been entirely left out of it. <eob>
And I was giving a talk in 2015 <eol> about the suffragettes -- <eob> I'm sure you know those magnificent <eol> women who fought so hard <eob> for the right for women <eol> in Britain to vote. <eob>
And their slogan was: <eol> "Deeds, not words." <eob> And boy, they succeeded, <eob> because women did indeed get <eol> the vote in 1928. <eob>
So I'm giving this talk about this, <eob> and as I'm talking, what I realized is: <eob> this was not a history lecture I was giving; <eob> this was not something <eol> where the job was done. <eob>
This was something where <eol> there was so much left to do. <eob>
Nowhere in the world, for example, <eob> do women have equal representation <eol> in positions of power. <eob>
OK, let's take a very quick look <eol> at the top 100 companies <eob> in the London Stock Exchange in 2016. <eob>
Top 100 companies: How many women <eol> running them? <eob> Seven. OK. Seven. That's all right, I suppose. <eob>
Until you realize that 17 are run <eol> by men called "John." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There are more men called John <eol> running FTSE 100 companies -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
than there are women. <eob> There are 14 run by men called "Dave." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, I'm sure Dave and John <eol> are doing a bang-up job. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK. Why does it matter? <eob> Well, it's that pesky business <eol> of the gender pay gap. <eob>
Nowhere in the world do women <eol> earn the same as men. <eob>
And that is never going to change <eob> unless we have more women <eol> at the top in the boardroom. <eob>
We have plenty of laws; <eob> the Equal Pay Act in Britain <eol> was passed in 1975. <eob>
Nevertheless, there are still <eol> many, many women <eob> who, from early November <eol> until the end of the year, <eob> by comparison to their male colleagues, <eob> are effectively working for free. <eob>
In fact, the World Economic Forum estimates <eob> that women will finally get equal pay in ... <eob> 2133! <eob> Yay! <eob>
And here's the thing: <eob> the day before I came out <eol> to give my talk, <eob> the World Economic Forum revised it. <eob> So that's good, because that's a terrible -- 2133. <eob>
Do you know what they revised it to? <eob> 2186. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah, another 53 years, OK? <eob> We are not going to get equal pay <eob> in my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives <eob> under the current system. <eob>
And I have waited long enough. <eob>
I've waited long enough <eol> in my own business. <eob>
In 2016 I became the very first woman <eol> on British television <eob> to host a prime-time panel show. <eob>
Isn't that great? <eob>
Wonderful, I'm thrilled. <eob> But — <eob>
But 2016! The first! <eob> Television's been around for 80 years! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It may be television's not so important, <eob> but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it? <eob>
2016, the UN were looking <eol> for a brand new ambassador <eob> to represent women's empowerment <eol> and gender equality, <eob> and who did they choose? <eob> Wonder Woman. <eob> Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Because no woman was up to the job. <eob>
The representation of women in positions <eol> of power is shockingly low. <eob>
It's true in Congress, <eol> and it's certainly true in the British Parliament. <eob>
In 2015, the number of men <eol> elected to the Parliament that year <eob> was greater than the total number of women <eob> who have ever been members of Parliament. <eob> And why does it matter? <eob> Here's the thing: <eol> if they're not at the table -- <eob> literally, in Britain, at that table <eol> helping to make the laws -- <eob> do not be surprised <eol> if the female perspective is overlooked. <eob>
It's a great role model for young people <eol> to see a woman in charge. <eob>
In 2016, Britain <eol> got its second female Prime Minister; <eob> Theresa May came to power. <eob> The day she came to power she was challenged: <eob> just do one thing. <eob> Do one thing in the first 100 days <eol> that you're in office <eob> to try and improve lives for women in Britain. <eob>
And what did she do? Nothing. <eob> Nothing. <eob> Because she's much too busy cleaning up <eol> the mess the boys made. <eob>
Even having a female leader, <eob> they always find something better to do <eob> than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality. <eob>
So I keep talking about equality <eol> like it matters. Does it? <eob> Well, let's take a very quick look <eol> at the STEM industries, OK? <eob>
So science, technology, <eol> engineering and mathematics. <eob>
Pretty much important <eol> in every single aspect of our daily lives. <eob>
There is the thickest and most incredibly <eol> well-documented glass ceiling <eob> in the STEM industries. <eob>
What if the cure for cancer <eob> or the answer the global warming <eob> lies in the head of a young female scientist <eol> who fails to progress? <eob>
So I thought all these things, <eob> and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words." <eob> And I spoke to my wonderful friend, <eob> brilliant journalist Catherine Mayer in Britain, <eob> and we rather foolishly — <eob> and I suspect there was wine involved — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We decided to found <eol> a brand new political party. <eob>
Because here's the critical thing: <eob> the one place women and men <eol> are absolutely equal is at the ballot box. <eob>
We had no idea what we were doing, <eob> we didn't know how complicated <eol> it was to start a political party. <eob>
I thought, "It can't be that difficult, <eol> men have been doing it for years." <eob>
So we started by calling it <eol> "The Women's Equality Party." <eob> And straightaway people said to me, <eob> "Why did you call it that?" <eob> I said, "I don't know, <eol> I just thought we'd be clear." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I didn't want what we were doing <eol> to be a secret, you know? I just -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Some people said, "You can't call it that! <eob>
It's much too feminist! <eob> "Ooh! Scary word! Ahh! <eob> I can't tell you how many times <eol> I've heard somebody say," <eob> I'm not a feminist, but... <eob> "And I always think <eol> if there's a" but "in the sentence, <eob> it can't all be roses in the garden. <eob>
And then I started getting <eol> asked the hilarious question, <eob> "Are you all going to burn your bras?" <eob> Yes! Because bras are famously <eol> made of flammable material. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's why all women spark when they walk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's quick history sidebar for you: <eob> no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s. <eob>
It's a story made up by a journalist. <eob>
So -- <eob> Thank goodness journalism <eol> has improved since then. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I announced what we were going to do <eol> in a broadcast interview, <eob> and straightaway, the emails started coming. <eob>
First hundreds, then thousands and thousands, <eob> from every age group: <eol> from the very young to women in their '90s, <eob> to hundreds of wonderful men. <eob>
People wrote and said, <eol> "Please, can I help? <eob> Please, can I visit <eol> you at party headquarters?" <eob> We didn't have a headquarters -- <eol> we didn't have a party! <eob>
We didn't have anything. <eob>
All we had was a wonderful, tight group <eol> of fabulous friends <eob> trying to answer emails <eol> pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas. <eob>
We were all busy. <eob> Many of us had careers, many <eol> of us had children, <eob> but we did what women do, <eol> and we shared the work. <eob>
And almost instantly, we agreed <eol> on certain fundamental things. <eob>
First thing: we want to be <eol> the only political party in the world <eob> whose main aim was to no longer <eol> need to exist. <eob> That's a fantastic idea. <eob> We wanted to be the only political party <eol> with no particular political leaning. <eob>
We wanted people from the left, <eol> from the right, from the middle, <eob> every age group. <eob>
Because the whole point was to work <eol> with a simple agenda: <eob> let's get equality <eol> in every aspect of our lives, <eob> and when we're finished, <eob> let's go home and get <eol> the other chores done. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And we wanted to change <eol> how politics is conducted. <eob>
I don't know if you have this, <eob> but in Britain we have two <eol> major political parties. <eob>
They're the dinosaurs of politics. <eob>
And how they speak to each other <eol> is shameful and poisonous. <eob>
I'm sure you've never had <eol> that kind of name-calling -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And lying here. <eob> Wouldn't it be great <eol> if just one politician said, <eob> "Do you know, my opponent has a point. <eob>
Let's see if we can't work together <eol> and get the job done." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And let's get more women <eol> into politics, OK? <eob>
Let's immediately get more women into politics <eob> by being the only political party <eol> to offer free childcare to our candidates, <eob> so they can get out of the house <eol> and start campaigning. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Within 10 months, <eob> we had more than 70 branches <eol> of our party across the UK. <eob>
We stood candidates for election <eol> in London, Scotland and Wales <eob> in May 2016. <eob>
One in 20 people voted <eol> for our candidate for London Mayor. <eob>
And when the men in the race <eol> saw how many votes we were attracting, <eob> wonder of wonders, <eob> they began to talk about the need <eol> to tackle gender equality. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
You know, I've been promised change <eol> since I was a child. <eob>
It was always coming: <eob> women were going to stand shoulder <eol> to shoulder with men. <eob>
All I got were empty promises <eol> and disappointment -- <eob> enough disappointment to found <eol> a political party. <eob>
But here is my new idea for today — <eol> this is my five percent, OK? <eob>
And this one is really good. <eob>
The fact is, this is not enough. <eob>
It is not enough to found one political party <eol> for equality in a single country. <eob>
What we need is a seismic change <eol> in the global political landscape. <eob>
And the wonderful thing <eol> about the model we have created <eob> is that it would work anywhere. <eob> It would work in America, <eob> it would work in Australia, <eol> it would work in India. <eob>
It's like we've made <eol> the perfect recipe: anybody can cook it, <eob> and it's good for everybody. <eob>
And we want to give it away. <eob>
If you want to know what we did, <eol> we're giving it away. <eob>
Can you imagine if we could mobilize <eol> millions of women across the world <eob> to say, "That's enough!" <eol> to the traditional battles of politics? <eob>
To say, "Stop the bickering, <eol> let's get the work done." <eob> We could literally change the world. <eob>
And I want that. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want ... <eob>
I want that for our daughters, <eob> and I want it for our sons. <eob>
Because the fact is: equality <eol> is better for everyone. <eob>
Come on people, let's activate! <eol> Let's change the world! <eob> I know we can do it, <eol> and it wants doing! <eob>
I'd like to try something new. <eob>
Those of you who are able, <eob> please stand up. <eob>
OK, so I'm going to name some names. <eob>
When you hear a name <eol> that you don't recognize, <eob> you can't tell me anything about them, <eob> I'd like you to take a seat <eob> and stay seated. <eob>
The last person standing, <eol> we're going to see what they know. OK? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
All right. <eob> Eric Garner. <eob> Mike Brown. <eob> Tamir Rice. <eob> Freddie Gray. <eob>
So those of you who are still standing, <eob> I'd like you to turn <eol> around and take a look. <eob>
I'd say half to most <eol> of the people are still standing. <eob> So let's continue. <eob>
Michelle Cusseaux. <eob> Tanisha Anderson. <eob> Aura Rosser. <eob> Meagan Hockaday. <eob>
So if we look around again, <eob> there are about four people <eol> still standing, <eob> and actually I'm not going to put you on the spot. <eob>
I just say that to encourage transparency, <eol> so you can be seated. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So those of you who recognized <eol> the first group of names know <eob> that these were African-Americans <eol> who have been killed by the police <eob> over the last two and a half years. <eob>
What you may not know <eob> is that the other list <eol> is also African-Americans <eob> who have been killed within the last two years. <eob>
Only one thing distinguishes <eol> the names that you know <eob> from the names <eol> that you don't know: <eob> gender. <eob>
So let me first let you know that <eol> there's nothing at all distinct <eob> about this audience <eob> that explains the pattern <eol> of recognition that we've just seen. <eob>
I've done this exercise <eol> dozens of times around the country. <eob> I've done it to women's rights organizations. <eob>
I've done it with sociologists. <eob> I've done it even with progressive <eol> members of Congress. <eob>
And everywhere, the awareness <eol> of the level of police violence <eob> that black women experience <eob> is exceedingly low. <eob>
Now, it is surprising, isn't it, <eol> that this would be the case. <eob>
I mean, there are two issues <eol> involved here. <eob>
There's police violence <eol> against African-Americans, <eob> and there's violence against women, <eob> two issues that have been talked <eol> about a lot lately. <eob>
But when we think about <eol> who is implicated by these problems, <eob> when we think about who is victimized <eol> by these problems, <eob> the names of these black women <eol> never come to mind. <eob>
Now, communications experts tell us <eob> that when facts do not fit <eol> with the available frames, <eob> people have a difficult <eol> time incorporating new facts <eob> into their way of thinking <eol> about a problem. <eob>
These women's names have <eol> slipped through our consciousness <eob> because there are no frames <eol> for us to see them, <eob> no frames for us to remember them, <eob> no frames for us to hold them. <eob>
As a consequence, <eob> reporters don't lead with them, <eob> policymakers don't think about them, <eob> and politicians aren't encouraged <eol> or demanded that they speak to them. <eob>
Now, you might ask, <eob> why does a frame matter? <eob>
I mean, after all, <eob> an issue that affects black people <eol> and an issue that affects women, <eob> wouldn't that necessarily <eol> include black people who are women <eob> and women who are black people? <eob>
Well, the simple answer is that this is a trickle-down <eol> approach to social justice, <eob> and many times it <eol> just doesn't work. <eob>
Without frames that allow us to see <eob> how social problems impact <eol> all the members of a targeted group, <eob> many will fall through the cracks <eol> of our movements, <eob> left to suffer in virtual isolation. <eob>
But it doesn't have to be this way. <eob>
Many years ago, I began to use <eol> the term "intersectionality" <eob> to deal with the fact that many <eol> of our social justice problems <eob> like racism and sexism <eob> are often overlapping, <eob> creating multiple levels <eol> of social injustice. <eob>
Now, the experience <eol> that gave rise to intersectionality <eob> was my chance encounter <eol> with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid. <eob>
Emma DeGraffenreid <eol> was an African-American woman, <eob> a working wife and a mother. <eob>
I actually read about Emma's story <eol> from the pages of a legal opinion <eob> written by a judge who had dismissed Emma's claim <eob> of race and gender discrimination <eob> against a local car manufacturing plant. <eob>
Emma, like so many African-American women, <eob> sought better employment <eol> for her family and for others. <eob>
She wanted to create a better life <eol> for her children and for her family. <eob>
But she applied for a job, <eob> and she was not hired, <eob> and she believed that she was not hired <eol> because she was a black woman. <eob>
Now, the judge in question <eol> dismissed Emma's suit, <eob> and the argument for dismissing <eol> the suit was <eob> that the employer did hire <eol> African-Americans <eob> and the employer hired women. <eob>
The real problem, though, that the judge <eol> was not willing to acknowledge <eob> was what Emma was actually trying to say, <eob> that the African-Americans that were hired, <eob> usually for industrial jobs, maintenance jobs, were all men. <eob>
And the women that were hired, <eob> usually for secretarial <eol> or front-office work, <eob> were all white. <eob>
Only if the court was able <eol> to see how these policies came together <eob> would he be able to see <eol> the double discrimination <eob> that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing. <eob>
But the court refused <eol> to allow Emma to put two causes of action together <eob> to tell her story <eob> because he believed that, <eol> by allowing her to do that, <eob> she would be able to have <eol> preferential treatment. <eob>
She would have an advantage <eol> by having two swings at the bat, <eob> when African-American men <eol> and white women only had one swing at the bat. <eob>
But of course, neither African-American <eol> men or white women <eob> needed to combine a race <eol> and gender discrimination claim <eob> to tell the story of the discrimination <eol> they were experiencing. <eob>
Why wasn't the real unfairness <eob> law's refusal to protect <eol> African-American women <eob> simply because their experiences <eol> weren't exactly the same <eob> as white women and African-American men? <eob>
Rather than broadening the frame <eol> to include African-American women, <eob> the court simply tossed their case <eol> completely out of court. <eob>
Now, as a student of antidiscrimination law, <eob> as a feminist, <eob> as an antiracist, <eob> I was struck by this case. <eob>
It felt to me like injustice squared. <eob>
So first of all, <eob> black women weren't allowed <eol> to work at the plant. <eob>
Second of all, the court doubled <eol> down on this exclusion <eob> by making it legally inconsequential. <eob>
And to boot, there was no <eol> name for this problem. <eob>
And we all know that, <eol> where there's no name for a problem, <eob> you can't see a problem, <eob> and when you can't see a problem, <eol> you pretty much can't solve it. <eob>
Many years later, I had come to recognize <eob> that the problem that Emma <eol> was facing was a framing problem. <eob>
The frame that the court was using <eob> to see gender discrimination <eol> or to see race discrimination <eob> was partial, and it was distorting. <eob>
For me, the challenge that I faced was <eob> trying to figure out whether there <eol> was an alternative narrative, <eob> a prism that would allow us <eol> to see Emma's dilemma, <eob> a prism that would allow us <eol> to rescue her from the cracks in the law, <eob> that would allow judges to see her story. <eob>
So it occurred to me, <eob> maybe a simple analogy <eol> to an intersection <eob> might allow judges to better see <eol> Emma's dilemma. <eob>
So if we think about this intersection, <eol> the roads to the intersection would be <eob> the way that the workforce <eol> was structured by race and by <eob> gender. <eob>
And then the traffic in those roads <eol> would be the hiring policies <eob> and the other practices <eol> that ran through those roads. <eob>
Now, because Emma was both black and female, <eob> she was positioned precisely <eol> where those roads overlapped, <eob> experiencing the simultaneous impact <eob> of the company's gender and race traffic. <eob>
The law -- the law is like <eol> that ambulance that shows up <eob> and is ready to treat Emma <eol> only if it can be shown <eob> that she was harmed on the race road <eol> or on the gender road <eob> but not where those roads <eol> intersected. <eob>
So what do you call being impacted <eol> by multiple forces <eob> and then abandoned to fend for yourself? <eob>
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me. <eob>
I would go on to learn <eol> that African-American women, <eob> like other women of color, <eob> like other socially marginalized <eol> people all over the world, <eob> were facing all kinds <eol> of dilemmas and challenges <eob> as a consequence of intersectionality, <eob> intersections of race and gender, <eob> of heterosexism, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, <eob> all of these social dynamics come together <eob> and create challenges <eol> that are sometimes quite unique. <eob>
But in the same way <eob> that intersectionality <eob> raised our awareness <eol> to the way that black women live their lives, <eob> it also exposes the tragic circumstances <eob> under which African-American women die. <eob>
Police violence against black women <eob> is very real. <eob>
The level of violence <eol> that black women face <eob> is such that it's not surprising <eob> that some of them do not survive <eol> their encounters with police. <eob>
Black girls as young as seven, <eob> great grandmothers as old as 95 <eob> have been killed by the police. <eob>
They've been killed in their living rooms, <eob> in their bedrooms. <eob>
They've been killed in their cars. <eob>
They've been killed on the street. <eob>
They've been killed <eol> in front of their parents <eob> and they've been killed in front of their children. <eob>
They have been shot to death. <eob>
They have been stomped to death. <eob>
They have been suffocated to death. <eob>
They have been manhandled to death. <eob>
They have been tasered to death. <eob>
They've been killed <eol> when they've called for help. <eob>
They've been killed <eol> when they were alone, <eob> and they've been killed when they were with others. <eob>
They've been killed shopping while black, <eob> driving while black, <eob> having a mental disability while black, <eob> having a domestic disturbance while black. <eob>
They've even been killed <eol> being homeless while black. <eob>
They've been killed <eol> talking on the cell phone, <eob> laughing with friends, <eob> sitting in a car <eol> reported as stolen <eob> and making a U-turn <eol> in front of the White House <eob> with an infant strapped <eol> in the backseat of the car. <eob>
Why don't we know these stories? <eob>
Why is it that their lost lives <eob> don't generate the same amount <eol> of media attention and communal outcry <eob> as the lost lives of their fallen brothers? <eob>
It's time for a change. <eob>
So what can we do? <eob> In 2014, the African-American Policy <eol> Forum began to demand <eob> that we "say her name" <eob> at rallies, at protests, <eob> at conferences, at meetings, <eob> anywhere and everywhere <eob> that state violence against black bodies <eol> is being discussed. <eob>
But saying her name is not enough. <eob>
We have to be willing to do more. <eob>
We have to be willing <eol> to bear witness, <eob> to bear witness to the often painful realities <eob> that we would just rather not confront, <eob> the everyday violence and humiliation <eol> that many black women have had to face, <eob> black women across color, <eob> age, gender expression, <eob> sexuality and ability. <eob>
So we have the opportunity right now -- <eob> bearing in mind that some <eol> of the images that I'm about to share with you <eob> may be triggering for some -- <eob> to collectively bear witness <eol> to some of this violence. <eob>
We're going to hear the voice <eol> of the phenomenal Abby Dobson. <eob>
And as we sit with these women, <eob> some who have experienced <eol> violence and some who have not survived them, <eob> we have an opportunity <eob> to reverse what happened <eol> at the beginning of this talk, <eob> when we could not stand for these women <eob> because we did not know their names. <eob>
So at the end of this clip, <eol> there's going to be a roll call. <eob>
Several black women's names will come up. <eob>
I'd like those of you who are able <eol> to join us in saying these names <eob> as loud as you can, <eob> randomly, disorderly. <eob>
Let's create a cacophony of sound <eob> to represent our intention <eob> to hold these women up, <eob> to sit with them, <eob> to bear witness to them, <eob> to bring them into the light. <eob>
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say, <eob> say her name. <eob>
Say, <eob> say, <eob> say her name. <eob>
Say her name. <eob>
For all the names <eob> I'll never know, <eob>
say her name. <eob>
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones, <eol> Janisha Fonville, <eob> Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore, <eob> Michelle Cusseaux, <eob> Rekia Boyd, <eob> Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith. <eob>
AD: <eob> Say her name. <eob>
KC: So I said at the beginning, <eob> if we can't see a problem, <eob> we can't fix a problem. <eob>
Together, we've come together <eol> to bear witness <eob> to these women's lost lives. <eob>
But the time now is to move <eob> from mourning and grief <eob> to action and transformation. <eob>
This is something that we can do. <eob>
It's up to us. <eob>
Thank you for joining us. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Music) <eob>
Roughly 43,000 years ago, <eob> a young cave bear died in the rolling hills <eob> on the northwest border <eol> of modern day Slovenia. <eob>
A thousand years later, <eol> a mammoth died in southern Germany. <eob>
A few centuries after that, <eol> a griffon vulture also died <eob> in the same vicinity. <eob>
And we know almost nothing <eol> about how these animals met their deaths, <eob> but these different creatures dispersed <eol> across both time and space <eob> did share one remarkable fate. <eob>
After their deaths, a bone from each <eol> of their skeletons <eob> was crafted by human hands <eob> into a flute. <eob>
Think about that for a second. <eob> Imagine you're a caveman, <eol> 40,000 years ago. <eob>
You've mastered fire. <eob>
You've built simple tools for hunting. <eob>
You've learned how to craft garments <eol> from animal skins <eob> to keep yourself warm in the winter. <eob>
What would you choose to invent next? <eob>
It seems preposterous <eol> that you would invent the flute, <eob> a tool that created useless vibrations <eol> in air molecules. <eob>
But that is exactly <eol> what our ancestors did. <eob>
Now this turns out <eol> to be surprisingly common <eob> in the history of innovation. <eob>
Sometimes people invent things <eob> because they want to stay alive <eol> or feed their children <eob> or conquer the village next door. <eob>
But just as often, <eob> new ideas come into the world <eob> simply because they're fun. <eob>
And here's the really strange thing: <eob> many of those playful <eol> but seemingly frivolous inventions <eob> ended up sparking momentous transformations <eob> in science, in politics and society. <eob>
Take what may be the most important <eol> invention of modern times: <eob> programmable computers. <eob>
Now, the standard story <eol> is that computers descend from military technology, <eob> since many of the early computers <eol> were designed specifically <eob> to crack wartime codes <eol> or calculate rocket trajectories. <eob>
But in fact, the origins <eol> of the modern computer <eob> are much more playful, <eob> even musical, <eob> than you might imagine. <eob>
The idea behind the flute, <eob> of just pushing air through tubes <eol> to make a sound, <eob> was eventually modified to create <eol> the first organ <eob> more than 2,000 years ago. <eob>
Someone came up with the brilliant <eol> idea of triggering sounds <eob> by pressing small levers <eol> with our fingers, <eob> inventing the first musical keyboard. <eob>
Now, keyboards evolved from organs <eol> to clavichords to harpsichords <eob> to the piano, <eob> until the middle of the 19th century, <eob> when a bunch of inventors <eol> finally hit on the idea <eob> of using a keyboard to trigger <eol> not sounds but letters. <eob>
In fact, the very first typewriter <eob> was originally called <eol> "the writing harpsichord." <eob>
Flutes and music led to even more powerful <eol> breakthroughs. <eob>
About a thousand years ago, <eob> at the height <eol> of the Islamic Renaissance, <eob> three brothers in Baghdad <eol> designed a device <eob> that was an automated organ. <eob>
They called it "the instrument <eol> that plays itself." <eob> Now, the instrument was basically <eol> a giant music box. <eob>
The organ could be trained <eol> to play various songs by using instructions <eob> encoded by placing pins <eol> on a rotating cylinder. <eob>
And if you wanted the machine <eol> to play a different song, <eob> you just swapped a new cylinder in <eol> with a different code on it. <eob>
This instrument was the first of its kind. <eob> It was programmable. <eob>
Now, conceptually, this was <eol> a massive leap forward. <eob>
The whole idea of hardware <eol> and software <eob> becomes thinkable for the first time <eol> with this invention. <eob>
And that incredibly powerful concept <eob> didn't come to us as an instrument <eol> of war or of conquest, <eob> or necessity at all. <eob>
It came from the strange delight <eol> of watching a machine play music. <eob>
In fact, the idea of programmable machines <eob> was exclusively kept alive by music <eol> for about 700 years. <eob>
In the 1700s, <eol> music-making machines <eob> became the playthings of the Parisian elite. <eob>
Showmen used the same coded cylinders <eob> to control the physical movements <eol> of what were called automata, <eob> an early kind of robot. <eob>
One of the most famous of those robots <eob> was, you guessed it, <eol> an automated flute player <eob> designed by a brilliant French inventor <eob> named Jacques de Vaucanson. <eob>
And as de Vaucanson was designing <eol> his robot musician, <eob> he had another idea. <eob>
If you could program a machine <eol> to make pleasing sounds, <eob> why not program it to weave delightful <eol> patterns of color out of cloth? <eob>
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder <eol> to represent musical notes, <eob> they would represent threads <eol> with different colors. <eob>
If you wanted a new pattern <eol> for your fabric, <eob> you just programmed a new cylinder. <eob>
This was the first programmable loom. <eob>
Now, the cylinders were too expensive <eol> and time-consuming to make, <eob> but a half century later, <eob> another French inventor <eol> named Jacquard <eob> hit upon the brilliant idea <eol> of using paper-punched cards <eob> instead of metal cylinders. <eob>
Paper turned out to be much cheaper <eol> and more flexible <eob> as a way of programming the device. <eob>
That punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage <eob> to create his analytical engine, <eob> the first true programmable computer <eob> ever designed. <eob>
And punch cards were used <eol> by computer programmers <eob> as late as the 1970s. <eob>
So ask yourself this question: <eob> what really made <eol> the modern computer possible? <eob>
Yes, the military involvement <eol> is an important part of the story, <eob> but inventing a computer <eol> also required other building blocks: <eob> music boxes, <eob> toy robot flute players, <eob> harpsichord keyboards, <eob> colorful patterns woven <eol> into fabric, <eob> and that's just a small part of the story. <eob>
There's a long list of world-changing <eol> ideas and technologies <eob> that came out of play: <eob> public museums, rubber, <eob> probability theory, the insurance business <eob> and many more. <eob>
Necessity isn't always <eol> the mother of invention. <eob>
The playful state of mind <eol> is fundamentally exploratory, <eob> seeking out new possibilities <eol> in the world around us. <eob>
And that seeking is why <eol> so many experiences <eob> that started with simple delight <eol> and amusement <eob> eventually led us to profound <eol> breakthroughs. <eob>
Now, I think this has implications <eol> for how we teach kids in school <eob> and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces, <eob> but thinking about play and delight this way <eob> also helps us detect what's coming next. <eob>
Think about it: <eol> if you were sitting there in 1750 <eob> trying to figure out the big <eol> changes coming to society <eob> in the 19th, the 20th centuries, <eob> automated machines, computers, <eob> artificial intelligence, <eob> a programmable flute <eob> entertaining the Parisian elite <eob> would have been as powerful a clue <eol> as anything else at the time. <eob>
It seemed like an amusement at best, <eob> not useful in any serious way, <eob> but it turned out to be <eol> the beginning of a tech revolution <eob> that would change the world. <eob>
You'll find the future <eob> wherever people are having the most fun. <eob>
Speaking up is hard to do. <eob>
I understood the true meaning <eol> of this phrase exactly one month ago, <eob> when my wife and I became new parents. <eob>
It was an amazing moment. <eob>
It was exhilarating and elating, <eob> but it was also scary and terrifying. <eob>
And it got particularly terrifying when we got <eol> home from the hospital, <eob> and we were unsure <eob> whether our little baby boy was getting <eol> enough nutrients from breastfeeding. <eob>
And we wanted to call our pediatrician, <eob> but we also didn't want to make <eol> a bad first impression <eob> or come across as a crazy, neurotic parent. <eob> So we worried. <eob> And we waited. <eob> When we got to the doctor's office <eol> the next day, <eob> she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated. <eob>
Our son is fine now, <eob> and our doctor has reassured us <eol> we can always contact her. <eob>
But in that moment, <eob> I should've spoken up, but I didn't. <eob>
But sometimes we speak up <eol> when we shouldn't, <eob> and I learned that over 10 years ago <eol> when I let my twin brother down. <eob>
My twin brother is a document <eol>ary filmmaker, <eob> and for one of his first films, <eob> he got an offer from a distribution company. <eob>
He was excited, <eob> and he was inclined to accept the offer. <eob>
But as a negotiations researcher, <eob> I insisted he make a counteroffer, <eob> and I helped him craft the perfect one. <eob>
And it was perfect -- <eob> it was perfectly insulting. <eob>
The company was so offended, <eob> they literally withdrew the offer <eob> and my brother was left with nothing. <eob>
And I've asked people all over the world <eol> about this dilemma of speaking up: <eob> when they can assert themselves, <eob> when they can push their interests, <eob> when they can express an opinion, <eob> when they can make an ambitious ask. <eob>
And the range of stories <eol> are varied and diverse, <eob> but they also make up a universal tapestry. <eob>
Can I correct my boss <eol> when they make a mistake? <eob>
Can I confront my coworker <eol> who keeps stepping on my toes? <eob>
Can I challenge my friend's insensitive joke? <eob>
Can I tell the person I love <eol> the most my deepest insecurities? <eob>
And through these experiences, <eol> I've come to recognize <eob> that each of us have something <eol> called a range of acceptable behavior. <eob>
Now, sometimes we're too strong; <eol> we push ourselves too much. <eob> That's what happened with my brother. <eob>
Even making an offer was outside <eol> his range of acceptable behavior. <eob>
But sometimes we're too weak. <eob>
That's what happened <eol> with my wife and I. <eob> And this range of acceptable behaviors -- <eob> when we stay within our range, <eol> we're rewarded. <eob>
When we step outside that range, we get punished <eol> in a variety of ways. <eob>
We get dismissed or demeaned <eol> or even ostracized. <eob>
Or we lose that raise <eol> or that promotion or that deal. <eob>
Now, the first thing we need to know is: <eob> What is my range? <eob>
But the key thing is, <eol> our range isn't fixed; <eob> it's actually pretty dynamic. <eob>
It expands and it narrows <eol> based on the context. <eob>
And there's one thing that determines <eol> that range more than anything else, <eob> and that's your power. <eob>
Your power determines your range. <eob> What is power? <eob> Power comes in lots of forms. <eob>
In negotiations, it comes in the form <eol> of alternatives. <eob>
So my brother had no alternatives; <eob> he lacked power. <eob>
The company had lots of alternatives; <eob> they had power. <eob>
Sometimes it's being new to a country, <eol> like an immigrant, <eob> or new to an organization <eob> or new to an experience, <eob> like my wife and I as new parents. <eob>
Sometimes it's at work, <eob> where someone's the boss and someone's <eol> the subordinate. <eob>
Sometimes it's in relationships, <eob> where one person's more invested <eol> than the other person. <eob>
And the key thing <eol> is that when we have lots of power, <eob> our range is very wide. <eob>
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. <eob>
But when we lack power, our range narrows. <eob>
We have very little leeway. <eob>
The problem is that when our range narrows, <eob> that produces something called <eol> the low-power double bind. <eob>
The low-power double bind happens <eob> when, if we don't speak up, <eol> we go unnoticed, <eob> but if we do speak up, <eol> we get punished. <eob>
Now, many of you have heard <eol> the phrase the "double bind" <eob> and connected it with one thing, <eol> and that's gender. <eob>
The gender double bind is women <eol> who don't speak up go unnoticed, <eob> and women who do speak <eol> up get punished. <eob>
And the key thing is that women <eol> have the same need as men to speak up, <eob> but they have barriers to doing so. <eob>
But what my research has shown <eol> over the last two decades <eob> is that what looks like a gender difference <eob> is not really a gender double bind, <eob> it's a really a low-power <eol> double bind. <eob>
And what looks like a gender difference <eob> are really often just power <eol> differences in disguise. <eob>
Oftentimes we see a difference <eol> between a man and a woman <eob> or men and women, <eob> and think, "Biological cause. <eob>
There's something fundamentally <eol> different <eob> about the sexes. <eob> "But in study after study, <eob> I've found that a better explanation <eol> for many sex differences <eob> is really power. <eob>
And so it's the low-power double bind. <eob>
And the low-power double bind means <eol> that we have a narrow range, <eob> and we lack power. <eob>
We have a narrow range, <eob> and our double bind is very large. <eob>
So we need to find ways <eol> to expand our range. <eob>
And over the last couple decades, <eob> my colleagues and I have found <eol> two things really matter. <eob>
The first: you seem powerful <eol> in your own eyes. <eob>
The second: you seem powerful <eol> in the eyes of others. <eob>
When I feel powerful, <eob> I feel confident, not fearful; <eob> I expand my own range. <eob>
When other people see me as powerful, <eob> they grant me a wider range. <eob>
So we need tools to expand our range <eol> of acceptable behavior. <eob>
And I'm going to give you <eol> a set of tools today. <eob>
Speaking up is risky, <eob> but these tools will lower your risk <eol> of speaking up. <eob>
The first tool I'm going to give you <eol> got discovered in negotiations <eob> in an important finding. <eob>
On average, women <eol> make less ambitious offers <eob> and get worse outcomes <eol> than men at the bargaining table. <eob>
But Hannah Riley Bowles <eol> and Emily Amanatullah have discovered <eob> there's one situation where women <eol> get the same outcomes as men <eob> and are just as ambitious. <eob>
That's when they advocate for others. <eob>
When they advocate for others, <eob> they discover their own range and expand <eol> it in their own mind. <eob>
They become more assertive. <eob>
This is sometimes called <eol> "the mama bear effect." <eob> Like a mama bear defending her cubs, <eob> when we advocate for others, <eol> we can discover our own voice. <eob>
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves. <eob> How do we do that? <eob> One of the most important tools <eol> we have to advocate for ourselves <eob> is something called perspective-taking. <eob>
And perspective-taking is really simple: <eob> it's simply looking at the world <eol> through the eyes of another person. <eob>
It's one of the most important tools <eol> we have to expand our range. <eob>
When I take your perspective, <eob> and I think about what you really want, <eob> you're more likely to give me <eol> what I really want. <eob>
But here's the problem: <eob> perspective-taking is hard to do. <eob>
So let's do a little experiment. <eob>
I want you all to hold your hand <eol> just like this: <eob> your finger -- put it up. <eob>
And I want you to draw <eol> a capital letter E on your forehead <eob> as quickly as possible. <eob>
OK, it turns out that we can draw <eol> this E in one of two ways, <eob> and this was originally designed <eol> as a test of perspective-taking. <eob>
I'm going to show you two pictures <eob> of someone with an E on their forehead -- <eob> my former student, Erika Hall. <eob>
And you can see over here, <eob> that's the correct E. <eob> I drew the E so it looks like an E <eol> to another person. <eob>
That's the perspective-taking E <eob> because it looks like an E <eol> from someone else's vantage point. <eob>
But this E over here <eol> is the self-focused E. <eob> We often get self-focused. <eob>
And we particularly get <eol> self-focused in a crisis. <eob>
I want to tell you <eol> about a particular crisis. <eob>
A man walks into a bank <eol> in Watsonville, California. <eob>
And he says, "Give me $2,000, <eob> or I'm blowing the whole bank up <eol> with a bomb." <eob> Now, the bank manager <eol> didn't give him the money. <eob>
She took a step back. <eob>
She took his perspective, <eob> and she noticed something really important. <eob>
He asked for a specific amount of money. <eob>
So she said, <eob> "Why did you ask for $2,000?" <eob>
And he said, "My friend is going <eol> to be evicted <eob> unless I get him $2,000 immediately." <eob>
And she said, "Oh! You don't want <eol> to rob the bank -- <eob> you want to take out a loan." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"Why don't you come back to my office, <eob> and we can have you fill out the paperwork." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, her quick perspective-taking <eol> defused a volatile situation. <eob>
So when we take someone's perspective, <eob> it allows us to be ambitious <eol> and assertive, but still be likable. <eob>
Here's another way to be assertive <eol> but still be likable, <eob> and that is to signal flexibility. <eob>
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, <eol> and you want to sell someone a car. <eob>
You're going to more likely make the sale <eol> if you give them two options. <eob>
Let's say option A: <eob> $24,000 for this car <eol> and a five-year warranty. <eob>
Or option B: <eob> $23,000 and a three-year warranty. <eob>
My research shows that when you give people <eol> a choice among options, <eob> it lowers their defenses, <eob> and they're more likely to accept <eol> your offer. <eob>
And this doesn't just work with salespeople; <eob> it works with parents. <eob>
When my niece was four, <eob> she resisted getting dressed <eol> and rejected everything. <eob>
But then my sister-in-law <eol> had a brilliant idea. <eob> What if I gave my daughter a choice? <eob> This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt. <eob>
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant. <eob>
How do we do that? <eob> She got dressed quickly and without resistance. <eob> When I've asked the question around the world <eob> when people feel comfortable speaking up, <eob> the number one answer is: <eob> "When I have social support in my audience; <eol> when I have allies." <eob> So we want to get allies on our side. <eob> Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear. <eob>
When we advocate for others, <eob> we expand our range in our own eyes <eol> and the eyes of others, <eob> but we also earn strong allies. <eob>
Another way we can earn strong allies, <eol> especially in high places, <eob> is by asking other people for advice. <eob>
When we ask others for advice, <eol> they like us because we flatter them, <eob> and we're expressing humility. <eob>
And this really works <eol> to solve another double bind. <eob>
And that's the self-promotion double bind. <eob>
The self-promotion double bind <eob> is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, <eob> no one notices. <eob> And if we do, we're not likable. <eob>
But if we ask for advice <eol> about one of our accomplishments, <eob> we are able to be competent <eol> in their eyes but also be likeable. <eob>
And this is so powerful <eob> it even works when you see it coming. <eob>
There have been multiple times in life <eol> when I have been forewarned <eob> that a low-power person <eol> has been given the advice to come ask me for advice. <eob>
I want you to notice <eol> three things about this: <eob> First, I knew they were going <eol> to come ask me for advice. <eob>
Two, I've actually done research <eol> on the strategic benefits <eob> of asking for advice. <eob>
And three, it still worked! <eob>
I took their perspective, <eob> I became more invested in their cause, <eob> I became more committed to them <eol> because they asked for advice. <eob>
Now, another time we feel <eol> more confident speaking up <eob> is when we have expertise. <eob>
Expertise gives us credibility. <eob>
When we have high power, <eol> we already have credibility. <eob>
We only need good evidence. <eob>
When we lack power, <eol> we don't have the credibility. <eob>
We need excellent evidence. <eob>
And one of the ways we can <eol> come across as an expert <eob> is by tapping into our passion. <eob>
I want everyone in the next few days <eol> to go up to friend of theirs <eob> and just say to them, <eob> "I want you to describe a passion <eol> of yours to me." <eob> I've had people do this <eol> all over the world <eob> and I asked them, <eob> "What did you notice about the other person <eob> when they described their passion?" <eob> And the answers are always the same. <eob> "Their eyes lit up and got big." <eob> "They smiled a big beaming smile." <eob> "They used their hands all over -- <eob> I had to duck because their hands were coming <eol> at me." <eob> "They talk quickly with a little higher pitch." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"They leaned in as if telling me a secret." <eob>
And then I said to them, <eob> "What happened to you as you <eol> listened to their passion?" <eob>
They said, "My eyes lit up. <eob> I smiled. <eob> I leaned in." <eob>
When we tap into our passion, <eob> we give ourselves the courage, <eol> in our own eyes, to speak up, <eob> but we also get the permission <eol> from others to speak up. <eob>
Tapping into our passion even works <eol> when we come across as too weak. <eob>
Both men and women get punished <eol> at work when they shed tears. <eob>
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we <eol> frame our strong emotions as passion, <eob> the condemnation of our crying disappears <eol> for both men and women. <eob>
I want to end with a few words <eol> from my late father <eob> that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding. <eob>
Here's a picture of us. <eob>
My dad was a psychologist like me, <eob> but his real love and his real <eol> passion was cinema, <eob> like my brother. <eob>
And so he wrote a speech <eol> for my brother's wedding <eob> about the roles <eol> we play in the human comedy. <eob>
And he said, "The lighter your touch, <eob> the better you become at improving <eol> and enriching your performance. <eob>
Those who embrace their roles <eol> and work to improve their performance <eob> grow, change and expand the self. <eob>
Play it well, <eob> and your days will be mostly joyful." <eob>
What my dad was saying <eob> is that we've all been assigned ranges <eol> and roles in this world. <eob>
But he was also saying <eol> the essence of this talk: <eob> those roles and ranges <eol> are constantly expanding and evolving. <eob>
So when a scene calls for it, <eob> be a ferocious mama bear <eob> and a humble advice seeker. <eob>
Have excellent evidence and strong allies. <eob>
Be a passionate perspective taker. <eob>
and your days will be mostly joyful." <eob> And if you use those tools -- <eob> and each and every one of you <eol> can use these tools -- <eob> you will expand your range <eol> of acceptable behavior, <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here's a question that matters. <eob>
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?] <eob>
Because we're beginning to get <eol> all the tools together to evolve ourselves. <eob>
And we can evolve bacteria <eol> and we can evolve plants <eob> and we can evolve animals, <eob> and we're now reaching a point <eol> where we really have to ask, <eob> is it really ethical and do <eol> we want to evolve human beings? <eob>
And as you're thinking about that, <eob> let me talk about <eol> that in the context of prosthetics, <eob> prosthetics past, present, future. <eob>
So this is the iron hand <eob> that belonged to one of the German counts. <eob>
Loved to fight, lost his arm <eol> in one of these battles. <eob>
No problem, he just made a suit of armor, <eob> put it on, <eob> perfect prosthetic. <eob>
That's where the concept <eol> of ruling with an iron fist comes from. <eob>
And of course these prosthetics <eol> have been getting more and more useful, <eob> more and more modern. <eob>
You can hold soft-boiled eggs. <eob>
You can have all types of controls, <eol> and as you're thinking about that, <eob> there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr <eob> who have been building <eol> absolutely extraordinary prosthetics. <eob>
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins <eol> will go out and say, <eob> how tall do I want to be tonight? <eob> Or Hugh will say what type <eol> of cliff do I want to climb? <eob> Or does somebody want to run a marathon, <eol> or does somebody want to ballroom dance? <eob> And as you adapt these things, <eob> the interesting thing about prosthetics <eol> is they've been coming inside the body. <eob>
So these external prosthetics <eol> have now become artificial knees. <eob> They've become artificial hips. <eob>
And then they've evolved further <eob> to become not just nice to have <eob> but essential to have. <eob>
So when you're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic, <eob> you're talking about something <eol> that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg," <eob> it's, "if I don't have this, I can die." <eob> And at that point, a prosthetic becomes <eol> a symbiotic relationship <eob> with the human body. <eob>
And four of the smartest people <eol> that I've ever met -- <eob> Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr, Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander -- <eob> are working on a Center <eol> for Extreme Bionics. <eob>
And the interesting thing <eol> of what you're seeing here is <eob> these prosthetics now get integrated <eol> into the bone. <eob> They get integrated into the skin. <eob> They get integrated into the muscle. <eob>
And one of the other sides of Ed <eob> is he's been thinking about <eol> how to connect the brain <eob> using light or other mechanisms <eob> directly to things like these prosthetics. <eob>
And if you can do that, <eob> then you can begin changing <eol> fundamental aspects of humanity. <eob>
So how quickly you react to something <eol> depends on the diameter of a nerve. <eob>
And of course, if you have nerves <eol> that are external or prosthetic, <eob> say with light or liquid metal, <eob> then you can increase that diameter <eob> and you could even increase it theoretically <eol> to the point where, <eob> as long as you could see <eob> the muzzle flash, you could step <eol> out of the way of a bullet. <eob>
Those are the order of magnitude <eol> of changes you're talking about. <eob>
This is a fourth sort <eol> of level of prosthetics. <eob>
These are Phonak hearing aids, <eob> and the reason why these are so interesting <eob> is because they cross the threshold <eol> from where prosthetics are something <eob> for somebody who is "disabled" <eob> and they become something <eol> that somebody who is "normal" <eob> might want to actually have, <eob> because what this prosthetic does, <eol> which is really interesting, <eob> is not only does it help you hear, <eob> you can focus your hearing, <eob> so it can hear the conversation going on over there. <eob> You can have superhearing. <eob>
You can have white noise. <eob> You can record, and oh, by the way, <eol> they also put a phone into this. <eob>
So this functions as your hearing aid <eol> and also as your phone. <eob>
And at that point, somebody might actually <eol> want to have a prosthetic voluntarily. <eob>
All of these thousands of loosely <eol> connected little pieces <eob> are coming together, <eob> and it's about time we ask the question, <eob> how do we want to evolve human beings <eol> over the next century or two? <eob>
And for that we turn to a great philosopher <eob> who was a very smart man <eol> despite being a Yankee fan. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course, <eol> that it's very tough to make predictions, <eob> especially about the future. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So instead of making a prediction <eol> about the future to begin with, <eob> let's take what's happening <eol> in the present with people like Tony Atala, <eob> who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs. <eob>
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic <eol> isn't having something external, titanium. <eob> Maybe the ultimate prosthetic <eol> is take your own gene code, <eob> remake your own body parts, <eob> because that's a whole lot more effective <eol> than any kind of a prosthetic. <eob>
But while you're at it, then you can take <eol> the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith. <eob>
And one of the things <eol> that we've been doing <eob> is trying to figure out <eol> how to reprogram cells. <eob>
And if you can reprogram a cell, <eob> then you can change the cells <eol> in those organs. <eob> So if you can change the cells in those organs, <eob> maybe you make those organs more radiation-resistant. <eob>
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen. <eob> Maybe you make them more efficient <eob> to filter out stuff that <eol> you don't want in your body. <eob>
And over the last few weeks, George Church <eol> has been in the news a lot <eob> because he's been talking <eol> about taking one of these programmable cells <eob> and inserting an entire human genome <eob> into that cell. <eob>
And once you can insert <eol> an entire human genome into a cell, <eob> then you begin to ask the question, <eob> would you want to enhance any of that genome? <eob>
Do you want to enhance a human body? <eob>
How would you want to enhance <eol> a human body? <eob>
Where is it ethical to enhance <eol> a human body <eob> and where is it not ethical <eol> to enhance a human body? <eob>
And all of a sudden, what we're doing <eob> is we've got this multidimensional chess board <eob> where we can change human genetics <eol> by using viruses <eob> to attack things like AIDS, <eob> or we can change the gene <eol> code through gene therapy <eob> to do away with some hereditary diseases, <eob> or we can change the environment, <eob> and change the expression of those genes <eol> in the epigenome <eob> and pass that on to the next generations. <eob>
And all of a sudden, it's not <eol> just one little bit, <eob> it's all these stacked little bits <eob> that allow you to take little portions of it <eob> until all the portions coming together <eob> lead you to something <eol> that's very different. <eob>
And a lot of people <eol> are very scared by this stuff. <eob>
And it does sound scary, <eol> and there are risks to this stuff. <eob>
So why in the world <eol> would you ever want to do this stuff? <eob>
Why would we really want <eol> to alter the human body <eob> in a fundamental way? <eob>
The answer lies in part <eob> with Lord Rees, <eob> astronomer royal of Great Britain. <eob>
And one of his favorite sayings is the universe <eol> is 100 percent malevolent. <eob>
So what does that mean? <eob>
It means if you take any one <eol> of your bodies at random, <eob> drop it anywhere in the universe, <eob> drop it in space, you die. <eob> Drop it on the Sun, you die. <eob> Drop it on the surface <eol> of Mercury, you die. <eob> Drop it near a supernova, you die. <eob>
But fortunately, it's only about 80 percent effective. <eob>
So as a great physicist once said, <eob> there's these little upstream <eol> eddies of biology <eob> that create order in this <eol> rapid torrent of entropy. <eob>
So as the universe dissipates energy, <eob> there's these upstream eddies <eol> that create biological order. <eob>
Now, the problem with eddies is, <eob> they tend to disappear. <eob> They shift. They move in rivers. <eob>
And because of that, <eol> when an eddy shifts, <eob> when the Earth becomes a snowball, <eol> when the Earth becomes very hot, <eob> when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, <eol> when you have supervolcanoes, <eob> when you have solar flares, <eob> when you have potentially extinction-level events <eob> like the next election -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
then all of a sudden, <eol> you can have periodic extinctions. <eob>
And by the way, that's happened <eol> five times on Earth, <eob> and therefore it is very likely <eob> that the human species on Earth <eol> is going to go extinct someday. <eob>
Not next week, <eob> not next month, <eob> maybe in November, <eol> but maybe 10,000 years after that. <eob>
As you're thinking <eol> of the consequence of that, <eob> if you believe that extinctions <eol> are common and natural <eob> and normal and occur periodically, <eob> it becomes a moral imperative <eol> to diversify our species. <eob>
And it becomes a moral imperative <eob> because it's going to be <eol> really hard to live on Mars <eob> if we don't fundamentally modify the human body. <eob> Right? <eob> You go from one cell, <eob> mom and dad coming together <eol> to make one cell, <eob> in a cascade to 10 trillion cells. <eob>
We don't know, if you change <eol> the gravity substantially, <eob> if the same thing will happen <eol> to create your body. <eob>
We do know that if you expose <eol> our bodies as they currently are <eob> to a lot of radiation, we will die. <eob>
So as you're thinking of that, <eol> you have to really redesign things <eob> just to get to Mars. <eob>
Forget about the moons <eol> of Neptune or Jupiter. <eob>
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev, <eob> let's think about life <eol> in a series of scales. <eob>
So Life One civilization <eob> is a civilization <eol> that begins to alter his or her looks. <eob>
And we've been doing that <eol> for thousands of years. <eob>
You've got tummy tucks <eol> and you've got this and you've got that. <eob>
You alter your looks, and I'm told <eob> that not all of those alterations <eol> take place for medical reasons. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Seems odd. <eob>
A Life Two civilization <eol> is a different civilization. <eob>
A Life Two civilization <eol> alters fundamental aspects of the body. <eob>
So you put human growth hormone in, <eol> the person grows taller, <eob> or you put x in and the person gets fatter <eol> or loses metabolism <eob> or does a whole series of things, <eob> but you're altering the functions <eob> in a fundamental way. <eob>
To become an intrasolar civilization, <eob> we're going to have <eol> to create a Life Three civilization, <eob> and that looks very different <eol> from what we've got here. <eob>
Maybe you splice in Deinococcus radiodurans <eob> so that the cells can resplice <eol> after a lot of exposure to radiation. <eob>
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen <eol> flow through your blood <eob> instead of through your lungs. <eob>
But you're talking <eol> about really radical redesigns, <eob> and one of the interesting things <eol> that's happened in the last decade <eob> is we've discovered <eol> a whole lot of planets out there. <eob>
And some of them may be Earth-like. <eob>
The problem is, if we ever want <eol> to get to these planets, <eob> the fastest human objects -- <eob> Juno and Voyager and the rest <eol> of this stuff -- <eob> take tens of thousands of years <eob> to get from here <eol> to the nearest solar system. <eob>
So if you want to start exploring <eol> beaches somewhere else, <eob> or you want to see <eol> two-sun sunsets, <eob> then you're talking about something <eol> that is very different, <eob> because you have to change <eol> the timescale and the body of humans <eob> in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable. <eob>
And that's a Life Four civilization. <eob>
Now, we can't even begin to imagine <eol> what that might look like, <eob> but we're beginning to get glimpses <eob> of instruments that might take us <eol> even that far. <eob>
And let me give you two examples. <eob>
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg, <eob> and one of the things <eol> that Floyd's been doing <eob> is he's been playing <eol> with the basic chemistry of life. <eob>
So all life on this planet <eol> is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA. <eob>
All bacteria, all plants, all animals, <eol> all humans, all cows, <eob> everything else. <eob>
And what Floyd did is he changed out two <eol> of those base pairs, <eob> so it's ATXY. <eob>
And that means that you now have <eol> a parallel system to make life, <eob> to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve, <eob> that doesn't mate with most things on Earth <eob> or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth. <eob>
Maybe you make plants <eol> that are immune to all bacteria. <eob> Maybe you make plants <eol> that are immune to all viruses. <eob>
But why is that so interesting? <eob>
It means that we are not <eol> a unique solution. <eob>
It means you can create <eol> alternate chemistries to us <eob> that could be chemistries adaptable <eol> to a very different planet <eob> that could create life and heredity. <eob>
The second experiment, <eob> or the other implication <eol> of this experiment, <eob> is that all of you, all life <eol> is based on 20 amino acids. <eob>
If you don't substitute two amino acids, <eob> if you don't say ATXY, if you say ATCG + XY, <eob> then you go from 20 building <eob> blocks <eol> to 172, <eob> and all of a sudden you've got 172 building <eol> blocks of amino acids <eob> to build life-forms in very different shapes. <eob>
The second experiment <eob> to think about <eol> is a really weird experiment <eob> that's been taking place in China. <eob>
Right? <eob> So this guy has been transplanting <eol> hundreds of mouse heads. <eob> And why is that an interesting <eol> experiment? <eob>
Well, think of the first heart <eol> transplants. <eob>
One of the things they used to do <eob> is they used to bring in the wife <eol> or the daughter of the donor <eob> so the donee could tell the doctors, <eob> "Do you recognize this person? <eol> Do you love this person? <eob> Do you feel anything for this person?" <eob> We laugh about that today. <eob>
We laugh because we know <eol> the heart is a muscle, <eob> but for hundreds of thousands <eol> of years, or tens of thousands of years, <eob> "I gave her my heart. <eol> She took my heart. <eob>
She broke my heart. <eob> "We thought this was emotion <eob> and we thought maybe emotions <eol> were transplanted with the heart. Nope. <eob>
So how about the brain? <eob>
Two possible outcomes to this experiment. <eob>
If you can get a mouse <eob> that is functional, <eob> then you can see, <eob> is the new brain a blank slate? <eob>
And boy, does that have implications. <eob>
Second option: <eob> the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse. <eob>
The new mouse remembers <eol> what it's afraid of, <eob> remembers how to navigate the maze, <eob> and if that is true, <eob> then you can transplant memory and consciousness. <eob>
And then the really interesting question is, <eob> if you can transplant this, <eol> is the only input-output mechanism <eob> this down here? <eob>
Or could you transplant <eol> that consciousness into something <eob> that would be very different, <eob> that would last in space, <eob> that would last tens of thousands of years, <eob> that would be a completely <eol> redesigned body <eob> that could hold consciousness <eol> for a long, long period of time? <eob>
And let's come back to the first question: <eob> Why would you ever want to do that? <eob>
Well, I'll tell you why. <eob>
Because this is the ultimate selfie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is taken from six billion miles away, <eob> and that's Earth. <eob>
And that's all of us. <eob>
And if that little thing goes, <eol> all of humanity goes. <eob>
And the reason you want <eol> to alter the human body <eob> is because you eventually want <eol> a picture that says, <eob> that's us, and that's us, <eob> and that's us, <eob> because that's the way <eol> humanity survives long-term extinction. <eob>
And that's the reason why it turns out <eob> it's actually unethical not <eol> to evolve the human body <eob> even though it can be scary, <eol> even though it can be challenging, <eob> but it's what's going to allow us <eol> to explore, live <eob> and get to places we can't even dream of today, <eob> but which our great-great-great-great- grandchildren might someday. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It's easy to forget that last night, <eob> one billion people went to sleep <eol> without access to electricity. <eob> One billion people. <eob> Two and a half billion people <eol> did not have access to clean cooking fuels <eob> or clean heating fuels. <eob>
Those are the problems <eol> in the developing world. <eob>
And it's easy for us not to be empathetic <eob> with those people who seem so distanced from us. <eob>
But even in our own world, <eol> the developed world, <eob> we see the tension <eol> of stagnant economies <eob> impacting the lives of people around us. <eob>
We see it in whole pieces of the economy, <eob> where the people involved <eol> have lost hope about the future <eob> and despair about the present. <eob>
We see that in the Brexit vote. <eob>
We see that in the Sanders / Trump campaigns in my own country. <eob>
But even in countries as recently turning the corner <eob> towards being in the developed world, <eob> in China, <eob> we see the difficulty that President Xi has <eob> as he begins to un-employ so many people <eol> in his coal and mining industries <eob> who see no future for themselves. <eob>
As we as a society figure out <eol> how to manage <eob> the problems of the developed world <eob> and the problems of the developing world, <eob> we have to look at how we move forward <eob> and manage the environmental <eol> impact of those decisions. <eob>
We've been working on this problem <eol> for 25 years, since Rio, <eob> the Kyoto Protocols. <eob>
Our most recent move is the Paris treaty, <eob> and the resulting climate agreements <eob> that are being ratified <eol> by nations around the world. <eob>
I think we can be very hopeful <eob> that those agreements, <eol> which are bottom-up agreements, <eob> where nations have said <eol> what they think they can do, <eob> are genuine and forthcoming <eol> for the vast majority of the parties. <eob>
The unfortunate thing <eob> is that now, as we look <eol> at the independent analyses <eob> of what those climate treaties <eol> are liable to yield, <eob> the magnitude of the problem <eol> before us becomes clear. <eob>
This is the United States Energy <eol> Information Agency's assessment <eob> of what will happen if the countries <eol> implement the climate commitments <eob> that they've made in Paris <eob> between now and 2040. <eob>
It shows basically CO2 emissions <eol> around the world <eob> over the next 30 years. <eob>
There are three things <eol> that you need to look at and appreciate. <eob>
One, CO2 emissions are expected <eol> to continue to grow <eob> for the next 30 years. <eob>
In order to control climate, <eob> CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero <eob> because it's the cumulative <eol> emissions that drive heating on the planet. <eob>
This should tell you that we are losing <eol> the race to fossil fuels. <eob>
The second thing you should notice <eob> is that the bulk of the growth <eol> comes from the developing countries, <eob> from China, from India, from the rest of the world, <eob> which includes South Africa and Indonesia <eol> and Brazil, <eob> as most of these countries <eol> move their people <eob> into the lower range of lifestyles <eob> that we literally take <eol> for granted in the developed world. <eob>
The final thing that you should notice <eob> is that each year, <eob> about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added <eol> to the planet's atmosphere, <eob> and then diffusing into the ocean <eol> and into the land. <eob>
That's on top of the 550 gigatons <eol> that are in place today. <eob>
At the end of 30 years, <eob> we will have put 850 gigatons <eol> of carbon into the air, <eob> and that probably goes a long way <eob> towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase <eol> in global mean surface temperatures, <eob> locking in ocean acidification <eob> and locking in sea level rise. <eob>
Now, this is a projection made by men <eob> by the actions of society, <eob> and it's ours to change, not to accept. <eob>
But the magnitude of the problem <eol> is something we need to appreciate. <eob>
Different nations make different <eol> energy choices. <eob>
It's a function <eol> of their natural resources. <eob>
It's a function of their climate. <eob>
It's a function of the development path <eol> that they've followed as a society. <eob>
It's a function of where on the surface <eol> of the planet they are. <eob>
Are they where it's dark <eol> a lot of the time, <eob> or are they at the mid-latitudes? <eob>
Many, many, many things <eol> go into the choices of countries, <eob> and they each make a different choice. <eob>
The overwhelming thing <eol> that we need to appreciate <eob> is the choice that China <eol> has made. <eob>
China has made the choice, <eob> and will make the choice, to run on coal. <eob>
The United States has an alternative. <eob>
It can run on natural gas <eob> as a result of the inventions <eol> of fracking and shale gas, <eob> which we have here. <eob>
They provide an alternative. <eob>
The OECD Europe has a choice. <eob>
It has renewables that it can afford <eol> to deploy in Germany <eob> because it's rich enough <eol> to afford to do it. <eob>
The French and the British show interest <eol> in nuclear power. <eob>
Eastern Europe, still very heavily <eol> committed to natural gas and to coal, <eob> and with natural gas that comes from Russia, <eob> with all of its entanglements. <eob>
China has many fewer choices <eob> and a much harder row to hoe. <eob>
If you look at China, and you ask yourself <eob> why has coal been important to it, <eob> you have to remember what China's done. <eob>
China brought people to power, <eol> not power to people. <eob>
It didn't do rural electrification. <eob> It urbanized. <eob> It urbanized by taking low-cost <eol> labor and low-cost energy, <eob> creating export industries <eob> that could fund a tremendous amount of growth. <eob>
If we look at China's path, <eob> all of us know that prosperity <eol> in China has dramatically increased. <eob>
In 1980, 80 percent of China's population <eob> lived below the extreme poverty level, <eob> below the level of having $1.90 per person per day. <eob>
By the year 2000, only 20 percent of China's population <eob> lived below the extreme poverty level <eob> — <eob> a remarkable feat, <eob> admittedly, with some costs <eol> in civil liberties <eob> that would be tough to accept <eol> in the Western world. <eob>
But the impact of all that wealth <eob> allowed people to get <eol> massively better nutrition. <eob>
It allowed water pipes to be placed. <eob>
It allowed sewage pipes to be placed, <eob> dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases, <eob> at the cost of some outdoor air pollution. <eob>
But in 1980, and even today, <eob> the number one killer <eol> in China is indoor air pollution, <eob> because people do not have access <eol> to clean cooking and heating fuels. <eob>
In fact, in 2040, <eob> it's still estimated <eol> that 200 million people <eob> in China <eob> will not have access <eol> to clean cooking fuels. <eob>
They have a remarkable path to follow. <eob>
India also needs to meet the needs <eol> of its own people, <eob> and it's going to do that <eol> by burning coal. <eob>
When we look at the EIA's projections <eol> of coal burning in India, <eob> India will supply nearly four times <eol> as much of its energy from coal <eob> as it will from renewables. <eob>
It's not because they don't know <eol> the alternatives; <eob> it's because rich countries <eol> can do what they choose, <eob> poor countries do what they must. <eob>
So what can we do to stop <eol> coal's emissions in time? <eob>
What can we do that changes this forecast <eol> that's in front of us? <eob>
Because it's a forecast that we can change <eol> if we have the will to do it. <eob>
First of all, we have to think <eol> about the magnitude of the problem. <eob>
Between now and 2040, <eob> 800 to 1,600 new coal plants <eol> are going to be built around the world. <eob>
This week, between one and three <eol> one-gigawatt coal plants <eob> are being turned <eol> on around the world. <eob>
That's happening <eol> regardless of what we want, <eob> because the people that rule their countries, <eob> assessing the interests of their citizens, <eob> have decided it's in the interest <eol> of their citizens to do that. <eob>
And that's going to happen unless <eol> they have a better alternative. <eob>
And every 100 of those plants will use up <eob> between one percent and three percent <eob> of the Earth's climate budget. <eob>
So every day that you go home <eol> thinking that you should do something <eob> about global warming, <eob> at the end of that week, remember: <eob> somebody fired up a coal plant <eol> that's going to run for 50 years <eob> and take away your ability <eol> to change it. <eob>
What we've forgotten <eol> is something that Vinod Khosla used to talk about, <eob> a man of Indian ethnicity <eol> but an American venture capitalist. <eob>
And he said, back in the early 2000s, <eob> that if you needed to get China <eol> and India off of fossil fuels, <eob> you had to create a technology <eol> that passed the "Chindia test," <eob> "Chindia" being the appending <eol> of the two words. <eob>
It had to be first of all viable, <eob> meaning that technically, <eol> they could implement it in their country, <eob> and that it would be accepted <eol> by the people in the country. <eob>
Two, it had to be a technology <eol> that was scalable, <eob> that it could deliver the same benefits <eob> on the same timetable as fossil fuels, <eob> so that they can enjoy the kind of life, <eol> again, that we take for granted. <eob>
And third, it had to be cost-effective <eob> without subsidy or without mandate. <eob>
It had to stand on its own two feet; <eob> it could not be maintained <eol> for that many people <eob> if in fact, those countries <eol> had to go begging <eob> or had some foreign country say, <eol> "I won't trade with you," <eob> in order to get the technology shift to occur. <eob>
If you look at the Chindia test, <eob> we simply have not come up <eol> with alternatives that meet that test. <eob>
That's what the EIA forecast tells us. <eob>
China's building 800 gigawatts of coal, <eob> 400 gigawatts of hydro, <eob> about 200 gigawatts of nuclear, <eob> and on an energy-equivalent basis, <eol> adjusting for intermittency, <eob> about 100 gigawatts of renewables. <eob>
800 gigawatts of coal. <eob>
They're doing that, knowing <eol> the costs better than any other country, <eob> knowing the need better than any other country. <eob>
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040 <eob> unless we give them a better choice. <eob>
To give them a better choice, <eob> it's going to have <eol> to meet the Chindia test. <eob>
If you look at all the alternatives <eol> that are out there, <eob> there are really two that come near to meeting it. <eob>
First is this area of new nuclear <eol> that I'll talk about in just a second. <eob>
It's a new generation of nuclear plants <eol> that are on the drawing boards <eob> around the world, <eob> and the people who are developing these say <eob> we can get them in position <eol> to demo by 2025 <eob> and to scale by 2030, <eol> if you will just let us. <eob>
The second alternative <eol> that could be there in time <eob> is utility-scale solar backed up <eol> with natural gas, <eob> which we can use today, <eob> versus the batteries which are still <eol> under development. <eob>
So what's holding new nuclear back? <eob>
Outdated regulations <eol> and yesterday's mindsets. <eob>
We have not used our latest scientific thinking <eol> on radiological health <eob> to think how we communicate <eol> with the public <eob> and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors. <eob>
We have new scientific knowledge <eol> that we need to use <eob> in order to improve the way we regulate <eol> nuclear industry. <eob>
The second thing is we've got a mindset <eob> that it takes 25 years <eol> and 2 to 5 billion dollars <eob> to develop a nuclear power plant. <eob>
That comes from the historical, military mindset <eob> of the places nuclear power <eol> came from. <eob>
These new nuclear ventures are saying <eob> that they can deliver power <eol> for 5 cents a kilowatt hour; <eob> they can deliver it <eol> for 100 gigawatts a year; <eob> they can demo it by 2025; <eob> and they can deliver it in scale by 2030, <eob> if only we give them a chance. <eob>
Right now, we're basically <eol> waiting for a miracle. <eob>
What we need is a choice. <eob>
If they can't make it safe, <eol> if they can't make it cheap, <eob> it should not be deployed. <eob>
But what I want you to do <eol> is not carry an idea forward, <eob> but write your leaders, <eob> write the head of the NGOs you support, <eob> and tell them to give you the choice, <eob> not the past. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter <eol> important for the US right now <eob> and in the world? <eob>
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter <eol> is our call to action. <eob>
It is a tool to reimagine a world <eob> where black people are free to exist, <eob> free to live. <eob>
It is a tool for our allies <eol> to show up differently for us. <eob>
I grew up in a neighborhood <eol> that was heavily policed. <eob>
I witnessed my brothers and my siblings <eob> continuously stopped <eol> and frisked by law enforcement. <eob>
I remember my home being raided. <eob>
And one of my questions <eol> as a child was, why? <eob> Why us? <eob> Black Lives Matter offers answers to the why. <eob>
It offers a new vision for young <eol> black girls around the world <eob> that we deserve to be fought for, <eob> that we deserve to call on local governments <eol> to show up for us. <eob>
Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And antiblack racism <eol> is not only happening in the United States. <eob>
It's actually happening <eol> all across the globe. <eob>
And what we need now more <eol> than ever is a human rights movement <eob> that challenges systemic racism <eol> in every single context. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We need this because the global reality <eob> is that black people are subject <eol> to all sorts of disparities <eob> in most of our most challenging <eol> issues of our day. <eob>
I think about issues like climate change, <eob> and how six of the 10 worst impacted <eol> nations by climate change <eob> are actually on the continent of Africa. <eob>
People are reeling from all sorts <eol> of unnatural disasters, <eob> displacing them from their ancestral homes <eob> and leaving them without a chance <eol> at making a decent living. <eob>
We also see disasters <eol> like Hurricane Matthew, <eob> which recently wreaked havoc <eol> in many different nations, <eob> but caused the most damage to Haiti. <eob>
Haiti is the poorest country <eol> in this hemisphere, <eob> and its inhabitants are black people. <eob>
And what we're seeing in Haiti <eob> is that they were actually <eol> facing a number of challenges <eob> that even preceded this hurricane. <eob>
They were reeling from the earthquake, <eob> they were reeling from cholera <eol> that was brought in by UN peacekeepers <eob> and still hasn't been eradicated. <eob> This is unconscionable. <eob> And this would not happen <eol> if this nation didn't have a population that was black, <eob> and we have to be real about that. <eob>
But what's most heartening right now <eob> is that despite these challenges, <eob> what we're seeing is that there's a network <eol> of Africans <eob> all across the continent <eob> who are rising up and fighting <eol> back and demanding climate justice. <eob>
MB: So Alicia, <eob> you've said that when black people <eol> are free, <eob> everyone is free. <eob>
Can you talk about what that means? <eob>
Alicia Garza: Sure. <eob> So I think race and racism <eol> is probably the most studied <eob> social, economic and political phenomenon <eol> in this country, <eob> but it's also the least understood. <eob>
The reality is that race <eol> in the United States <eob> operates on a spectrum <eol> from black to white. <eob>
Doesn't mean that people who are in <eol> between don't experience racism, <eob> but it means that the closer you are <eol> to white on that spectrum, <eob> the better off you are. <eob>
And the closer to black <eol> that you are on that spectrum <eob> the worse off your are. <eob>
When we think about <eol> how we address problems in this country, <eob> we often start from a place <eol> of trickle-down justice. <eob>
So using white folks as the control we say, <eob> well, if we make things better <eol> for white folks <eob> then everybody else is going to get free. <eob>
But actually it doesn't work that way. <eob>
We have to address problems at the root, <eob> and when you deal with <eol> what's happening in black communities, <eob> it creates an effervescence, right? <eob>
So a bubble up rather than a trickle down. <eob>
Let me give an example. <eob>
When we talk about the wage gap, <eob> we often say women make 78 cents <eol> to every dollar that a man makes. <eob>
You all have heard that before. <eob>
But those are the statistics <eol> for white women and white men. <eob>
The reality is that black women <eol> make something like 64 cents <eob> to every 78 cents <eol> that white women make. <eob>
When we talk about latinas, <eol> it goes down to about 58 cents. <eob>
If we were to talk about indigenous women, <eob> if we were to talk about trans women, <eob> it would even go further down. <eob>
So again, <eob> if you deal with those <eol> who are the most impacted, <eob> everybody has an opportunity <eol> to benefit from that, <eob> rather than dealing with the folks <eol> who are not as impacted, <eob> and expecting it to trickle down. <eob>
MB: So I love the effervescence, <eob> bubbling up. <eob>
AG: Effervescence -- like champagne. <eob>
MB: Who doesn't love a glass <eol> of champagne, right? <eob>
Champagne and freedom, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
What more could we want, y'all? <eob>
So you all have been doing <eol> this for a minute, <eob> and the last few years have been -- <eob> well, I can't even imagine, <eob> but I'm sure very transformative. <eob>
And I know that you all have learned <eol> a lot about leadership. <eob>
What do you want to share <eol> with these people <eob> about what you've learned <eol> about leadership? <eob>
Patrisse, let's start with you. <eob>
PC: Yeah, we have to invest <eol> in black leadership. <eob>
That's what I've learned <eol> the most in the last few years. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What we've seen is thousands of black <eol> people showing up for our lives <eob> with very little infrastructure <eol> and very little support. <eob>
I think our work as movement <eol> leaders isn't just about our own visibility <eob> but rather how do we make <eol> the whole visible. <eob>
How do we not just fight <eol> for our individual selves <eob> but fight for everybody? <eob>
And I also think <eob> leadership looks like everybody <eol> in this audience <eob> showing up for black lives. <eob>
It's not just about coming <eol> and watching people on a stage, right? <eob>
It's about how do you become that leader -- <eob> whether it's in your workplace, <eol> whether it's in your home -- <eob> and believe that the movement <eol> for black lives isn't just for us, <eob> but it's for everybody. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
MB: What about you, Opal? <eob>
OT: So I've been learning a great deal <eol> about interdependence. <eob>
I've been learning <eol> about how to trust your team. <eob>
I've come up with this new mantra <eob> after coming back from a three-month sabbatical, <eob> which is rare for black women <eol> to take who are in leadership, <eob> but I felt it was really important <eol> for my leadership and for my team <eob> to also practice stepping back <eob> as well as also sometimes stepping in. <eob>
And what I learned in this process <eol> was that we need to acknowledge <eob> that different people contribute <eol> different strengths, <eob> and that in order for our entire team <eol> to flourish, <eob> we have to allow them to share <eol> and allow them to shine. <eob>
And so during my sabbatical <eob> with the organization <eol> that I also work with, <eob> I saw our team rise up in my absence. <eob>
They were able to launch new programs, <eob> fundraise. <eob>
And when I came back, <eob> I had to give them a lot <eol> of gratitude and praise <eob> because they showed me <eol> that they truly had my back <eob> and that they truly had their own backs. <eob>
You know, in this process <eol> of my sabbatical, <eob> I was really reminded <eob> of this Southern African philosophy <eol> of Ubuntu. <eob>
I am because you are; <eob> you are because I am. <eob>
And I realized that my own leadership, <eob> and the contributions <eol> that I'm able to make, <eob> is in large part due to the contributions <eol> that they make, right? <eob>
And I have to acknowledge that, <eol> and I have to see that, <eob> and so my new mantra is, "Keep calm and trust the team." <eob> And also, <eob> "Keep calm and thank the team." <eob>
MB: You know, one of the things <eol> I feel like I've heard <eob> in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement <eol> more than anywhere else <eob> is about being a leaderful movement, <eob> and that's such a beautiful concept, <eob> and I think that something <eob> that women often bring to the conversation <eol> about leadership <eob> is really the collective piece. <eob>
What about you, Alicia? <eob>
AG: Yeah ... <eob> How many of you heard <eol> that saying that leadership is lonely? <eob>
I think that there is an element <eol> where leadership is lonely, <eob> but I also believe <eol> that it doesn't have to be like that. <eob>
And in order for us <eol> to get to that point, <eob> I think there's a few things <eol> that we need to be doing. <eob>
So one is we have to stop treating <eol> leaders like superheroes. <eob>
We are ordinary people attempting <eol> to do extraordinary things, <eob> and so we need to be supported in that way. <eob>
The other thing <eol> that I've learned about leadership <eob> is that there's a difference <eol> between leadership and celebrities, right? <eob>
And there's a way in which we've been <eol> kind of transformed into celebrities <eob> rather than people who are trying to solve a problem. <eob>
And the way that we treat celebrities <eol> is very fickle, right? <eob>
We like them one day, <eob> we don't like what they're wearing <eol> the next day, <eob> and all of a sudden we have <eol> issues, right? <eob>
So we need to stop deifying leaders <eob> so that more people <eol> will step into leadership. <eob>
Lots of people are terrified <eol> to step into leadership <eob> because of how much scrutiny <eol> they receive <eob> and how brutal we are with leaders. <eob>
And then the last thing <eol> that I've learned about leadership <eob> is that it's really easy to be a leader <eol> when everybody likes you. <eob>
But it's hard to be a leader <eol> when you have to make hard choices <eob> and when you have to do <eol> what's right, <eob> even though people are not <eol> going to like you for it. <eob>
And so in that way, <eob> I think another way <eol> that we can support leaders <eob> is to struggle with us, <eob> but struggle with us politically, <eob> not personally. <eob>
We can have disagreements <eol> without being disagreeable, <eob> but it's important for us <eol> to sharpen each other <eob> so that we all can rise. <eob>
MB: That's beautiful, thank you. <eob>
So you all are doing work <eob> that forces you to face some <eol> brutal, painful realities <eob> on a daily basis. <eob>
What gives you hope <eob> and inspires you in that context? <eob>
PC: I am hopeful for black futures. <eob>
And I say that because <eol> we live in a society <eob> that's so obsessed with black death. <eob>
We have images of our death <eol> on the TV screen, <eob> on our Twitter timelines, <eob> on our Facebook timelines, <eob> but what if instead we imagine black life? <eob>
We imagine black people <eol> living and thriving. <eob>
And that -- <eob> that inspires me. <eob>
OT: What inspires me <eol> these days are immigrants. <eob>
Immigrants all over the world <eol> who are doing the best that they can <eob> to make a living, to survive <eol> and also to thrive. <eob>
Right now there are over 244 million people <eob> who aren't living in <eol> their country of origin. <eob>
This is a 40 percent increase <eol> since the year 2000. <eob>
So what this tells me <eob> is that the disparities <eol> across the globe are only getting worse. <eob>
Yet there are people <eol> who are finding the strength and wherewithal to travel, <eob> to move, <eob> to eke out a better living for themselves <eob> and to provide for their families <eol> and their loved ones. <eob>
And some of these people who are immigrants <eob> are also undocumented. <eob> They're unauthorized. <eob> And they inspire me even more <eob> because although our society <eol> is telling them, you're not wanted, <eob> you're not needed here, <eob> and they're highly vulnerable <eol> and subject to abuse, to wage theft, <eob> to exploitation and xenophobic attacks, <eob> many of them are also beginning <eol> to organize in their communities. <eob>
And what I'm seeing is that <eol> there's also an emerging network <eob> of black, undocumented people <eol> who are resisting the framework, <eob> and resisting the criminalization <eol> of their existence. <eob>
And that to me is incredibly powerful <eob> and inspires me every singe day. <eob>
MB: Thank you. <eob> Alicia? <eob>
AG: So we know that young people <eol> are the present and the future, <eob> but what inspires me are older people <eob> who are becoming transformed <eol> in the service of this movement. <eob>
We all know that as you get older, <eob> you get a little more entrenched <eol> in your ways. <eob>
It's happening to me, I know that's right. <eob>
But I'm so inspired when I see people <eol> who have a way that they do things, <eob> have a way that they think about the world, <eob> and they're courageous enough to be open <eol> to listening to what the experiences are <eob> of so many of us who want <eol> to live in world that's just <eob> and want to live in a world <eol> that's equitable. <eob>
And I'm also inspired by the actions <eol> that I'm seeing older people taking <eob> in service of this movement. <eob>
I'm inspired by seeing older people step <eol> into their own power and leadership <eob> and say, "I'm not passing a torch, <eob> I'm helping you light the fire." <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
MB: I love that -- <eob> yes. <eob>
So in terms of action, <eob> I think that it is awesome to sit here <eol> and be able to listen to you all, <eob> and to have our minds open and shift, <eob> but that's not going to get <eol> black people free. <eob>
So if you had one thing <eol> you would like this audience <eob> and the folks who are watching <eol> around the world to actually do, <eob> what would that be? <eob>
AG: OK, two quick ones. <eob>
One, call the White House. <eob>
The water protectors <eol> are being forcibly removed <eob> from the camp that they have set up <eol> to defend what keeps us alive. <eob>
And that is intricately <eol> related to black lives. <eob>
So definitely call the White House <eol> and demand that they stop doing that. <eob>
There are tanks <eob> and police officers arresting <eol> every single person there as we speak. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
The second thing that you can do <eob> is to join something. <eob>
Be a part of something. <eob>
There are groups, collectives -- <eob> doesn't have to be a non-profit, <eol> you know what I mean? <eob>
But there are groups that are doing <eol> work in our communities right now <eob> to make sure that black lives matter <eol> so all lives matter. <eob>
Get involved; <eob> don't sit on your couch and tell people <eol> what you think they should be doing. <eob>
Go do it with us. <eob>
MB: Do you guys want to add anything? <eob> That's good? All right. So -- <eob> And I think that the joining something, <eob> like if you feel like there's not <eol> something where you are, start it. <eob>
AG: Start it. <eob>
MB: These conversations <eol> that we're having, <eob> have those conversations <eol> with somebody else. <eob>
And then instead of just letting <eol> it be a talk that you had, <eob> actually decide to start something. <eob>
OT: That's right. <eob>
MB: I mean, that's what you all did. <eob> You started something, and look <eol> what's happened. <eob>
Thank you all so much <eol> for being here with us today. <eob>
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation <eol> was on Facebook, <eob> and it was three days long. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We shared over 3,000 messages between us, <eob> and it was during those 72 hours <eol> that I knew she was going to be my wife. <eob>
We didn't wait any prerequisite <eol> amount of time for our courtship; <eob> we told each other <eol> the vulnerable truths up front: <eob> I am a transgender man, <eob> which means the F on my birth <eol> certificate should have stood for "False," <eob> instead of "Female." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Walking around as a woman in the world <eob> felt like walking with <eol> pebbles in my shoes. <eob>
It took the rhythm out of my swagger, <eob> it threw me off balance, <eob> it pained me with every step <eol> I took forward. <eob>
But today I'm a man of my own intention; <eob> a man of my own design. <eob>
Kim Katrin Milan: I am <eol> a cisgender queer woman. <eob>
Cisgender means the gender <eol> I was assigned at birth <eob> is still and has always been female. <eob>
This doesn't make me natural or normal, <eob> this is just one way of describing <eol> the many different ways <eob> that we exist in this world. <eob>
And queer is a cultural term, <eob> but in this case, <eob> it refers to the way that I'm not <eol> restricted by gender <eob> when it comes to choosing partners. <eob>
I've identified in a few different ways -- <eob> as a bisexual, as a lesbian -- <eob> but for me, <eob> queerness encompasses all of the layers <eol> of who I am and how I've loved. <eob>
I'm layers, and not fractions. <eob>
And for me, <eob> the fact that he was queer <eob> meant that I could trust his courtship <eol> from the very beginning. <eob>
As queer and trans people, <eob> we're so often excluded <eol> from institutions and traditions. <eob>
We create spaces outside of convention, <eob> including the conventions of time. <eob>
And in those 3,000 messages between us, <eob> we collapsed time; <eob> we queered it; <eob> we laid it all on the table. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
With no pretense at all. <eob> And this meant that we were able <eol> to commit to each other <eob> in a profoundly different way. <eob>
So often what we're told is this idea <eol> of the "Golden Rule," <eob> that we should treat other people <eol> the way we want to be treated. <eob>
But the problem with that <eob> is that it assumes that we are <eol> the standard for other people, <eob> and we're not. <eob>
We need to treat other people <eol> the way they want to be treated, <eob> which means we had to ask. <eob>
I couldn't assume that the kind <eol> of love that Tiq needed <eob> was the same kind of love that I needed. <eob>
So I asked him everything -- <eol> about his fears, his insecurities -- <eob> and we started from there. <eob>
TM: I didn't know what <eol> kind of love I needed. <eob>
I had just come out of a year-long fog <eob> of being rejected and utterly depleted. <eob>
I had someone look me in my eyes <eob> and tell me that I was unworthy <eol> of their love because I was trans. <eob>
And there's a culture of lovelessness <eob> that we've created around <eol> transgender people. <eob>
It's reasoned, justified <eol> and often signed into law. <eob>
And I was a heartbeat away <eol> from internalizing that message, <eob> that I wasn't worthy. <eob>
But Kim said that I was her ideal -- <eob> the heartbroken mess that I was. <eob>
KKM: He totally was my ideal. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In more ways than one. <eob> Both poets, writers, creatives <eob> with a long history <eol> of community work behind us, <eob> and big, huge dreams <eol> of a family in front of us, <eob> we shared a lot of things in common, <eob> but we were also incredibly different. <eob>
I've been a lifelong traveler <eol> and a bit of an orphan, <eob> whereas he comes from a huge family, <eob> and definitely stays grounded. <eob>
I often kind of sum up <eol> the differences in our strengths <eob> by saying, "Keep me safe, <eob> and I'll keep you wild." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
TM: We have marginalized identities <eol> but we don't live marginalized lives. <eob>
Being queer and trans is about creating <eol> new ways of existing. <eob>
It's about loving people as they are, <eob> not as they're supposed to be. <eob>
Kim is unapologetically feminine <eob> in a world that is often cruel and violent <eob> to women who are <eol> too proud and too freeing. <eob>
And I didn't enter into this union <eob> under the auspices that she <eol> was going to be my helper or my rib, <eob> but a fully complex -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
KKM: Right? That's not right. <eob>
TM: But a fully complex human being <eob> whose femininity wasn't for me <eol> to rein in, control or critique. <eob>
It's her brilliance, <eob> the way she leads with compassion, <eob> and how she never loses <eol> sight of her empathy. <eob>
She has been my hero since day one. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
KKM: Our relationship has always been <eol> about setting each other free. <eob>
One of the first questions I asked him <eob> was what dreams he had left to accomplish, <eob> and how would I help him get there. <eob>
His dreams to live as a poet, <eob> to adopt and raise a family together, <eob> to live a life that he was proud of, <eob> and one that would live up to <eol> his mother's incredible legacy. <eob>
And I really appreciated that we <eol> were able to start from that place, <eob> and not from a place <eol> that was around figuring out <eob> how to make each other work together. <eob>
And I think this really allowed us <eol> to grow into the people that we were <eob> in a way that was incredibly different. <eob>
I love him whole; <eob> pre-transition, now and in the future. <eob>
And it's this love that had us <eol> committed to each other <eob> before we'd even seen each other's faces. <eob>
TM: My mother's biggest <eol> concern when I transitioned <eob> was who was going to love me as I am. <eob>
Had being transgender somehow <eol> precluded me from love and monogamy <eob> because I was supposedly <eol> born in the wrong body? <eob>
But it's this type of structuring <eol> that has to be reframed <eob> in order to let love in. <eob>
My body never betrayed me, <eob> and my body was never wrong. <eob>
It's this restrictive, <eol> binary thinking on gender <eob> that said that I didn't exist. <eob>
But when we met, <eob> she loved me for exactly how I showed up. <eob>
She would trace her fingers <eol> along the numb keloid scars <eob> left by my top surgery. <eob>
Scars that run from the middle of my chest <eol> all the way out to my outer torso. <eob>
She said that these were <eol> reminders of my strength <eob> and everything that I went through <eob> and nothing for me to be ashamed of. <eob>
So sprinting towards her hand in marriage <eob> was the queerest thing that I could do. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It flew in the face of more <eol> conventional trajectories <eob> of love and relationships, <eob> because God was never supposed <eol> to bless a union for folks like us, <eob> and the law was never <eol> supposed to recognize it. <eob>
KKM: So on May 5, 2014, <eob> just about three months <eol> after meeting online, <eob> we were married on the steps <eol> of City Hall in Manhattan, <eob> and it was beautiful <eol> in every conceivable way. <eob>
It's safe to say that we <eol> reimagined some traditions, <eob> but we also kept some old ones <eol> that we worked in, <eob> and we created something <eol> that worked for us. <eob>
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled <eol> with wildflowers from Brooklyn -- <eob> also added in a little bit of lavender <eol> and sage to keep us grounded <eob> because we were so nervous. <eob>
And it was put together by a sweet <eol> sister healer friend of ours. <eob>
I never wanted a diamond ring, <eob> because conflict and convention <eol> are not my thing, <eob> so my ring is the deepest purple, <eob> like the color of my crown chakra, <eob> and set in place with my birthstones. <eob>
The gift of queerness is options. <eob>
I never had to choose his last name, <eob> it was never an exception, <eob> but I did because I am <eol> my father's bastard child, <eob> someone who has always been <eol> an apology, a secret, an imposition. <eob>
And it was incredibly freeing <eob> to choose the name of a man <eol> who chose me first. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
TM: So we told some family <eol> and some close friends, <eob> many of whom were still in disbelief <eol> as we took our vows. <eob>
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding <eol> photos on Facebook, <eob> where we met -- <eob> and Instagram, of course. <eob>
And we quickly realized <eob> that our coming together was more <eol> than just a union of two people, <eob> but was a model of possibility <eol> for the millions of LGBTQ folks <eob> who have been sold this lie <eob> that family and matrimony <eol> is antithetical to who they are -- <eob> for those of us <eol> who rarely get to see ourselves <eob> reflected in love and happiness. <eob>
KKM: And the thing is, <eob> absolutely we are marginalized <eol> because of our identities, <eob> but it also emboldens us <eol> to be the people that we are. <eob>
Queerness is our major key; <eob> blackness is our magic. <eob>
It's because of these things <eob> that we are able to be hopeful, open, <eol> receptive and shape-shifting. <eob>
These are the things that give us, <eob> and are such an incredible <eol> source of, our strength. <eob>
Our queerness is a source <eol> of that strength. <eob>
I think of the words of Ottawa-based <eol> poet Brandon Wint: <eob> "Not queer like gay; <eol> queer like escaping definition. <eob>
Queer like some sort of fluidity <eol> and limitlessness all at once. <eob>
Queer like a freedom <eol> too strange to be conquered. <eob>
Queer like the fearlessness <eol> to imagine what love can look like, <eob> and to pursue it." <eob>
TM: We are part of a community of folks -- <eob> Yeah, that's good right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We are part of a community of folks <eol> who are living their authentic selves <eob> all along the gender spectrum, <eob> despite the ubiquitous threat of violence, <eob> despite the undercurrent of anxiety <eol> that always is present <eob> for people who live on their own terms. <eob>
Globally, a transgender person <eol> is murdered every 21 hours. <eob>
And the United States has had more <eol> trans murders on record this year <eob> than any year to date. <eob>
However, our stories are much more <eol> than this rigid dichotomy <eob> of strength and resilience. <eob>
We are expanding the human <eol> complexity on these margins, <eob> and we are creating freedom <eol> on these margins. <eob>
KKM: And we don't have any blueprints. <eob>
We're creating a world <eol> that we have literally never seen before; <eob> organizing families based <eol> on love and not by blood, <eob> guiding by a compassion that so few of us <eol> have been shown ourselves. <eob>
So many of us have not received <eol> love from our families -- <eob> have been betrayed by the people <eol> that we trust most. <eob>
So what we do here is we create <eol> entirely new languages of love. <eob>
Ones that are about creating the space <eol> for us to be our authentic selves <eob> and not imposing this standard <eob> of what masculinity or femininity <eol> is supposed to be. <eob>
TM: We are interested <eol> in love and inclusion <eob> as a tool of revolutionary change, right? <eob>
And the idea is simply, <eob> if we drop all our preconceived notions <eob> about how somebody is supposed to be -- <eob> in their body, in their <eol> gender, in their skin -- <eob> if we take the intentional steps <eol> to unlearn these deep-seated biases <eob> and create space for people <eol> to be self-determined, <eob> and embrace who they are, <eob> then we will definitely create a better <eol> world than the one we were born into. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
KKM: We want to mark this time in history <eob> by leaving evidence of the fact <eol> that we were here. <eob>
We open up little windows <eol> into our relationship <eob> for our community to bear witness, <eob> and we do this because we want <eol> to make maps to the future <eob> and not monuments to ourselves. <eob>
Our experience does not invalidate <eol> other peoples' experience, <eob> but it should and necessarily does <eol> complicate this idea <eob> of what love and marriage <eol> are supposed to be. <eob>
TM: OK, now for all the talking, <eob> and inspiring, <eob> and possibility-modeling we've done, <eob> we've been nowhere near perfect. <eob>
And we've had to hold <eol> a mirror up to ourselves. <eob>
And I saw that I wasn't <eol> always the best listener, <eob> and that my ego got in the way <eol> of our progress as a couple. <eob>
And I've had to really assess <eol> these deep-seated, sexist ideas <eob> that I've had about the value <eol> of a woman's experience in the world. <eob>
I've had to reevaluate what it means <eol> to be in allyship with my wife. <eob>
KKM: And I had to remind myself <eol> of a lot of things, too. <eob> What it means to be hard on the issues, <eob> but soft on the person. <eob>
While we were writing this, <eol> we got into a massive fight. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
For so many different reasons, <eob> but based on the content about our values <eol> and our lived experiences -- <eob> and we were really hurt, you know? <eob>
Because what we do and how we love <eol> puts ourselves entirely on the line. <eob>
But even though the fight lasted <eol> over the course of two days -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We were able to come back <eol> together to each other, <eob> and recommit to ourselves, <eol> to each other and to our marriage. <eob>
And that really yielded <eol> some of the most passionate parts <eob> of what we share with you here today. <eob>
TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity, <eob> which I think doesn't happen enough. <eob>
I've had to interrogate masculinity; <eob> the toxic privileges that come <eol> with being a man don't define me, <eob> but I have to be accountable <eol> for how it shows up in my life every day. <eob>
I have allowed my wife <eol> to do all of the emotional labor <eob> of prying open the lines of communication <eol> when I'd rather clam up and run away. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I've stripped away emotional support <eol> instead of facing my own vulnerabilities, <eob> particularly around the heartbreaking <eol> miscarriage we suffered last year, <eob> and I'm sorry for that. <eob>
Sometimes as men, <eol> we get to take the easy way out. <eob>
And so my journey as a trans person <eol> is about reimagining masculinity. <eob> About creating a manhood <eol> that isn't measured <eob> by the power it wields, <eol> by the entitlements afforded to it, <eob> or any simulacrum of control <eol> that it can muster, <eob> but works in tandem with femininity, <eob> and is guided by my spirit. <eob>
KKM: Y'all ... <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And this has created the space <eol> for my femininity to flourish <eob> in a way I had never experienced before. <eob>
He never is threatened by my sexuality, <eob> he never polices what I wear or how I act. <eob>
I cook but he does way more <eol> of the cleaning than I do. <eob>
And when we're rushing <eol> to get out of the house <eob> and we have so much to handle, <eob> he handles everything, <eob> so I have time to do my hair and makeup. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He understands that this is my armor, <eob> and he never treats femininity <eol> as though it is frivolous or superficial, <eob> and this, and him -- <eob> he grows my experience <eol> of gender every single day. <eob>
TM: I love to watch her <eol> get dressed in the morning. <eob>
Watching her in the closet, <eob> looking for something comfortable <eol> and colorful, and tight, <eob> and safe -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But it's challenging to watch her <eol> negotiate her decisions <eob> looking for something that's going <eol> to get the least amount of attention, <eob> but at the same time be an expression <eol> of the vibrant and sexy woman she is. <eob>
And all I want to do is celebrate <eol> her for her beauty, <eob> and the things that make her <eol> beautiful and special and free, <eob> from her long acrylic nails, <eob> to her uncompromising black feminism. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
KKM: I love you. <eob>
TM: I love you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
KKM: There are so many queer <eol> and trans people <eob> who have come before us, <eob> whose stories we will never get to hear. <eob>
We constantly experience <eol> this retelling of history <eob> where we are conspicuously left out. <eob>
And it's really hard <eol> to not see ourselves there. <eob>
And so living out loud for us <eol> is about that representation. <eob>
It's about having possibility models, <eob> and having hope that love is part <eol> of our inheritance in this world, too. <eob>
TM: The possibility that we are practicing <eob> is about reinventing time, <eol> love and institutions. <eob>
We are creating a future of multiplicity. <eob>
We are expanding the spectrum <eol> of gender and sexuality, <eob> imagining ourselves into existence, <eob> imagining a world where gender <eol> is self-determined and not imposed, <eob> and where who we are <eol> is a kaleidoscope of possibility <eob> without the narrow-minded limitations <eol> masquerading as science or justice. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
KKM: And I can't lie: <eob> it is really, really hard. <eob>
It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry <eob> with an open heart and a smile on my face. <eob>
It is really hard to face the injustice <eol> that exists in the world, <eob> while still believing in the ability <eol> of people to really change. <eob>
That takes an enormous amount <eol> of faith and dedication. <eob>
And beyond that, <eob> marriage is hard work. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Piles of dirty socks on the floor, <eob> more boring sports shows <eol> than I ever thought possible -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And fights that bring me to tears <eob> when it feels like we're not <eol> speaking the same language. <eob>
But there is not a day that goes by <eob> where I am not so grateful <eol> to be married to this man; <eob> where I'm not so grateful for <eol> the possibility of changing minds, <eob> and rewarding conversations, <eob> and creating a world <eol> where love belongs to us all. <eob>
I think about our acronym: <eob> LGBTQ2SIA. <eob>
A seemingly endless evolution <eol> of self and a community, <eob> but also this really deep desire <eol> not to leave anyone behind. <eob>
We've learned how to love each other, <eob> and we've committed to loving each other <eol> throughout changes to gender <eob> and changes in spirit. <eob>
And we learned this love <eol> in our chat rooms, <eob> in our clubs, in our bars <eol> and in our community centers. <eob>
We've learned how to love each other <eob> for the long haul. <eob>
TM & amp; KKM: Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This picture <eob> is from my metro card <eob> when I spent a year abroad <eol> in Paris in college in the mid- '90s. <eob>
My friend says I look like <eol> a French anarchist -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But this is still what I see <eob> when I look in the mirror in the morning. <eob>
Within a month of living in Paris, <eol> I'd lost 15 pounds <eob> and I was in the best shape of my life <eob> because I was eating fresh food <eob> and I was walking wherever I went. <eob>
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta, <eob> a region built largely by highways <eol> and automobiles <eob> and with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl, <eob> Paris fundamentally changed the way I understood <eob> the construction of the world <eol> around me, <eob> and I got obsessed with the role <eol> of infrastructure -- <eob> that it's not just the way to move people <eol> from point A to point B, <eob> it's not just the way to convey water or sewage or energy, <eob> but it's the foundation for our economy. <eob>
It's the foundation <eol> for our social life and for our culture, <eob> and it really matters to the way <eol> that we live. <eob>
When I came home, <eol> I was instantly frustrated, <eob> stuck in traffic as I crossed the top end <eol> of our perimeter highway. <eob>
Not only was I not moving a muscle, <eob> I had no social interaction <eob> with the hundreds of thousands <eol> of people that were hurtling past me, <eob> like me, with their eyes faced forward <eol> and their music blaring. <eob>
I wondered if this was an inevitable outcome, <eob> or could we do something about it. <eob>
Was it possible to transform <eol> this condition in Atlanta <eob> into the kind of place <eol> that I wanted to live in? <eob>
I went back to grad school <eol> in architecture and city planning, <eob> developed this interest in infrastructure, <eob> and in 1999 came up with an idea <eob> for my thesis project: <eob> the adaptation of an obsolete loop <eol> of old railroad circling downtown <eob> as a new infrastructure <eol> for urban revitalization. <eob>
It was just an idea. <eob>
I never thought <eol> we would actually build it. <eob>
But I went to work at an architecture firm, <eob> and eventually talked to my coworkers about it, <eob> and they loved the idea. <eob>
And as we started talking <eol> to more people about it, <eob> more people wanted to hear about it. <eob>
In the summer of 2001, <eob> we connected with Cathy Woolard, <eob> who was soon elected city council president. <eob>
And we built a citywide <eol> vision around this idea: <eob> the Atlanta BeltLine, <eol> a 22-mile loop <eob> of transit and trails <eol> and transformation. <eob>
I was doing two and three meetings <eol> a week for two and a half years, <eob> and so was Cathy and her staff <eol> and a handful of volunteers. <eob>
Together, we built this amazing movement <eol> of people and ideas. <eob>
It included community advocates who were used <eol> to fighting against things, <eob> but found the Atlanta BeltLine <eol> as something that they could fight for; <eob> developers who saw the opportunity <eob> to take advantage of a lot <eol> of new growth in the city; <eob> and dozens of nonprofit <eol> partners who saw their mission <eob> at least partly accomplished by the shared vision. <eob>
Now, usually these groups <eol> of people aren't at the same table <eob> wanting the same outcome. <eob>
But there we were, <eol> and it was kind of weird, <eob> but it was really, really powerful. <eob>
The people of Atlanta fell in love with a vision <eob> that was better than what <eol> they saw through their car windshields, <eob> and the people of Atlanta made it happen, <eob> and I guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise. <eob>
From the beginning, our coalition <eol> was diverse. <eob>
People of all stripes <eol> were part of our story. <eob>
People on the lower end <eol> of the economic spectrum loved it, too. <eob>
They were just afraid <eol> they weren't going to be able to be there <eob> when it got built, that <eol> they'd be priced out. <eob>
And we've all heard <eol> that kind of story before, right? <eob>
But we promised that the Atlanta BeltLine <eol> would be different, <eob> and people took ownership of the idea, <eob> and they made it better than anything <eol> we ever imagined <eob> in the beginning, <eob> including significant subsidies <eol> for housing, <eob> new parks, art, an arboretum -- <eol> a list that continues to grow. <eob>
And we put in place <eob> the organizations and agencies <eol> that were required to make it happen. <eob>
And importantly, it is. <eob>
Now we're in the early stages <eol> of implementation, and it's working. <eob>
The first mainline section of trail <eol> was opened in 2012, <eob> and it's already generated over three billion dollars <eob> of private-sector investment. <eob>
But it's not only changing <eol> the physical form of the city, <eob> it's changing the way <eol> we think about the city, <eob> and what our expectations <eol> are for living there. <eob>
About a month ago, <eob> I had to take my kids <eol> with me to the grocery store <eob> and they were complaining about it, <eob> because they didn't want <eol> to get in the car. <eob>
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go, <eob> can we at least ride our bikes?" <eob> And I said, "Of course we can. <eob>
That's what people in Atlanta do. <eob>
We ride our bikes to the grocery store." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you, yeah. <eob>
Now, they don't know <eol> how ridiculous that is, <eob> but I do. <eob>
And I also understand <eol> that their expectations for Atlanta <eob> are really powerful. <eob>
This kind of transformation <eol> is exactly like sprawl <eob> in the last century, <eob> the movement where our investment <eol> in highways and automobiles <eob> fundamentally changed American life. <eob>
That wasn't some grand conspiracy. <eob>
There were conspiracies <eol> within it, of course. <eob>
But it was a cultural momentum. <eob>
It was millions of people <eol> making millions of decisions <eob> over an extended period of time, <eob> that fundamentally changed not only <eol> the way that we build cities, <eob> but it changed our expectations <eob> for our lives. <eob>
These changes were the foundations <eol> for urban sprawl. <eob>
We didn't call it sprawl at that time. <eob>
We called it the future. <eob> And it was. <eob> And we got all the highways and strip malls <eol> and cul-de-sacs we wanted. <eob>
It was a radical transformation, <eob> but it was built by a cultural momentum. <eob>
So it's important to not separate <eob> the physical construction <eol> of the places we live <eob> from other things that are happening at that time. <eob>
At that time, <eob> in the second half of the last century, <eob> science was curing disease <eob> and lifting us to the moon, <eob> and the sexual revolution <eol> was breaking down barriers, <eob> and the Civil Rights Movement <eol> began its march <eob> toward the fulfillment <eol> of our nation's promise. <eob>
Television, entertainment, food, <eol> travel, business -- everything was changing, <eob> and both the public and private <eol> sectors were colluding <eob> to give us the lives we wanted. <eob>
The Federal Highway Administration, <eob> for example, didn't exist <eol> before there were highways. <eob> Think about it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course, today it's important <eol> to understand and acknowledge <eob> that those benefits accrued <eol> to some groups of people <eob> and not to others. <eob>
It was not an equitable cultural momentum. <eob>
But when we look today in wonder <eol> and disgust, maybe, <eob> at the metropolis sprawl before us, <eob> we wonder if we're stuck. <eob>
Are we stuck with the legacy <eol> of that inequity? <eob>
Are we stuck with this dystopian <eol> traffic hellscape? <eob>
Are we stuck with rampant urban displacement, <eob> with environmental degradation? <eob>
Are we stuck with social isolation <eob> or political polarization? <eob>
Are these the inevitable <eol> and permanent outcomes? <eob>
Or are they the result <eol> of our collective cultural decisions <eob> that we've made for ourselves? <eob>
And if they are, <eob> can't we change them? <eob>
What I have learned <eol> from our experience in Atlanta <eob> is not an anomaly. <eob>
Similar stories are playing out everywhere, <eob> where people are reclaiming <eol> not only old railroads, <eob> but also degraded urban waterways <eol> and obsolete roadways, <eob> reinventing all of the infrastructure <eob> in their lives. <eob>
Whether here in New York <eob> or in Houston <eob> or Miami, <eob> Detroit, Philadelphia, <eob> Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, <eob> Toronto and Paris, <eob> cities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing <eob> this infrastructure for themselves, <eob> including the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects, <eob> the Los Angeles River, <eob> the revitalization effort for which similarly started <eob> as a grassroots movement, <eob> has developed into a cultural momentum, <eob> and is now in the early stages of being transformed <eob> into some kind of life-affirming infrastructure again, <eob> this one with trails and parks and fishing and boating <eob> and community revitalization, <eob> and of course, water quality and flood control. <eob>
It's already improving <eol> the lives of people. <eob>
It's already changing the way the rest <eol> of us think about Los Angeles. <eob>
This is more than just infrastructure. <eob>
We're building new lives for ourselves. <eob>
It's a movement that includes local food, <eol> urban agriculture, <eob> craft beer, the maker movement, <eob> tech and design -- all of these things, <eol> early indicators of a really radical shift <eob> in the way we build cities. <eob>
We're taking places like this <eob> and transforming them into this. <eob> And soon this. <eob>
And this is all exciting and good. <eob>
We're changing the world for the better. <eob> Good for us! <eob> And it is awesome -- I mean that. <eob>
But our history of sprawl, <eob> and from what we can already see <eol> with these catalyst projects today, <eob> we know and must remember <eob> that big changes like this <eol> don't usually benefit everyone. <eob>
The market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum <eob> often include the seemingly <eol> unstoppable <eob> and inevitable cycle of rising <eol> taxes, prices and rents. <eob>
This is urgent. <eob> If we care, we have to stand up <eob> and speak out. <eob>
This should be a call to action, <eob> because the answer can't be <eol> to not improve communities. <eob> The answer can't be to not build <eol> parks and transit and grocery stores. <eob>
The answer can't be <eol> to hold communities down <eob> just to keep them affordable. <eob>
But we do have to follow through <eol> and address the financial realities <eob> that we're facing. <eob>
This is hard, and it <eol> won't happen on its own. <eob>
We can do it, and I'm committed <eol> to this goal in Atlanta, <eob> to sticking up again for people <eol> who made it possible in the first place. <eob>
We can't call it a success without them. <eob>
I certainly can't, <eob> because the people I made <eol> commitments to all those years <eob> weren't abstract populations. <eob>
They're my friends and neighbors. <eob> They're people that I love. <eob>
So even though it started as my graduate thesis <eob> and I'm working hard <eol> for 16 years with thousands of people <eob> to help make this thing come to life, <eob> I know and believe that who the BeltLine <eol> is being built for <eob> is just as important as whether <eol> it's built at all. <eob>
Not just in Atlanta, <eob> but locally and globally, <eob> we have to understand <eob> this accountability to the people whose lives <eol> we are changing, <eob> because this is us. <eob>
We are the lives we're talking about. <eob>
These places aren't inevitable. <eob>
The places we live aren't inevitable, <eob> and if we want something different, <eol> we just need to speak up. <eob>
We have to ensure <eol> that change comes on our terms. <eob>
And to do that, <eob> we have to participate actively <eol> in the process of shaping change. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In 1987, Tina Lord found herself <eol> in quite the pickle. <eob>
See, this gold digger made <eol> sure she married sweet Cord Roberts <eob> just before he inherited millions. <eob>
But when Cord found out <eol> Tina loved his money <eob> as much as she loved him, <eob> he dumped her. <eob>
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled <eob> until they hooked up again. <eob>
So Maria hired Max Holden <eol> to romance Tina <eob> and then made sure Cord didn't find <eol> out Tina was pregnant with his baby. <eob>
So Tina, still married <eol> but thinking Cord didn't love her <eob> flew to Argentina with Max. <eob>
Cord finally figured out <eol> what was going on <eob> and rushed after them, <eol> but he was too late. <eob>
Tina had already been kidnapped, <eob> strapped to a raft <eol> and sent over a waterfall. <eob>
She and her baby were presumed dead. <eob>
Cord was sad for a bit, <eob> but then he bounced right back <eob> with a supersmart archaeologist named Kate, <eob> and they had a gorgeous wedding <eob> until Tina, seemingly back <eol> from the dead, ran into the church holding a baby. <eob> "Stop!" she screamed. <eob> "Am I too late? <eob>
Cord, I've come so far. <eob>
This is your son." <eob>
And that, ladies and gentlemen, <eob> is how the soap opera <eol> "One Life to Live" introduced a love story <eob> that lasted 25 years. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, if you've ever seen <eol> a soap opera, <eob> you know the stories and the characters <eol> can be exaggerated, larger than life, <eob> and if you're a fan, you find <eol> that exaggeration fun, <eob> and if you're not, <eob> maybe you find them melodramatic or unsophisticated. <eob>
Maybe you think watching soap operas <eob> is a waste of time, <eob> that their bigness means <eol> their lessons are small or nonexistent. <eob>
But I believe the opposite to be true. <eob>
Soap operas reflect life, just bigger. <eob>
So there are real life lessons <eol> we can learn from soap operas, <eob> and those lessons are as big <eol> and adventurous <eob> as any soap opera storyline. <eob>
Now, I've been a fan since I ran home <eol> from the bus stop in second grade <eob> desperate to catch the end of Luke and Laura's wedding, <eob> the biggest moment in "General Hospital" history. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So you can imagine <eol> how much I loved my eight years <eob> as the assistant casting director <eol> on "As the World Turns." <eob> My job was watching soap operas, <eob> reading soap opera scripts <eob> and auditioning actors <eol> to be on soap operas. <eob>
So I know my stuff. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And yes, soap operas <eob> are larger than life, <eob> drama on a grand scale, <eob> but our lives can be filled <eol> with as much intensity, <eob> and the stakes can feel <eol> just as dramatic. <eob>
We cycle through tragedy and joy <eob> just like these characters. <eob>
We cross thresholds, fight demons <eol> and find salvation unexpectedly, <eob> and we do it again and again and again, <eob> but just like soaps, <eol> we can flip the script, <eob> which means we can learn from these characters <eob> that move like bumblebees, <eob> looping and swerving through life. <eob>
And we can use those lessons <eob> to craft our own life stories. <eob>
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt <eob> and believe in our capacity <eob> for bravery, vulnerability, <eob> adaptability and resilience. <eob>
And most importantly, they show us <eob> it's never too late to change your story. <eob>
So with that, let's start <eol> with soap opera lesson one: <eob> surrender is not an option. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"All My Children" 's Erica Kane was daytime's version <eol> of Scarlett O'Hara, <eob> a hyperbolically self-important princess <eob> who deep down was scrappy and daring. <eob>
Now, in her 41 years on TV, <eol> perhaps Erica's most famous scene <eob> is her alone in the woods <eob> suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear. <eob>
She screamed at the bear, <eob> "You may not do this! <eob> Do you understand me? <eob> You may not come near me! <eob>
I am Erica Kane <eob> and you are a filthy beast!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And of course the bear left, <eob> so what that teaches us <eob> is obstacles are to be expected <eob> and we can choose to surrender <eol> or we can stand and fight. <eob>
Pandora's Tim Westergren knows <eol> this better than most. <eob>
You might even call him <eol> the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley. <eob>
Tim and his cofounders launched the company <eob> with two million dollars <eol> in funding. <eob>
They were out of cash the next year. <eob>
Now, lots of companies fold <eol> at that point, but Tim chose to fight. <eob>
He maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up <eol> six figures in personal debt <eob> and it still wasn't enough. <eob>
So every two weeks for two years <eol> on payday he stood in front of his employees <eob> and he asked them to sacrifice <eol> their salaries, <eob> and it worked. <eob>
More than 50 people <eol> deferred two million dollars, <eob> and now, more than a decade later, <eob> Pandora is worth billions. <eob>
When you believe that there is a way <eob> around or through whatever <eol> is in front of you, <eob> that <eob> surrender is not an option, <eob> you can overcome enormous obstacles. <eob>
Which brings us to soap opera lesson two: <eob> sacrifice your ego <eol> and drop the superiority complex. <eob>
Now, this is scary. <eob> It's an acknowledgment <eol> of need or fallibility. <eob>
Maybe it's even an admission <eob> that we're not as special <eol> as we might like to think. <eob>
Stephanie Forrester <eol> of "The Bold and the Beautiful" <eob> thought she was pretty darn special. <eob>
She thought she was so special, <eob> she didn't need to mix <eol> with the riffraff from the valley, <eob> and she made sure valley girl Brooke knew it. <eob>
But after nearly 25 years <eol> of epic fighting, <eob> Stephanie got sick <eol> and let Brooke in. <eob>
They made amends, <eob> archenemies became soul mates <eob> and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms, <eob> and here's our takeaway. <eob> Drop your ego. <eob> Life is not about you. <eob>
It's about us, <eob> and our ability to experience joy <eob> and love and to improve our reality <eob> comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable <eob> and we accept responsibility <eol> for our actions <eob> and our inactions, <eob> kind of like Howard Schultz, <eol> the CEO of Starbucks. <eob>
Now, after a great run as CEO, <eob> Howard stepped down in 2000, <eob> and Starbucks quickly overextended itself <eob> and stock prices fell. <eob>
Howard rejoined the team in 2008, <eob> and one of the first things he did <eob> was apologize to all 180,000 employees. <eob> He apologized. <eob> And then he asked for help, honesty, <eol> and ideas in return. <eob>
And now, Starbucks has more than doubled <eob> its net revenue since Howard came back. <eob>
So sacrifice your desire to be <eol> right or safe all the time. <eob>
It's not helping anyone, least of all you. <eob> Sacrifice your ego. <eob>
Soap opera lesson three: <eob> evolution is real. <eob>
You're not meant to be static characters. <eob>
On television, static equals boring <eol> and boring equals fired. <eob>
Characters are supposed <eol> to grow and change. <eob>
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes <eob> can make for some rough transitions, <eob> particularly when a character <eol> is played by one person yesterday <eob> and played by someone new today. <eob>
Recasting happens all the time on soaps. <eob>
Over the last 20 years, <eob> four different actors <eol> have played the same key role <eob> of Carly Benson on "General Hospital." <eob> Each new face triggered a change <eol> in the character's life and personality. <eob>
Now, there was always an essential <eol> nugget of Carly in there, <eob> but the character and the story <eol> adapted to whomever was playing her. <eob>
And here's what that means for us. <eob>
While we may not swap faces <eol> in our own lives, <eob> we can evolve too. <eob>
We can choose to draw a circle <eol> around our feet and stay in that spot, <eob> or we can open ourselves <eol> to opportunities <eob> like Carly, who went from nursing student <eol> to hotel owner, <eob> or like Julia Child. <eob>
Julia was a World War II spy, <eob> and when the war ended, <eol> she got married, moved to France, <eob> and decided to give culinary school a shot. <eob>
Julia, her books and her TV shows revolutionized <eol> the way America cooks. <eob>
We all have the power <eol> to initiate change in our lives, <eob> to evolve and adapt. <eob>
We make the choice, <eob> but sometimes life chooses for us, <eol> and we don't get a heads up. <eob>
Surprise slams us in the face. <eob>
You're flat on the ground, <eol> the air is gone, <eob> and you need resuscitation. <eob>
So thank goodness for soap <eol> opera lesson four: <eob> resurrection is possible. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"' Stefano DiMera died of a stroke, <eob> but not really, because in 1984 <eob> he died when his car plunged <eol> into the harbor, <eob> and yet he was back <eol> in 1985 with a brain tumor. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But before the tumor could kill him, <eob> Marlena shot him, and he tumbled <eol> off a catwalk to his death. <eob>
And so it went for 30 years. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Even when we saw the body, <eob> we knew better. <eob>
And here's what that means for us. <eob> He's called the Phoenix for a reason. <eob>
As long as the show is still on the air, <eob> or you're still breathing, <eob> nothing is permanent. <eob> Resurrection is possible. <eob>
Now, of course, just like life, <eob> soap operas do ultimately <eol> meet the big finale. <eob>
CBS canceled my show, "As The World Turns," <eol> in December 2009, <eob> and we shot our final episode <eob> in June 2010. <eob>
It was six months of dying <eob> and I rode that train <eol> right into the mountain. <eob>
And even though we were <eol> in the middle of a huge recession <eob> and millions of people <eol> were struggling to find work, <eob> I somehow thought everything <eol> would be OK. <eob>
So I packed up the kids <eol> and the Brooklyn apartment, <eob> and we moved in with my in-laws <eob> in Alabama. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Three months later, nothing was OK. <eob>
That was when I watched <eol> the final episode air, <eob> and I realized the show <eol> was not the only fatality. <eob>
I was one too. <eob>
I was unemployed and living on the second floor <eob> of my in-laws' home, <eob> and that's enough to make anyone <eol> feel dead inside. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I knew my story wasn't over, <eob> that it couldn't be over. <eob>
I just had to tap into everything <eol> I had ever learned about soap operas. <eob>
I had to be brave like Erica <eol> and refuse to surrender, <eob> so every day, I made a decision to fight. <eob>
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie <eob> and sacrifice my ego. <eob>
I had to ask for help a lot of times <eol> across many states. <eob>
I had to be adaptable like Carly <eob> and evolve my skills, my mindset, <eol> and my circumstances, <eob> and then I had to be resilient, <eol> like Stefano, <eob> and resurrect myself and my career <eob> like a phoenix from the ashes. <eob>
Eventually I got an interview. <eob>
After 15 years in news and entertainment, <eob> nine months of unemployment <eob> and this one interview, <eob> I had an offer for an entry level job. <eob>
I was 37 years old <eob> and I was back from the dead. <eob>
We will all experience <eol> what looks like an ending, <eob> and we can choose to make it a beginning. <eob>
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously survived that waterfall, <eob> and because I hate to leave <eol> a cliffhanger hanging, <eob> Tina and Cord did get divorced, <eob> but they got remarried three times <eol> before the show went off the air in 2012. <eob>
it's never too late to change your story. <eob> So remember, <eob> as long as there is breath in your body, <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When I was six years old, <eob> I received my gifts. <eob>
My first grade teacher <eol> had this brilliant idea. <eob>
She wanted us to experience <eol> receiving gifts <eob> but also learning the virtue <eol> of complimenting each other. <eob>
So she had all of us <eol> come to the front of the classroom, <eob> and she bought all of us gifts <eol> and stacked them in the corner. <eob>
And she said, <eob> "Why don't we just stand here <eol> and compliment each other? <eob>
If you hear your name called, <eob> go and pick up your gift and sit down." <eob> What a wonderful idea, right? <eob>
What could go wrong? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, there were 40 of us to start with, <eob> and every time I heard <eol> someone's name called, <eob> I would give out the heartiest cheer. <eob>
And then there were 20 people left, <eob> and 10 people left, <eob> and five left ... <eob> and three left. <eob>
And I was one of them. <eob>
And the compliments stopped. <eob>
Well, at that moment, I was crying. <eob>
And the teacher was freaking out. <eob>
She was like, "Hey, would anyone <eol> say anything nice about these people?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"No one? OK, why don't you <eol> go get your gift and sit down. <eob>
So behave next year — <eob> someone might say something nice about you. <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, as I'm describing this you, <eob> you probably know <eol> I remember this really well. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I don't know who felt worse that day. <eob>
Was it me or the teacher? <eob>
She must have realized <eol> that she turned a team-building event <eob> into a public roast <eol> for three six-year-olds. <eob>
And without the humor. <eob>
You know, when you see <eol> people get roasted on TV, <eob> it was funny. <eob>
There was nothing funny about that day. <eob>
So that was one version of me, <eob> and I would die to avoid <eol> being in that situation again -- <eob> to get rejected in public again. <eob>
That's one version. <eob>
Then fast-forward eight years. <eob>
Bill Gates came to my hometown -- <eob> Beijing, China -- <eob> to speak, <eob> and I saw his message. <eob>
I fell in love with that guy. <eob>
I thought, wow, <eol> I know what I want to do now. <eob> That night I wrote a letter to my family <eob> telling them: "By age 25, <eob> I will build the biggest <eol> company in the world, <eob> and that company will buy Microsoft." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I totally embraced this idea <eol> of conquering the world -- <eob> domination, right? <eob>
And I didn't make this up, <eol> I did write that letter. <eob> And here it is -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You don't have to read this through -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This is also bad handwriting, <eol> but I did highlight some key words. <eob>
You get the idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So... <eob> that was another version of me: <eob> one who will conquer the world. <eob>
Well, then two years later, <eob> I was presented with the opportunity <eol> to come to the United States. <eob> I jumped on it, <eob> because that was <eol> where Bill Gates lived, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I thought that was the start <eol> of my entrepreneur journey. <eob>
Then, fast-forward another 14 years. <eob> I was 30. <eob> Nope, I didn't build that company. <eob>
I didn't even start. <eob>
I was actually a marketing manager <eol> for a Fortune 500 company. <eob>
And I felt I was stuck; <eob> I was stagnant. <eob> Why is that? <eob> Where is that 14-year-old <eol> who wrote that letter? <eob>
It's not because he didn't try. <eob>
It's because every time <eol> I had a new idea, <eob> every time I wanted to try something new, <eob> even at work — <eob> I wanted to make a proposal, <eob> I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — <eob> I felt there was this constant battle <eob> between the 14-year-old <eol> and the six-year-old. <eob>
One wanted to conquer the world -- <eob> make a difference -- <eob> another was afraid of rejection. <eob>
And every time that six-year-old won. <eob>
And this fear even persisted <eol> after I started my own company. <eob>
I mean, I started my own company <eol> when <eob> I was 30 <eob> — <eob> if you want to be Bill Gates, <eob> you've got to start sooner or later, right? <eob>
When I was an entrepreneur, <eob> I was presented <eol> with an investment opportunity, <eob> and then I was turned down. <eob>
And that rejection hurt me. <eob>
It hurt me so bad <eol> that I wanted to quit right there. <eob>
But then I thought, <eob> hey, would Bill Gates quit <eol> after a simple investment rejection? <eob> Would any successful <eol> entrepreneur quit like that? <eob> No way. <eob> And this is where it clicked for me. <eob>
OK, I can build a better company. <eob> I can build a better <eol> team or better product, <eob> but one thing for sure: <eob> I've got to be a better leader. <eob>
I've got to be a better person. <eob>
I cannot let that six-year-old <eol> keep dictating my life anymore. <eob>
I have to put him back in his place. <eob>
So this is where I went online <eol> and looked for help. <eob>
Google was my friend. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I searched, "How do I overcome <eol> the fear of rejection?" <eob> I came up with a bunch <eol> of psychology articles <eob> about where the fear <eol> and pain are coming from. <eob>
Then I came up with a bunch <eol> of "rah-rah" inspirational articles <eob> about "Don't take it personally, <eol> just overcome it." <eob> Who doesn't know that? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But why was I still so scared? <eob>
Then I found this website by luck. <eob> It's called rejectiontherapy.com. <eob>
"Rejection Therapy" was this game <eol> invented by this Canadian entrepreneur. <eob>
His name is Jason Comely. <eob>
And basically the idea is for 30 days <eol> you go out and look for rejection, <eob> and every day get rejected at something, <eob> and then by the end, <eol> you desensitize yourself from the pain. <eob>
And I loved that idea. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I said, "You know what? <eol> I'm going to do this. <eob> And I'll feel myself <eol> getting rejected 100 days." <eob> And I came up with my own rejection ideas, <eob> and I made a video blog out of it. <eob>
And so here's what I did. <eob>
This is what the blog looked like. <eob> Day One ... <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. <eob>
So this is where I went <eol> to where I was working. <eob>
I came downstairs <eob> and I saw this big guy <eol> sitting behind a desk. <eob>
He looked like a security guard. <eob>
So I just approached him. <eob>
And I was just walking <eob> and that was the longest <eol> walk of my life -- <eob> hair on the back <eol> of my neck standing up, <eob> I was sweating and my heart was pounding. <eob>
And I got there and said, <eob> "Hey, sir, can I borrow <eol> 100 dollars from you?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he looked up, he's like, "No." <eob> "Why?" <eob>
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry." <eob> Then I turned around, <eol> and I just ran. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I felt so embarrassed. <eob> But because I filmed myself -- <eob> so that night I was watching <eol> myself getting rejected, <eob> I just saw how scared I was. <eob>
I looked like this kid <eol> in "The Sixth Sense." <eob> I saw dead people. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But then I saw this guy. <eob> You know, he wasn't that menacing. <eob>
He was a chubby, loveable guy, <eob> and he even asked me, <eob> "Why?" <eob> In fact, he invited me to explain myself. <eob>
And I could've said many things. <eob>
I could've explained, <eol> I could've negotiated. <eob>
I didn't do any of that. <eob>
All I did was run. <eob>
I felt, wow, this is like <eol> a microcosm of my life. <eob> Every time I felt the slightest rejection, <eob> I would just run as fast as I could. <eob>
And you know what? <eob>
The next day, no matter what happens, <eob> I'm not going to run. <eob> I'll stay engaged. <eob>
Day Two: Request a "burger refill." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's when I went to a burger joint, <eob> I finished lunch, <eol> and I went to the cashier and said, <eob> "Hi, can I get a burger refill?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
He was all confused, <eol> like, "What's a burger refill?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I said, "Well, it's just like <eol> a drink refill but with a burger." <eob> And he said, "Sorry, <eol> we don't do burger refill, man." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this is where rejection happened <eol> and I could have run, but I stayed. <eob>
I said, "Well, I love your burgers, <eob> I love your joint, <eob> and if you guys do a burger refill, <eob> I will love you guys more." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he said, "Well, OK, <eol> I'll tell my manager about it, <eob> and maybe we'll do it, <eol> but sorry, we can't do this today." <eob> Then I left. <eob>
And by the way, <eob> I don't think they've <eol> ever done burger refill. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I think they're still there. <eob>
But the life and death feeling <eol> I was feeling the first time <eob> was no longer there, <eob> just because I stayed engaged -- <eob> because I didn't run. <eob>
I said, "Wow, great, <eol> I'm already learning things. <eob> Great." <eob>
And then Day Three: <eol> Getting Olympic Doughnuts. <eob>
This is where my life <eol> was turned upside down. <eob>
I went to a Krispy Kreme. <eob>
It's a doughnut shop <eob> in mainly the Southeastern part <eol> of the United States. <eob>
I'm sure they have some here, too. <eob>
And I went in, <eob> I said, "Can you make me doughnuts <eol> that look like Olympic symbols? <eob>
Basically, you interlink <eol> five doughnuts together ... " <eob> I mean there's no way <eol> they could say yes, right? <eob>
The doughnut maker took me so seriously. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So she put out paper, <eob> started jotting down <eol> the colors and the rings, <eob> and is like, "How can I make this?" <eob> And then 15 minutes later, <eob> she came out with a box <eol> that looked like Olympic rings. <eob>
And I was so touched. <eob>
I just couldn't believe it. <eob>
And that video got <eol> over five million views on Youtube. <eob>
The world couldn't believe that either. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, because of that <eol> I was in newspapers, <eob> in talk shows, in everything. <eob>
And I became famous. <eob>
A lot of people <eol> started writing emails to me <eob> and saying, "What you're <eol> doing is awesome." <eob> But you know, fame and notoriety <eol> did not do anything to me. <eob>
What I really wanted to do was learn, <eob> and to change myself. <eob>
So I turned the rest <eol> of my 100 days of rejection <eob> into this playground -- <eob> into this research project. <eob>
I wanted to see what I could learn. <eob>
And then I learned a lot of things. <eob>
I discovered so many secrets. <eob>
For example, I found if I just don't run, <eob> if I got rejected, <eob> I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes," <eob> and the magic word is, "why." <eob>
So one day I went to a stranger's house, <eol> I had this flower in my hand, <eob> knocked on the door and said, <eob> "Hey, can I plant this flower <eol> in your backyard?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And he said, "No." <eob> But before he could leave I said, <eob> "Hey, can I know why?" <eob> And he said, "Well, I have this dog <eob> that would dig up <eol> anything I put in the backyard. <eob>
I don't want to waste your flower. <eob>
If you want to do this, <eol> go across the street and talk to Connie. <eob>
She loves flowers." <eob> So that's what I did. <eob>
I went across and knocked <eol> on Connie's door. <eob>
And she was so happy to see me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then half an hour later, <eob> there was this flower <eol> in Connie's backyard. <eob>
I'm sure it looks better now. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But had I left <eol> after the initial rejection, <eob> I would've thought, <eob> well, it's because <eol> the guy didn't trust me, <eob> it's because I was crazy, <eob> because I didn't dress up well, <eol> I didn't look good. <eob> It was none of those. <eob>
It was because what I offered <eol> did not fit what he wanted. <eob>
And he trusted me enough <eol> to offer me a referral, <eob> using a sales term. <eob>
I converted a referral. <eob>
Then one day -- <eob> and I also learned that I can <eol> actually say certain things <eob> and maximize my chance to get a yes. <eob>
So for example, <eol> one day I went to a Starbucks, <eob> and asked the manager, <eol> "Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?" <eob> He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?" <eob> I said, "Do you know <eol> those Walmart greeters? <eob>
You know, those people who say <eol> 'hi' to you before you walk in the store, <eob> and make sure you <eol> don't steal stuff, basically? <eob>
I want to give a Walmart experience <eol> to Starbucks customers." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Well, I'm not sure <eol> that's a good thing, actually -- <eob> Actually, I'm pretty sure <eol> it's a bad thing. <eob>
And he was like, "Oh" -- <eob> yeah, this is how he looked, <eol> his name is Eric -- <eob> and he was like, "I'm not sure." <eob> This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure." <eob> Then I ask him, "Is that weird?" <eob> He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man." <eob> But as soon as he said that, <eol> his whole demeanor changed. <eob>
It's as if he's putting <eol> all the doubt on the floor. <eob>
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this, <eob> just don't get too weird." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So for the next hour <eol> I was the Starbucks greeter. <eob>
I said "hi" to every customer <eol> that walked in, <eob> and gave them holiday cheers. <eob>
By the way, I don't know <eol> what your career trajectory is, <eob> don't be a greeter. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was really boring. <eob> But then I found I could do this <eol> because I mentioned, "Is that weird?" <eob> I mentioned the doubt that he was having. <eob>
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?", <eol> that means I wasn't weird. <eob>
That means I was actually <eol> thinking just like him, <eob> seeing this as a weird thing. <eob>
And again, and again, <eob> I learned that if I mention <eol> some doubt people might have <eob> before I ask the question, <eob> I gained their trust. <eob>
People were more likely to say yes to me. <eob>
And then I learned <eol> I could fulfill my life dream ... <eob> by asking. <eob>
You know, I came <eol> from four generations of teachers, <eob> and my grandma has always told me, <eob> "Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, <eob> but it'd be great <eol> if you became a teacher." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I wanted to be <eol> an entrepreneur, so I didn't. <eob>
But it has always been my dream <eol> to actually teach something. <eob>
So I said, "What if I just ask <eob> and teach a college class?" <eob> I lived in Austin at the time, <eob> so I went to University <eol> of Texas at Austin <eob> and knocked on professors' doors <eol> and said, "Can I teach your class?" <eob> I didn't get anywhere <eol> the first couple of times. <eob>
But <eob> because I didn't run <eob> — I kept doing it — <eob> and on the third try the professor <eol> was very impressed. <eob>
He was like, "No one <eol> has done this before." <eob> And I came in prepared <eol> with powerpoints and my lesson. <eob>
He said, "Wow, I can use this. <eob>
Why don't you come back in two months? <eob>
I'll fit you in my curriculum. <eob> "And two months later <eol> I was teaching a class. <eob>
This is me -- you probably can't see, <eol> this is a bad picture. <eob>
You know, sometimes you get <eol> rejected by lighting, you know? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But wow -- <eob> when I finished teaching that class, <eol> I walked out crying, <eob> because I thought <eob> I could fulfill my life dream <eol> just by simply asking. <eob>
I used to think I have to accomplish <eol> all these things -- <eob> have to be a great entrepreneur, <eol> or get a PhD to teach -- <eob> but no, I just asked, <eob> and I could teach. <eob>
And in that picture, <eol> which you can't see, <eob> I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. <eob> Why? Because in my research I found <eol> that people who really change the world, <eob> who change the way we live <eol> and the way we think, <eob> are the people who were met <eol> with initial and often violent rejections. <eob>
People like Martin Luther King, Jr., <eob> like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, <eob> or even Jesus Christ. <eob>
These people did not <eol> let rejection define them. <eob>
They let their own reaction <eol> after rejection define themselves. <eob>
And they embraced rejection. <eob>
And we don't have to be those people <eol> to learn about rejection, <eob> and in my case, <eob> rejection was my curse, <eob> was my boogeyman. <eob>
It has bothered me my whole life <eol> because I was running away from it. <eob>
Then I started embracing it. <eob>
I turned that into <eol> the biggest gift in my life. <eob>
I started teaching people <eol> how to turn rejections into opportunities. <eob>
I use my blog, I use my talk, <eob> I use the book I just published, <eob> and I'm even building technology to help <eol> people overcome their fear of rejection. <eob>
When you get rejected in life, <eob> when you are facing the next obstacle <eob> or next failure, <eob> consider the possibilities. <eob> Don't run. <eob> If you just embrace them, <eob> they might become your gifts as well. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Our lives depend <eob> on a world we can't see. <eob>
Think about your week so far. <eob>
Have you watched TV, used GPS, <eob> checked the weather or even ate a meal? <eob>
These many things <eol> that enable our daily lives <eob> rely either directly or indirectly <eob> on satellites. <eob>
And while we often take for granted <eob> the services that satellites provide us, <eob> the satellites themselves <eol> deserve our attention <eob> as they are leaving a lasting mark <eob> on the space they occupy. <eob>
People around the world <eol> rely on satellite infrastructure every day <eob> for information, entertainment <eol> and to communicate. <eob>
There's agricultural <eol> and environmental monitoring, <eob> Internet connectivity, navigation. <eob>
Satellites even play a role <eob> in the operation of our financial <eol> and energy markets. <eob>
But these satellites that we rely on <eob> day in and day out <eob> have a finite life. <eob>
They might run out of propellant, <eob> they could malfunction, <eob> or they may just naturally <eol> reach the end of their mission life. <eob>
At this point, these satellites <eol> effectively become space junk, <eob> cluttering the orbital environment. <eob>
So imagine you're driving down the highway <eol> on a beautiful, sunny day <eob> out running errands. <eob>
You've got your music cranked, <eob> your windows rolled down, <eob> with the cool breeze <eol> blowing through your hair. <eob>
Feels nice, right? <eob>
Everything is going smoothly <eob> until suddenly your car stutters <eol> and stalls <eob> right in the middle of the highway. <eob>
So now you have no choice <eol> but to abandon your car <eob> where it is on the highway. <eob>
Maybe you were lucky enough <eob> to be able to move it out of the way <eol> and into a shoulder lane <eob> so that it's out of the way <eol> of other traffic. <eob>
A couple of hours ago, <eob> your car was a useful machine <eol> that you relied on in your everyday life. <eob>
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal <eob> taking up space in a valuable <eol> transportation network. <eob>
And imagine international roadways <eol> all cluttered with broken down vehicles <eob> that are just getting in the way <eol> of other traffic. <eob>
And imagine the debris <eol> that would be strewn everywhere <eob> if a collision actually happened, <eob> thousands of smaller pieces of debris <eob> becoming new obstacles. <eob>
This is the paradigm <eol> of the satellite industry. <eob>
Satellites that are no longer working <eob> are often left to deorbit <eol> over many, many years, <eob> or only moved out of the way <eol> as a temporary solution. <eob>
And there are no <eol> international laws in space <eob> to enforce us to clean up after ourselves. <eob>
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I, <eob> was launched in 1957, <eob> and in that year, there were <eol> only a total of three launch attempts. <eob>
Decades later and dozens of countries <eol> from all around the world <eob> have launched thousands <eol> of more satellites into orbit, <eob> and the frequency of launches <eol> is only going to increase in the future, <eob> especially if you consider <eol> things like the possibility <eob> of 900-plus satellite <eol> constellations being launched. <eob>
Now, we send satellites <eol> to different orbits <eob> depending on what they're needed for. <eob>
One of the most common places <eol> we send satellites <eob> is the low Earth orbit, <eob> possibly to image the surface of Earth <eob> at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude. <eob>
Satellites there are naturally buffeted <eol> by Earth's atmosphere, <eob> so their orbits naturally decay, <eob> and they'll eventually burn up, <eob> probably within a couple of decades. <eob>
Another common place we send satellites <eob> is the geostationary orbit <eob> at about 35,000 kilometers altitude. <eob>
Satellites there remain in the same place <eol> above Earth as the Earth rotates, <eob> which enables things like communications <eol> or television broadcast, for example. <eob>
Satellites in high orbits like these <eol> could remain there for centuries. <eob>
And then there's the orbit <eol> coined "the graveyard," <eob> the ominous junk or disposal orbits, <eob> where some satellites <eol> are intentionally placed <eob> at the end of their life <eob> so that they're out of the way <eol> of common operational orbits. <eob>
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites <eol> launched since the late 1950s, <eob> only about one in seven <eol> is currently operational, <eob> and in addition to the satellites <eol> that are no longer working, <eob> there's also hundreds of thousands <eol> of marble-sized debris <eob> and millions of paint chip-sized debris <eob> that are also orbiting around the Earth. <eob>
Space debris is a major risk <eol> to space missions, <eob> but also to the satellites <eol> that we rely on each and every day. <eob>
Now, because space debris and junk <eol> has become increasingly worrisome, <eob> there have been some national <eol> and international efforts <eob> to develop technical standards <eob> to help us limit the generation <eol> of additional debris. <eob>
So for example, there are recommendations <eob> for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft <eob> to be made to deorbit in under 25 years, <eob> but that's still a really long time, <eob> especially if a satellite <eol> hasn't been working for years. <eob>
There's also mandates <eol> for those dead geostationary spacecraft <eob> to be moved into a graveyard orbit. <eob>
But neither of these guidelines <eol> is binding under international law, <eob> and the understanding is that they will be <eol> implemented through national mechanisms. <eob>
These guidelines are also not long-term, <eob> they're not proactive, <eob> nor do they address <eol> the debris that's already up there. <eob>
They're only in place <eol> to limit the future creation of debris. <eob>
Space junk is no one's responsibility. <eob>
Now, Mount Everest is actually <eol> an interesting comparison <eob> of a new approach to how <eol> we interact with our environments, <eob> as it's often given the dubious honor <eob> of being the world's highest garbage dump. <eob>
Decades after the first conquest <eol> of the world's highest peak, <eob> tons of rubbish left behind by climbers <eob> has started to raise concern, <eob> and you may have read in the news <eol> that there's speculation <eob> that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers <eob> with stricter enforcement <eol> of penalties and legal obligations. <eob>
The goal, of course, <eol> is to persuade climbers <eob> to clean up after themselves, <eob> so maybe local not-for-profits will pay <eol> climbers who bring down extra waste, <eob> or expeditions might organize <eol> voluntary cleanup trips. <eob>
And yet still many climbers feel <eob> that independent groups <eol> should police themselves. <eob>
There's no simple or easy answer, <eob> and even well-intentioned <eol> efforts at conservation <eob> often run into problems. <eob>
But that doesn't mean <eol> we shouldn't do everything in our power <eob> to protect the environments <eol> that we rely and depend on, <eob> and like Everest, the remote location <eol> and inadequate infrastructure <eob> of the orbital environment <eob> make waste disposal a challenging problem. <eob>
But we simply cannot reach new heights <eob> and create an even higher garbage dump, <eob> one that's out of this world. <eob>
The reality of space <eob> is that if a component <eol> on a satellite breaks down, <eob> there really are limited <eol> opportunities for repairs, <eob> and only at great cost. <eob>
But what if we were smarter <eol> about how we designed satellites? <eob>
What if all satellites, <eob> regardless of what country <eol> they were built in, <eob> had to be standardized in some way <eob> for recycling, servicing <eob> or active deorbiting? <eob>
What if there actually were <eol> international laws with teeth <eob> that enforced end-of-life <eol> disposal of satellites <eob> instead of moving them out of the way <eob> as a temporary solution? <eob>
Or maybe satellite manufacturers <eol> need to be charged a deposit <eob> to even launch a satellite into orbit, <eob> and that deposit would only be returned <eob> if the satellite was disposed of properly <eob> or if they cleaned up <eol> some quota of debris. <eob>
Or maybe a satellite <eol> needs to have technology on board <eob> to help accelerate deorbit. <eob>
There are some encouraging signs. <eob>
The UK's TechDemoSat-1, <eol> launched in 2014, for example, <eob> was designed for end-of-life disposal <eob> via a small drag sail. <eob>
This works for the satellite <eol> because it's small, <eob> but satellites that are higher <eol> or in larger orbits <eob> or are larger altogether, <eol> like the size of school buses, <eob> will require other disposal options. <eob>
So maybe you get into things <eol> like high-powered lasers <eob> or tugging using nets or tethers, <eob> as crazy as those sound in the short term. <eob>
And then one really cool possibility <eob> is the idea of orbital tow trucks <eol> or space mechanics. <eob>
Imagine if a robotic arm <eob> on some sort of space tow truck <eob> could fix the broken components <eol> on a satellite, <eob> making them usable again. <eob>
Or what if that very same robotic arm <eob> could refuel the propellant tank <eol> on a spacecraft <eob> that relies on chemical propulsion <eob> just like you or I would refuel <eol> the fuel tanks on our cars? <eob>
Robotic repair and maintenance <eob> could extend the lives of hundreds <eol> of satellites orbiting around the Earth. <eob>
Whatever the disposal <eol> or cleanup options we come up with, <eob> it's clearly not just a technical problem. <eob>
There's also complex space laws <eol> and politics that we have to sort out. <eob>
Simply put, we haven't found a way <eol> to use space sustainably yet. <eob>
Exploring, innovating <eol> to change the way we live and work <eob> are what we as humans do, <eob> and in space exploration, <eob> we're literally moving <eol> beyond the boundaries of Earth. <eob>
But as we push thresholds <eol> in the name of learning and innovation, <eob> we must remember that accountability <eol> for our environments never goes away. <eob>
There is without doubt congestion <eol> in the low Earth and geostationary orbits, <eob> and we cannot keep <eol> launching new satellites <eob> to replace the ones that have broken down <eob> without doing something about them first, <eob> just like we would never <eol> leave a broken down car <eob> in the middle of the highway. <eob>
Next time you use your phone, <eob> check the weather or use your GPS, <eob> think about the satellite technologies <eol> that make those activities possible. <eob>
But also think about the very impact <eob> that the satellites have <eol> on the environment surrounding Earth, <eob> and help spread the message <eol> that together we must reduce our impact. <eob>
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful <eob> and our gateway to exploration. <eob>
It's up to us to keep it that way. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Like many of us, <eob> I've had several careers in my life, <eob> and although they've been varied, <eob> my first job set the foundation <eol> for all of them. <eob>
I was a home-birth midwife <eol> throughout my 20s. <eob>
Delivering babies taught me <eol> valuable and sometimes surprising things, <eob> like how to start a car at 2am. <eob> when it's 10 degrees below zero. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or how to revive a father <eol> who's fainted at the sight of blood. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so, <eob> to make a beautiful belly button. <eob>
But those aren't the things <eol> that stuck with me or guided me <eob> when I stopped being a midwife <eol> and started other jobs. <eob>
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief <eob> that each one of us comes into this world <eol> with a unique worth. <eob>
When I looked into the face of a newborn, <eob> I caught a glimpse of that worthiness, <eob> that sense of unapologetic selfhood, <eob> that unique spark. <eob>
I use the word "soul" <eol> to describe that spark, <eob> because it's the only word in English <eol> that comes close to naming <eob> what each baby brought into the room. <eob>
Every newborn was as singular <eol> as a snowflake, <eob> a matchless mash-up of biology <eob> and ancestry and mystery. <eob>
And then that baby grows up, <eob> and in order to fit into the family, <eob> to conform to the culture, <eob> to the community, to the gender, <eob> that little one begins to cover its soul, <eob> layer by layer. <eob>
We're born this way, <eob> but -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But as we grow, a lot <eol> of things happen to us <eob> that make us ... <eob> want to hide our soulful <eol> eccentricities and authenticity. <eob>
We've all done this. <eob>
Everyone in this room is a former baby -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
with a distinctive birthright. <eob> But as adults, we spend so much <eol> of our time uncomfortable in our own skin, <eob> like we have ADD: <eol> authenticity deficit disorder. <eob>
But not those babies -- <eob> not yet. <eob>
Their message to me was: <eob> uncover your soul <eob> and look for that soul-spark <eob> in everyone else. <eob>
It's still there. <eob>
And here's what I learned <eol> from laboring women. <eob>
Their message was about staying open, <eob> even when things are painful. <eob>
A woman's cervix normally looks like this. <eob>
It's a tight little muscle <eob> at the base of the uterus. <eob>
And during labor, <eol> it has to stretch from this <eob> to this. <eob> Ouch! <eob> If you fight against that pain, <eob> you just create more pain, <eob> and you block what wants to be born. <eob>
I'll never forget the magic <eol> that would happen <eob> when a woman stopped resisting the pain <eob> and opened. <eob>
It was as if the forces <eol> of the universe took notice <eob> and sent in a wave of help. <eob>
I never forgot that message, <eob> and now, when difficult <eol> or painful things happen to me <eob> in my life or my work, <eob> of course at first I resist them, <eob> but then I remember <eol> what I learned from the mothers: <eob> stay open. <eob> Stay curious. <eob> Ask the pain what it's come to deliver. <eob>
Something new wants to be born. <eob>
And there was one more big soulful lesson, <eob> and that one I learned <eol> from Albert Einstein. <eob>
He wasn't at any of the births, <eob> but — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It was a lesson about time. <eob>
At the end of his life, <eol> Albert Einstein concluded <eob> that our normal, hamster-wheel <eol> experience of life <eob> is an illusion. <eob>
We run round and round, faster and faster, <eob> trying to get somewhere. <eob>
And all the while, <eob> underneath surface time <eol> is this whole other dimension <eob> where the past and the present <eol> and the future merge <eob> and become deep time. <eob>
And there's nowhere to get to. <eob>
Albert Einstein called <eol> this state, this dimension, <eob> "only being." <eob> And he said when he experienced it, <eob> he knew sacred awe. <eob>
When I was delivering babies, <eob> I was forced off the hamster wheel. <eob>
Sometimes I had to sit for days, <eol> hours and hours, <eob> just breathing with the parents; <eob> just being. <eob>
And I got a big dose of sacred awe. <eob>
So those are the three lessons <eol> I took with me from midwifery. <eob>
One: <eob> uncover your soul. <eob>
Two: when things get difficult <eol> or painful, try to <eob> stay open. <eob>
And three: every now and then, <eol> step off your hamster wheel <eob> into deep time. <eob>
Those lessons have served me <eol> throughout my life, <eob> but they really served me recently, <eob> when I took on the most <eol> important job of my life thus far. <eob>
Two years ago, my younger sister <eol> came out of remission <eob> from a rare blood cancer, <eob> and the only treatment left for her <eol> was a bone marrow transplant. <eob>
And against the odds, <eol> we found a match for her, <eob> who turned out to be me. <eob>
I come from a family of four girls, <eob> and when my sisters found out that <eol> I was my sister's perfect genetic match, <eob> their reaction was, "Really? You?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"A perfect match for her?" <eob> Which is pretty typical for siblings. <eob>
In a sibling society, <eol> there's lots of things. <eob> There's love and there's friendship <eol> and there's protection. <eob>
But there's also jealousy <eob> and competition <eob> and rejection and attack. <eob>
In siblinghood, that's where we start <eol> assembling many of those first layers <eob> that cover our soul. <eob>
When I discovered I was my sister's match, <eob> I went into research mode. <eob>
And I discovered that <eob> the premise of transplants <eol> is pretty straightforward. <eob>
You destroy all the bone marrow <eol> in the cancer patient <eob> with massive doses of chemotherapy, <eob> and then you replace that marrow <eob> with several million healthy <eol> marrow cells from a donor. <eob>
And then you do everything you can <eob> to make sure that those new cells <eol> engraft in the patient. <eob>
I also learned that bone marrow <eol> transplants are fraught with danger. <eob>
If my sister made it <eol> through the near-lethal chemotherapy, <eob> she still would face other challenges. <eob>
My cells <eob> might attack her body. <eob>
And her body might reject my cells. <eob>
They call this rejection or attack, <eob> and both could kill her. <eob>
Rejection. Attack. <eob> Those words had a familiar ring <eob> in the context of being siblings. <eob>
My sister and I had <eol> a long history of love, <eob> but we also had a long history <eol> of rejection and attack, <eob> from minor misunderstandings <eol> to bigger betrayals. <eob>
We didn't have <eol> the kind of the relationship <eob> where we talked about the deeper stuff; <eob> but, like many siblings and like people <eol> in all kinds of relationships, <eob> we were hesitant to tell our truths, <eob> to reveal our wounds, <eob> to admit our wrongdoings. <eob>
But when I learned about <eol> the dangers of rejection or attack, <eob> I thought, it's time to change this. <eob>
What if we left the bone marrow <eol> transplant up to the doctors, <eob> but did something that we later came <eol> to call our "soul marrow transplant?" <eob> What if we faced any pain <eol> we had caused each other, <eob> and instead of rejection or attack, <eob> could we listen? <eob> Could we forgive? <eob> Could we merge? <eob> Would that teach our cells to do the same? <eob>
To woo my skeptical sister, <eol> I turned to my parents' holy text: <eob> the New Yorker Magazine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I sent her a cartoon from its pages <eob> as a way of explaining <eol> why we should visit a therapist <eob> before having my bone marrow harvested <eol> and transplanted into her body. <eob> Here it is. <eob>
"I have never forgiven him for that thing <eol> I made up in my head." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I told my sister <eob> we had probably been doing the same thing, <eob> carting around made-up stories <eol> in our heads that kept us separate. <eob>
And I told her that after the transplant, <eob> all of the blood flowing in her veins <eob> would be my blood, <eob> made from my marrow cells, <eob> and that inside the nucleus <eol> of each of those cells <eob> is a complete set of my DNA. <eob> "I will be swimming around in you <eol> for the rest of your life," <eob> I told my slightly horrified sister. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"I think we better clean up <eol> our relationship." <eob>
A health crisis makes people <eol> do all sorts of risky things, <eob> like quitting a job <eol> or jumping out of an airplane <eob> and, in the case of my sister, <eob> saying "yes" to several therapy sessions, <eob> during which we got down to the marrow. <eob>
We looked at and released years of stories <eob> and assumptions about each other <eob> and blame and shame <eob> until all that was left was love. <eob>
People have said I was brave <eol> to undergo the bone marrow harvest, <eob> but I don't think so. <eob>
What felt brave to me <eob> was that other kind <eol> of harvest and transplant, <eob> the soul marrow transplant, <eob> getting emotionally naked <eol> with another human being, <eob> putting aside pride and defensiveness, <eob> lifting the layers <eob> and sharing with each other <eol> our vulnerable souls. <eob>
uncover your soul <eob> I called on those midwife lessons: <eob> Open to what's scary and painful. <eob> Look for the sacred awe. <eob>
Here I am with my marrow cells <eol> after the harvest. <eob>
That's they call it -- "harvest," <eob> like it's some kind of bucolic <eol> farm-to-table event -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which I can assure you it is not. <eob>
And here is my brave, brave sister <eob> receiving my cells. <eob>
After the transplant, we began to spend <eol> more and more time together. <eob>
It was as if we were little girls again. <eob>
The past and the present merged. <eob>
We entered deep time. <eob>
I left the hamster wheel of work and life <eob> to join my sister <eob> on that lonely island <eob> of illness and healing. <eob>
We spent months together -- <eob> in the isolation unit, <eob> in the hospital and in her home. <eob>
Our fast-paced society <eob> does not support or even value <eol> this kind of work. <eob>
We see it as a disruption <eol> of real life and important work. <eob>
We worry about the emotional drain <eol> and the financial cost -- <eob> and, yes, there is a financial cost. <eob>
But I was paid <eob> in the kind of currency our culture <eol> seems to have forgotten all about. <eob>
I was paid in love. <eob>
I was paid in soul. <eob>
I was paid in my sister. <eob>
My sister said the year after transplant <eol> was the best year of her life, <eob> which was surprising. <eob>
She suffered so much. <eob>
But she said life never tasted as sweet, <eob> and that because of the soul-baring <eob> and the truth-telling we had done with each other, <eob> she became more unapologetically herself <eob> with everyone. <eob>
She said things <eol> she'd always needed to say. <eob>
She did things she always wanted to do. <eob>
The same happened for me. <eob>
I became braver about being authentic <eol> with the people in my life. <eob>
I said my truths, <eob> but more important than that, <eol> I sought the truth of others. <eob>
It wasn't until <eol> the final chapter of this story <eob> that I realized just how well <eol> midwifery had trained me. <eob>
After that best year of my sister's life, <eob> the cancer came roaring back, <eob> and this time there was nothing more <eol> the doctors could do. <eob>
They gave her just <eol> a couple of months to live. <eob>
The night before my sister died, <eob> I sat by her bedside. <eob>
She was so small and thin. <eob> I could see the blood pulsing in her neck. <eob>
It was my blood, her blood, our blood. <eob>
When she died, part of me would die, too. <eob>
I tried to make sense of it all, <eob> how becoming one with each other <eob> had made us more ourselves, <eob> our soul selves, <eob> and how by facing and opening <eol> to the pain of our past, <eob> we'd finally been delivered to each other, <eob> and how by stepping out of time, <eob> we would now be connected forever. <eob>
My sister left me with so many things, <eob> and I'm going to leave you now <eol> with just one of them. <eob>
You don't have to wait <eol> for a life-or-death situation <eob> to clean up the relationships <eol> that matter to you, <eob> to offer the marrow of your soul <eob> and to seek it in another. <eob>
We can all do this. <eob>
We can be like a new kind <eol> of first responder, <eob> like the one to take <eol> the first courageous step <eob> toward the other, <eob> and to do something or try to do something <eob> other than rejection or attack. <eob>
We can do this with our siblings <eob> and our mates <eob> and our friends and our colleagues. <eob>
We can do this with the disconnection <eob> and the discord all around us. <eob>
We can do this for the soul of the world. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What is a parent? <eob>
What is a parent? <eob>
It's not an easy question. <eob> Today we have adoption, <eob> stepfamilies, <eob> surrogate mothers. <eob>
Many parents face tough questions <eob> and tough decisions. <eob>
Shall we tell our child <eol> about the sperm donation? <eob>
If so, when? <eob> What words to use? <eob> Sperm donors are often referred <eol> to as "biological fathers," <eob> but should we really <eol> be using the word "father?" <eob>
As a philosopher and social scientist, <eob> I have been studying these questions <eol> about the concept of parenthood. <eob>
But today, I will talk to you <eol> about what I learned <eob> from talking to parents and children. <eob>
I will show you that they know <eol> what matters most in a family, <eob> even though their family <eol> looks a little different. <eob>
I will show you their creative ways <eol> of dealing with tough questions. <eob>
But I will also show you <eol> the parents' uncertainties. <eob>
We interviewed couples <eob> who received fertility treatment <eol> at Ghent University Hospital, <eob> using sperm from a donor. <eob>
In this treatment timeline, <eob> you can see two points <eol> at which we conducted interviews. <eob>
We included heterosexual couples, <eob> where the man for some reason <eol> did not have good-quality sperm, <eob> and lesbian couples who obviously <eol> needed to find sperm elsewhere. <eob>
We also included children. <eob>
I wanted to know <eob> how those children define concepts <eol> like parenthood and family. <eob>
In fact, that is what I asked them, <eob> only not in that way. <eob>
I drew an apple tree instead. <eob>
This way, I could ask abstract, <eol> philosophical questions <eob> in a way that did not make them run off. <eob>
So as you can see, <eob> the apple tree is empty. <eob>
And that illustrates my research approach. <eob>
By designing techniques like this, <eob> I can bring as little meaning and content <eol> as possible to the interview, <eob> because I want to hear that from them. <eob>
I asked them: <eob> What would your family look like <eol> if it were an apple tree? <eob> And they could take a paper apple <eol> for everyone who, in their view, <eob> was a member of the family, <eob> write a name on it <eol> and hang it wherever they wanted. <eob>
And I would ask questions. <eob>
Most children started <eol> with a parent or a sibling. <eob>
One started with "Boxer," <eob> the dead dog of his grandparents. <eob>
At this point, none of the children <eol> started mentioning the donor. <eob>
So, <eob> I asked them <eob> about their birth story. <eob>
I said, "Before you were born, <eob> it was just your mom and dad, <eob> or mom and mommy. <eob>
Can you tell me how you came <eol> into the family?" <eob> And they explained. <eob>
One said, <eob> "My parents did not have good seeds, <eob> but there are friendly men out there <eol> who have spare seeds. <eob>
They bring them to the hospital, <eob> and they put them in a big jar. <eob>
My mommy went there, <eob> and she took two from the jar, <eob> one for me and one for my sister. <eob>
She put the seeds in her belly -- <eob> somehow -- <eob> and her belly grew really big, <eob> and there I was." <eob>
Hmm. <eob> So only when they started <eol> mentioning the donor, <eob> I asked questions about him, <eol> using their own words. <eob>
I said, <eob> "If this would be an apple <eol> for the friendly man with the seeds, <eob> what would you do with it?" <eob> And one boy was thinking out loud, <eob> holding the apple. <eob>
And he said, <eob> "I won't put this one <eol> up there with the others. <eob>
He's not part of my family. <eob>
But I will not put him on the ground. <eob>
That's too cold and too hard. <eob>
I think he should be in the trunk, <eob> because he made my family possible. <eob>
If he would not have done this, <eob> that would really be sad <eol> because my family would not be here, <eob> and I would not be here." <eob>
So also, parents <eol> constructed family tales -- <eob> tales to tell their children. <eob>
One couple explained their insemination <eob> by taking their children to a farm <eob> to watch a vet inseminate cows. <eob> And why not? <eob> It's their way of explaining; <eob> their do-it-yourself <eol> with family narratives. <eob> DIY. <eob> And we had another couple <eol> who made books -- <eob> a book for each child. <eob>
They were really works of art <eob> containing their thoughts and feelings <eol> throughout the treatment. <eob>
They even had the hospital <eol> parking tickets in there. <eob>
So it is DIY: <eob> finding ways, words and images <eob> to tell your family story to your child. <eob>
And these stories were highly diverse, <eob> but they all had one thing in common: <eob> it was a tale of longing for a child <eob> and a quest for that child. <eob>
It was about how special <eol> and how deeply loved their child was. <eob>
And research so far shows <eol> that these children are doing fine. <eob>
They do not have <eol> more problems than other kids. <eob>
Yet, these parents also wanted <eol> to justify their decisions <eob> through the tales they tell. <eob>
They hoped that their children <eol> would understand their reasons <eob> for making the family in this way. <eob>
Underlying was a fear <eol> that their children might disapprove <eob> and would reject the non-genetic parent. <eob>
And that fear is understandable, <eob> because we live in a very heteronormative <eob> and geneticized society -- <eob> a world that still believes <eob> that true families consist <eol> of one mom, one dad <eob> and their genetically related children. <eob>
Well. <eob> I want to tell you about a teenage boy. <eob>
He was donor-conceived <eol> but not part of our study. <eob>
One day, he had an argument <eol> with his father, <eob> and he yelled, <eob> "You're telling me what to do? <eob>
You're not even my father!" <eob> That was exactly what <eol> the parents in our study feared. <eob>
Now, the boy soon felt sorry, <eol> and they made up. <eob>
But it is the reaction of his father <eol> that is most interesting. <eob>
He said, <eob> "This outburst had nothing to do <eol> with the lack of a genetic link. <eob>
It was about puberty -- <eob> being difficult. <eob> It's what they do at that age. <eob> It will pass." <eob>
What this man shows us <eob> is that when something goes wrong, <eob> we should not immediately think <eob> it is because the family <eol> is a little different. <eob>
These things happen in all families. <eob>
And every now and then, <eob> all parents may wonder: <eob> Am I a good enough parent? <eob> These parents, too. <eob>
They, above all, wanted to do <eol> what's best for their child. <eob>
But they also sometimes wondered: <eob> Am I a real parent? <eob> And their uncertainties were present <eol> long before they even were parents. <eob>
At the start of treatment, <eob> when they first saw the counselor, <eob> they paid close attention <eol> to the counselor, <eob> because they wanted to do it right. <eob>
Even 10 years later, <eob> they still remember <eol> the advice they were given. <eob>
So when they thought about the counselor <eob> and the advice they were given, <eob> we discussed that. <eob>
And we saw one lesbian couple who said, <eob> "When our son asks us, <eob> 'Do I have a dad?' <eob> we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.' <eob> But we will say nothing more, <eol> not unless he asks, <eob> because he might not be ready for that. <eob>
The counselor said so." <eob>
Well. <eob> I don't know; that's quite different <eob> from how we respond <eol> to children's questions. <eob>
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?" <eob> We will say, "No, it comes from cows," <eob> and we will talk about the farmer, <eob> and the way the milk ends up in the shop. <eob>
We will not say, <eob> "No, milk is not made in a factory." <eob> So something strange happened here, <eob> and of course these children noticed that. <eob>
One boy said, <eob> "I asked my parents loads of questions, <eob> but they acted really weird. <eob>
So, you know, I have a friend at school, <eol> and she's made in the same way. <eob>
When I have a question, <eol> I just go and ask her." <eob> Clever guy. <eob> Problem solved. <eob> But his parents did not notice, <eob> and it certainly was not <eol> what they had in mind, <eob> nor what the counselor had in mind <eob> when they were saying how important <eol> it is to be an open-communication family. <eob>
And that's the strange thing about advice. <eob>
When we offer people pills, <eol> we gather evidence first. <eob>
We do tests, <eob> we do follow-up studies. <eob>
We want to know, and rightly so, <eol> what this pill is doing <eob> and how it affects people's lives. <eob> And advice? <eob> It is not enough for advice, <eob> or for professionals to give advice <eol> that is theoretically sound, <eob> or well-meant. <eob>
It should be advice <eol> that there is evidence for -- <eob> evidence that it actually <eol> improves patients' lives. <eob>
So the philosopher in me <eol> would now like to offer you a paradox: <eob> I advise you to stop following advice. <eob> But, yes. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I will not end here with what went wrong; <eob> I would not be doing justice <eol> to the warmth we found in those families. <eob>
Remember the books <eol> and the trip to the farmer? <eob>
When parents do things that work for them, <eob> they do brilliant things. <eob>
What I want you to remember <eol> as members of families, <eob> in no matter what form or shape, <eob> is that what families need <eol> are warm relationships. <eob>
And we do not need to be <eol> professionals to create those. <eob>
Most of us do just fine, <eob> although it may be hard work, <eob> and from time to time, <eol> we can do with some advice. <eob>
In that case, <eob> bear in mind three things. <eob>
Work with advice <eol> that works for your family. <eob>
Remember -- you're the expert, <eol> because you live your family life. <eob>
And finally, <eob> believe in your abilities <eol> and your creativity, <eob> because you can do it yourself. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I was a new mother <eob> and a young rabbi <eob> in the spring of 2004 <eob> and the world was in shambles. <eob> Maybe you remember. <eob> Every day, we heard devastating reports <eol> from the war in Iraq. <eob>
There were waves of terror <eol> rolling across the globe. <eob>
It seemed like humanity <eol> was spinning out of control. <eob>
I remember the night that I read <eob> about the series of coordinated bombings <eob> in the subway system in Madrid, <eob> and I got up and I walked over to the crib <eob> where my six-month-old baby girl <eob> lay sleeping sweetly, <eob> and I heard the rhythm of her breath, <eob> and I felt this sense of urgency <eol> coursing through my body. <eob>
We were living through a time <eol> of tectonic shifts in ideologies, <eob> in politics, in religion, in populations. <eob>
Everything felt so precarious. <eob>
And I remember thinking, <eob> "My God, what kind of world <eol> did we bring this child into? <eob>
And what was I as a mother <eol> and a religious leader <eob> willing to do about it? <eob>
Of course, I knew it was clear <eob> that religion would be <eol> a principle battlefield <eob> in this rapidly changing landscape, <eob> and it was already clear <eob> that religion was a significant <eol> part of the problem. <eob>
The question for me was, <eob> could religion <eol> also be part of the solution? <eob>
Now, throughout history, <eob> people have committed <eol> horrible crimes and atrocities <eob> in the name of religion. <eob>
And as we entered the 21st century, <eob> it was very clear that religious extremism <eol> was once again on the rise. <eob>
Our studies now show <eob> that over the course <eol> of the past 15, 20 years, <eob> hostilities and religion-related violence <eob> have been on the increase <eol> all over the world. <eob>
But we don't even need <eol> the studies to prove it, <eob> because I ask you, <eol> how many of us are surprised today <eob> when we hear the stories <eol> of a bombing or a shooting, <eob> when we later find out <eol> that the last word that was uttered <eob> before the trigger is pulled <eol> or the bomb is detonated <eob> is the name of God? <eob>
It barely raises an eyebrow today <eob> when we learn that yet another person <eob> has decided to show his love of God <eob> by taking the lives of God's children. <eob>
In America, religious extremism <eob> looks like a white, <eol> antiabortion Christian extremist <eob> walking into Planned Parenthood <eol> in Colorado Springs <eob> and murdering three people. <eob>
It also looks like a couple <eob> inspired by the Islamic State <eob> walking into an office party <eol> in San Bernardino and killing 14. <eob>
And even when religion-related extremism <eol> does not lead to violence, <eob> it is still used <eol> as a political wedge issue, <eob> cynically leading people <eol> to justify the subordination of women, <eob> the stigmatization of LGBT people, <eob> racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. <eob>
This ought to concern deeply <eob> those of us who care <eol> about the future of religion <eob> and the future of faith. <eob>
We need to call this what it is: <eob> a great failure of religion. <eob>
But the thing is, this isn't even the only <eol> challenge that religion faces today. <eob>
At the very same time <eob> that we need religion <eol> to be a strong force against extremism, <eob> it is suffering <eol> from a second pernicious trend, <eob> what I call religious routine-ism. <eob>
This is when our institutions <eol> and our leaders <eob> are stuck in a paradigm <eol> that is rote and perfunctory, <eob> devoid of life, devoid of vision <eob> and devoid of soul. <eob>
Let me explain what I mean like this. <eob>
One of the great blessings <eol> of being a rabbi <eob> is standing under the chuppah, under the wedding <eol> canopy, with a couple, <eob> and helping them proclaim publicly <eob> and make holy the love <eol> that they found for one another. <eob>
I want to ask you now, though, <eob> to think maybe from your own experience <eob> or maybe just imagine it <eob> about the difference <eol> between the intensity of the experience <eob> under the wedding canopy, <eob> and maybe the experience <eol> of the sixth or seventh anniversary. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And if you're lucky enough <eol> to make it 16 or 17 years, <eob> if you're like most people, <eol> you probably wake up in the morning <eob> realizing that you forgot to make <eol> a reservation at your favorite restaurant <eob> and you forgot so much as a card, <eob> and then you just hope and pray <eol> that your partner also forgot. <eob>
Well, religious ritual and rites <eob> were essentially designed <eol> to serve the function of the anniversary, <eob> to be a container in which <eol> we would hold on to the remnants <eob> of that sacred, revelatory encounter <eob> that birthed the religion <eol> in the first place. <eob>
The problem is that after a few centuries, <eob> the date remains on the calendar, <eob> but the love affair is long dead. <eob>
That's when we find ourselves <eol> in endless, mindless repetitions <eob> of words that don't mean anything to us, <eob> rising and being seated <eol> because someone has asked us to, <eob> holding onto jealously guarded doctrine <eob> that's completely and wildly out of step <eol> with our contemporary reality, <eob> engaging in perfunctory practice <eob> simply because that's the way <eol> things have always been done. <eob>
Religion is waning in the United States. <eob>
Across the board, <eol> churches and synagogues and mosques <eob> are all complaining <eob> about how hard it is to maintain relevance <eob> for a generation of young people <eol> who seem completely uninterested, <eob> not only in the institutions <eol> that stand at the heart of our traditions <eob> but even in religion itself. <eob>
And what they need to understand <eob> is that there is today <eol> a generation of people <eob> who are as disgusted by the violence <eol> of religious extremism <eob> as they are turned off <eob> by the lifelessness <eol> of religious routine-ism. <eob>
Of course there is <eol> a bright spot to this story. <eob>
Given the crisis of these two <eol> concurrent trends in religious life, <eob> about 12 or 13 years ago, <eol> I set out to try to determine <eob> if there was any way <eob> that I could reclaim the heart <eol> of my own Jewish tradition, <eob> to help make it meaningful <eol> and purposeful again <eob> in a world on fire. <eob>
I started to wonder, <eob> what if we could harness <eol> some of the great minds of our generation <eob> and think in a bold and robust <eol> and imaginative way again <eob> about what the next iteration <eol> of religious life would look like? <eob>
Now, we had no money, <eol> no space, no game plan, <eob> but we did have email. <eob>
So my friend Melissa and I <eol> sat down and we wrote an email <eob> which we sent out <eol> to a few friends and colleagues. <eob>
It basically said this: <eob> "Before you bail on religion, <eob> why don't we come together <eol> this Friday night <eob> and see what we might make <eol> of our own Jewish inheritance?" <eob>
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up. <eob> It turned out 135 people came. <eob>
They were cynics and seekers, <eob> atheists and rabbis. <eob>
Many people said that night <eol> that it was the first time <eob> that they had a meaningful religious <eol> experience in their entire lives. <eob>
And so I set out to do the only <eol> rational thing <eob> that someone would do <eol> in such a circumstance: <eob> I quit my job and tried to build <eol> this audacious dream, <eob> a reinvented, rethought religious life <eob> which we called "IKAR," <eob> which means "the essence" <eol> or "the heart of the matter." <eob>
Now, IKAR is not alone <eob> out there in the religious <eol> landscape today. <eob>
There are Jewish and Christian <eol> and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders, <eob> many of them women, by the way, <eob> who have set out to reclaim <eol> the heart of our traditions, <eob> who firmly believe that now is the time <eol> for religion to be part of the solution. <eob>
We are going back <eol> into our sacred traditions <eob> and recognizing that all of our traditions <eob> contain the raw material <eol> to justify violence and extremism, <eob> and also contain the raw material <eol> to justify compassion, <eob> coexistence and kindness -- <eob> that when others choose to read our texts <eol> as directives for hate and vengeance, <eob> we can choose to read those same texts <eob> as directives for love <eol> and for forgiveness. <eob>
I have found now <eob> in communities as varied <eol> as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts <eob> to a woman's mosque, <eob> to black churches <eol> in New York and in North Carolina, <eob> to a holy bus loaded with nuns <eob> that traverses this country <eol> with a message of justice and peace, <eob> that there is a shared religious ethos <eob> that is now emerging in the form <eol> of revitalized religion in this country. <eob>
And while the theologies <eol> and the practices vary very much <eob> between these independent communities, <eob> what we can see are some common, <eol> consistent threads between them. <eob>
I'm going to share with you <eol> four of those commitments now. <eob>
The first is wakefulness. <eob> We live in a time today <eob> in which we have unprecedented access <eob> to information about every global tragedy <eob> that happens on every corner <eol> of this Earth. <eob>
Within 12 hours, 20 million people <eob> saw that image <eol> of Aylan Kurdi's little body <eob> washed up on the Turkish shore. <eob>
We all saw this picture. <eob>
We saw this picture <eol> of a five-year-old child <eob> pulled out of the rubble <eol> of his building in Aleppo. <eob>
And once we see these images, <eob> we are called to a certain kind of action. <eob>
My tradition tells a story <eol> of a traveler who is walking down a road <eob> when he sees a beautiful house on fire, <eob> and he says, "How can it be <eol> that something so beautiful would burn, <eob> and nobody seems to even care?" <eob> So too we learn that our world is on fire, <eob> and it is our job to keep our hearts <eol> and our eyes open, <eob> and to recognize <eol> that it's our responsibility <eob> to help put out the flames. <eob>
This is extremely difficult to do. <eob>
Psychologists tell us that the more <eol> we learn about what's broken in our world, <eob> the less likely we are to do anything. <eob>
It's called psychic numbing. <eob>
We just shut down at a certain point. <eob>
Well, somewhere along the way, <eol> our religious leaders forgot <eob> that it's our job <eol> to make people uncomfortable. <eob>
It's our job to wake people up, <eob> to pull them out of their apathy <eob> and into the anguish, <eob> and to insist that we do <eol> what we don't want to do <eob> and see what we do not want to see. <eob>
Because we know <eol> that social change only happens -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
when we are awake enough <eol> to see that the house is on fire. <eob>
The second principle is hope, <eob> and I want to say this about hope. <eob>
Hope is not naive, <eob> and hope is not an opiate. <eob>
Hope may be the single <eol> greatest act of defiance <eob> against a politics of pessimism <eob> and against a culture of despair. <eob>
Because what hope does for us <eob> is it lifts us out of the container <eob> that holds us and constrains us <eol> from the outside, <eob> and says, "You can dream <eol> and think expansively again. <eob>
That they cannot control in you." <eob>
I saw hope made manifest <eol> in an African-American church <eob> in the South Side of Chicago this summer, <eob> where I brought my little girl, <eob> who is now 13 <eob> and a few inches taller than me, <eob> to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach. <eob>
That summer, there had already been <eol> 3,000 people shot <eob> between January and July in Chicago. <eob>
We went into that church <eol> and heard Rev. Moss preach, <eob> and after he did, <eob> this choir of gorgeous women, <eol> 100 women strong, <eob> stood up and began to sing. <eob> "I need you. You need me. <eob> I love you. I need you to survive." <eob> And I realized in that moment <eob> that this is what religion <eol> is supposed to be about. <eob>
It's supposed to be about <eol> giving people back a sense of purpose, <eob> a sense of hope, <eob> a sense that they and their dreams <eol> fundamentally matter in this world <eob> that tells them <eol> that they don't matter at all. <eob>
The third principle <eol> is the principle of mightiness. <eob>
There's a rabbinic tradition <eol> that we are to walk around <eob> with two slips of paper in our pockets. <eob>
One says, "I am but dust and ashes." <eob> It's not all about me. <eob>
I can't control everything, <eol> and I cannot do this on my own. <eob>
The other slip of paper says, <eol> "For my sake the world was created." <eob> Which is to say it's true <eol> that I can't do everything, <eob> but I can surely do something. <eob> I can forgive. <eob> I can love. <eob> I can show up. <eob> I can protest. <eob> I can be a part of this conversation. <eob>
We even now have a religious ritual, <eob> a posture, <eob> that holds the paradox <eol> between powerlessness and power. <eob>
In the Jewish community, <eob> the only time of year <eol> that we prostrate fully to the ground <eob> is during the high holy days. <eob>
It's a sign of total submission. <eob>
Now in our community, <eol> when we get up off the ground, <eob> we stand with our hands <eol> raised to the heavens, <eob> and we say, "I am strong, <eol> I am mighty, and I am worthy. <eob>
I can't do everything, <eol> but I can do something." <eob>
In a world that conspires <eol> to make us believe that we are invisible <eob> and that we are impotent, <eob> religious communities and religious ritual <eob> can remind us that for whatever <eol> amount of time we have here on this Earth, <eob> whatever gifts and blessings <eol> we were given, <eob> whatever resources we have, <eob> we can and we must use them <eob> to try to make the world <eol> a little bit more just <eob> and a little bit more loving. <eob>
The fourth and final <eol> is interconnectedness. <eob>
A few years ago, there was a man <eol> walking on the beach in Alaska, <eob> when he came across a soccer ball <eob> that had some Japanese <eol> letters written on it. <eob>
He took a picture of it <eol> and posted it up on social media, <eob> and a Japanese teenager contacted him. <eob>
He had lost everything in the tsunami <eol> that devastated his country, <eob> but he was able <eol> to retrieve that soccer ball <eob> after it had floated <eol> all the way across the Pacific. <eob>
How small our world has become. <eob>
It's so hard for us to remember <eol> how interconnected we all are <eob> as human beings. <eob>
And yet, we know <eob> that it is systems of oppression <eob> that benefit the most <eol> from the lie of radical individualism. <eob>
Let me tell you how this works. <eob>
I'm not supposed to care <eob> when black youth are harassed by police, <eob> because my white-looking Jewish kids <eob> probably won't ever get pulled over <eol> for the crime of driving while black. <eob>
Well, not so, because <eol> this is also my problem. <eob> And guess what? <eol> Transphobia and Islamophobia <eob> and racism of all forms, <eol> those are also all of our problems. <eob>
And so too is anti-Semitism <eol> all of our problems. <eob>
Because Emma Lazarus was right. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Emma Lazarus was right <eol> when she said until all of us are free, <eob> we are none of us free. <eob> We are all in this together. <eob>
And now somewhere at the intersection <eol> of these four trends, <eob> of wakefulness and hope <eol> and mightiness and interconnectedness, <eob> there is a burgeoning, multifaith <eol> justice movement in this country <eob> that is staking a claim on a countertrend, <eob> saying that religion can and must be <eol> a force for good in the world. <eob>
Our hearts hurt from <eol> the failed religion of extremism, <eob> and we deserve more <eol> than the failed religion of routine-ism. <eob>
It is time for religious leaders <eol> and religious communities <eob> to take the lead in the spiritual <eol> and cultural shift <eob> that this country and the world <eol> so desperately needs -- <eob> a shift toward love, <eob> toward justice, toward equality <eol> and toward dignity for all. <eob>
I believe that our children <eol> deserve no less than that. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Science. <eob> The very word for many of you conjures <eol> unhappy memories of boredom <eob> in high school biology or physics class. <eob>
But let me assure that what you did there <eob> had very little to do with science. <eob>
That was really the "what" of science. <eob>
It was the history <eol> of what other people had discovered. <eob>
What I'm most interested in as a scientist <eob> is the "how" of science. <eob>
Because science is knowledge in process. <eob>
We make an observation, <eol> guess an explanation for that observation, <eob> and then make a prediction <eol> that we can test <eob> with an experiment <eol> or other observation. <eob>
A couple of examples. <eob> First of all, people noticed <eol> that the Earth was below, the sky above, <eob> and both the Sun and the Moon <eol> seemed to go around them. <eob>
Their guessed explanation <eob> was that the Earth must be <eol> the center of the universe. <eob>
The prediction: everything <eol> should circle around the Earth. <eob>
This was first really tested <eob> when Galileo got his hands <eol> on one of the first telescopes, <eob> and as he gazed into the night sky, <eob> what he found there was a planet, Jupiter, <eob> with four moons circling around it. <eob>
He then used those moons <eol> to follow the path of Jupiter <eob> and found that Jupiter <eol> also was not going around the Earth <eob> but around the Sun. <eob>
So the prediction test failed. <eob>
And this led to <eol> the discarding of the theory <eob> that the Earth was the center <eol> of the universe. <eob>
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton <eol> noticed that things fall to the Earth. <eob>
The guessed explanation was gravity, <eob> the prediction that everything <eol> should fall to the Earth. <eob>
But of course, not everything <eol> does fall to the Earth. <eob>
So did we discard gravity? <eob> No. We revised the theory and said, <eol> gravity pulls things to the Earth <eob> unless there is an equal <eol> and opposite force in the other direction. <eob>
This led us to learn something new. <eob>
We began to pay more attention <eol> to the bird and the bird's wings, <eob> and just think of all the discoveries <eob> that have flown <eol> from that line of thinking. <eob>
So the test failures, <eol> the exceptions, the outliers <eob> teach us what we don't know <eol> and lead us to something new. <eob>
This is how science moves forward. <eob>
This is how science learns. <eob>
Sometimes in the media, <eol> and even more rarely, <eob> but sometimes even scientists will say <eob> that something or other <eol> has been scientifically proven. <eob>
But I hope that you understand <eol> that science never proves anything <eob> definitively forever. <eob>
Hopefully science remains curious enough <eob> to look for <eob> and humble enough to recognize <eob> when we have found <eob> the next outlier, <eob> the next exception, <eob> which, like Jupiter's moons, <eob> teaches us what we don't actually know. <eob>
We're going to change gears <eol> here for a second. <eob>
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine, <eob> means a lot of different things <eol> to different people, <eob> but most of our <eol> public discourse on medicine <eob> really turns it into <eol> an engineering problem. <eob>
We have the hallways of Congress, <eob> and the boardrooms of insurance companies <eol> that try to figure out how to pay for it. <eob>
The ethicists and epidemiologists <eob> try to figure out <eol> how best to distribute medicine, <eob> and the hospitals and physicians <eol> are absolutely obsessed <eob> with their protocols and checklists, <eob> trying to figure out <eol> how best to safely apply medicine. <eob>
These are all good things. <eob>
However, they also all assume <eob> at some level <eob> that the textbook of medicine is closed. <eob>
We start to measure <eol> the quality of our health care <eob> by how quickly we can access it. <eob>
It doesn't surprise me <eol> that in this climate, <eob> many of our institutions <eol> for the provision of health care <eob> start to look a heck of a lot <eol> like Jiffy Lube. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The only problem is that <eol> when I graduated from medical school, <eob> I didn't get one of those <eol> little doohickeys <eob> that your mechanic <eol> has to plug into your car <eob> and find out exactly what's wrong with it, <eob> because the textbook of medicine <eob> is not closed. <eob> Medicine is science. <eob> Medicine is knowledge in process. <eob>
We make an observation, <eob> we guess an explanation <eol> of that observation, <eob> and then we make a prediction <eol> that we can test. <eob>
Now, the testing ground <eol> of most predictions in medicine <eob> is populations. <eob>
And you may remember <eol> from those boring days in biology class <eob> that populations tend to distribute <eob> around a mean <eob> as a Gaussian or a normal curve. <eob>
Therefore, in medicine, <eob> after we make a prediction <eol> from a guessed explanation, <eob> we test it in a population. <eob>
That means that what we know in medicine, <eob> our knowledge and our know-how, <eob> comes from populations <eob> but extends only as far <eob> as <eob> the next outlier, <eob> the next exception, <eob> which, like Jupiter's moons, <eob> will teach us what we <eol> don't actually know. <eob>
Now, I am a surgeon <eob> who looks after patients with sarcoma. <eob>
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer. <eob>
It's the cancer of flesh and bones. <eob>
And I would tell you that every one <eol> of my patients is an outlier, <eob> is an exception. <eob>
There is no surgery I have ever performed <eol> for a sarcoma patient <eob> that has ever been guided <eol> by a randomized controlled clinical trial, <eob> what we consider the best kind <eol> of population-based evidence in medicine. <eob>
People talk about thinking <eol> outside the box, <eob> but we don't even have a box in sarcoma. <eob>
What we do have as we take <eol> a bath in the uncertainty <eob> and unknowns and exceptions <eol> and outliers that surround us in sarcoma <eob> is easy access to what I think <eol> are those two most important values <eob> for any science: <eob> humility and curiosity. <eob>
Because if I am humble and curious, <eob> when a patient asks me a question, <eob> and I don't know the answer, <eob> I'll ask a colleague <eob> who may have a similar <eol> albeit distinct patient with sarcoma. <eob>
We'll even establish <eol> international collaborations. <eob>
Those patients will start <eol> to talk to each other through chat rooms <eob> and support groups. <eob>
It's through this kind <eol> of humbly curious communication <eob> that we begin to try and learn new things. <eob>
As an example, this is a patient of mine <eob> who had a cancer near his knee. <eob>
Because of humbly curious communication <eob> in international collaborations, <eob> we have learned that we can repurpose <eol> the ankle to serve as the knee <eob> when we have to remove the knee <eol> with the cancer. <eob>
He can then wear a prosthetic <eol> and run and jump and play. <eob>
This opportunity was available to him <eob> because of international collaborations. <eob>
It was desirable to him <eob> because he had contacted other patients <eol> who had experienced it. <eob>
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine <eob> teach us what we don't know, <eol> but also lead us to new thinking. <eob>
Now, very importantly, <eob> all the new thinking that outliers <eol> and exceptions lead us to in medicine <eob> does not only apply <eol> to the outliers and exceptions. <eob>
It is not that we only learn <eol> from sarcoma patients <eob> ways to manage sarcoma patients. <eob>
Sometimes, the outliers <eob> and the exceptions <eob> teach us things that matter quite a lot <eol> to the general population. <eob>
Like a tree standing outside a forest, <eob> the outliers <eob> and the exceptions <eob> draw our attention <eob> and lead us into a much greater sense <eol> of perhaps what a tree is. <eob>
We often talk about <eol> losing the forests for the trees, <eob> but one also loses a tree <eob> within a forest. <eob>
But the tree that stands out by itself <eob> makes those relationships <eol> that define a tree, <eob> the relationships between trunk and roots and branches, <eob> much more apparent. <eob>
Even if that tree is crooked <eob> or even if that tree <eol> has very unusual relationships <eob> between trunk and roots and branches, <eob> it nonetheless draws our attention <eob> and allows us to make observations <eob> that we can then test <eol> in the general population. <eob>
I told you that sarcomas are rare. <eob>
They make up about one percent <eol> of all cancers. <eob>
You also probably know that cancer <eol> is considered a genetic disease. <eob>
By genetic disease we mean <eol> that cancer is caused by oncogenes <eob> that are turned on in cancer <eob> and tumor suppressor genes <eol> that are turned off to cause cancer. <eob>
You might think <eol> that we learned about oncogenes <eob> and tumor suppressor genes <eol> from common cancers <eob> like breast cancer and prostate cancer <eob> and lung cancer, <eob> but you'd be wrong. <eob>
We learned about oncogenes <eol> and tumor suppressor genes <eob> for the first time <eob> in that itty-bitty little one percent <eol> of cancers called sarcoma. <eob>
In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize <eob> for realizing that chickens <eob> had a transmissible form of sarcoma. <eob>
Thirty years later, Harold Varmus <eol> and Mike Bishop discovered <eob> what that transmissible element was. <eob>
It was a virus <eob> carrying a gene, <eob> the src oncogene. <eob>
Now, I will not tell you that src <eol> is the most important oncogene. <eob>
I will not tell you <eob> that src is the most frequently <eol> turned on oncogene in all of cancer. <eob>
But it was the first oncogene. <eob>
The exception, the outlier <eob> drew our attention and led us to something <eob> that taught us very important things <eol> about the rest of biology. <eob>
Now, TP53 is the most important <eol> tumor suppressor gene. <eob>
It is the most frequently turned off <eol> tumor suppressor gene <eob> in almost every kind of cancer. <eob>
But we didn't learn about it <eol> from common cancers. <eob> We learned about it <eol> when doctors Li and Fraumeni <eob> were looking at families, <eob> and they realized that these families <eob> had way too many sarcomas. <eob>
I told you that sarcoma is rare. <eob>
Remember that a one <eol> in a million diagnosis, <eob> if it happens twice in one family, <eob> is way too common in that family. <eob>
The very fact that these are rare <eob> draws our attention <eob> and leads us to new kinds of thinking. <eob>
Now, many of you may say, <eob> and may rightly say, <eob> that yeah, Kevin, that's great, <eob> but you're not talking <eol> about a bird's wing. <eob> You're not talking about moons <eol> floating around some planet Jupiter. <eob>
This is a person. <eob> This outlier, this exception, <eol> may lead to the advancement of science, <eob> but this is a person. <eob>
And all I can say <eob> is that I know that all too well. <eob>
I have conversations with these patients <eol> with rare and deadly diseases. <eob>
I write about these conversations. <eob> These conversations are terribly fraught. <eob>
They're fraught with horrible phrases <eob> like "I have bad news" <eol> or "There's nothing more we can do." <eob> Sometimes these conversations <eol> turn on a single word: <eob> "terminal." <eob>
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable. <eob>
Where the blanks are in medicine <eob> can be just as important <eob> as the words that we use <eol> in these conversations. <eob>
What are the unknowns? <eob>
What are the experiments <eol> that are being done? <eob>
Do this little exercise with me. <eob>
Up there on the screen, <eol> you see this phrase, "no where." <eob> Notice where the blank is. <eob>
If we move that blank one space over <eob> "no where" <eob> becomes "now here," <eob> the exact opposite meaning, <eob> just by shifting the blank one space over. <eob>
I'll never forget the night <eob> that I walked into <eol> one of my patients' rooms. <eob>
I had been operating long that day <eob> but I still wanted to come and see him. <eob>
He was a boy I had diagnosed <eol> with a bone cancer a few days before. <eob>
He and his mother had been meeting <eol> with the chemotherapy doctors <eob> earlier that day, <eob> and he had been admitted <eol> to the hospital to begin chemotherapy. <eob>
It was almost midnight <eol> when I got to his room. <eob>
He was asleep, but I found his mother <eob> reading by flashlight <eob> next to his bed. <eob>
She came out in the hall <eol> to chat with me for a few minutes. <eob>
It turned out that <eol> what she had been reading <eob> was the protocol <eol> that the chemotherapy doctors <eob> had given her that day. <eob>
She had memorized it. <eob>
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me <eob> that we don't always win <eob> with this type of cancer, <eob> but I've been studying this protocol, <eol> and I think I can do it. <eob>
I think I can comply <eol> with these very difficult treatments. <eob> I'm going to quit my job. <eol> I'm going to move in with my parents. <eob>
I'm going to keep my baby safe." <eob> I didn't tell her. <eob>
I didn't stop to correct her thinking. <eob>
She was trusting in a protocol <eob> that even if complied with, <eob> wouldn't necessarily save her son. <eob>
I didn't tell her. <eob>
I didn't fill in that blank. <eob>
But a year and a half later <eob> her boy nonetheless died of his cancer. <eob>
Should I have told her? <eob>
Now, many of you may say, <eob> "So what? <eob>
I don't have sarcoma. <eob>
No one in my family has sarcoma. <eob>
And this is all fine and well, <eob> but it probably doesn't <eol> matter in my life." <eob> And you're probably right. <eob>
Sarcoma may not matter <eol> a whole lot in your life. <eob>
But where the blanks are in medicine <eob> does matter in your life. <eob>
I didn't tell you one dirty little secret. <eob>
I told you that in medicine, <eol> we test predictions in populations, <eob> but I didn't tell you, <eob> and so often medicine never tells you <eob> that every time an individual <eob> encounters medicine, <eob> even if that individual is firmly <eol> embedded in the general population, <eob> neither the individual <eol> nor the physician knows <eob> where in that population <eol> the individual will land. <eob>
Therefore, every encounter with medicine <eob> is an experiment. <eob>
You will be a subject <eob> in an experiment. <eob>
And the outcome will be either <eol> a better or a worse result for you. <eob>
As long as medicine works well, <eob> we're fine with fast service, <eob> bravado, brimmingly <eol> confident conversations. <eob>
But when things don't work well, <eob> sometimes we want something different. <eob>
A colleague of mine <eol> removed a tumor from a patient's limb. <eob>
He was concerned about this tumor. <eob>
In our physician conferences, <eol> he talked about his concern <eob> that this was a type of tumor <eob> that had a high risk <eol> for coming back in the same limb. <eob>
But his conversations with the patient <eob> were exactly what a patient might want: <eob> brimming with confidence. <eob>
He said, "I got it all <eol> and you're good to go." <eob> She and her husband were thrilled. <eob>
They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner, <eol> opened a bottle of champagne. <eob>
The only problem was a few weeks later, <eob> she started to notice <eol> another nodule in the same area. <eob>
It turned out he hadn't gotten it all, <eol> and she wasn't good to go. <eob>
But what happened at this juncture <eol> absolutely fascinates me. <eob>
My colleague came to me and said, <eob> "Kevin, would you mind <eol> looking after this patient for me?" <eob> I said, "Why, you know the right thing <eol> to do as well as I do. <eob>
You haven't done anything wrong." <eob> He said, "Please, just look <eol> after this patient for me." <eob> He was embarrassed -- <eob> not by what he had done, <eob> but by the conversation that he had had, <eob> by the overconfidence. <eob>
So I performed <eol> a much more invasive surgery <eob> and had a very different conversation <eol> with the patient afterwards. <eob>
I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all <eob> and you're most likely good to go, <eob> but this is the experiment <eol> that we're doing. <eob>
This is what you're going to watch for. <eob>
This is what I'm going to watch for. <eob>
And we're going to work together <eol> to find out if this surgery will work <eob> to get rid of your cancer." <eob> I can guarantee you, she and her husband <eob> did not crack another bottle of champagne <eol> after talking to me. <eob>
But she was now a scientist, <eob> not only a subject in her experiment. <eob>
And so I encourage you <eob> to seek <eob> humility and curiosity <eob> in your physicians. <eob>
Almost 20 billion times each year, <eob> a person walks into a doctor's office, <eob> and that person becomes a patient. <eob>
You or someone you love <eol> will be that patient sometime very soon. <eob>
How will you talk to your doctors? <eob> What will you tell them? <eob> What will they tell you? <eob> They cannot tell you <eob> what they do not know, <eob> but they can tell you when they don't know <eob> if only you'll ask. <eob>
So please, join the conversation. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm going to talk a little bit <eol> about where technology's going. <eob>
And often technology comes to us, <eob> we're surprised by what it brings. <eob>
But there's actually <eol> a large aspect of technology <eob> that's much more predictable, <eob> and that's because technological systems <eol> of all sorts have leanings, <eob> they have urgencies, <eob> they have tendencies. <eob>
And those tendencies are derived <eol> from the very nature of the physics, <eob> chemistry of wires <eol> and switches and electrons, <eob> and they will make reoccurring <eol> patterns again and again. <eob>
And so those patterns produce <eol> these tendencies, these leanings. <eob>
You can almost think of it <eol> as sort of like gravity. <eob>
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley. <eob>
The actual path of a raindrop <eol> as it goes down the valley <eob> is unpredictable. <eob>
We cannot see where it's going, <eob> but the general direction <eol> is very inevitable: <eob> it's downward. <eob>
And so these baked-in <eol> tendencies and urgencies <eob> in technological systems <eob> give us a sense of where things <eol> are going at the large form. <eob>
So in a large sense, <eob> I would say that telephones <eol> were inevitable, <eob> but the iPhone was not. <eob>
The Internet was inevitable, <eob> but Twitter was not. <eob>
So we have many ongoing <eol> tendencies right now, <eob> and I think one of the chief among them <eob> is this tendency to make things <eol> smarter and smarter. <eob>
I call it cognifying -- cognification -- <eob> also known as artificial <eol> intelligence, or AI. <eob>
And I think that's going to be one <eol> of the most influential developments <eob> and trends and directions and drives <eol> in our society in the next 20 years. <eob>
So, of course, it's already here. <eob>
We already have AI, <eob> and often it works in the background, <eob> in the back offices of hospitals, <eob> where it's used to diagnose X-rays <eol> better than a human doctor. <eob>
It's in legal offices, <eob> where it's used to go <eol> through legal evidence <eob> better than a human paralawyer. <eob>
It's used to fly the plane <eol> that you came here with. <eob>
Human pilots only flew it <eol> seven to eight minutes, <eob> the rest of the time the AI was driving. <eob>
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon, <eob> it's in the background, <eol> making those recommendations. <eob>
That's what we have today. <eob>
And we have an example, of course, <eol> in a more front-facing aspect of it, <eob> with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat <eol> the world's greatest Go champion. <eob>
But it's more than that. <eob>
If you play a video game, <eol> you're playing against an AI. <eob>
But recently, Google taught their AI <eob> to actually learn how to play video games. <eob>
Again, teaching video games <eol> was already done, <eob> but learning how to play <eol> a video game is another step. <eob>
That's artificial smartness. <eob>
What we're doing is taking <eol> this artificial smartness <eob> and we're making it smarter and smarter. <eob>
There are three aspects <eol> to this general trend <eob> that I think are underappreciated; <eob> I think we would understand <eol> AI a lot better <eob> if we understood these three things. <eob>
I think these things also would <eol> help us embrace AI, <eob> because it's only by embracing it <eol> that we actually can steer it. <eob>
We can actually steer the specifics <eol> by embracing the larger trend. <eob>
So let me talk about <eol> those three different aspects. <eob>
The first one is: our own intelligence <eol> has a very poor understanding <eob> of what intelligence is. <eob>
We tend to think of intelligence <eol> as a single dimension, <eob> that it's kind of like a note <eol> that gets louder and louder. <eob>
It starts like with IQ measurement. <eob>
It starts with maybe a simple <eol> low IQ in a rat or mouse, <eob> and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee, <eob> and then maybe there's more <eol> in a stupid person, <eob> and then maybe an average <eol> person like myself, <eob> and then maybe a genius. <eob>
And this single IQ intelligence <eol> is getting greater and greater. <eob>
That's completely wrong. <eob>
That's not what intelligence is -- <eol> not what human intelligence is, anyway. <eob>
It's much more like a symphony <eol> of different notes, <eob> and each of these notes is played <eol> on a different instrument of cognition. <eob>
There are many types <eol> of intelligences in our own minds. <eob> We have deductive reasoning, <eob> we have emotional intelligence, <eob> we have spatial intelligence; <eob> we have maybe 100 different types <eol> that are all grouped together, <eob> and they vary in different strengths <eol> with different people. <eob>
And of course, if we go to animals, <eol> they also have another basket -- <eob> another symphony of different <eol> kinds of intelligences, <eob> and sometimes those same instruments <eol> are the same that we have. <eob>
They can think in the same way, <eol> but they may have a different arrangement, <eob> and maybe they're higher <eol> in some cases than humans, <eob> like long-term memory in a squirrel <eol> is actually phenomenal, <eob> so it can remember <eol> where it buried its nuts. <eob>
But in other cases they may be lower. <eob>
When we go to make machines, <eob> we're going to engineer <eol> them in the same way, <eob> where we'll make some of those types <eol> of smartness much greater than ours, <eob> and many of them won't be <eol> anywhere near ours, <eob> because they're not needed. <eob>
So we're going to take these things, <eob> these artificial clusters, <eob> and we'll be adding more varieties <eol> of artificial cognition to our AIs. <eob>
We're going to make them <eol> very, very specific. <eob>
So your calculator is smarter <eol> than you are in arithmetic already; <eob> your GPS is smarter <eol> than you are in spatial navigation; <eob> Google, Bing, are smarter <eol> than you are in long-term memory. <eob>
And we're going to take, again, <eol> these kinds of different types of thinking <eob> and we'll put them into, like, a car. <eob>
The reason why we want to put them <eol> in a car so the car drives, <eob> is because it's not driving like a human. <eob>
It's not thinking like us. <eob>
That's the whole feature of it. <eob> It's not being distracted, <eob> it's not worrying about whether <eol> it left the stove on, <eob> or whether it should have <eol> majored in finance. <eob> It's just driving. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just driving, OK? <eob> And we actually might even <eol> come to advertise these <eob> as "consciousness-free." <eob> They're without consciousness, <eob> they're not concerned about those things, <eob> they're not distracted. <eob>
So in general, what we're trying to do <eob> is make as many different <eol> types of thinking as we can. <eob>
We're going to populate the space <eob> of all the different possible types, <eol> or species, of thinking. <eob>
And there actually may be some problems <eob> that are so difficult <eol> in business and science <eob> that our own type of human thinking <eol> may not be able to solve them alone. <eob>
We may need a two-step program, <eob> which is to invent new kinds of thinking <eob> that we can work alongside of to solve <eol> these really large problems, <eob> say, like dark energy or quantum gravity. <eob>
What we're doing <eol> is making alien intelligences. <eob>
You might even think of this <eol> as, sort of, artificial aliens <eob> in some senses. <eob>
And they're going to help <eol> us think different, <eob> because thinking different <eol> is the engine of creation <eob> and wealth and new economy. <eob>
The second aspect of this <eol> is that we are going to use AI <eob> to basically make a second <eol> Industrial Revolution. <eob>
The first Industrial Revolution <eol> was based on the fact <eob> that we invented something <eol> I would call artificial power. <eob>
Previous to that, <eob> during the Agricultural Revolution, <eob> everything that was made <eol> had to be made with human muscle <eob> or animal power. <eob>
That was the only way <eol> to get anything done. <eob>
The great innovation during <eol> the Industrial Revolution was, <eob> we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels, <eob> to make this artificial power <eol> that we could use <eob> to do anything we wanted to do. <eob>
So today when you drive down the highway, <eob> you are, with a flick of the switch, <eol> commanding 250 horses -- <eob> 250 horsepower -- <eob> which we can use to build skyscrapers, <eol> to build cities, to build roads, <eob> to make factories that would churn out <eol> lines of chairs or refrigerators <eob> way beyond our own power. <eob>
And that artificial power can also <eol> be distributed on wires on a grid <eob> to every home, factory, farmstead, <eob> and anybody could buy <eol> that artificial power, <eob> just by plugging something in. <eob>
So this was a source <eol> of innovation as well, <eob> because a farmer could take <eol> a manual hand pump, <eob> and they could add this artificial <eol> power, this electricity, <eob> and he'd have an electric pump. <eob>
And you multiply that by thousands <eol> or tens of thousands of times, <eob> and that formula was what brought us <eol> the Industrial Revolution. <eob>
All the things that we see, <eol> all this progress that we now enjoy, <eob> has come from the fact <eol> that we've done that. <eob>
We're going to do <eol> the same thing now with AI. <eob>
We're going to distribute that on a grid, <eob> and now you can take that electric pump. <eob> You can add some artificial intelligence, <eob> and now you have a smart pump. <eob>
And that, multiplied by a million times, <eob> is going to be this <eol> second Industrial Revolution. <eob>
So now the car is going down the highway, <eob> it's 250 horsepower, <eol> but in addition, it's 250 minds. <eob>
That's the auto-driven car. <eob> It's like a new commodity; <eob> it's a new utility. <eob>
The AI is going to flow <eol> across the grid -- the cloud -- <eob> in the same way electricity did. <eob>
So everything that we had electrified, <eob> we're now going to cognify. <eob>
And I would suggest, then, <eob> that the formula <eol> for the next 10,000 start-ups <eob> is very, very simple, <eob> which is to take x and add AI. <eob>
That is the formula, <eol> that's what we're going to be doing. <eob>
And that is the way <eol> in which we're going to make <eob> this second Industrial Revolution. <eob>
And by the way -- right now, this minute, <eob> you can log on to Google <eob> and you can purchase <eol> AI for six cents, 100 hits. <eob>
That's available right now. <eob>
So the third aspect of this <eob> is that when we take this AI <eol> and embody it, <eob> we get robots. <eob>
And robots are going to be bots, <eob> they're going to be doing many <eol> of the tasks that we have already done. <eob>
A job is just a bunch of tasks, <eob> so they're going to redefine our jobs <eob> because they're going to do <eol> some of those tasks. <eob>
But they're also going <eol> to create whole new categories, <eob> a whole new slew of tasks <eob> that we didn't know we wanted to do before. <eob>
They're going to actually <eol> engender new kinds of jobs, <eob> new kinds of tasks that we want done, <eob> just as automation made up <eol> a whole bunch of new things <eob> that we didn't know we needed before, <eob> and now we can't live without them. <eob>
So they're going to produce <eol> even more jobs than they take away, <eob> but it's important that a lot of the tasks <eol> that we're going to give them <eob> are tasks that can be defined <eol> in terms of efficiency or productivity. <eob>
If you can specify a task, <eob> either manual or conceptual, <eob> that can be specified in terms <eol> of efficiency or productivity, <eob> that goes to the bots. <eob>
Productivity is for robots. <eob>
What we're really good at <eol> is basically wasting time. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We're really good at things <eol> that are inefficient. <eob>
Science is inherently inefficient. <eob>
It runs on that fact that you have <eol> one failure after another. <eob> It runs on the fact that you make tests <eol> and experiments that don't work, <eob> otherwise you're not learning. <eob>
It runs on the fact <eob> that there is not <eol> a lot of efficiency in it. <eob>
Innovation by definition is inefficient, <eob> because you make prototypes, <eob> because you try stuff that fails, <eol> that doesn't work. <eob>
Exploration is inherently inefficiency. <eob>
Art is not efficient. <eob>
Human relationships are not efficient. <eob>
These are all the kinds of things <eol> we're going to gravitate to, <eob> because they're not efficient. <eob>
Efficiency is for robots. <eob>
We're also going to learn <eol> that we're going to work with these AIs <eob> because they think differently than us. <eob>
When Deep Blue beat <eol> the world's best chess champion, <eob> people thought it was the end of chess. <eob>
But actually, it turns out that today, <eol> the best chess champion in the world <eob> is not an AI. <eob>
And it's not a human. <eob>
It's the team of a human and an AI. <eob>
The best medical diagnostician <eol> is not a doctor, it's not an AI, <eob> it's the team. <eob>
We're going to be working with these AIs, <eob> and I think you'll be paid in the future <eob> by how well you work with these bots. <eob>
So that's the third thing, <eol> is that they're different, <eob> they're utility <eob> and they are going to be something <eol> we work with rather than against. <eob>
We're working with these <eol> rather than against them. <eob>
So, the future: <eob> Where does that take us? <eob>
I think that 25 years from now, <eol> they'll look back <eob> and look at our understanding <eol> of AI and say, <eob> "You didn't have AI. <eob>
In fact, you didn't even have <eol> the Internet yet, <eob> compared to what we're going <eol> to have 25 years from now. <eob> "There are no AI experts right now. <eob>
There's a lot of money going to it, <eob> there are billions of dollars <eol> being spent on it; <eob> it's a huge business, <eob> but there are no experts, compared <eol> to what we'll know 20 years from now. <eob>
So we are just at the beginning <eol> of the beginning, <eob> we're in the first hour of all this. <eob>
We're in the first hour of the Internet. <eob> We're in the first hour of what's coming. <eob>
The most popular AI product <eol> in 20 years from now, <eob> that everybody uses, <eob> has not been invented yet. <eob>
That means that you're not late. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, my journey began in the Bronx, New York, <eob> in a one-bedroom apartment, <eob> with my two sisters <eol> and immigrant mother. <eob>
I loved our neighborhood. <eob> It was lively. <eob> There was all this merengue blasting, <eob> neighbors socializing on building stoops <eob> and animated conversations <eol> over domino playing. <eob>
It was home, <eob> and it was sweet. <eob>
But it wasn't simple. <eob>
In fact, everyone at school knew <eol> the block where we lived, <eob> because it was where people came <eol> to buy weed and other drugs. <eob>
And with drug-dealing comes conflict, <eob> so we often went to sleep <eol> to the sound of gunshots. <eob>
I spent much of my childhood worried, <eob> worried about our safety. <eob>
And so did our mother. <eob>
She worried that the violence <eol> we witnessed would overtake our lives; <eob> that our poverty meant <eob> that the neighbors with whom we lived <eol> and shared space <eob> would harm us. <eob>
Our entire life was in the Bronx, <eob> but my mother's anxiety <eol> spurred her into action, <eob> and soon we were driving <eol> so fast to Connecticut -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
to boarding school campuses, <eol> with full scholarships in tow. <eob>
Man, don't underestimate <eol> the power of a mother <eob> determined to keep her children safe. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
At boarding school, <eob> for the first time, <eob> I was able to sleep without worry. <eob>
I could leave my dorm room unlocked, <eob> walk barefoot in the grass, <eob> and look up to see a night sky full of stars. <eob> Happy novelties. <eob>
But there were other novelties as well. <eob>
Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong. <eob>
I learned that I didn't speak <eol> the right way, <eob> and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking, <eob> my teachers gave me frequent lessons, in public, <eob> on the appropriate way <eol> to enunciate certain words. <eob>
A teacher once instructed me in the hallway: <eob> "Aaaaaas-king." <eob> She said this loudly. <eob> "Dena, it's not 'axing,' like you're running <eol> around with an axe. <eob>
That's silly." <eob>
Now at this point, you can imagine <eol> the snickers of my classmates, <eob> but she continued: <eob> "Think about breaking the word into 'ass' and 'king,' <eob> and then put the two together <eol> to say it correctly -- <eob> 'Asking.'" <eob>
There were some other moments <eol> that reminded me that I didn't belong. <eob>
Once, I walked into a classmate's dorm room, <eob> and I watched her watch her <eol> valuables around me. <eob>
Like, why would she do that? <eol> I thought to myself. <eob> And then there was the time <eob> when another classmate walked <eol> into my dorm room, <eob> and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying <eol> hair grease to my scalp. <eob>
There is emotional damage done <eol> when young people can't be themselves, <eob> when they are forced to edit <eol> who they are in order to be acceptable. <eob>
It's a kind of violence. <eob>
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential success story. <eob>
I attended boarding school <eol> and college in New England, <eob> studied abroad in Chile <eob> and returned to the Bronx <eol> to be a middle school teacher. <eob>
I received a Truman Scholarship, <eob> a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship. <eob>
And I could list more. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I won't. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I earned my doctorate <eol> at Columbia University. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And then I landed a job at Yale. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I am proud of everything <eol> that I've been able to accomplish <eob> on my journey thus far. <eob>
I have eternal imposter syndrome. <eob>
Either I've been invited <eol> because I'm a token, <eob> which really isn't about me, <eob> but rather, about a box someone <eol> needed to check off. <eob>
Or, I am exceptional, <eob> which means I've had to leave <eol> the people I love behind. <eob>
It's the price that I and so many others <eol> pay for learning while black. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I police myself all the time. <eob>
Are my pants too tight? <eob>
Should I wear my hair up or in a fro? <eob>
Should I speak up for myself, <eob> or will the power of my words <eol> be reduced to: "She's angry?" <eob>
Why did I have to leave the Bronx <eob> to gain access to a better education? <eob>
And why, in the process <eol> of getting that better education, <eob> did I have to endure the trauma <eol> of erasing what made me, me -- <eob> a black girl from the Bronx, <eol> raised by an Antiguan mother? <eob>
So when I think about our current <eol> education reform initiatives, <eob> I can't help asking: <eob> What are our students of color <eol> learning about themselves? <eob>
Three -- three decades of research reveal <eob> that students of color <eol> are suspended and expelled <eob> at a rate three times greater <eol> than white students, <eob> and are punished in harsher ways <eol> for the same infractions. <eob>
They also learn this through the absence <eol> of their lives and narratives <eob> in the curricula. <eob>
The Cooperative Children's Book Center <eol> did a review of nearly 4,000 books <eob> and found that only three percent <eol> were about African-Americans. <eob>
And they further learn this <eob> through the lack of teachers <eol> that look like them. <eob>
An analysis of data <eob> from the National Center for Education Statistics <eob> found that 45 percent of our nation's pre-K <eol> to high school students <eob> were people of color, <eob> while only 17 percent of our teachers are. <eob>
Our youth of color pay <eol> a profound price <eob> when their schooling sends them the message <eob> that they must be controlled, <eob> that they must leave <eol> their identities at home <eob> in order to be successful. <eob>
Every child deserves an education <eob> that guarantees the safety to learn <eob> in the comfort of one's own skin. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
It is possible to create emotionally <eol> and physically safe classrooms <eob> where students also thrive academically. <eob>
I know, because I did it in my classroom <eob> when I returned to teach in the Bronx. <eob>
So what did that look like? <eob>
I centered my instruction <eob> on the lives, histories <eol> and identities of my students. <eob>
And I did all of this <eol> because I wanted my students to know <eob> that everyone around them <eol> was supporting them <eob> to be their best self. <eob>
So while I could not control <eol> the instability of their homes, <eob> the uncertainty of their next meal, <eob> or the loud neighbors <eol> that kept them from sleep, <eob> I provided them with a loving classroom <eob> that made them feel proud of who they are, <eob> that made them know that they mattered. <eob>
You know, <eob> every time I hear <eol> or say the word "asking," <eob> I am in high school again. <eob>
I am thinking about "ass" and "king" <eob> and putting the two together <eol> so that I speak in a way <eob> where someone in power <eol> will want to listen. <eob>
There is a better way, <eob> one that doesn't force kids <eol> of color into a double bind; <eob> a way for them <eol> to preserve their ties <eob> to their families, homes and communities; <eob> a way that teaches them <eol> to trust their instincts <eob> and to have faith in their own creative genius. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
When people find out <eol> I write about time management, <eob> they assume two things. <eob>
One is that I'm always on time, <eob> and I'm not. <eob>
I have four small children, <eob> and I would like to blame them <eol> for my occasional tardiness, <eob> but sometimes it's just not their fault. <eob>
I was once late to my own speech <eol> on time management. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We all had to just take a moment <eol> together and savor that irony. <eob>
The second thing they assume <eol> is that I have lots of tips and tricks <eob> for saving bits of time here and there. <eob>
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines <eol> that are doing a story along these lines, <eob> generally on how to help <eol> their readers find an extra hour in the day. <eob>
And the idea is that we'll shave bits <eol> of time off everyday activities, <eob> add it up, <eob> and we'll have time <eol> for the good stuff. <eob>
I question the entire premise of this piece, <eol> but I'm always interested <eob> in hearing what they've come up <eol> with before they call me. <eob>
Some of my favorites: <eob> doing errands where you <eol> only have to make right-hand turns -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Being extremely judicious in microwave usage: <eob> it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package, <eob> we're totally getting in <eol> on the bottom side of that. <eob>
And my personal favorite, <eol> which makes sense on some level, <eob> is to DVR your favorite shows so you <eol> can fast-forward through the commercials. <eob>
That way, you save eight minutes <eol> every half hour, <eob> so in the course of two hours <eol> of watching TV, <eob> you find 32 minutes to exercise. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Which is true. <eob> You know another way to find <eol> 32 minutes to exercise? <eob>
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time <eol> here and there, <eob> add it up, <eob> we will finally get to everything <eol> we want to do. <eob>
But after studying <eol> how successful people spend their time <eob> and looking at their schedules <eol> hour by hour, <eob> I think this idea has it completely backward. <eob>
We don't build the lives <eol> we want by saving time. <eob>
We build the lives we want, <eob> and then time saves itself. <eob>
Here's what I mean. <eob> I recently did a time diary project <eob> looking at 1,001 days in the lives <eol> of extremely busy women. <eob>
They had demanding jobs, <eol> sometimes their own businesses, <eob> kids to care for, maybe parents to care for, <eob> community commitments -- <eob> busy, busy people. <eob>
I had them keep track <eol> of their time for a week <eob> so I could add up how much they worked and slept, <eob> and I interviewed them about <eol> their strategies, for my book. <eob>
One of the women <eol> whose time log I studied <eob> goes out on a Wednesday night for something. <eob>
She comes home to find <eol> that her water heater has broken, <eob> and there is now water all over her basement. <eob>
If you've ever had anything <eol> like this happen to you, <eob> you know it is a hugely damaging, <eol> frightening, sopping mess. <eob>
So she's dealing with the immediate <eol> aftermath that night, <eob> next day she's got <eol> plumbers coming in, <eob> day after that, professional cleaning crew <eol> dealing with the ruined carpet. <eob>
All this is being recorded <eol> on her time log. <eob>
Winds up taking seven hours <eol> of her week. <eob> Seven hours. <eob> That's like finding <eol> an extra hour in the day. <eob>
But I'm sure if you had asked her <eol> at the start of the week, <eob> "Could you find <eob> seven hours <eol> to train for a triathlon?" <eob> "Could you find <eob> seven hours <eol> to mentor seven worthy people?" <eob> I'm sure she would've said <eol> what most of us would've said, <eob> which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?" <eob> Yet when she had to find <eol> seven hours <eob> because there is water all over her basement, <eob> she found seven hours. <eob>
And what this shows us is that time <eol> is highly elastic. <eob>
We cannot make more time, <eob> but time will stretch to accommodate <eol> what we choose to put into it. <eob>
And so the key to time management <eob> is treating our priorities <eob> as the equivalent <eol> of that broken water heater. <eob>
To get at this, <eob> I like to use language from one <eol> of the busiest people I ever interviewed. <eob>
By busy, I mean <eol> she was running a small business <eob> with 12 people on the payroll, <eob> she had six children in her spare time. <eob>
I was getting in touch with her <eol> to set up an interview <eob> on how she "had it all" -- that phrase. <eob>
I remember it was a Thursday morning, <eob> and she was not available <eol> to speak with me. <eob>
Of course, right? <eob>
But the reason she was unavailable <eol> to speak with me <eob> is that she was out for a hike, <eob> because it was a beautiful spring morning, <eob> and she wanted to go for a hike. <eob>
So of course this makes me <eol> even more intrigued, <eob> and when I finally do catch up with her, <eol> she explains it like this. <eob> She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do, <eob> every minute I spend, is my choice." <eob> And rather than say, <eob> "I don't have time to do x, y or z," <eob> she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z <eol> because it's not a priority." <eob> "I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority." <eob> If you think about it, that's really more accurate language. <eob>
I could tell you I don't have time <eol> to dust my blinds, <eob> but that's not true. <eob>
If you offered to pay me $100,000 <eol> to dust my blinds, <eob> I would get to it pretty quickly. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Since that is not going to happen, <eob> I can acknowledge this is not <eol> a matter of lacking time; <eob> it's that I don't want to do it. <eob>
Using this language reminds us <eol> that time is a choice. <eob>
And granted, <eob> there may be horrible consequences <eol> for making different choices, <eob> I will give you that. <eob>
But we are smart people, <eob> and certainly over the long run, <eob> we have the power to fill our lives <eob> with the things that deserve to be there. <eob>
So how do we do that? <eob> How do we treat our priorities <eob> as the equivalent <eol> of that broken water heater? <eob>
Well, first we need <eol> to figure out what they are. <eob>
I want to give you two strategies <eol> for thinking about this. <eob>
The first, on the professional side: <eob> I'm sure many people <eol> coming up to the end of the year <eob> are giving or getting annual <eol> performance reviews. <eob>
You look back over your successes <eol> over the year, <eob> your "opportunities for growth." <eob> And this serves its purpose, <eob> but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward. <eob>
So I want you to pretend <eol> it's the end of next year. <eob>
You're giving yourself a performance review, <eob> and it has been an absolutely amazing year <eol> for you professionally. <eob>
What three to five things did you do <eol> that made it so amazing? <eob>
So you can write next year's <eol> performance review now. <eob>
And you can do this <eol> for your personal life, too. <eob>
I'm sure many of you, like me, <eol> come December, <eob> get cards that contain these folded up <eol> sheets of colored paper, <eob> on which is written what is known <eol> as the family holiday letter. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really, <eob> going on about how amazing everyone <eol> in the household is, <eob> or even more scintillating, <eob> how busy everyone <eol> in the household is. <eob>
But these letters serve a purpose, <eob> which is that they tell <eol> your friends and family <eob> what you did in your personal life <eol> that mattered to you over the year. <eob>
So this year's kind of done, <eob> but I want you to pretend <eol> it's the end of next year, <eob> and it has been an absolutely amazing year <eob> for you and the people you care about. <eob>
What three to five things did you do <eol> that made it so amazing? <eob>
So you can write next year's <eol> family holiday letter now. <eob>
Don't send it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Please, don't send it. <eob>
But you can write it. <eob>
And now, between the performance review <eol> and the family holiday letter, <eob> we have a list of six to ten goals <eol> we can work on in the next year. <eob>
And now we need to break <eol> these down into doable steps. <eob>
So maybe you want <eol> to write a family history. <eob>
First, you can read <eol> some other family histories, <eob> get a sense for the style. <eob>
Then maybe think about the questions <eol> you want to ask your relatives, <eob> set up appointments to interview them. <eob>
Or maybe you want to run a 5K. <eob>
So you need to find a race and sign up, <eol> figure out a training plan, <eob> and dig those shoes out <eol> of the back of the closet. <eob>
And then — this is key — <eob> we treat our priorities <eob> as the equivalent <eol> of that broken water heater, <eob> by putting them into our schedules first. <eob>
We do this by thinking through our weeks <eol> before we are in them. <eob>
I find a really good time <eol> to do this is Friday afternoons. <eob>
Friday afternoon is what an <eol> economist might call <eob> a "low opportunity cost" time. <eob>
Most of us are not sitting <eol> there on Friday afternoons saying, <eob> "I am excited to make progress <eob> toward my personal and professional priorities <eob> right now." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But we are willing to think <eol> about what those should be. <eob>
So take a little bit <eol> of time Friday afternoon, <eob> make yourself a three-category priority <eol> list: career, relationships, self. <eob>
Making a three-category list reminds us <eob> that there should be something <eol> in all three categories. <eob>
Career, we think about; <eob> relationships, self -- <eob> not so much. <eob>
But anyway, just a short list, <eob> two to three items in each. <eob>
Then look out over the whole <eol> of the next week, <eob> and see where you can plan them in. <eob>
Where you plan them in is up to you. <eob>
I know this is going to be more complicated <eol> for some people than others. <eob>
I mean, some people's lives <eol> are just harder than others. <eob>
It is not going to be easy to find <eol> time to take that poetry class <eob> if you are caring <eol> for multiple children on your own. <eob> I get that. <eob> And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle. <eob>
But I do think that the numbers <eol> I am about to tell you are empowering. <eob>
There are 168 hours in a week. <eob>
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours. <eob>
That is a lot of time. <eob>
If you are working a full-time job, <eol> so 40 hours a week, <eob> sleeping eight hours a night, <eol> so 56 hours a week -- <eob> that leaves 72 hours for other things. <eob>
That is a lot of time. <eob>
You say you're working 50 hours a week, <eob> maybe a main job and a side hustle. <eob>
Well, that leaves 62 hours <eol> for other things. <eob>
You say you're working 60 hours. <eob>
Well, that leaves 52 hours for other things. <eob>
You say you're working more than 60 hours. <eob>
Well, are you sure? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
There was once a study comparing <eol> people's estimated work weeks <eob> with time diaries. <eob>
They found that people claiming <eol> 75-plus-hour work weeks <eob> were off by about 25 hours. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You can guess in which direction, right? <eob>
Anyway, in 168 hours a week, <eob> I think we can find time <eol> for what matters to you. <eob>
If you want to spend <eol> more time with your kids, <eob> you want to study more for a test <eol> you're taking, <eob> you want to exercise for three hours <eol> and volunteer for two, <eob> you can. <eob>
And that's even if you're working <eol> way more than full-time hours. <eob>
So we have plenty of time, which is great, <eob> because guess what? <eob>
We don't even need that much time <eol> to do amazing things. <eob>
But when most of us have bits <eol> of time, what do we do? <eob>
Pull out the phone, right? <eob> Start deleting emails. <eob> Otherwise, we're puttering around the house <eob> or watching TV. <eob>
But small moments can have great power. <eob>
You can use your bits of time <eob> for bits of joy. <eob>
Maybe it's choosing to read something <eol> wonderful on the bus <eob> on the way to work. <eob>
I know when I had a job <eol> that required two bus rides <eob> and a subway ride every morning, <eob> I used to go to the library <eol> on weekends to get stuff to read. <eob>
It made the whole experience almost, <eol> almost, enjoyable. <eob>
Breaks at work can be used <eol> for meditating or praying. <eob>
If family dinner is out because <eol> of your crazy work schedule, <eob> maybe family breakfast <eol> could be a good substitute. <eob>
It's about looking at the whole <eol> of one's time <eob> and seeing where the good stuff can go. <eob>
I truly believe this. <eob> There is time. <eob> Even if we are busy, <eob> we have time for what matters. <eob>
And when we focus on what matters, <eob> we can build the lives we want <eob> in the time we've got. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is a tuberculosis ward, <eob> and at the time this picture <eol> was taken in the late 1800s, <eob> one in seven of all people <eob> died from tuberculosis. <eob>
We had no idea what was <eol> causing this disease. <eob>
The hypothesis was actually <eob> it was your constitution <eol> that made you susceptible. <eob>
And it was a highly romanticized disease. <eob>
It was also called consumption, <eob> and it was the disorder of poets <eob> and artists and intellectuals. <eob>
And some people actually thought <eol> it gave you heightened sensitivity <eob> and conferred creative genius. <eob>
By the 1950s, <eob> we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused <eob> by a highly contagious <eol> bacterial infection, <eob> which is slightly less romantic, <eob> but that had the upside <eob> of us being able to maybe develop drugs <eol> to treat it. <eob>
So doctors had discovered <eol> a new drug, iproniazid, <eob> that they were optimistic <eol> might cure tuberculosis, <eob> and they gave it to patients, <eob> and patients were elated. <eob>
They were more social, more energetic. <eob>
One medical report actually says <eol> they were "dancing in the halls." <eob> And unfortunately, <eob> this was not necessarily <eol> because they were getting better. <eob>
A lot of them were still dying. <eob>
Another medical report describes them <eol> as being "inappropriately happy." <eob> And that is how the first <eol> antidepressant was discovered. <eob>
So accidental discovery <eol> is not uncommon in science, <eob> but it requires more than just a happy accident. <eob>
You have to be able <eol> to recognize it for discovery to occur. <eob>
As a neuroscientist, I'm going to talk <eol> to you a little bit <eob> about my firsthand experience <eob> with whatever you want to call <eol> the opposite of dumb luck -- <eob> let's call it smart luck. <eob>
But first, a bit more background. <eob>
Thankfully, since the 1950s, <eob> we've developed some other drugs <eol> and we can actually now cure tuberculosis. <eob>
And at least in the United States, <eol> though not necessarily in other countries, <eob> we have closed our sanitoriums <eob> and probably most of you are not <eol> too worried about TB. <eob>
But a lot of what was true <eol> in the early 1900s <eob> about infectious disease, <eob> we can say now about psychiatric disorders. <eob>
We are in the middle <eol> of an epidemic of mood disorders <eob> like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, <eol> or PTSD. <eob>
One in four of all adults <eol> in the United States <eob> suffers from mental illness, <eob> which means that if you haven't experienced <eol> it personally <eob> or someone in your family <eol> hasn't, <eob> it's still very likely <eol> that someone you know has, <eob> though they may not talk about it. <eob>
Depression has actually now surpassed <eob> HIV / AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war <eob> as the leading cause <eol> of disability worldwide. <eob>
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s, <eob> we don't know what causes it. <eob>
Once it's developed, it's chronic, <eob> lasts a lifetime, <eob> and there are no known cures. <eob>
The second antidepressant we discovered, <eob> also by accident, in the 1950s, <eob> from an antihistamine that <eol> was making people manic, <eob> imipramine. <eob>
And in both the case of the tuberculosis ward <eol> and the antihistamine, <eob> someone had to be able to recognize <eob> that a drug that was designed <eol> to do one thing -- <eob> treat tuberculosis <eol> or suppress allergies -- <eob> could be used to do something <eol> very different -- <eob> treat depression. <eob>
And this sort of repurposing <eol> is actually quite challenging. <eob>
When doctors first saw <eol> this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid, <eob> they didn't really recognize <eol> what they saw. <eob>
They were so used to thinking about it <eob> from the framework of being <eol> a tuberculosis drug <eob> that they actually just listed it <eob> as a side effect, <eol> an adverse side effect. <eob>
As you can see here, <eob> a lot of these patients in 1954 <eol> are experiencing severe euphoria. <eob>
And they were worried <eol> that this might somehow interfere <eob> with their recovering from tuberculosis. <eob>
So they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases <eol> of extreme TB <eob> and in patients that were highly emotionally stable, <eob> which is of course the exact opposite <eol> of how we use it as an antidepressant. <eob>
They were so used to looking at it <eol> from the perspective of this one disease, <eob> they could not see the larger implications <eol> for another disease. <eob>
And to be fair, it's not entirely <eol> their fault. <eob>
Functional fixedness is a bias <eol> that affects all of us. <eob>
It's a tendency to only be able <eol> to think of an object <eob> in terms of its traditional use or function. <eob>
And mental set is another thing. Right? <eob> That's sort of this preconceived framework <eob> with which we approach problems. <eob>
And that actually makes repurposing <eol> pretty hard for all of us, <eob> which is, I guess, why they gave <eol> a TV show to the guy who was, <eob> like, really great <eol> at repurposing. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So the effects in both the case of iproniazid and imipramine, <eob> they were so strong -- <eob> there was mania, or people <eol> dancing in the halls. <eob>
It's actually not <eol> that surprising they were caught. <eob>
But it does make you wonder <eol> what else we've missed. <eob>
So iproniazid and imipramine, <eob> they're more than just a case <eol> study in repurposing. <eob>
They have two other things in common <eol> that are really important. <eob>
One, they have terrible side effects. <eob>
That includes liver toxicity, <eob> weight gain of over 50 pounds, <eob> suicidality. <eob>
And two, they both increase <eol> levels of serotonin, <eob> which is a chemical signal in the brain, <eob> or a neurotransmitter. <eob>
And those two things together, right, <eol> one or the two, <eob> may not have been that important, <eob> but the two together meant <eol> that we had to develop safer drugs, <eob> and that serotonin seemed <eol> like a pretty good place to start. <eob>
So we developed drugs to more specifically <eol> focus on serotonin, <eob> the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, <eol> so the SSRIs, <eob> the most famous of which is Prozac. <eob>
And that was 30 years ago, <eob> and since then we have mostly just worked <eol> on optimizing those drugs. <eob>
And the SSRIs, they are better <eol> than the drugs that came before them, <eob> but they still have a lot of side effects, <eob> including weight gain, insomnia, <eob> suicidality -- <eob> and they take <eol> a really long time to work, <eob> something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients. <eob>
And that's in the patients <eol> where they do work. <eob>
There are a lot of patients <eol> where these drugs don't work. <eob>
And that means now, in 2016, <eob> we still have no cures <eol> for any mood disorders, <eob> just drugs that suppress symptoms, <eob> which is kind of the difference <eol> between taking a painkiller for an infection <eob> versus an antibiotic. <eob>
A painkiller will make you feel better, <eob> but is not going to do anything <eol> to treat that underlying disease. <eob>
And it was this flexibility in our thinking <eob> that let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine <eob> could be repurposed in this way, <eob> which led us to the serotonin hypothesis, <eob> which we then, ironically, fixated on. <eob>
This is brain signaling, serotonin, <eob> from an SSRI commercial. <eob>
In case you're not clear, <eol> this is a dramatization. <eob>
And in science, we try <eol> and remove our bias, right, <eob> by running double-blinded experiments <eob> or being statistically agnostic <eol> as to what our results will be. <eob>
But bias creeps in more insidiously <eol> in what we choose to study <eob> and how we choose to study it. <eob>
So we've focused on serotonin <eol> now for the past 30 years, <eob> often to the exclusion of other things. <eob>
We still have no cures, <eob> and what if serotonin <eol> isn't all there is to depression? <eob>
What if it's not even the key part of it? <eob>
That means no matter how much time <eob> or money or effort we put into it, <eob> it will never lead to a cure. <eob>
In the past few years, doctors have discovered <eob> probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs, <eob> Calypsol, <eob> and this drug works very quickly, <eol> within a few hours or a day, <eob> and it doesn't work on serotonin. <eob>
It works on glutamate, which is another <eol> neurotransmitter. <eob>
And it's also repurposed. <eob>
It was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery. <eob>
But unlike those other drugs, <eob> which were recognized pretty quickly, <eob> it took us 20 years <eob> to realize that Calypsol was an antidepressant, <eob> despite the fact that it's actually <eol> a better antidepressant, <eob> probably, than those other drugs. <eob>
It's actually probably because of the fact <eol> that it's a better antidepressant <eob> that it was harder for us to recognize. <eob>
There was no mania to signal its effects. <eob>
So in 2013, up at Columbia University, <eob> I was working with my colleague, <eob> Dr. Christine Ann Denny, <eob> and we were studying Calypsol <eol> as an antidepressant in mice. <eob>
And Calypsol has, like, <eol> a really short half-life, <eob> which means it's out of your body <eol> within a few hours. <eob>
And we were just piloting. <eob>
So we would give an injection to mice, <eob> and then we'd wait a week, <eob> and then we'd run another experiment <eol> to save money. <eob>
And one of the experiments I was running, <eob> we would stress the mice, <eob> and we used that as a model of depression. <eob>
And at first it kind of just looked like <eol> it didn't really work at all. <eob>
So we could have stopped there. <eob>
But I have run this model <eol> of depression for years, <eob> and the data just looked kind of weird. <eob>
It didn't really look right to me. <eob>
So I went back, <eob> and we reanalyzed it <eob> based on whether or not they had gotten <eol> that one injection of Calypsol <eob> a week beforehand. <eob>
And it looked kind of like this. <eob>
So if you look at the far left, <eob> if you put a mouse <eol> in a new space, <eob> this is the box, it's very exciting, <eob> a mouse will walk around and explore, <eob> and you can see that pink line <eol> is actually the measure of them walking. <eob>
And we also give it another <eol> mouse in a pencil cup <eob> that it can decide to interact with. <eob>
This is also a dramatization, <eol> in case that's not clear. <eob>
And a normal mouse will explore. <eob> It will be social. <eob> Check out what's going on. <eob>
If you stress a mouse <eol> in this depression model, <eob> which is the middle box, <eob> they aren't social, they don't explore. <eob>
They mostly just kind of hide <eol> in that back corner, behind a cup. <eob>
Yet the mice that had gotten <eol> that one injection of <eob> Calypsol, <eob> here on your right, <eob> they were exploring, they were social. <eob>
They looked like they had <eol> never been stressed at all, <eob> which is impossible. <eob>
So we could have just stopped there, <eob> but Christine had also used Calypsol <eol> before as anesthesia, <eob> and a few years ago she had seen <eob> that it seemed to have <eol> some weird effects on cells <eob> and some other behavior <eob> that also seemed to last long <eol> after the drug, <eob> maybe a few weeks. <eob>
So we were like, OK, <eob> maybe this is not completely impossible, <eob> but we were really skeptical. <eob>
So we did what you do in science <eol> when you're not sure, <eob> and we ran it again. <eob>
And I remember being <eol> in the animal room, <eob> moving mice from box to box to test them, <eob> and Christine was actually sitting on the floor <eol> with the computer in her lap <eob> so the mice couldn't see her, <eob> and she was analyzing <eol> the data in real time. <eob>
And I remember us yelling, <eob> which you're not supposed to do <eol> in an animal room where you're testing, <eob> because it had worked. <eob>
It seemed like these mice <eol> were protected against stress, <eob> or they were inappropriately happy, <eol> however you want to call it. <eob>
And we were really excited. <eob>
And then we were really skeptical, <eol> because it was too good to be true. <eob>
So we ran it again. <eob>
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model, <eob> and we ran it again <eob> in a physiological model, <eob> where all we did was give stress hormones. <eob>
And we had our undergrads run it. <eob>
And then we had our collaborators halfway <eol> across the world in France run it. <eob>
And every time someone ran it, <eol> they confirmed the same thing. <eob>
It seemed like this <eol> one injection of Calypsol <eob> was somehow protecting <eol> against stress for weeks. <eob>
And we only published this a year ago, <eob> but since then other labs have <eol> independently confirmed this effect. <eob>
So we don't know what causes depression, <eob> but we do know that stress is the initial trigger <eob> in 80 percent of cases, <eob> and depression and PTSD are different diseases, <eob> but this is something they share in common. <eob> Right? It is traumatic stress <eob> like active combat or natural disasters <eob> or community violence or sexual assault <eob> that causes post-traumatic stress disorder, <eob> and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder. <eob>
And this ability to experience <eol> stress and be resilient <eob> and bounce back and not develop <eol> depression or PTSD <eob> is known as stress resilience, <eob> and it varies between people. <eob>
And we have always thought of it <eol> as just sort of this passive property. <eob>
It's the absence of susceptibility factors <eob> and risk factors for these disorders. <eob>
But what if it were active? <eob>
Maybe we could enhance it, <eob> sort of akin to putting on armor. <eob>
We had accidentally discovered <eol> the first resilience-enhancing drug. <eob>
And like I said, we only gave <eol> a tiny amount of the drug, <eob> and it lasted for weeks, <eob> and that's not like anything <eol> you see with antidepressants. <eob>
But it is actually kind of similar <eol> to what you see in immune vaccines. <eob>
So in immune vaccines, <eol> you'll get your shots, <eob> and then weeks, months, years later, <eob> when you're actually exposed to bacteria, <eob> it's not the vaccine in your body <eol> that protects you. <eob>
It's your own immune system <eob> that's developed resistance <eol> and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off, <eob> and you actually never get the infection, <eob> which is very different from, say, our treatments. Right? <eob> In that case, you get the infection, <eol> you're exposed to the bacteria, <eob> you're sick, and then you take, say, an antibiotic which cures it, <eob> and those drugs are actually <eol> working to kill the bacteria. <eob>
Or similar to as I said before, <eol> with this palliative, <eob> you'll take something <eol> that will suppress the symptoms, <eob> but it won't treat the underlying infection, <eob> and you'll only feel better during the time <eol> in which you're taking it, <eob> which is why you have to keep taking it. <eob>
And in depression and PTSD -- <eob> here we have your stress exposure -- <eob> we only have palliative care. <eob>
Antidepressants <eol> only suppress symptoms, <eob> and that is why you basically <eol> have to keep taking them <eob> for the life of the disease, <eob> which is often the length <eol> of your own life. <eob>
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing <eol> drugs "paravaccines," <eob> which means vaccine-like, <eob> because it seems like they might <eol> have the potential <eob> to protect against stress <eob> and prevent mice from developing <eob> depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. <eob>
Also, not all antidepressants <eol> are also paravaccines. <eob>
We tried Prozac as well, <eob> and that had no effect. <eob>
So if this were to translate into humans, <eob> we might be able to protect people <eob> who are predictably at risk <eob> against stress-induced disorders like depression and PTSD. <eob>
So that's first responders and firefighters, <eob> refugees, prisoners and prison guards, <eob> soldiers, you name it. <eob>
And to give you a sense <eol> of the scale of these diseases, <eob> in 2010, the global burden <eol> of disease <eob> was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars, <eob> and since they are chronic, <eob> that cost is compounding and is therefore <eol> expected to rise <eob> up to six trillion dollars <eol> in just the next 15 years. <eob>
As I mentioned before, <eob> repurposing can be challenging <eol> because of our prior biases. <eob>
Calypsol has another name, <eob> ketamine, <eob> which also goes by another name, <eob> Special K, <eob> which is a club drug and drug of abuse. <eob>
It's still used across the world <eol> as an anesthetic. <eob>
It's used in children. <eol> We use it on the battlefield. <eob>
It's actually the drug of choice <eol> in a lot of developing nations, <eob> because it doesn't affect breathing. <eob>
It is on the World Health Organization <eol> list of most essential medicines. <eob>
If we had discovered ketamine <eol> as a paravaccine first, <eob> it'd be pretty easy <eol> for us to develop it, <eob> but as is, we have to compete <eol> with our functional fixedness <eob> and mental set that kind <eol> of interfere. <eob>
Fortunately, it's not the only compound <eol> we have discovered <eob> that has these prophylactic, <eol> paravaccine qualities, <eob> but all of the other drugs <eol> we've discovered, <eob> or compounds if you will, <eol> they're totally new, <eob> they have to go through the entire FDA approval process -- <eob> if they make it before they can ever <eol> be used in humans. <eob>
And that will be years. <eob>
So if we wanted something sooner, <eob> ketamine is already FDA-approved. <eob>
It's generic, it's available. <eob>
We could develop it for a fraction of the price <eol> and a fraction of the time. <eob>
But actually, beyond functional fixedness <eol> and mental set, <eob> there's a real other challenge <eol> to repurposing drugs, <eob> which is policy. <eob>
There are no incentives in place <eob> once a drug is generic and off patent <eol> and no longer exclusive <eob> to encourage pharma companies to develop them, <eob> because they don't make money. <eob>
And that's not true for just ketamine. <eol> That is true for all drugs. <eob>
Regardless, the idea itself <eol> is completely novel in psychiatry, <eob> to use drugs to prevent mental illness <eob> as opposed to just treat it. <eob>
It is possible that 20, 50, <eol> 100 years from now, <eob> we will look back now <eol> at depression and PTSD <eob> the way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums <eob> as a thing of the past. <eob>
This could be the beginning of the end <eol> of the mental health epidemic. <eob>
But as a great scientist once said, <eob> "Only a fool is sure of anything. <eob>
A wise man keeps on guessing." <eob>
Thank you, guys. <eob>
Tell your daughters of this year, <eob> how we woke needing coffee <eob> but discovered instead cadavers strewn <eol> about our morning papers, <eob> waterlogged facsimiles <eol> of our sisters, spouses, small children. <eob>
Say to your baby of this year <eol> when she asks, as she certainly should, <eob> tell her it was too late coming. <eob>
Admit even in the year we leased <eol> freedom, we didn't own it outright. <eob>
There were still laws for every way <eol> we used our privates <eob> while they pawed at the soft folds of us, <eob> grabbed with no concern <eol> for consent, <eob> no laws made for the men <eol> that enforced them. <eob>
We were trained to dodge, <eob> to wait, to cower and cover, <eob> to wait more, still, wait. <eob>
We were told to be silent. <eob>
But speak to your girls of this wartime, <eob> a year preceded by a score of the same, <eob> so as in two decades before, <eob> we wiped our eyes, <eob> laced caskets with flags, <eob> evacuated the crime scene <eol> of the club, <eob> caterwauled in the street, <eob> laid our bodies on the concrete against the outlines <eol> of our fallen, <eob> cried, "Of course we mattered," <eob> chanted for our disappeared. <eob>
The women wept this year. <eob> They did. <eob>
In the same year, we were ready. <eob>
The year we lost our inhibition <eol> and moved with courageous abandon <eob> was also the year we stared down barrels, <eob> sang of cranes in skies, ducked and parried, <eob> caught gold in hijab, <eol> collected death threats, <eob> knew ourselves as patriots, <eob> said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down and found <eol> a running mate," <eob> made road maps for infant joy, <eol> shamed nothing but fear, <eob> called ourselves fat and meant, of course, <eob> impeccable. <eob>
This year, we were women, <eob> not brides or trinkets, <eob> not an off-brand gender, <eob> not a concession, but women. <eob>
Instruct your babies. <eob> Remind them that the year <eol> has passed to be docile or small. <eob>
Some of us said for the first time <eol> that we were women, <eob> took this oath of solidarity seriously. <eob>
Some of us bore children <eol> and some of us did not, <eob> and none of us questioned <eol> whether that made us real <eob> or appropriate or true. <eob>
When she asks you of this year, <eob> your daughter, whether your offspring <eol> or heir to your triumph, <eob> from her comforted side of history <eol> teetering towards woman, <eob> she will wonder and ask voraciously, <eob> though she cannot fathom your sacrifice, <eob> she will hold your estimation <eol> of it holy, <eob> curiously probing, "Where were you? <eob> Did you fight? Were you fearful or fearsome? <eob>
What colored the walls of your regret? <eob>
What did you do for women <eol> in the year it was time? <eob>
This path you made for me <eol> which bones had to break? <eob>
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma? <eob>
And are you a hero?" <eob> She will ask the difficult questions. <eob>
She will not care <eol> about the arc of your brow, <eob> the weight of your clutch. <eob>
She will not ask of your mentions. <eob>
Your daughter, for whom you have already carried <eol> so much, wants to know <eob> what you brought, what gift, <eol> what light did you keep from extinction? <eob>
When they came for victims in the night, <eob> did you sleep through it <eol> or were you roused? <eob>
What was the cost of staying woke? <eob>
What, in the year we said time's up, <eol> what did you do with your privilege? <eob>
Did you sup on others' squalor? <eob>
Did you look away or directly <eol> into the flame? <eob>
Did you know your skill <eol> or treat it like a liability? <eob>
Were you fooled <eol> by the epithets of "nasty" or "less than"? <eob>
Did you teach with an open heart <eol> or a clenched fist? <eob> Where were you? <eob>
Tell her the truth. Make it your life. <eob> Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there <eob> with the moment drawn on my face like a dagger, <eob> and flung it back at itself, <eob> slicing space for you." <eob> Tell her the truth, how you lived <eol> in spite of crooked odds. <eob>
Tell her you were brave, <eob> and always, always in the company <eol> of courage, <eob> mostly the days when you just <eol> had yourself. <eob>
Tell her she was born as you were, <eob> as your mothers before, <eol> and the sisters beside them, <eob> in the age of legends, like always. <eob>
Tell her she was born just in time, <eob> just in time <eob> to lead. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Let me ask you all a question. <eob>
How much weapons-grade nuclear <eol> material do you think it would take <eob> to level a city the size of San Francisco? <eob>
How many of you think <eol> it would be an amount <eob> about the size of this suitcase? <eob> OK. And how about this minibus? <eob>
All right. <eob> Well actually, under <eol> the right circumstances, <eob> an amount of highly enriched uranium <eol> about the size of your morning latte <eob> would be enough to kill 100,000 people <eob> instantly. <eob>
Hundreds of thousands of others <eol> would become horribly ill, <eob> and parts of the city <eol> would be uninhabitable for years, <eob> if not for decades. <eob>
But you can forget that nuclear latte, <eob> because today's nuclear weapons <eol> are hundreds of times more powerful <eob> even than those we dropped <eol> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <eob>
And even a limited nuclear war <eol> involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons, <eob> could lead to the end <eol> of all life on the planet. <eob>
So it's really important that you know <eob> that right now we have <eol> over 15,000 nuclear weapons <eob> in the hands of nine nations. <eob>
And if you live in a city <eol> or near a military facility, <eob> one is likely pointed right at you. <eob>
In fact, if you live in any <eol> of the rural areas <eob> where nuclear weapons are stored globally, <eob> one is likely pointed at you. <eob>
About 1,800 of these weapons <eol> are on high alert, <eob> which means they can be launched <eol> within 15 minutes <eob> of a presidential command. <eob>
So I know this is a bummer of an issue, <eob> and maybe you have that -- <eol> what was it? -- psychic fatigue <eob> that we heard about a little bit earlier. <eob>
So I'm going to switch gears <eol> for just a second, <eob> and I'm going to talk <eol> about my imaginary friend, <eob> who I like to think of as Jasmine, <eob> just for a moment. <eob>
Jasmine, at the age of 25, <eob> is part of a generation that is more <eol> politically and socially engaged <eob> than anything we've seen in 50 years. <eob>
She and her friends think of themselves <eob> as change agents <eol> and leaders and activists. <eob>
I think of them as Generation Possible. <eob>
They regularly protest <eol> about the issues they care about, <eob> but nuclear weapons are not one of them, <eol> which makes sense, <eob> because Jasmine was born in 1991, <eol> at the end of the Cold War. <eob> So she didn't grow up hearing a lot <eol> about nuclear weapons. <eob>
She never had to duck and cover <eol> under her desk at school. <eob>
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter <eol> is an app in the Android store. <eob>
Nuclear weapons help win games. <eob>
And that is really a shame, <eob> because right now, we need <eol> Generation Possible <eob> to help us make some really important <eol> decisions about nuclear weapons. <eob>
For instance, will we further reduce <eol> our nuclear arsenals globally, <eob> or will we spend billions, <eob> maybe a trillion dollars, <eob> to modernize them so they last <eol> throughout the 21st century, <eob> so that by the time Jasmine is my age, <eol> she's talking to her children <eob> and maybe even her grandchildren <eob> about the threat of nuclear holocaust? <eob>
And if you're paying any attention <eol> at all to cyberthreats, <eob> or, for instance, if you've read <eol> about the Stuxnet virus <eob> or, for God's sake, if you've ever <eol> had an email account or a Yahoo account <eob> or a phone hacked, <eob> you can imagine the whole new world <eol> of hurt that could be triggered <eob> by modernization in a period <eol> of cyberwarfare. <eob>
Now, if you're paying attention to the money, <eob> a trillion dollars <eol> could go a long way <eob> to feeding and educating <eol> and employing people, <eob> all of which could reduce the threat <eol> of nuclear war to begin with. <eob> So — <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is really crucial right now, <eob> because nuclear weapons -- <eol> they're vulnerable. <eob>
We have solid evidence <eob> that terrorists are trying <eol> to get ahold of them. <eob>
Just this last spring, <eob> when four retirees <eol> and two taxi drivers were arrested <eob> in the Republic of Georgia <eob> for trying to sell nuclear materials <eol> for 200 million dollars, <eob> they demonstrated that the black market <eol> for this stuff is alive and well. <eob>
And it's really important, <eob> because there have been <eol> dozens of accidents <eob> involving nuclear weapons, <eob> and I bet most of us have never heard <eol> anything about them. <eob>
Just here in the United States, <eob> we've dropped nuclear weapons <eol> on the Carolinas twice. <eob>
In one case, one of the bombs, <eob> which fell out of an Air Force plane, <eob> didn't detonate <eob> because the nuclear core <eol> was stored somewhere else on the plane. <eob>
In another case, the weapon <eol> did arm when it hit the ground, <eob> and five of the switches designed <eol> to keep it from detonating failed. <eob> Luckily, the sixth one didn't. <eob>
But if that's not enough <eol> to get your attention, <eob> there was the 1995 Black Brant incident. <eob> That's when Russian radar technicians saw <eob> what they thought was a US nuclear missile <eob> streaking towards Russian airspace. <eob>
It later turned out to be <eol> a Norwegian rocket <eob> collecting data about the northern lights. <eob>
But at that time, <eob> Russian President Boris Yeltsin <eol> came within five minutes <eob> of launching a full-scale <eol> retaliatory nuclear attack <eob> against the United States. <eob>
So, most of the world's nuclear nations <eob> have committed to getting rid <eol> of these weapons of mass destruction. <eob>
But consider this: <eob> the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation <eol> of Nuclear Weapons, <eob> which is the most widely adopted <eol> arms control treaty in history <eob> with 190 signatories, <eob> sets no specific date by which <eol> the world's nuclear-armed nations <eob> will get rid of their nuclear weapons. <eob>
Now, when John F. Kennedy <eol> sent a man to the moon <eob> and decided to bring him back, <eol> or decided to do both those things, <eob> he didn't say, "Hey, whenever <eol> you guys get to it." <eob> He gave us a deadline. <eob>
He gave us a challenge <eob> that would have been incredible <eol> just a few years earlier. <eob>
And with that challenge, <eob> he inspired scientists and marketers, <eob> astronauts and schoolteachers. <eob>
He gave us a vision. <eob>
But along with that vision, <eob> he also tried to give us -- and most <eol> people don't know this, either -- <eob> he tried to give us a partner <eob> in the form of our fiercest <eol> Cold War rival, the Soviet Union. <eob>
Because part of Kennedy's vision <eol> for the Apollo program <eob> was that it be a cooperation, <eol> not a competition, with the Soviets. <eob>
And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev, <eol> the Soviet Premier, agreed. <eob>
But before that cooperation <eol> could be realized, <eob> Kennedy was assassinated, <eob> and that part of the vision was deferred. <eob>
But the promise of joint innovation <eol> between these two nuclear superpowers <eob> wasn't totally extinguished. <eob>
Because in 1991, which is the year <eol> that Jasmine was born <eob> and the Soviet Union fell, <eob> these two nations engaged in a project <eob> that genuinely does seem incredible today <eob> in the truest sense of that word, <eob> which is that the US sent cash <eol> to the Russians when they needed it most, <eob> to secure loose nuclear materials <eob> and to employ out-of-work <eol> nuclear scientists. <eob>
They worked alongside American scientists <eol> to convert weapons-grade uranium <eob> into the type of fuel that can be used <eol> for nuclear power instead. <eob>
They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts." <eob> So the result is that for over 20 years, <eob> our two nations had a program <eob> that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs <eol> in the United States <eob> was essentially fueled <eol> by former Russian warheads. <eob>
So, together these two nations <eol> did something truly audacious. <eob>
But the good news is, <eol> the global community has the chance <eob> to do something just as audacious today. <eob>
To get rid of nuclear weapons <eob> and to end the supply of the materials <eol> required to produce them, <eob> some experts tell me would take 30 years. <eob>
It would take a renaissance of sorts, <eob> the kinds of innovation that, <eol> for better or worse, <eob> underpinned both the Manhattan Project, <eol> which gave rise to nuclear weapons, <eob> and the Megatons to Megawatts program. <eob>
It would take design constraints. <eob>
These are fundamental to creativity, <eob> things like a platform <eol> for international collaboration; <eob> a date certain, which is <eol> a forcing mechanism; <eob> and a positive vision <eol> that inspires action. <eob>
It would take us to 2045. <eob>
Now, 2045 happens to be <eol> the 100th anniversary <eob> of the birth of nuclear weapons <eol> in the New Mexico desert. <eob>
But it's also an important date <eol> for another reason. <eob>
It's predicted to be the advent <eol> of the singularity, <eob> a new moment in human development, <eob> where the lines between artificial <eol> intelligence and human intelligence blur, <eob> where computing and consciousness <eol> become almost indistinguishable <eob> and advanced technologies help us solve <eol> the 21st century's greatest problems: <eob> hunger, energy, poverty, <eob> ushering in an era of abundance. <eob>
And we all get to go to space <eob> on our way to becoming <eol> a multi-planetary species. <eob>
Now, the people who really believe <eol> this vision are the first to say <eob> they don't yet know precisely <eol> how we're going to get there. <eob>
But the values behind their vision <eob> and the willingness to ask "How might we?" <eob> have inspired a generation of innovators. <eob>
They're working backward <eol> from the outcomes they want, <eob> using the creative problem-solving methods <eol> of collaborative design. <eob>
They're busting through obstacles. <eob>
They're redefining <eol> what we all consider possible. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> that vision of abundance isn't compatible <eob> with a world that still relies <eol> on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine <eob> called "mutually assured destruction." <eob> It has to be about building <eol> the foundations for the 22nd century. <eob>
It has to be about strategies <eol> for mutually assured prosperity <eob> or, at the very least, <eol> mutually assured survival. <eob>
Now, every day, I get to meet <eol> people who are real pioneers <eob> in the field of nuclear threats. <eob>
As you can see, many of them <eol> are young women, <eob> and they're doing fiercely <eol> interesting stuff, <eob> like Mareena Robinson Snowden here, <eol> who is developing new ways, <eob> better ways, to detect nuclear warheads, <eob> which will help us <eol> overcome a critical hurdle <eob> to international disarmament. <eob> Or Melissa Hanham, who is using <eol> satellite imaging <eob> to make sense of what's going on <eol> around far-flung nuclear sites. <eob>
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe, <eob> who has been campaigning <eol> to make nuclear weapons illegal <eob> in international courts of law, <eob> and just won a big victory <eol> at the UN last week. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And yet, <eob> and yet, <eob> with all of our talk in this culture <eol> about moon shots, <eob> too few members of Generation Possible <eol> and those of us who mentor them <eob> are taking on nuclear weapons. <eob>
It's as if there's a taboo. <eob>
But I remember something Kennedy said <eol> that has really stuck with me, <eob> and that is something to the effect <eob> that humans can be as big as the solutions <eob> to all the problems we've created. <eob>
No problem of human destiny, he said, <eob> is beyond human beings. <eob> I believe that. <eob> And I bet a lot of you here <eol> believe that, too. <eob>
And I know Generation <eol> Possible believes it. <eob>
So it's time to commit to a date. <eob>
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter <eob> on the 100th anniversary of its inception. <eob>
After all, by 2045, we will have held <eol> billions of people hostage <eob> to the threat of nuclear annihilation. <eob>
Surely, 100 years will have been enough. <eob>
Surely, a century of economic development <eob> and the development of military strategy <eob> will have given us better ways <eol> to manage global conflict. <eob>
Surely, if ever there was a global <eol> moon shot worth supporting, <eob> this is it. <eob>
Now, in the face of real threats -- <eob> for instance, North Korea's recent <eol> nuclear weapons tests, <eob> which fly in the face of sanctions -- <eob> reasonable people disagree <eob> about whether we should maintain <eol> some number of nuclear weapons <eob> to deter aggression. <eob>
But the question is: <eol> What's the magic number? <eob> Is it a thousand? <eob> Is it a hundred? Ten? <eob> And then we have to ask: <eob> Who should be responsible for them? <eob>
I think we can agree, however, <eob> that having 15,000 of them <eol> represents a greater global threat <eob> to Jasmine's generation than a promise. <eob>
So it's time we make a promise <eob> of a world in which we've broken <eol> the stranglehold <eob> that nuclear weapons have <eol> on our imaginations; <eob> in which we invest <eol> in the creative solutions <eob> that come from working backward <eol> from the future we desperately want, <eob> rather than plodding forward <eol> from a present <eob> that brings all of the mental models <eol> and biases of the past with it. <eob>
It's time we pledge our resources <eol> as leaders across the spectrum <eob> to work on this old problem in new ways, <eob> to ask, "How might we?" <eob> How might we make good on a promise <eob> of greater security <eol> for Jasmine's generation <eob> in a world beyond nuclear weapons? <eob>
I truly hope you will join us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
So what if I could make for you <eob> a designer baby? <eob>
What if you as a parent-to-be <eob> and I as a scientist decided <eol> to go down that road together? <eob>
What if we didn't? <eob>
What if we thought, "That's a bad idea," <eob> but many of our family, <eol> friends and coworkers <eob> did make that decision? <eob>
Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now. <eob>
Let's pretend it's the year 2030, <eob> and you're a parent. <eob>
You have your daughter, <eol> Marianne, next to you, <eob> and in 2030, she is what we call a natural <eob> because she has no genetic modifications. <eob>
And because you and your partner <eol> consciously made that decision, <eob> many in your social circle, <eol> they kind of look down on you. <eob>
They think you're, like, <eol> a Luddite or a technophobe. <eob>
Marianne's best friend Jenna, <eol> who lives right next door, <eob> is a very different story. <eob>
She was born a genetically modified <eol> designer baby with numerous upgrades. <eob> Yeah. Upgrades. <eob> And these enhancements were introduced <eob> using a new genetic <eol> modification technology <eob> that goes by the funny name CRISPR, <eob> you know, like something's crisp, <eob> this is CRISPR. <eob>
The scientist that Jenna's parents <eol> hired to do this <eob> for several million dollars <eob> introduced CRISPR <eol> into a whole panel of human embryos. <eob>
And then they used genetic testing, <eob> and they predicted that <eol> that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo, <eob> would be the best of the bunch. <eob>
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person. <eob>
She's sitting on the carpet <eol> in your living room <eob> playing with your daughter Marianne. <eob>
And your families have known <eol> each other for years now, <eob> and it's become very clear to you <eob> that Jenna is extraordinary. <eob>
She's incredibly intelligent. <eob>
If you're honest with yourself, <eol> she's smarter than you, <eob> and she's five years old. <eob>
She's beautiful, tall, athletic, <eob> and the list goes on and on. <eob>
And in fact, there's <eol> a whole new generation <eob> of these GM kids like Jenna. <eob>
And so far it looks like <eob> they're healthier <eol> than their parents' generation, <eob> than your generation. <eob>
And they have lower health care costs. <eob>
They're immune <eol> to a host of health conditions, <eob> including HIV / AIDS <eol> and genetic diseases. <eob>
It all sounds so great, <eob> but you can't help but have <eol> this sort of unsettling feeling, <eob> a gut feeling, that there's something <eol> just not quite right about Jenna, <eob> and you've had the same feeling <eol> about other GM kids that you've met. <eob>
You were also reading <eol> in the newspaper earlier this week <eob> that a study of these children <eol> who were born as designer babies <eob> indicates they may have some issues, <eob> like increased aggressiveness <eol> and narcissism. <eob>
But more immediately on your mind <eob> is some news that you just got <eol> from Jenna's family. <eob>
She's so smart, <eob> she's now going to be going <eol> to a special school, <eob> a different school <eol> than your daughter Marianne, <eob> and this is kind of throwing <eol> your family into a disarray. <eob>
Marianne's been crying, <eob> and last night when you took her to bed <eol> to kiss her goodnight, <eob> she said, "Daddy, will Jenna <eol> even be my friend anymore?" <eob>
So now, as I've been telling you <eol> this imagined 2030 story, <eob> I have a feeling <eol> that I may have put some of you <eob> into this sci-fi <eol> frame of reference. Right? <eob> You think you're reading a sci-fi book. <eob>
Or maybe, like, <eol> in Halloween mode of thinking. <eob>
But this is really <eol> a possible reality for us, <eob> just 15 years from now. <eob>
I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher <eob> and I can see this new CRISPR technology <eob> and its potential impact. <eob>
And we may find ourselves in that reality, <eob> and a lot will depend <eol> on what we decide to do today. <eob>
And if you're still <eol> kind of thinking in sci-fi mode, <eob> consider that the world of science <eol> had a huge shock earlier this year, <eob> and the public largely <eol> doesn't even know about it. <eob>
Researchers in China just a few months ago <eob> reported the creation <eol> of genetically modified human embryos. <eob>
This was the first time in history. <eob>
And they did it using <eol> this new CRISPR technology. <eob>
It didn't work perfectly, <eob> but I still think <eol> they sort of cracked the door ajar <eob> on a Pandora's box here. <eob>
And I think some people <eol> are going to run with this technology <eob> and try to make designer babies. <eob>
Now, before I go on, some of you <eol> may hold up your hands and say, <eob> "Stop, Paul, wait a minute. <eob>
Wouldn't that be illegal? <eob>
You can't just go off <eol> and create <eob> a designer baby. <eob> "And in fact, to some extent, <eol> you're right. <eob>
In some countries, you couldn't do that. <eob>
But in many other countries, <eol> including my country, the US, <eob> there's actually no law on this, <eol> so in theory, you could do it. <eob>
And there was another development <eol> this year that resonates in this area, <eob> and that happened <eol> not so far from here over in the UK. <eob>
And the UK traditionally <eol> has been the strictest country <eob> when it comes to human <eol> genetic modification. <eob>
It was illegal there, <eob> but just a few months ago, <eob> they carved out an exception to that rule. <eob>
They passed a new law <eob> allowing the creation <eol> of genetically modified humans <eob> with the noble goal of trying <eol> to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease. <eob>
But still I think in combination <eol> these events are pushing us <eob> further towards an acceptance <eob> of human genetic modification. <eob>
So I've been talking <eol> about this CRISPR technology. <eob>
What actually is CRISPR? <eob>
So if you think about the GMOs <eol> that we're all more familiar with, <eob> like GMO tomatoes and wheat <eob> and things like that, <eob> this technology <eol> is similar to the technologies <eob> that were used to make those, <eob> but it's dramatically better, <eob> cheaper and faster. <eob>
So what is it? <eob> It's actually like <eol> a genetic Swiss army knife. <eob>
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife <eob> with different tools in it, <eob> and one of the tools <eol> is kind of like a magnifying glass <eob> or a GPS for our DNA, <eob> so it can home in on a certain spot. <eob>
And the next tool is like scissors <eob> that can cut the DNA right in that spot. <eob>
And finally we have a pen <eob> where we can literally rewrite <eol> the genetic code in that location. <eob>
It's really that simple. <eob>
And this technology, which came <eol> on the scene just three years ago, <eob> has taken science by storm. <eob>
It's evolving so fast, and it's <eol> so freaking exciting to scientists, <eob> and I admit I'm fascinated by it <eol> and we use it in my own lab, <eob> that I think someone <eol> is going to go that extra step <eob> and continue the GM human embryo work <eob> and maybe make designer babies. <eob>
This is so ubiquitous now. <eob>
It just came on the scene three years ago. <eob>
Thousands of labs <eol> literally have this in hand today, <eob> and they're doing important research. <eob>
Most of them are not interested <eol> in designer babies. <eob>
They're studying human disease <eob> and other important elements of science. <eob>
So there's a lot of good research <eol> going on with CRISPR. <eob>
And the fact that we can <eol> now do genetic modifications <eob> that used to take years <eol> and cost millions of dollars <eob> in a few weeks <eol> for a couple thousand bucks, <eob> to me as a scientist that's fantastic, <eob> but again, at the same time, <eob> it opens the door to people going too far. <eob>
And I think for some people <eob> the focus is not going to be <eol> so much on science. <eob>
That's not what's going <eol> to be driving them. <eob>
It's going to be ideology <eol> or the chase for a profit. <eob>
And they're going to go <eol> for designer babies. <eob>
So why should we be concerned about this? <eob>
We know from Darwin, <eol> if we go back two centuries, <eob> that evolution and genetics <eol> profoundly have impacted humanity, <eob> who we are today. <eob>
And some think there's like <eol> a social Darwinism at work in our world, <eob> and maybe even a eugenics as well. <eob>
Imagine those trends, those forces, <eob> with a booster rocket <eol> of this CRISPR technology <eob> that is so powerful and so ubiquitous. <eob>
And in fact, we can just go back <eol> one century to the last century <eob> to see the power that eugenics can have. <eob>
So my father, Peter Knoepfler, <eob> was actually born right here in Vienna. <eob>
He was Viennese, <eol> and he was born here in 1929. <eob>
And when my grandparents <eol> had little baby Peter, <eob> the world was very different. Right? <eob> It was a different Vienna. <eob> The United States was different. <eob>
The world was different. <eob>
There was a eugenics rising, <eob> and my grandparents realized, <eob> pretty quickly I think, <eob> that they were on the wrong side <eol> of the eugenics equation. <eob>
And so despite this being their home <eob> and their whole extended family's home, <eob> and this area being their family's <eol> home for generations, <eob> they decided because of eugenics <eob> that they had to leave. <eob>
And they survived, <eol> but they were heartbroken, <eob> and I'm not sure my dad <eol> ever really got over leaving Vienna. <eob>
He left when he was just eight years old <eob> in 1938. <eob>
So today, I see a new eugenics <eob> kind of bubbling to the surface. <eob>
It's supposed to be a kinder, <eol> gentler, positive eugenics, <eob> different than all that past stuff. <eob>
But I think even though it's focused <eol> on trying to improve people, <eob> it could have negative consequences, <eob> and it really worries me <eob> that some of the top proponents <eol> of this new eugenics, <eob> they think CRISPR is the ticket <eol> to make it happen. <eob>
So I have to admit, you know, <eob> eugenics, we talk <eol> about making better people. <eob>
It's a tough question. <eob>
What is better when we're talking <eol> about a human being? <eob>
But I admit I think maybe a lot of us <eob> could agree that human beings, <eob> maybe we could use a little betterment. <eob>
Look at our politicians <eob> here, you know, back in the US -- <eob> God forbid we go there right now. <eob>
Maybe even if we just look in the mirror, <eob> there might be ways <eol> we think we could be better. <eob>
I might wish, honestly, that I had <eol> more hair here, instead of baldness. <eob>
Some people might wish they were taller, <eob> have a different weight, a different face. <eob>
If we could do those things, <eol> we could make those things happen, <eob> or we could make them happen <eol> in our children, <eob> it would be very seductive. <eob>
And yet coming with it <eol> would be these risks. <eob>
I talked about eugenics, <eob> but there would be risks <eol> to individuals as well. <eob>
So if we forget about enhancing people <eob> and we just try to make them <eol> healthier using genetic modification, <eob> this technology is so new <eob> and so powerful, <eob> that by accident <eol> we could make them sicker. <eob>
That easily could happen. <eob>
And there's another risk, <eob> and that is that all of the legitimate, <eol> important genetic modification research <eob> going on just in the lab -- <eob> again, no interest in designer babies -- <eob> a few people going <eol> the designer baby route, <eob> things go badly, <eob> that entire field could be damaged. <eob>
I also think it's not that unlikely <eob> that governments might start taking <eol> an interest in genetic modification. <eob>
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child <eob> who is healthier, <eob> if there's a generation that looks <eol> like they have lower health care costs, <eob> it's possible that governments <eol> may start trying to compel their citizens <eob> to go the GM route. <eob>
Look at China's one-child policy. <eob>
It's thought that that prevented <eol> the birth of 400 million human beings. <eob>
So it's not beyond the realm of possible <eob> that genetic modification <eol> could be something that governments push. <eob>
And if designer babies become popular, <eob> in our digital age -- <eob> viral videos, social media -- <eob> what if designer babies <eol> are thought to be fashionable, <eob> and they kind of become <eol> the new glitterati, <eob> the new Kardashians or something? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, are those trends <eol> that we really could control? <eob>
I'm not convinced that we could. <eob>
So again, today it's Halloween <eob> and when we talk <eol> about genetic modification, <eob> there's one Halloween-associated character <eob> that is talked about <eol> or invoked more than anything else, <eob> and that is Frankenstein. <eob>
Mostly that's been Frankenfoods <eol> and all this other stuff. <eob>
But if we think <eob> about this now and we think <eol> about it in the human context <eob> on a day like Halloween, <eob> if parents can in essence <eol> costume their children genetically, <eob> are we going to be talking about a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation? <eob>
I don't think so. <eob>
I don't think it's going <eol> to get to that extreme. <eob>
But when we are going about <eol> hacking the human code, <eob> I think all bets are off <eol> in terms of what might come of that. <eob>
There would still be dangers. <eob>
And we can look in the past <eob> to other elements <eol> of transformative science <eob> and see how they can <eol> basically go out of control <eob> and permeate society. <eob>
So I'll just give you one example, <eol> and that is in vitro fertilization. <eob>
Almost exactly 40 years ago, <eob> test tube baby number one <eol> Louise Brown was born, <eob> and that's a great thing, <eob> and I think since then <eol> five million IVF babies have been born, <eob> bringing immeasurable happiness. <eob>
A lot of parents now can love those kids. <eob>
But if you think about, <eol> it in four decades, <eob> five million babies being born <eol> from a new technology <eob> is pretty remarkable, <eob> and the same kind of thing could happen <eob> with human genetic modification <eol> and designer babies. <eob>
So depending on the decisions <eol> we make in the next few months, <eob> the next year or so, <eob> if designer baby number one is born, <eob> within a few decades, <eob> there could well be millions of genetically modified humans. <eob>
And there's a difference there too, <eol> because if we, you in the audience, or I, <eob> if we decide to have <eob> a designer baby, <eob> then their children will also be <eol> genetically modified, and so on, <eob> because it's heritable. <eob>
So that's a big difference. <eob>
So with all of this in mind, <eob> what should we do? <eob>
There's actually going to be a meeting <eob> a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C. <eob> by the US National Academy of Sciences <eob> to tackle that exact question. <eob>
What is the right path forward <eol> with human genetic modification? <eob>
I believe at this time <eob> we need a moratorium. <eob>
We have to ban this. <eob>
We should not allow <eol> creating genetically modified people, <eob> because it's just too dangerous <eol> and too unpredictable. <eob>
But there's a lot of people -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thanks. <eob>
And let me say, just as a scientist, <eob> it's a little bit scary for me <eol> to say that in public, <eob> because science generally <eol> doesn't like self-regulation <eob> and things like that. <eob>
So I think we need to put a hold on this, <eob> but there are many people <eol> who not only disagree with me, <eob> they feel the exact opposite. <eob>
They're like, step on the gas, <eol> full speed ahead, <eob> let's make designer babies. <eob>
And so in the meeting in December <eob> and other meetings that are likely <eol> to follow in the next few months, <eob> it's very possible <eol> there may be no moratorium. <eob>
And I think part <eol> of the problem that we have <eob> is that all of this trend, <eob> this revolution in genetic modification <eol> applying to humans, <eob> the public hasn't known about it. <eob>
Nobody has been saying, <eob> look, this is a big deal, <eol> this is a revolution, <eob> and this could affect you <eol> in very personal ways. <eob> And so part of my goal <eol> is actually to change that <eob> and to educate and engage with the public <eob> and get you guys talking about this. <eob>
And so I hope at these meetings <eol> that there will be a role for the public <eob> to bring their voice to bear as well. <eob>
So if we kind of circle back now <eol> to 2030 again, that imagined story, <eob> and depending on the decisions <eol> we make, again, today — <eob> literally we don't have a lot of time — <eob> in the next few months, <eob> the next year or so, <eob> because this technology <eol> is spreading like wildfire. <eob>
Let's pretend we're back in that reality. <eob>
We're at a park, <eob> and our kid is swinging on the swing. <eob>
Is that kid a regular old kid, <eob> or did we decide to have <eob> a designer baby? <eob>
And let's say we went <eol> the sort of traditional route, <eob> and there's our kid swinging on the swing, <eob> and frankly, they're kind of a mess. <eob>
Their hair is all over <eol> the place like mine. <eob>
They have a stuffy nose. <eob> They're not the best student in the world. <eob>
They're adorable, you love them, <eob> but there on the swing next to them, <eob> their best friend is a GM kid, <eob> and the two of them <eol> are kind of swinging like this, <eob> and you can't help <eol> but compare them, right? <eob>
And the GM kid is swinging higher, <eob> they look better, <eol> they're a better student, <eob> they don't have that stuffy nose <eol> you need to wipe. <eob>
How is that going to make you feel <eob> and what decision <eol> might you make next time? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I want you to look <eol> around the room for a minute <eob> and try to find the most <eol> paranoid person here -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then I want you to point <eol> at that person for me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
OK, don't actually do it. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But, as an organizational psychologist, <eob> I spend a lot of time in workplaces, <eob> and I find paranoia everywhere. <eob>
Paranoia is caused by people <eol> that I call "takers." <eob> Takers are self-serving <eol> in their interactions. <eob>
It's all about what can you do for me. <eob>
The opposite is a giver. <eob>
It's somebody who approaches <eol> most interactions by asking, <eob> "What can I do for you?" <eob>
I wanted to give you a chance <eol> to think about your own style. <eob>
We all have moments of giving and taking. <eob>
Your style is how you treat <eol> most of the people most of the time, <eob> your default. <eob>
I have a short test you can take <eob> to figure out if you're more <eol> of a giver or a taker, <eob> and you can take it right now. <eob>
[The Narcissist Test] <eob>
This is the only thing I will say today <eol> that has no data behind it, <eob> but I am convinced the longer it takes <eol> for you to laugh at this cartoon, <eob> the more worried we should be <eol> that you're a taker. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Of course, not all takers are narcissists. <eob>
Some are just givers who got burned <eol> one too many times. <eob>
Then there's another kind of taker <eol> that we won't be addressing today, <eob> and that's called a psychopath. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I was curious, though, about how <eol> common these extremes are, <eob> and so I surveyed over 30,000 <eol> people across industries <eob> around the world's cultures. <eob>
And I found that most people <eol> are right in the middle <eob> between giving and taking. <eob>
They choose this third style <eol> called "matching." <eob> If you're a matcher, you try to keep <eol> an even balance of give and take: <eob> quid pro quo -- I'll do something <eol> for you if you do something for me. <eob>
And that seems like a safe way <eol> to live your life. <eob>
But is it the most effective <eol> and productive way to live your life? <eob>
The answer to that question <eol> is a very definitive ... <eob> maybe. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I studied dozens of organizations, <eob> thousands of people. <eob>
I had engineers measuring <eol> their productivity. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I looked at medical students' grades -- <eob> even salespeople's revenue. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And, unexpectedly, <eob> the worst performers in each <eol> of these jobs were the givers. <eob>
The engineers who got the least work done <eob> were the ones who did more favors <eol> than they got back. <eob>
They were so busy doing <eol> other people's jobs, <eob> they literally ran out of time and energy <eol> to get their own work completed. <eob>
In medical school, the lowest grades <eol> belong to the students <eob> who agree most strongly <eol> with statements like, <eob> "I love helping others," <eob> which suggests the doctor <eol> you ought to trust <eob> is the one who came to med school <eol> with no desire to help anybody. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then in sales, too, <eol> the lowest revenue accrued <eob> in the most generous salespeople. <eob>
I actually reached out <eol> to one of those salespeople <eob> who had a very high giver score. <eob>
And I asked him, "Why do <eol> you suck at your job --" <eob> I didn't ask it that way, but -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?" <eob> And he said, "Well, I just care <eol> so deeply about my customers <eob> that I would never sell them <eol> one of our crappy products." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So just out of curiosity, <eob> how many of you self-identify more <eol> as givers than takers or matchers? <eob> Raise your hands. <eob> OK, it would have been more <eol> before we talked about these data. <eob>
But actually, it turns out <eol> there's a twist here, <eob> because givers are often <eol> sacrificing themselves, <eob> but they make their organizations better. <eob>
We have a huge body of evidence -- <eob> many, many studies looking <eol> at the frequency of giving behavior <eob> that exists in a team <eol> or an organization -- <eob> and the more often people are helping <eol> and sharing their knowledge <eob> and providing mentoring, <eob> the better organizations do <eol> on every metric we can measure: <eob> higher profits, customer satisfaction, <eol> employee retention -- <eob> even lower operating expenses. <eob>
So givers spend a lot of time <eol> trying to help other people <eob> and improve the team, <eob> and then, unfortunately, <eol> they suffer along the way. <eob>
I want to talk about what it takes <eob> to build cultures where givers <eol> actually get to succeed. <eob>
So I wondered, then, if givers <eol> are the worst performers, <eob> who are the best performers? <eob>
Let me start with the good news: <eol> it's not the takers. <eob>
Takers tend to rise quickly <eol> but also fall quickly in most jobs. <eob>
And they fall at the hands of matchers. <eob>
If you're a matcher, you believe <eol> in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world. <eob>
And so when you meet a taker, <eob> you feel like it's your mission in life <eob> to just punish the hell <eol> out of that person. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that way justice gets served. <eob>
Well, most people are matchers. <eob>
And that means if you're a taker, <eob> it tends to catch up with you eventually; <eob> what goes around will come around. <eob>
And so the logical conclusion is: <eob> it must be the matchers <eob> who are the best performers. <eob> But they're not. <eob> In every job, in every organization <eol> I've ever studied, <eob> the best results belong <eol> to the givers again. <eob>
Take a look at some data I gathered <eol> from hundreds of salespeople, <eob> tracking their revenue. <eob>
What you can see is that the givers <eol> go to both extremes. <eob>
They make up the majority of people <eol> who bring in the lowest revenue, <eob> but also the highest revenue. <eob>
The same patterns were true <eol> for engineers' productivity <eob> and medical students' grades. <eob>
Givers are overrepresented <eol> at the bottom and at the top <eob> of every success metric that I can track. <eob>
Which raises the question: <eob> How do we create a world <eol> where more of these givers get to excel? <eob>
I want to talk about how to do that, <eol> not just in businesses, <eob> but also in nonprofits, schools -- <eob> even governments. <eob> Are you ready? <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
I was going to do it anyway, <eol> but I appreciate the enthusiasm. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The first thing that's really critical <eob> is to recognize that givers <eol> are your most valuable people, <eob> but if they're not careful, they burn out. <eob>
So you have to protect <eol> the givers in your midst. <eob>
And I learned a great lesson about this <eol> from Fortune's best networker. <eob>
It's the guy, not the cat. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
His name is Adam Rifkin. <eob>
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur <eob> who spends a huge amount <eol> of his time helping other people. <eob>
And his secret weapon <eol> is the five-minute favor. <eob>
Adam said, "You don't have to be <eol> Mother Teresa or Gandhi <eob> to be a giver. <eob>
You just have to find small ways <eol> to add large value <eob> to other people's lives." <eob> That could be as simple <eol> as making an introduction <eob> between two people who could <eol> benefit from knowing each other. <eob>
It could be sharing your knowledge <eol> or giving a little bit of feedback. <eob>
Or It might be even something <eol> as basic as saying, <eob> "You know, <eob> I'm going to try and figure out <eob> if I can recognize somebody <eol> whose work has gone unnoticed." <eob> And those five-minute favors <eol> are really critical <eob> to helping givers set boundaries <eol> and protect themselves. <eob>
The second thing that matters <eob> if you want to build a culture <eol> where givers succeed, <eob> is you actually need a culture <eol> where help-seeking is the norm; <eob> where people ask a lot. <eob>
This may hit a little too close <eol> to home for some of you. <eob>
[So in all your relationships, <eol> you always have to be the giver?] <eob>
What you see with successful givers <eob> is they recognize that it's OK <eol> to be a receiver, too. <eob>
If you run an organization, <eol> we can actually make this easier. <eob> We can make it easier <eol> for people to ask for help. <eob>
A couple colleagues and I <eol> studied hospitals. <eob>
We found that on certain floors, <eol> nurses did a lot of help-seeking, <eob> and on other floors, <eol> they did very little of it. <eob>
The factor that stood out on the floors <eol> where help-seeking was common, <eob> where it was the norm, <eob> was there was just one nurse <eol> whose sole job it was <eob> to help other nurses on the unit. <eob>
When that role was available, <eob> nurses said, "It's not embarrassing, <eol> it's not vulnerable to ask for help -- <eob> it's actually encouraged." <eob>
Help-seeking isn't important <eol> just for protecting the success <eob> and the well-being of givers. <eob>
It's also critical to getting <eol> more people to act like givers, <eob> because the data say <eob> that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent <eol> of all giving in organizations <eob> starts with a request. <eob>
But a lot of people don't ask. <eob> They don't want to look incompetent, <eob> they don't know where to turn, <eol> they don't want to burden others. <eob>
Yet if nobody ever asks for help, <eob> you have a lot of frustrated givers <eol> in your organization <eob> who would love to step up and contribute, <eob> if they only knew <eol> who could benefit and how. <eob>
But I think the most important thing, <eob> if you want to build a culture <eol> of successful givers, <eob> is to be thoughtful about who <eol> you let onto your team. <eob>
I figured, you want a culture <eol> of productive generosity, <eob> you should hire a bunch of givers. <eob>
But I was surprised to discover, actually, <eol> that that was not right -- <eob> that the negative impact <eol> of a taker on a culture <eob> is usually double to triple <eol> the positive impact of a giver. <eob>
Think about it this way: <eob> one bad apple can spoil a barrel, <eob> but one good egg <eol> just does not make a dozen. <eob>
I don't know what that means -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I hope you do. <eob>
No -- let even one taker into a team, <eob> and you will see that the givers <eol> will stop helping. <eob>
They'll say, "I'm surrounded <eol> by a bunch of snakes and sharks. <eob>
Why should I contribute?" <eob> Whereas if you let one giver into a team, <eob> you don't get an explosion of generosity. <eob>
More often, people are like, <eob> "Great! That person can do all our work." <eob> So, effective hiring and screening <eol> and team building <eob> is not about bringing in the givers; <eob> it's about weeding out the takers. <eob>
If you can do that well, <eob> you'll be left with givers and matchers. <eob>
The givers will be generous <eob> because they don't have to worry <eol> about the consequences. <eob>
And the beauty of the matchers <eol> is that they follow the norm. <eob>
So how do you catch a taker <eol> before it's too late? <eob>
We're actually pretty bad <eol> at figuring out who's a taker, <eob> especially on first impressions. <eob>
There's a personality trait <eol> that throws us off. <eob> It's called agreeableness, <eob> one the major dimensions <eol> of personality across cultures. <eob>
Agreeable people are warm and friendly, <eol> they're nice, they're polite. <eob>
You find a lot of them in Canada -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Where there was actually <eol> a national contest <eob> to come up with a new Canadian slogan <eol> and fill in the blank, <eob> "As Canadian as ..." <eob> I thought the winning entry <eol> was going to be, <eob> "As Canadian as maple syrup," <eol> or, "... ice hockey." <eob> But no, Canadians voted <eol> for their new national slogan to be -- <eob> I kid you not -- <eob> "As Canadian as possible <eol> under the circumstances." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now for those of you <eol> who are highly agreeable, <eob> or maybe slightly Canadian, <eob> you get this right away. <eob>
How could I ever say I'm any one thing <eob> when I'm constantly adapting <eol> to try to please other people? <eob>
Disagreeable people do less of it. <eob>
They're more critical, <eol> skeptical, challenging, <eob> and far more likely than their peers <eol> to go to law school. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That's not a joke, <eol> that's actually an empirical fact. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I always assumed <eol> that agreeable people were givers <eob> and disagreeable people were takers. <eob>
But then I gathered the data, <eob> and I was stunned to find <eol> no correlation between those traits, <eob> because it turns out <eol> that agreeableness-disagreeableness <eob> is your outer veneer: <eob> How pleasant is it to interact with you? <eob>
Whereas giving and taking <eol> are more of your inner motives: <eob> What are your values? <eob>
What are your intentions toward others? <eob>
If you really want to judge <eol> people accurately, <eob> you have to get to the moment every <eol> consultant in the room is waiting for, <eob> and draw a two-by-two. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The agreeable givers are easy to spot: <eob> they say yes to everything. <eob>
The disagreeable takers <eol> are also recognized quickly, <eob> although you might call them <eol> by a slightly different name. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We forget about the other <eol> two combinations. <eob>
There are disagreeable givers <eol> in our organizations. <eob>
There are people who are gruff <eol> and tough on the surface <eob> but underneath have <eol> others' best interests at heart. <eob>
Or as an engineer put it, <eob> "Oh, disagreeable givers -- <eob> like somebody with a bad user interface <eol> but a great operating system." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If that helps you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Disagreeable givers are the most <eol> undervalued people in our organizations, <eob> because they're the ones <eol> who give the critical feedback <eob> that no one wants to hear <eol> but everyone needs to hear. <eob>
We need to do a much better job <eol> valuing these people <eob> as opposed to writing them off early, <eob> and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly, <eob> must be a selfish taker." <eob>
The other combination we forget about <eol> is the deadly one -- <eob> the agreeable taker, <eol> also known as the faker. <eob>
This is the person <eol> who's nice to your face, <eob> and then will stab you right in the back. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And my favorite way to catch <eol> these people in the interview process <eob> is to ask the question, <eob> "Can you give me the names of four people <eob> whose careers you have <eol> fundamentally improved?" <eob> The takers will give you four names, <eob> and they will all be more <eol> influential than them, <eob> because takers are great at kissing up <eol> and then kicking down. <eob>
Givers are more likely to name people <eol> who are below them in a hierarchy, <eob> who don't have as much power, <eob> who can do them no good. <eob>
And let's face it, you all know <eol> you can learn a lot about character <eob> by watching how someone <eol> treats their restaurant server <eob> or their Uber driver. <eob>
So if we do all this well, <eob> if we can weed takers <eol> out of organizations, <eob> if we can make it safe to ask for help, <eob> if we can protect givers from burnout <eob> and make it OK for them to be ambitious <eol> in pursuing their own goals <eob> as well as trying to help other people, <eob> we can actually change the way <eol> that people define success. <eob>
Instead of saying it's all about <eol> winning a competition, <eob> people will realize success <eol> is really more about contribution. <eob>
I believe that the most <eol> meaningful way to succeed <eob> is to help other people succeed. <eob>
And if we can spread that belief, <eob> we can actually turn paranoia upside down. <eob>
There's a name for that. <eob>
It's called "pronoia." <eob> Pronoia is the delusional belief <eob> that other people <eol> are plotting your well-being. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That they're going around behind your back <eob> and saying exceptionally <eol> glowing things about you. <eob>
The great thing about a culture of givers <eol> is that's not a delusion -- <eob> it's reality. <eob> I want to live in a world <eol> where givers succeed, <eob> and I hope you will help me <eol> create that world. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Growing up in Kenya, <eob> I knew I always wanted <eol> to study biochemistry. <eob>
See, I had seen the impact of the high <eol> prevalence of diseases like malaria, <eob> and I wanted to make medicines <eol> that would cure the sick. <eob>
So I worked really hard, <eob> got a scholarship to the United States, <eol> where I became a cancer researcher, <eob> and I loved it. <eob>
For someone who wants to cure diseases, <eob> there is no higher calling. <eob>
Ten years later, I returned <eol> to Kenya to do just that. <eob>
A freshly minted PhD, <eob> ready to take on this horrific illness, <eob> which in Kenya was almost <eol> certainly a death sentence. <eob>
But instead of landing a job <eol> in a pharmaceutical company <eob> or a hospital, <eob> I found myself drawn <eol> to a different kind of lab, <eob> working with a different <eol> kind of patient -- <eob> a patient whose illness was so serious <eob> it impacted every single <eol> person in my country; <eob> a patient who needed to get healthy fast. <eob>
That patient was my government. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
See, many of us will agree that lots <eol> of governments are unhealthy today. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And Kenya was no exception. <eob>
When I returned to Kenya in 2014, <eob> there was 17 percent youth unemployment. <eob>
And Nairobi, the major business hub, <eob> was rated 177th on the quality <eol> of living index. <eob> It was bad. <eob>
Now, an economy is only as healthy <eol> as the entities that make it up. <eob>
So when government -- <eob> one of its most vital entities -- <eob> is weak or unhealthy, <eob> everyone and everything suffers. <eob>
Sometimes you might <eol> put a Band-Aid in place <eob> to try and temporarily stop the pain. <eob>
Maybe some of you here have participated <eob> in a Band-Aid operation <eol> to an African country -- <eob> setting up alternative schools, <eol> building hospitals, digging wells -- <eob> because governments there <eol> either weren't or couldn't provide <eob> the services to their citizens. <eob>
We all know this is a temporary solution. <eob>
There are just some things <eol> Band-Aids can't fix, <eob> like providing an environment <eol> where businesses feel secure <eob> that they'll have an equal opportunity <eob> to be able to run and start <eol> their businesses successfully. <eob>
Or there are systems in place <eob> that would protect the private <eol> property that they create. <eob>
I would argue, <eob> only government is capable of creating <eol> these necessary conditions <eob> for economies to thrive. <eob>
Economies thrive when business are able <eol> to quickly and easily set up shop. <eob>
Business owners create new sources <eol> of income for themselves, <eob> new jobs get added into the economy <eob> and then more taxes are paid <eol> to fund public projects. <eob>
New business is good for everyone. <eob>
And it's such an important measure <eol> of economic growth, <eob> the World Bank has a ranking called <eol> the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking," <eob> which measures how easy <eol> or difficult it is to start a business <eob> in any given country. <eob>
And as you can imagine, <eob> starting or running a business <eol> in a country with an ailing government -- <eob> almost impossible. <eob>
The President of Kenya knew this, <eol> which is why in 2014, <eob> he came to our lab and asked <eol> us to partner with him <eob> to be able to help Kenya <eol> to jump-start business growth. <eob>
He set an ambitious goal: <eob> he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50 <eol> in this World Bank ranking. <eob>
In 2014 when he came, <eob> Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries. <eob>
We had our work cut out for us. <eob>
Fortunately, he came to the right place. <eob>
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team. <eob>
We're a group of computer scientists, <eol> mathematicians, engineers <eob> and a cancer researcher, <eob> who understood that in order <eol> to cure the sickness <eob> of a system as big as government, <eob> we needed to examine the whole body, <eob> and then we needed to drill down <eol> all the way from the organs, <eob> into the tissues, <eob> all the way to single cells, <eob> so that we could properly <eol> make a diagnosis. <eob>
So with our marching orders <eol> from the President himself, <eob> we embarked on the purest <eol> of the scientific method: <eob> collecting data -- <eob> all the data we could get our hands on -- <eob> making hypotheses, <eob> creating solutions, <eob> one after the other. <eob>
So we met with hundreds of individuals <eol> who worked at government agencies, <eob> from the tax agency, the lands <eol> office, utilities company, <eob> the agency that's responsible <eol> for registering companies, <eob> and with each of them, we observed <eol> them as they served customers, <eob> we documented their processes -- <eol> most of them were manual. <eob>
We also just went back and looked at <eol> a lot of their previous paperwork <eob> to try and really understand; <eob> to try and diagnose what bodily <eol> malfunctions had occurred <eob> that lead to that 136th spot <eol> on the World Bank list. <eob>
What did we find? <eob> Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days <eob> for a business owner <eol> to register their property, <eob> compared to just one day in New Zealand, <eob> which was ranked second <eol> on the World Bank list. <eob>
It took 158 days to get <eol> a new electric connection. <eob>
In Korea it took 18 days. <eob>
If you wanted to get a construction permit <eob> so you could put up a building, <eob> in Kenya, it was going <eol> to take you 125 days. <eob>
In Singapore, which is ranked first, <eol> that would only take you 26 days. <eob>
God forbid you had to go to court <eob> to get help in being able to settle <eol> a dispute to enforce a contract, <eob> because that process alone <eol> would take you 465 days. <eob>
And if that wasn't bad enough, <eob> you would lose 40 percent <eol> of your claim in just fees -- <eob> legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees. <eob>
Now, I know what you're thinking: <eob> for there to exist such inefficiencies <eol> in an African country, <eob> there must be corruption. <eob>
The very cells that run the show <eol> must be corrupt to the bone. <eob>
I thought so, too, actually. <eob>
When we started out, <eob> I thought I was going to find <eol> so much corruption, <eob> I was literally going to either die <eol> or get killed in the process. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But when we dug deeper, <eob> we didn't find corruption <eol> in the classic sense: <eob> slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness, <eob> waiting to grease the palms <eol> of their friends. <eob>
What we found was an overwhelming <eol> sense of helplessness. <eob>
Our government was sick, <eob> because government <eol> employees felt helpless. <eob>
They felt that they were not <eol> empowered to drive change. <eob>
And when people feel stuck and helpless, <eob> they stop seeing their role <eol> in a bigger system. <eob>
They start to think the work they do <eol> doesn't matter in driving change. <eob>
And when that happens, <eob> things slow down, <eob> fall through the cracks <eob> and inefficiencies flourish. <eob>
Now imagine with me, <eob> if you had a process <eol> you had to go through -- <eob> had no other alternative -- <eob> and this process was inefficient, complex <eob> and very, very slow. <eob> What would you do? <eob>
I think you might start by trying <eol> to find somebody to outsource it to, <eob> so that they can just <eol> take care of that for you. <eob> If that doesn't work, <eob> maybe you'd consider paying somebody <eob> to just "unofficially" take care <eol> of it on your behalf -- <eob> especially if you thought <eol> nobody was going to catch you. <eob>
Not out of malice or greed, <eob> just trying to make sure that you get <eol> something to work for you <eob> so you can move on. <eob>
Unfortunately, that <eol> is the beginning of corruption. <eob>
And if left to thrive and grow, <eob> it seeps into the whole system, <eob> and before you know it, <eob> the whole body is sick. <eob>
Knowing this, <eob> we had to start by making sure <eob> that every single stakeholder <eol> we worked with had a shared vision <eob> for what we wanted to do. <eob>
So we met with everyone, <eob> from the clerk whose sole job <eol> is to remove staples <eob> from application packets, <eob> to the legal drafters <eol> at the attorney general's office, <eob> to the clerks who are responsible <eol> for serving business owners <eob> when they came to access <eol> government services. <eob>
And with them, <eob> we made sure that they understood <eob> how their day-to-day actions <eol> were impacting our ability as a country <eob> to create new jobs <eol> and to attract investments. <eob>
No one's role was too small; <eol> everyone's role was vital. <eob>
Now, guess what we started to see? <eob>
A coalition of government employees <eob> who are excited and ready to drive change, <eob> began to grow and form. <eob>
And together we started <eol> to implement changes <eob> that impacted the service <eol> delivery of our country. <eob>
The result? <eob> In just two years, <eob> Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And in recognition of the significant <eol> reforms we've been able to implement <eob> in such a short time, <eob> Kenya was recognized <eob> to be among the top three <eol> global reformers in the world <eob> two years in a row. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Are we fully healthy? <eob> No. <eob> We have some serious work still to do. <eob>
I like to think about these two years <eol> like a weight-loss program. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's that time after months <eol> of hard, grueling work at the gym, <eob> and then you get your first <eol> time to weigh yourself, <eob> and you've lost 20 pounds. <eob>
You're feeling unstoppable. <eob>
Now, some of you may think <eol> this doesn't apply to you. <eob>
You're not from Kenya. <eob>
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur. <eob>
But think with me for just a moment. <eob>
When is the last time <eol> you accessed a government service? <eob>
Maybe applied for your driver's license, <eob> tried to do your taxes on your own. <eob>
It's easy in this political <eol> and global economy <eob> to want to give up when we think <eol> about transforming government. <eob>
We can easily resign to the fact <eol> or to the thinking <eob> that government is too inefficient, <eob> too corrupt, <eob> unfixable. <eob>
We might even rarely get <eol> some key government responsibilities <eob> to other sectors, <eob> to Band-Aid solutions, <eob> or to just give up and feel helpless. <eob>
But just because a system is sick <eol> doesn't mean it's dying. <eob>
We cannot afford to give up <eob> when it comes to the challenges <eol> of fixing our governments. <eob>
In the end, <eob> what really makes a government healthy <eol> is when healthy cells -- <eob> that's you and I -- <eob> get to the ground, <eob> roll up our sleeves, <eob> refuse to be helpless <eob> and believe that sometimes, <eob> all it takes is for us <eol> to create some space <eob> for healthy cells to grow and thrive. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
There is something about physics <eob> that has been really bothering me <eol> since I was a little kid. <eob>
And it's related to a question <eob> that scientists have been asking <eol> for almost 100 years, <eob> with no answer. <eob>
How do the smallest things in nature, <eob> the particles of the quantum world, <eob> match up with the largest <eol> things in nature -- <eob> planets and stars and galaxies <eol> held together by gravity? <eob>
As a kid, I would puzzle <eol> over questions just like this. <eob>
I would fiddle around <eol> with microscopes and electromagnets, <eob> and I would read <eol> about the forces of the small <eob> and about quantum mechanics <eob> and I would marvel at how well <eol> that description matched up <eob> to our observation. <eob>
Then I would look at the stars, <eob> and I would read about how well <eol> we understand gravity, <eob> and I would think surely, <eol> there must be some elegant way <eob> that these two systems match up. <eob>
But there's not. <eob>
And the books would say, <eob> yeah, we understand a lot <eol> about these two realms separately, <eob> but when we try to link <eol> them mathematically, <eob> everything breaks. <eob>
And for 100 years, <eob> none of our ideas as to how to solve <eol> this basically physics disaster, <eob> has ever been supported by evidence. <eob>
And to little old me -- <eob> little, curious, skeptical James -- <eob> this was a supremely unsatisfying answer. <eob>
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid. <eob>
Flash-forward now <eol> to December of 2015, <eob> when I found myself smack in the middle <eob> of the physics world <eol> being flipped on its head. <eob>
It all started when we at CERN <eol> saw something intriguing in our data: <eob> a hint of a new particle, <eob> an inkling of a possibly extraordinary <eol> answer to this question. <eob>
So I'm still a skeptical little kid, <eob> I think, <eob> but I'm also now a particle hunter. <eob>
I am a physicist at CERN's <eol> Large Hadron Collider, <eob> the largest science <eol> experiment ever mounted. <eob>
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel <eol> on the border of France and Switzerland <eob> buried 100 meters underground. <eob>
And in this tunnel, <eob> we use superconducting magnets <eol> colder than outer space <eob> to accelerate protons <eol> to almost the speed of light <eob> and slam them into each other <eol> millions of times per second, <eob> collecting the debris of these collisions <eob> to search for new, undiscovered <eol> fundamental particles. <eob>
Its design and construction <eol> took decades of work <eob> by thousands of physicists <eol> from around the globe, <eob> and in the summer of 2015, <eob> we had been working tirelessly <eol> to switch on the LHC <eob> at the highest energy that humans <eol> have ever used in a collider experiment. <eob>
Now, higher energy is important <eob> because for particles, <eol> there is an equivalence <eob> between energy and particle mass, <eob> and mass is just a number <eol> put there by nature. <eob>
To discover new particles, <eob> we need to reach these bigger numbers. <eob>
And to do that, we have to build <eol> a bigger, higher energy collider, <eob> and the biggest, highest <eol> energy collider in the world <eob> is the Large Hadron Collider. <eob>
And then, we collide protons <eol> quadrillions of times, <eob> and we collect this data very slowly, <eol> over months and months. <eob>
And then new particles might show up <eol> in our data as bumps -- <eob> slight deviations from what you expect, <eob> little clusters of data points <eol> that make a smooth line not so smooth. <eob>
For example, this bump, <eob> after months of data-taking in 2012, <eob> led to the discovery <eol> of the Higgs particle -- <eob> the Higgs boson -- <eob> and to a Nobel Prize <eol> for the confirmation of its existence. <eob>
This jump up in energy in 2015 <eob> represented the best chance <eol> that we as a species had ever had <eob> of discovering new particles — <eob> new answers to these long-standing questions, <eob> because it was almost twice as much energy <eol> as we used <eob> when we discovered <eol> the Higgs boson. <eob>
Many of my colleagues had been working <eol> their entire careers for this moment, <eob> and frankly, to little curious me, <eob> this was the moment <eol> I'd been waiting for my entire life. <eob>
So 2015 was go time. <eob>
So June 2015, <eob> the LHC is switched back on. <eob>
My colleagues and I held our breath <eol> and bit our fingernails, <eob> and then finally we saw <eol> the first proton collisions <eob> at this highest energy ever. <eob>
Applause, champagne, celebration. <eob>
This was a milestone for science, <eob> and we had no idea what we would find <eol> in this brand-new data. <eob>
And then a few weeks later, <eol> we found a bump. <eob>
It wasn't a very big bump, <eob> but it was big enough to make <eol> you raise your eyebrow. <eob>
But on a scale of one to 10 <eol> for eyebrow raises, <eob> if 10 indicates that you've <eol> discovered a new particle, <eob> this eyebrow raise is about a four. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I spent hours, days, weeks <eol> in secret meetings, <eob> arguing with my colleagues <eol> over this little bump, <eob> poking and prodding it with our most <eol> ruthless experimental sticks <eob> to see if it would withstand scrutiny. <eob>
But even after months <eol> of working feverishly -- <eob> sleeping in our offices <eol> and not going home, <eob> candy bars for dinner, <eob> coffee by the bucketful -- <eob> physicists are machines <eol> for turning coffee into diagrams -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This little bump would not go away. <eob>
So after a few months, <eob> we presented our little bump <eol> to the world with a very clear message: <eob> this little bump is interesting <eol> but it's not definitive, <eob> so let's keep an eye on it <eol> as we take more data. <eob>
So we were trying to be <eol> extremely cool about it. <eob>
And the world ran with it anyway. <eob>
The news loved it. <eob>
People said it reminded them <eol> of the little bump <eob> that was shown on the way <eol> toward the Higgs boson discovery. <eob>
Better than that, <eol> my theorist colleagues -- <eob> I love my theorist colleagues -- <eob> my theorist colleagues wrote <eol> 500 papers about this little bump. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The world of particle physics <eol> had been flipped on its head. <eob>
But what was it about this particular bump <eob> that caused thousands of physicists <eol> to collectively lose their cool? <eob>
This little bump was unique. <eob>
This little bump indicated <eob> that we were seeing an unexpectedly <eol> large number of collisions <eob> whose debris consisted <eol> of only two photons, <eob> two particles of light. <eob>
And that's rare. <eob>
Particle collisions are not <eol> like automobile collisions. <eob>
They have different rules. <eob>
When two particles collide <eol> at almost the speed of light, <eob> the quantum world takes over. <eob>
And in the quantum world, <eob> these two particles <eol> can briefly create a new particle <eob> that lives for a tiny fraction of a second <eob> before splitting into other particles <eol> that hit our detector. <eob>
Imagine a car collision <eol> where the two cars vanish upon impact, <eob> a bicycle appears in their place -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And then that bicycle explodes <eol> into two skateboards, <eob> which hit our detector. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Hopefully, not literally. <eob> They're very expensive. <eob>
Events where only two photons <eol> hit out detector are very rare. <eob>
And because of the special <eol> quantum properties of photons, <eob> there's a very small number <eol> of possible new particles -- <eob> these mythical bicycles -- <eob> that can give birth to only two photons. <eob>
But one of these options is huge, <eob> and it has to do with <eol> that long-standing question <eob> that bothered me as a tiny little kid, <eob> about gravity. <eob>
Gravity may seem super strong to you, <eob> but it's actually crazily weak <eol> compared to the other forces of nature. <eob>
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump, <eob> but I can't pick a proton out of my hand. <eob>
The strength of gravity compared <eol> to the other forces of nature? <eob>
It's 10 to the minus 39. <eob>
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it. <eob>
Worse than that, <eob> all of the other known forces of nature <eol> are perfectly described <eob> by this thing we call the Standard Model, <eob> which is our current best description <eol> of nature at its smallest scales, <eob> and quite frankly, <eob> one of the most successful <eol> achievements of humankind -- <eob> except for gravity, which is absent <eol> from the Standard Model. <eob> It's crazy. <eob> It's almost as though most <eol> of gravity has gone missing. <eob>
We feel a little bit of it, <eob> but where's the rest of it? <eob> No one knows. <eob>
But one theoretical explanation <eol> proposes a wild solution. <eob>
You and I -- <eob> even you in the back -- <eob> we live in three dimensions of space. <eob>
I hope that's a <eol> non-controversial statement. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
All of the known particles also live <eol> in three dimensions of space. <eob>
In fact, a particle is just another name <eob> for an excitation <eol> in a three-dimensional field; <eob> a localized wobbling in space. <eob>
More importantly, all the math <eol> that we use to describe all this stuff <eob> assumes that there are only <eol> three dimensions of space. <eob>
But math is math, and we can play <eol> around with our math however we want. <eob>
And people have been playing around <eol> with extra dimensions of space <eob> for a very long time, <eob> but it's always been an abstract <eol> mathematical concept. <eob>
I mean, just look around you -- <eol> you at the back, look around -- <eob> there's clearly only <eol> three dimensions of space. <eob>
But what if that's not true? <eob>
What if the missing gravity is leaking <eol> into an extra-spatial dimension <eob> that's invisible to you and I? <eob>
What if gravity is just as strong <eol> as the other forces <eob> if you were to view it in this <eol> extra-spatial dimension, <eob> and what you and I experience <eol> is a tiny slice of gravity <eob> make it seem very weak? <eob>
If this were true, <eob> we would have to expand <eol> our Standard Model of particles <eob> to include an extra particle, <eol> a hyperdimensional particle of gravity, <eob> a special graviton that lives <eol> in extra-spatial dimensions. <eob>
I see the looks on your faces. <eob>
You should be asking me the question, <eob> "How in the world are we going to test <eol> this crazy, science fiction idea, <eob> stuck as we are in three dimensions?" <eob> The way we always do, <eob> by slamming together two protons -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
two particles of light. <eob> Hard enough that <eol> the collision reverberates <eob> into any extra-spatial dimensions <eol> that might be there, <eob> momentarily creating <eol> this hyperdimensional graviton <eob> that then snaps back <eol> into the three dimensions of the LHC <eob> and spits off two photons, <eob>
And this hypothetical, <eol> extra-dimensional graviton <eob> is one of the only possible, <eol> hypothetical new particles <eob> that has the special quantum properties <eob> that could give birth to our little, <eol> two-photon bump. <eob>
So, the possibility of explaining <eol> the mysteries of gravity <eob> and of discovering extra <eol> dimensions of space -- <eob> perhaps now you get a sense <eob> as to why thousands of physics geeks <eol> collectively lost their cool <eob> over our little, two-photon bump. <eob>
A discovery of this type <eol> would rewrite the textbooks. <eob>
But remember, <eob> the message from us experimentalists <eob> that actually were doing <eol> this work at the time, <eob> was very clear: <eob> we need more data. <eob>
With more data, <eob> the little bump will either turn into <eol> a nice, crisp Nobel Prize -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or the extra data will fill in <eol> the space around the bump <eob> and turn it into a nice, smooth line. <eob>
So we took more data, <eob> and with five times the data, <eol> several months later, <eob> our little bump <eob> turned into a smooth line. <eob>
The news reported on a "huge disappointment," on "faded hopes," <eob> and on particle physicists "being sad." <eob> Given the tone of the coverage, <eob> you'd think that we had decided <eol> to shut down the LHC and go home. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But that's not what we did. <eob> But why not? <eob> I mean, if I didn't discover <eol> a particle -- and I didn't -- <eob> if I didn't discover a particle, <eol> why am I here talking to you? <eob>
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame <eob> and go home? <eob>
Particle physicists are explorers. <eob> And very much of what we do <eol> is cartography. <eob>
Let me put it this way: forget <eol> about the LHC for a second. <eob>
Imagine you are a space explorer <eol> arriving at a distant planet, <eob> searching for aliens. <eob>
What is your first task? <eob>
To immediately orbit the planet, <eol> land, take a quick look around <eob> for any big, obvious signs of life, <eob> and report back to home base. <eob>
That's the stage we're at now. <eob>
We took a first look at the LHC <eob> for any new, big, <eol> obvious-to-spot particles, <eob> and we can report that there are none. <eob>
We saw a weird-looking alien bump <eol> on a distant mountain, <eob> but once we got closer, <eol> we saw it was a rock. <eob>
But then what do we do? <eob>
Do we just give up and fly away? <eob> Absolutely not; <eob> we would be terrible scientists if we did. <eob>
No, we spend the next couple <eol> of decades exploring, <eob> mapping out the territory, <eob> sifting through the sand <eol> with a fine instrument, <eob> peeking under every stone, <eob> drilling under the surface. <eob>
New particles can either <eol> show up immediately <eob> as big, obvious-to-spot bumps, <eob> or they can only reveal themselves <eol> after years of data taking. <eob>
Humanity has just begun its exploration <eol> at the LHC at this big high energy, <eob> and we have much searching to do. <eob>
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years, <eol> we still find no new particles? <eob>
We build a bigger machine. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We search at higher energies. <eob>
We search at higher energies. <eob>
Planning is already underway <eol> for a 100-kilometer tunnel <eob> that will collide particles <eol> at 10 times the energy of the LHC. <eob>
We don't decide where <eol> nature places new particles. <eob>
We only decide to keep exploring. <eob>
But what if, even after <eol> a 100-kilometer tunnel <eob> or a 500-kilometer tunnel <eob> or a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space <eob> between the Earth and the Moon, <eob> we still find no new particles? <eob>
Then perhaps we're doing <eol> particle physics wrong. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Perhaps we need to rethink things. <eob>
Maybe we need more resources, <eol> technology, expertise <eob> than what we currently have. <eob>
We already use artificial intelligence <eol> and machine learning techniques <eob> in parts of the LHC, <eob> but imagine designing <eol> a particle physics experiment <eob> using such sophisticated algorithms <eob> that it could teach itself to discover <eol> a hyperdimensional graviton. <eob>
But what if? <eob> What if the ultimate question: <eob> What if even artificial intelligence <eol> can't help us answer our questions? <eob>
What if these open questions, <eol> for centuries, <eob> are destined to be unanswered <eol> for the foreseeable future? <eob>
What if the stuff that's bothered me <eol> since I was a little kid <eob> is destined to be unanswered <eol> in my lifetime? <eob>
Then that ... <eob> will be even more fascinating. <eob>
We will be forced to think <eol> in completely new ways. <eob>
We'll have to go back to our assumptions, <eob> and determine if there was <eol> a flaw somewhere. <eob>
And we'll need to encourage more people <eol> to join us in studying science <eob> since we need fresh eyes <eol> on these century-old problems. <eob>
I don't have the answers, <eol> and I'm still searching for them. <eob>
But someone -- maybe <eol> she's in school right now, <eob> maybe she's not even born yet -- <eob> could eventually guide us to see physics <eol> in a completely new way, <eob> and to point out that perhaps <eol> we're just asking the wrong questions. <eob>
Which would not be the end of physics, <eob> but a novel beginning. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Here's a startling fact: <eob> in the 45 years since the introduction <eol> of the automated teller machine, <eob> those vending machines that dispense cash, <eob> the number of human bank tellers employed <eol> in the United States <eob> has roughly doubled, <eob> from about a quarter of a million <eol> to a half a million. <eob>
A quarter of a million <eol> in 1970 to about a half a million today, <eob> with 100,000 added since the year 2000. <eob>
These facts, revealed in a recent book <eob> by Boston University economist James Bessen, <eob> raise an intriguing question: <eob> what are all those tellers doing, <eob> and why hasn't automation eliminated <eol> their employment by now? <eob>
If you think about it, <eob> many of the great inventions <eol> of the last 200 years <eob> were designed to replace human labor. <eob>
Tractors were developed <eob> to substitute mechanical power <eol> for human physical toil. <eob>
Assembly lines were engineered <eob> to replace inconsistent human handiwork <eob> with machine perfection. <eob>
Computers were programmed to swap out <eob> error-prone, inconsistent <eol> human calculation <eob> with digital perfection. <eob>
These inventions have worked. <eob>
We no longer dig ditches by hand, <eob> pound tools out of wrought iron <eob> or do bookkeeping using actual books. <eob>
And yet, the fraction of US adults <eol> employed in the labor market <eob> is higher now in 2016 <eob> than it was 125 years ago, <eol> in 1890, <eob> and it's risen in just about every decade <eob> in the intervening 125 years. <eob>
This poses a paradox. <eob> Our machines increasingly do <eol> our work for us. <eob>
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant <eol> and our skills obsolete? <eob>
Why are there still so many jobs? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm going to try to answer <eol> that question tonight, <eob> and along the way, I'm going to tell you <eol> what this means for the future of work <eob> and the challenges that automation does <eol> and does not pose <eob> for our society. <eob>
Why are there so many jobs? <eob>
There are actually two fundamental <eol> economic principles at stake. <eob>
One has to do with human genius <eob> and creativity. <eob>
The other has to do <eol> with human insatiability, <eob> or greed, if you like. <eob>
I'm going to call the first <eol> of these the O-ring principle, <eob> and it determines the type of work that we do. <eob>
The second principle <eol> is the never-get-enough principle, <eob> and it determines how many jobs <eol> there actually are. <eob>
Let's start with the O-ring. <eob>
ATMs, automated teller machines, <eob> had two countervailing effects <eol> on bank teller employment. <eob>
As you would expect, <eol> they replaced a lot of teller tasks. <eob>
The number of tellers per branch fell <eol> by about a third. <eob>
But banks quickly discovered <eol> that it also was cheaper to open new branches, <eob> and the number of bank branches <eol> increased by about 40 percent <eob> in the same time period. <eob>
The net result was more branches <eol> and more tellers. <eob>
But those tellers were doing <eol> somewhat different work. <eob>
As their routine, cash-handling tasks receded, <eob> they became less like checkout clerks <eob> and more like salespeople, <eob> forging relationships with customers, <eob> solving problems <eob> and introducing them <eol> to new products like credit cards, loans and investments: <eob> more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job. <eob>
There's a general principle here. <eob>
Most of the work that we do <eob> requires a multiplicity of skills, <eob> and brains and brawn, <eob> technical expertise and intuitive mastery, <eob> perspiration and inspiration <eol> in the words of Thomas Edison. <eob>
In general, automating some <eol> subset of those tasks <eob> doesn't make the other ones unnecessary. <eob>
In fact, it makes them more important. <eob>
It increases their economic value. <eob>
Let me give you a stark example. <eob>
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger <eob> exploded and crashed back down to Earth <eob> less than two minutes after takeoff. <eob>
The cause of that crash, it turned out, <eob> was an inexpensive rubber <eol> O-ring in the booster rocket <eob> that had frozen on the launchpad the night before <eob> and failed catastrophically <eol> moments after takeoff. <eob>
In this multibillion dollar enterprise <eob> that simple rubber O-ring <eob> made the difference <eol> between mission success <eob> and the calamitous death <eol> of seven astronauts. <eob>
An ingenious metaphor <eol> for this tragic setting <eob> is the O-ring production function, <eob> named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer <eob> after the Challenger disaster. <eob>
The O-ring production function <eol> conceives of the work <eob> as a series of interlocking steps, <eob> links in a chain. <eob>
Every one of those links <eol> must hold for the mission to succeed. <eob>
If any of them fails, <eob> the mission, or the product <eol> or the service, <eob> comes crashing down. <eob>
This precarious situation <eol> has a surprisingly positive implication, <eob> which is that improvements <eob> in the reliability <eol> of any one link in the chain <eob> increases the value <eol> of improving any of the other links. <eob>
Concretely, if most of the links <eol> are brittle and prone to breakage, <eob> the fact that your link <eol> is not that reliable <eob> is not that important. <eob>
Probably something else will break anyway. <eob>
But as all the other links <eol> become robust and reliable, <eob> the importance of your link <eol> becomes more essential. <eob>
In the limit, everything depends upon it. <eob>
The reason the O-ring was critical <eol> to space shuttle Challenger <eob> is because everything else worked perfectly. <eob>
If the Challenger were kind of <eol> the space era equivalent <eob> of Microsoft Windows 2000 -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
the reliability of the O-ring <eol> wouldn't have mattered <eob> because the machine <eol> would have crashed. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Here's the broader point. <eob>
In much of the work that we do, <eol> we are the O-rings. <eob>
Yes, ATMs could do certain <eol> cash-handling tasks <eob> faster and better than tellers, <eob> but that didn't make tellers <eol> superfluous. <eob>
It increased the importance <eol> of their problem-solving skills <eob> and their relationships with customers. <eob>
The same principle applies <eol> if we're building a building, <eob> if we're diagnosing <eol> and caring for a patient, <eob> or if we are teaching a class <eob> to a roomful of high schoolers. <eob>
As our tools improve, <eob> technology magnifies our leverage <eob> and increases the importance <eol> of our expertise <eob> and our judgment and our creativity. <eob>
And that brings me to the second principle: <eob> never get enough. <eob>
You may be thinking, OK, <eol> O-ring, got it, <eob> that says the jobs that people <eol> do will be important. <eob>
They can't be done by machines, <eol> but they still need to be done. <eob>
But that doesn't tell me how many jobs <eol> there will need to be. <eob> If you think about it, <eob> isn't it kind of self-evident <eob> that once we get sufficiently productive <eol> at something, <eob> we've basically worked <eol> our way out of a job? <eob>
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment <eob> was on farms. <eob>
Today, it's less than two percent. <eob>
Why are there so few farmers today? <eob>
It's not because we're eating less. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
A century of productivity growth in farming <eob> means that now, <eol> a couple of million farmers <eob> can feed a nation of 320 million. <eob>
That's amazing progress, <eob> but it also means there are <eol> only so many O-ring jobs left in farming. <eob>
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs. <eob>
Farming is only one example. <eob>
There are many others like it. <eob>
But what's true <eol> about a single product or service or industry <eob> has never been true <eol> about the economy as a whole. <eob>
Many of the industries <eol> in which we now work -- <eob> health and medicine, <eob> finance and insurance, <eob> electronics and computing -- <eob> were tiny or barely existent a century ago. <eob>
Many of the products <eol> that we spend a lot of our money on -- <eob> air conditioners, sport utility vehicles, <eob> computers and mobile devices -- <eob> were unattainably expensive, <eob> or just hadn't been invented <eol> a century ago. <eob>
As automation frees our time, increases <eol> the scope of what is possible, <eob> we invent new products, <eol> new ideas, new services <eob> that command our attention, <eob> occupy our time <eob> and spur consumption. <eob>
You may think some of these things <eol> are frivolous -- <eob> extreme yoga, adventure tourism, <eob> Pokémon GO -- <eob> and I might agree with you. <eob>
But people desire these things, <eol> and they're willing to work hard for them. <eob>
The average worker in 2015 <eob> wanting to attain the average <eol> living standard in 1915 <eob> could do so by working <eol> just 17 weeks a year, <eob> one third of the time. <eob>
But most people don't choose to do that. <eob>
They are willing to work hard <eob> to harvest the technological bounty <eol> that is available to them. <eob>
Material abundance has never eliminated <eol> perceived scarcity. <eob>
In the words of economist <eol> Thorstein Veblen, <eob> invention is the mother of necessity. <eob>
Now... <eob> So if you accept these two principles, <eob> the O-ring principle <eol> and the never-get-enough principle, <eob> then you agree with me. <eob> There will be jobs. <eob>
Does that mean <eol> there's nothing to worry about? <eob>
Automation, employment, robots and jobs -- <eob> it'll all take care of itself? <eob> No. <eob> That is not my argument. <eob>
Automation creates wealth <eob> by allowing us to do more work <eol> in less time. <eob>
There is no economic law <eob> that says that we will use <eol> that wealth well, <eob> and that is worth worrying about. <eob>
Consider two countries, <eob> Norway and Saudi Arabia. <eob>
Both oil-rich nations, <eob> it's like they have money <eol> spurting out of a hole in the ground. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But they haven't used that wealth <eol> equally well to foster human prosperity, <eob> human prospering. <eob>
Norway is a thriving democracy. <eob>
By and large, its citizens work <eol> and play well together. <eob>
It's typically numbered <eol> between first and fourth <eob> in rankings of national happiness. <eob>
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy <eob> in which many citizens lack a path <eol> for personal advancement. <eob>
It's typically ranked 35th among <eol> nations in happiness, <eob> which is low for such a wealthy nation. <eob>
Just by way of comparison, <eob> the US is typically ranked <eol> around 12th or 13th. <eob>
The difference between these two countries <eob> is not their wealth <eob> and it's not their technology. <eob>
It's their institutions. <eob>
Norway has invested to build a society <eob> with opportunity and economic mobility. <eob>
Saudi Arabia has raised <eol> living standards <eob> while frustrating many other human strivings. <eob>
Two countries, both wealthy, <eob> not equally well off. <eob>
And this brings me to the challenge <eol> that we face today, <eob> the challenge that automation poses for us. <eob>
The challenge is not <eol> that we're running out of work. <eob>
The US has added 14 million jobs <eob> since the depths of the Great Recession. <eob>
The challenge is that many of those jobs <eob> are not good jobs, <eob> and many citizens cannot qualify <eol> for the good jobs <eob> that are being created. <eob>
Employment growth in the United States <eol> and in much of the developed world <eob> looks something like a barbell <eob> with increasing poundage on either <eol> end of the bar. <eob>
On the one hand, <eob> you have high-education, <eol> high-wage jobs <eob> like doctors and nurses, <eol> programmers and engineers, <eob> marketing and sales managers. <eob>
Employment is robust in these jobs, <eol> employment growth. <eob>
Similarly, employment growth <eol> is robust in many low-skill, <eob> low-education jobs like food service, <eob> cleaning, security, <eob> home health aids. <eob>
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking <eob> in many middle-education, <eol> middle-wage, middle-class jobs, <eob> like blue-collar production <eol> and operative positions <eob> and white-collar clerical and sales positions. <eob>
The reasons behind this contracting middle <eob> are not mysterious. <eob>
Many of those middle-skill jobs <eob> use well-understood rules <eol> and procedures <eob> that can increasingly be codified in software <eob> and executed by computers. <eob>
The challenge that this phenomenon creates, <eob> what economists call <eol> employment polarization, <eob> is that it knocks out rungs <eol> in the economic ladder, <eob> shrinks the size <eol> of the middle class <eob> and threatens to make us <eol> a more stratified society. <eob>
On the one hand, <eob> a set of highly paid, <eol> highly educated professionals <eob> doing interesting work, <eob> on the other, a large number <eol> of citizens in low-paid jobs <eob> whose primary responsibility <eol> is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent. <eob>
That is not my vision of progress, <eob> and I doubt that it is yours. <eob>
But here is some encouraging news. <eob>
We have faced equally momentous <eol> economic transformations in the past, <eob> and we have come through them successfully. <eob>
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, <eob> when automation was eliminating vast <eol> numbers of agricultural jobs -- <eob> remember that tractor? -- <eob> the farm states faced a threat <eol> of mass unemployment, <eob> a generation of youth no longer <eol> needed on the farm <eob> but not prepared for industry. <eob>
Rising to this challenge, <eob> they took the radical step <eob> of requiring <eol> that their entire youth population <eob> remain in school and continue their education <eob> to the ripe old age of 16. <eob>
This was called the high school movement, <eob> and it was a radically <eol> expensive thing to do. <eob>
Not only did they have <eol> to invest in the schools, <eob> but those kids couldn't work at their jobs. <eob>
It also turned out to be <eol> one of the best investments <eob> the US made in the 20th century. <eob>
It gave us the most skilled, <eol> the most flexible <eob> and the most productive workforce in the world. <eob>
To see how well this worked, imagine <eol> taking the labor force of 1899 <eob> and bringing them into the present. <eob>
Despite their strong backs <eol> and good characters, <eob> many of them would lack the basic <eol> literacy and numeracy skills <eob> to do all but the most mundane jobs. <eob>
Many of them would be unemployable. <eob>
What this example highlights <eol> is the primacy of our institutions, <eob> most especially our schools, <eob> in allowing us to reap the harvest <eob> of our technological prosperity. <eob>
It's foolish to say <eol> there's nothing to worry about. <eob>
Clearly we can get this wrong. <eob>
If the US had not invested in its schools <eol> and in its skills <eob> a century ago with the high school movement, <eob> we would be a less prosperous, <eob> a less mobile and probably <eol> a lot less happy society. <eob>
But it's equally foolish to say <eol> that our fates are sealed. <eob>
That's not decided by the machines. <eob>
It's not even decided by the market. <eob>
It's decided by us <eol> and by our institutions. <eob>
Now, I started this talk with a paradox. <eob>
Our machines increasingly do our work for us. <eob> Why doesn't that make our labor superfluous, <eob> our skills redundant? <eob>
Isn't it obvious that the road <eol> to our economic and social hell <eob> is paved with our own great inventions? <eob>
History has repeatedly <eol> offered an answer to that paradox. <eob>
The first part of the answer is that <eob> technology magnifies our leverage, <eob> increases the importance, the added value <eob> of our expertise, our judgment and our creativity. <eob>
That's the O-ring. <eob>
The second part of the answer <eol> is our endless inventiveness <eob> and bottomless desires <eob> means that we <eob> never get enough, <eob> never get enough. <eob>
There's always new work to do. <eob>
Adjusting to the rapid pace <eol> of technological change <eob> creates real challenges, <eob> seen most clearly in our polarized labor market <eob> and the threat that it poses <eol> to economic mobility. <eob>
Rising to this challenge <eob> is not automatic. <eob> It's not costless. <eob> It's not easy. <eob> But it is feasible. <eob>
And here is some encouraging news. <eob>
Because of our amazing productivity, <eob> we're rich. <eob>
Of course we can afford to invest <eol> in ourselves and in our children <eob> as America did a hundred years ago <eol> with the high school movement. <eob>
Arguably, we can't afford not to. <eob>
Now, you may be thinking, <eob> Professor Autor <eol> has told us a heartwarming tale <eob> about the distant past, <eob> the recent past, <eob> maybe the present, <eol> but probably not the future. <eob>
Because everybody knows <eol> that this time is different. <eob> Right? Is this time different? <eob>
Of course this time is different. <eob>
Every time is different. <eob>
On numerous occasions <eol> in the last 200 years, <eob> scholars and activists have raised the alarm <eob> that we are running out of work <eol> and making ourselves obsolete: <eob> for example, the Luddites <eol> in the early 1800s; <eob> US Secretary of Labor James Davis <eob> in the mid-1920s; <eob> Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief in 1982; <eob> and of course, many scholars, <eob> pundits, technologists <eob> and media figures today. <eob>
These predictions strike me as arrogant. <eob>
These self-proclaimed oracles <eol> are in effect saying, <eob> "If I can't think of what people <eol> will do for work in the future, <eob> then you, me and our kids <eob> aren't going to think of it either." <eob> I don't have the guts <eob> to take that bet against human ingenuity. <eob>
Look, I can't tell you what people <eol> are going to do for work <eob> a hundred years from now. <eob>
But the future doesn't hinge <eol> on my imagination. <eob>
If I were a farmer in Iowa <eol> in the year 1900, <eob> and an economist from the 21st century <eol> teleported down to my field <eob> and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor, <eob> in the next hundred years, <eob> agricultural employment is going to fall <eol> from 40 percent of all jobs <eob> to two percent <eob> purely due to rising productivity. <eob>
What do you think the other 38 percent <eol> of workers are going to do?" <eob> I would not have said, "Oh, we got this. <eob>
We'll do app development, <eol> radiological medicine, <eob> yoga instruction, Bitmoji." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I wouldn't have had a clue. <eob>
But I hope I would have had <eol> the wisdom to say, <eob> "Wow, a 95 percent reduction <eol> in farm employment <eob> with no shortage of food. <eob>
That's an amazing amount of progress. <eob>
I hope that humanity <eol> finds something remarkable to do <eob> with all of that prosperity." <eob>
And by and large, I would say that it has. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So when you look out <eol> at the stars at night, <eob> it's amazing what you can see. <eob> It's beautiful. <eob> But what's more amazing <eol> is what you can't see, <eob> because what we know now <eob> is that around every star <eol> or almost every star, <eob> there's a planet, <eob> or probably a few. <eob>
So what this picture isn't showing you <eob> are all the planets that we know about <eob> out there in space. <eob>
But when we think about planets, <eol> we tend to think of faraway things <eob> that are very different from our own. <eob>
But here we are on a planet, <eob> and there are so many things <eol> that are amazing about Earth <eob> that we're searching far and wide <eol> to find things that are like that. <eob>
And when we're searching, <eol> we're finding amazing things. <eob>
But I want to tell you <eol> about an amazing thing here on Earth. <eob>
And that is that every minute, <eob> 400 pounds of hydrogen <eob> and almost seven pounds of helium <eob> escape from Earth into space. <eob>
And this is gas that is going off <eol> and never coming back. <eob>
So hydrogen, helium <eol> and many other things <eob> make up what's known as the Earth's atmosphere. <eob>
The atmosphere is just these gases <eol> that form a thin blue line <eob> that's seen here from the International <eol> Space Station, <eob> a photograph that some astronauts took. <eob>
And this tenuous veneer around our planet <eob> is what allows life to flourish. <eob>
It protects our planet <eol> from too many impacts, <eob> from meteorites and the like. <eob>
And it's such an amazing phenomenon <eob> that the fact that it's disappearing <eob> should frighten you, at least a little bit. <eob>
So this process is something that I study <eob> and it's called atmospheric escape. <eob>
So atmospheric escape <eol> is not specific to planet Earth. <eob>
It's part of what it means to be <eol> a planet, if you ask me, <eob> because planets, not just here on Earth <eol> but throughout the universe, <eob> can undergo atmospheric escape. <eob>
And the way it happens actually tells us <eol> about planets themselves. <eob>
Because when you think <eol> about the solar system, <eob> you might think <eol> about this picture here. <eob>
And you would say, well, <eol> there are eight planets, maybe nine. <eob>
So for those of you <eol> who are stressed by this picture, <eob> I will add somebody for you. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Courtesy of New Horizons, <eol> we're including Pluto. <eob>
And the thing here is, <eob> for the purposes of this talk <eol> and atmospheric escape, <eob> Pluto is a planet in my mind, <eob> in the same way that planets around <eol> other stars that we can't see <eob> are also planets. <eob>
So fundamental characteristics of planets <eob> include the fact that they are bodies <eob> that are bound together by gravity. <eob>
So it's a lot of material <eol> just stuck together <eob> with this attractive force. <eob>
And these bodies are so big <eol> and have so much gravity. <eob>
That's why they're round. <eob>
So when you look at all of these, <eob> including Pluto, <eob> they're round. <eob>
So you can see that gravity <eol> is really at play here. <eob>
But another fundamental characteristic about planets <eob> is what you don't see here, <eob> and that's the star, the Sun, <eob> that all of the planets in the solar system <eol> are orbiting around. <eob>
And that's fundamentally <eol> driving atmospheric escape. <eob>
The reason that fundamentally stars <eol> drive atmospheric escape from planets <eob> is because stars offer planets particles and light and heat <eob> that can cause the atmospheres to go away. <eob>
So if you think <eol> of a hot-air balloon, <eob> or you look at this picture <eol> of lanterns in Thailand at a festival, <eob> you can see that hot air can propel gasses upward. <eob>
And if you have enough energy <eol> and heating, <eob> which our Sun does, <eob> that gas, which is so light <eol> and only bound by gravity, <eob> it can escape into space. <eob>
And so this is what's actually <eol> causing atmospheric escape <eob> here on Earth and also on other planets -- <eob> that interplay between heating from the star <eob> and overcoming the force <eol> of gravity on the planet. <eob>
So I've told you that it happens <eob> at the rate of 400 pounds <eol> a minute for hydrogen <eob> and almost seven pounds for helium. <eob>
But what does that look like? <eob>
Well, even in the '80s, <eob> we took pictures of the Earth <eob> in the ultraviolet <eob> using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft. <eob>
So these two images of the Earth <eob> show you what that glow <eol> of escaping hydrogen looks like, <eob> shown in red. <eob>
And you can also see other features <eol> like oxygen and nitrogen <eob> in that white glimmer <eob> in the circle showing you the auroras <eob> and also some wisps around the tropics. <eob>
So these are pictures that conclusively show us <eob> that our atmosphere isn't just tightly <eol> bound to us here on Earth <eob> but it's actually reaching out far into space, <eob> and at an alarming rate, I might add. <eob>
But the Earth is not alone in undergoing <eol> atmospheric escape. <eob>
Mars, our nearest neighbor, <eol> is much smaller than Earth, <eob> so it has much less gravity with which <eol> to hold on to its atmosphere. <eob>
And so even though Mars has an atmosphere, <eob> we can see it's much thinner <eol> than the Earth's. <eob> Just look at the surface. <eob> You see craters indicating <eol> that it didn't have an atmosphere <eob> that could stop those impacts. <eob>
Also, we see that it's the "red planet," <eob> and atmospheric escape plays a role <eob> in Mars being red. <eob>
That's because we think Mars used <eol> to have a wetter past, <eob> and when water had enough energy, <eol> it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen, <eob> and hydrogen being so light, <eol> it escaped into space, <eob> and the oxygen that was left <eob> oxidized or rusted the ground, <eob> making that familiar rusty red color <eol> that we see. <eob>
So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars <eob> and say that atmospheric escape probably happened, <eob> but NASA has a probe that's currently at Mars <eol> called the MAVEN satellite, <eob> and its actual job <eol> is to study atmospheric escape. <eob>
It's the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft. <eob>
And results from it have already shown <eol> pictures very similar <eob> to what you've seen here on Earth. <eob>
We've long known that Mars <eol> was losing its atmosphere, <eob> but we have some stunning pictures. <eob>
Here, for example, you can see <eol> in the red circle <eob> is the size of Mars, <eob> and in blue you can see <eol> the hydrogen escaping away from the planet. <eob>
So it's reaching out more than 10 times <eol> the size of the planet, <eob> far enough away that it's no longer <eol> bound to that planet. <eob>
It's escaping off into space. <eob>
And this helps us confirm ideas, <eob> like why Mars is red, <eol> from that lost hydrogen. <eob>
But hydrogen isn't the only gas <eol> that's lost. <eob>
I mentioned helium on Earth <eol> and some oxygen and nitrogen, <eob> and from MAVEN we can also look at the oxygen <eol> being lost from Mars. <eob>
And you can see <eol> that because oxygen is heavier, <eob> it can't get as far as the hydrogen, <eob> but it's still escaping away from the planet. <eob>
You don't see it all confined <eol> into that red circle. <eob>
So the fact that we not only see <eol> atmospheric escape on our own planet <eob> but we can study it elsewhere and send spacecraft <eob> allows us to learn about the past of planets <eob> but also about planets in general <eob> and Earth's future. <eob>
So one way we actually <eol> can learn about the future <eob> is by planets so far away <eol> that we can't see. <eob>
And I should just note though, <eol> before I go on to that, <eob> I'm not going to show you photos <eol> like this of Pluto, <eob> which might be disappointing, <eob> but that's because we don't have them yet. <eob>
But the New Horizons mission <eol> is currently studying atmospheric escape <eob> being lost from the planet. <eob>
So stay tuned and look out for that. <eob>
But the planets <eol> that I did want to talk about <eob> are known as transiting exoplanets. <eob>
So any planet orbiting a star <eol> that's not our Sun <eob> is called an exoplanet, or extrasolar planet. <eob>
And these planets that we call transiting <eob> have the special feature <eob> that if you look at <eol> that star in the middle, <eob> you'll see that actually <eol> it's blinking. <eob>
And the reason that it's blinking <eob> is because there are planets <eol> that are going past it all the time, <eob> and it's that special orientation <eob> where the planets are blocking <eol> the light from the star <eob> that allows us to see <eol> that light blinking. <eob>
And by surveying <eol> the stars in the night sky <eob> for this blinking motion, <eob> we are able to find planets. <eob>
This is how we've now been able <eol> to detect over 5,000 planets <eob> in our own Milky Way, <eob> and we know there are many more out there, <eol> like I mentioned. <eob>
So when we look at the light <eol> from these stars, <eob> what we see, like I said, <eol> is not the planet itself, <eob> but you actually see <eol> a dimming of the light <eob> that we can record in time. <eob>
So the light drops <eol> as the planet decreases in front of the star, <eob> and that's that blinking <eol> that you saw before. <eob>
So not only do we detect the planets <eob> but we can look at this light <eol> in different wavelengths. <eob>
So I mentioned looking at the Earth <eol> and Mars in ultraviolet light. <eob>
If we look at transiting exoplanets <eol> with the Hubble Space Telescope, <eob> we find that <eob> in the ultraviolet, <eob> you see much bigger blinking, <eol> much less light from the star, <eob> when the planet is passing in front. <eob>
And we think this is because you have <eol> an extended atmosphere of hydrogen <eob> all around the planet <eob> that's making it look puffier <eob> and thus blocking <eol> more of the light that you see. <eob>
So using this technique, we've actually <eol> been able to discover <eob> a few transiting exoplanets <eol> that are undergoing atmospheric escape. <eob>
And these planets can be <eol> called hot Jupiters, <eob> for some of the ones we've found. <eob>
And that's because <eol> they're gas planets like Jupiter, <eob> but they're so close to their star, <eob> about a hundred times closer than Jupiter. <eob>
And because there's all this lightweight <eol> gas that's ready to escape, <eob> and all this heating from the star, <eob> you have completely catastrophic <eol> rates of atmospheric escape. <eob>
So unlike our 400 pounds per minute <eol> of hydrogen being lost on Earth, <eob> for these planets, <eob> you're losing 1.3 billion pounds <eol> of hydrogen every minute. <eob>
So you might think, well, does this <eol> make the planet cease to exist? <eob> And this is a question <eol> that people wondered <eob> when they looked at our solar system, <eob> because planets closer to the Sun are rocky, <eob> and planets further away are bigger <eol> and more gaseous. <eob>
Could you have started <eol> with something like Jupiter <eob> that was actually close to the Sun, <eob> and get rid of all the gas in it? <eob>
We now think that if you start <eol> with something like a hot Jupiter, <eob> you actually can't end up <eol> with Mercury or the Earth. <eob>
But if you started with something smaller, <eob> it's possible that enough gas <eol> would have gotten away <eob> that it would have significantly impacted it <eob> and left you with something <eol> very different than what you started with. <eob>
So all of this sounds sort of general, <eob> and we might think <eol> about the solar system, <eob> but what does this have to do <eol> with us here on Earth? <eob>
Well, in the far future, <eob> the Sun is going to get brighter. <eob>
And as that happens, <eob> the heating that we find from the Sun <eol> is going to become very intense. <eob>
In the same way that you see gas <eol> streaming off from a hot Jupiter, <eob> gas is going to stream off from the Earth. <eob>
And so what we can look forward to, <eob> or at least prepare for, <eob> is the fact that in the far future, <eob> the Earth is going to look more like Mars. <eob>
Our hydrogen, from water <eol> that is broken down, <eob> is going to escape into space more rapidly, <eob> and we're going to be left <eol> with this dry, reddish planet. <eob>
So don't fear, it's not <eol> for a few billion years, <eob> so there's some time to prepare. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But I wanted you to be aware <eol> of what's going on, <eob> not just in the future, <eob> but atmospheric escape <eol> is happening as we speak. <eob>
So there's a lot of amazing science <eol> that you hear about happening in space <eob> and planets that are far away, <eob> and we are studying these planets <eol> to learn about these worlds. <eob>
But as we learn about Mars or exoplanets <eol> like hot Jupiters, <eob> we find things like atmospheric escape <eob> that tell us a lot more about <eol> our planet here on Earth. <eob>
So consider that the next time <eol> you think that space is far away. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're going to share <eol> a lot of secrets today, you and I, <eob> and in doing so, I hope that we can lift <eob> some of the shame <eol> many of us feel about sex. <eob>
How many here have ever been <eol> catcalled by a stranger? <eob> Lots of women. <eob> For me, the time I remember best <eob> is when that stranger <eol> was a student of mine. <eob>
He came up to me after class that night <eob> and his words confirmed <eol> what I already knew: <eob> "I am so sorry, professor. <eob>
If I had known it was you, <eol> I would never have said those things. <eob> "(Laughter) <eob> I wasn't a person to him <eol> until I was his professor. <eob>
This concept, called objectification, <eob> is the foundation of sexism, <eob> and we see it reinforced <eol> through every aspect of our lives. <eob>
We see it in the government <eob> that refuses to punish men <eob> for raping women. <eob>
We see it in advertisements. <eob>
How many of you have seen <eol> an advertisement <eob> that uses a woman's breast to sell <eol> an entirely unrelated product? <eob>
Or movie after movie after movie <eob> that portrays women <eol> as only love interests? <eob>
These examples might seem <eol> inconsequential and harmless, <eob> but they're insidious, <eob> slowly building into a culture <eol> that refuses to see women as people. <eob>
We see this in the school <eol> that sends home a 10-year-old girl <eob> because her clothes were a distraction <eol> to boys trying to learn, <eob> or the government <eob> that refuses to punish men <eob> for raping women <eob> over and over, <eob> or the woman who is killed <eob> because she asked a man to stop grinding <eol> on her on the dance floor. <eob>
Media plays a large role in perpetuating <eol> the objectification of women. <eob>
Let's consider <eol> the classic romantic comedy. <eob>
We're typically introduced <eol> to two kinds of women in these movies, <eob> two kinds of desirable women, anyway. <eob>
The first is the sexy bombshell. <eob>
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman <eol> with the perfect body. <eob>
Our leading man <eol> has no trouble identifying her <eob> and even less trouble having sex with her. <eob>
The second is our leading lady, <eob> the beautiful but demure woman <eol> our leading man falls in love with <eob> despite not noticing her at first <eob> or not liking her if he did. <eob>
The first is the slut. <eob>
She is to be consumed and forgotten. <eob>
She is much too available. <eob>
The second is desirable but modest, <eob> and therefore worthy <eol> of our leading man's future babies. <eob> Marriage material. <eob> We're actually told <eol> that women have two roles, <eob> but these two roles have a difficult time <eol> existing within the same woman. <eob>
On the rare occasion <eol> that I share with a new acquaintance <eob> that I study sex, <eob> if they don't end <eol> the conversation right then, <eob> they're usually pretty intrigued. <eob> "Oh. Tell me more." <eob>
"Oh. Huh. <eob> Do pregnant people even have sex? <eob>
Have you thought <eol> about studying sexual desire <eob> or orgasms? <eob>
That would be interesting and sexy." <eob> Tell me. What are the first words <eol> that come to mind <eob> when you picture a pregnant woman? <eob>
I asked this question <eol> in a survey of over 500 adults, <eob> and most responded with "belly" or "round" <eob> and "cute." <eob> This didn't surprise me too much. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When we label an adult as cute, though, <eob> we take away a lot of their intelligence, <eob> their complexity. <eob>
We reduce them to childlike qualities. <eob>
I also asked heterosexual men <eob> to imagine a woman that they're <eol> partnered with is pregnant, <eob> and then asked women <eol> to imagine that they are pregnant, <eob> and then tell me <eol> the first words that come to mind <eob> when they imagine having sex. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Most of the responses were negative. <eob> "Gross." <eob> "Awkward." <eob> "Not sexy." "Odd." <eob> "Uncomfortable." <eob> "How?" <eob> "Not worth the trouble." <eol> "Not worth the risk." <eob> That last one really stuck with me. <eob>
We might think that because we divorce <eol> pregnant women and moms from sexuality, <eob> we are removing the constraints <eol> of sexual objectification. <eob>
They experience less sexism. Right? <eob> Not exactly. <eob> What happens instead <eol> is a different kind of objectification. <eob>
In my efforts to explain this to others, <eob> one conversation <eol> led to the Venus of Willendorf, <eob> a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed <eol> was a goddess of love and beauty, <eob> hence the name Venus. <eob>
This theory was later revised, though, <eob> when scholars noted <eol> the sculptor's obvious focus <eob> on the figurine's reproductive features: <eob> large breasts, <eol> considered ideal for nursing; <eob> a round, possibly pregnant belly; <eob> the remnants of red dye, <eol> alluding to menstruation or birth. <eob>
They also assumed that she was meant <eol> to be held or placed lying down <eob> because her tiny feet don't allow <eol> her to be freestanding. <eob>
She also had no face. <eob>
For this reason, it was assumed <eol> that she was a representation of fertility <eob> and not a portrait of a person. <eob>
She was an object. <eob>
In the history of her interpretation, <eob> she went from object <eol> of ideal beauty and love <eob> to object of reproduction. <eob>
I think this transition speaks more <eob> about the scholars <eol> who have interpreted her purpose <eob> than the actual purpose <eol> of the figurine herself. <eob>
When a woman becomes pregnant, <eob> she leaves the realm <eol> of men's sexual desire <eob> and slides into her reproductive <eol> and child-rearing role. <eob>
In doing so, she also becomes <eob> the property of the community, <eob> considered very important <eol> but only because she's pregnant. Right? <eob> I've taken to calling this <eol> the Willendorf effect, <eob> and once again we see it reinforced <eol> in many aspects of her life. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Has anyone here <eol> ever been visibly pregnant? <eob>
Yeah. Lots of you, right? <eob>
So how many of you ever had a stranger <eol> touch your belly during pregnancy, <eob> maybe without even asking <eol> your permission first? <eob>
Or told what you can and cannot eat <eob> by somebody who is not your doctor, <eol> your medical care provider? <eob>
Or asked private questions <eol> about your birth plan? <eob>
And then told why <eol> those choices are all wrong? <eob>
Yeah, me too. <eob>
Or had a server refuse <eol> to bring you a glass of wine? <eob>
This one might give you pause, <eol> I know, but stay with me. <eob>
This is a huge secret. <eob>
It is actually safe to drink <eol> in moderation during pregnancy. <eob>
Many of us don't know this <eob> because doctors don't trust <eol> pregnant women with this secret — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> especially if she's less educated <eol> or a woman of color. <eob>
What this tells us is, <eob> this Willendorf effect, <eol> it's also classist and racist. <eob>
It's present when the government reminds women <eob> with every new anti-choice bill <eob> that the contents <eol> of her uterus are not her own, <eob> or when an ob-gyn says, <eob> "While it's safe to have sex during pregnancy, <eob> sometimes you never know. <eob>
Better safe than sorry, right?" <eob> She's denied basic privacy <eol> and bodily autonomy <eob> under the guise of "be a good mother." <eob> We don't trust her <eol> to make her own decisions. <eob>
She's cute, remember? <eob>
When we tell women <eob> that sexual pleasure -- excuse me. <eob>
When we tell women <eob> that sex isn't worth <eol> the risk during pregnancy, <eob> what we're telling her is that her sexual pleasure <eol> doesn't matter. <eob> So what we are telling her <eol> is that she in fact doesn't matter, <eob> even though the needs of her fetus <eol> are not at odds with her own needs. <eob>
So medical providers, <eob> such as the American College <eol> of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <eob> have the opportunity to educate about the safety <eol> of sex during pregnancy. <eob>
So what do the experts say? <eob>
ACOG actually has <eol> no public official statement <eob> about the safety of sex during pregnancy. <eob>
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic <eol> is generally positive <eob> but presented with a caveat: <eob> "Although most women can safely <eol> have sex throughout pregnancy, <eob> sometimes it's best to be cautious." <eob> Some women don't want <eol> to have sex during pregnancy, <eob> and that's OK. <eob>
Some women do want <eol> to have sex during pregnancy, <eob> and that's OK, <eob> too. <eob>
What needs to stop <eol> is society telling women <eob> what they can and cannot do <eol> with their bodies. <eob> (Applause) <eob> Pregnant women are not faceless, <eol> identity-less vessels of reproduction <eob> who can't stand on their own two feet. <eob>
But the truth is, the real secret is, <eob> we tell all women that <eol> their sexual pleasure doesn't matter. <eob>
We refuse to even acknowledge <eol> that women who have sex with women <eob> or women who don't want children even exist. <eob> "Oh, it's just a phase... <eob> she just needs the right man <eol> to come along." Every time a woman has sex <eob> simply because it feels good, <eob> it is revolutionary. <eob> She is revolutionary. <eob> She is pushing back against society's insistence <eob> that she exist simply for men's pleasure <eob> or for reproduction. <eob>
A woman who prioritizes <eol> her sexual needs is scary, <eob> because a woman who prioritizes <eol> her sexual needs prioritizes herself. <eob> (Applause) <eob> That is a woman demanding <eol> that she be treated as an equal. <eob>
That is a woman who insists <eob> that you make room for her <eol> at the table of power, <eob> and that is the most terrifying of all <eob> because we can't make room for her <eob> without some of us giving up <eol> the extra space we hold. <eob> (Applause) <eob> I have one last secret for you. <eob>
I am the mother of two boys <eob> and we could use your help. <eob>
Even though my boys hear me say regularly <eob> that it's important for men <eol> to recognize women as equals <eob> and they see their father modeling this, <eob> we need what happens in the world <eol> to reinforce what happens in our home. <eob>
This is not a men's problem <eol> or a women's problem. <eob>
This is everyone's problem, <eob> and we all play a role <eol> in dismantling systems of inequality. <eob>
what they can and cannot do <eol> with their bodies. <eob> (Applause) <eob> For starters, we have got <eol> to stop telling women <eob> This includes not treating pregnant women <eol> like community property. <eob>
If you don't know her, <eol> don't even ask to touch her belly. <eob>
You wouldn't anybody else. <eob>
Don't tell her <eol> what she can and cannot eat. <eob>
Don't ask her private details <eol> about her medical decisions. <eob>
This also includes understanding <eob> that even if you are <eol> personally against abortion, <eob> you can still fight <eol> for a woman's right to choose. <eob>
When it comes to women's equality, <eol> the two need not oppose one another. <eob>
If you're somebody who has sex with women, <eob> prioritize her pleasure. <eob>
If you don't know how, ask. <eob>
If you have children — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> have conversations <eol> about sex as early as possible, <eob> because kids don't look up s-e-x <eol> in the dictionary anymore. <eob> They look it up on the internet. <eob>
And when you're having <eol> those conversations about sex, <eob> don't center them <eol> on reproduction only. <eob>
People have sex for many reasons, <eob> some because they want a baby, <eob> but most of us have sex <eol> because it feels good. <eob> Admit it. <eob> And regardless of whether <eol> you have children or not, <eob> support comprehensive sex education <eol> that doesn't shame our teenagers. <eob> (Applause) <eob> Nothing positive comes from shaming teens <eob> for their sexual desires, behaviors, <eob> other than positive STD and pregnancy tests. <eob>
Every single day, <eol> we are all given the opportunity <eob> to disrupt patterns of inequality. <eob>
I think we can all agree <eol> that it's worth the trouble to do so. <eob>
(Applause) <eob> Thank you. <eob>
I am a chef <eob> and a food policy guy, <eob> but I come from a whole <eol> family of teachers. <eob>
My sister is a special ed <eol> teacher in Chicago. <eob>
My father just retired <eol> after 25 years teaching fifth grade. <eob>
My aunt and uncle were professors. <eob>
My cousins all teach. <eob>
Everybody in my family, basically, <eol> teaches except for me. <eob>
They taught me that the only way <eol> to get the right answers <eob> is to ask the right questions. <eob>
So what are the right questions <eob> when it comes to improving <eol> the educational outcomes for our children? <eob>
There's obviously <eol> many important questions, <eob> but I think the following <eol> is a good place to start: <eob> What do we think the connection is <eob> between a child's growing mind <eob> and their growing body? <eob>
What can we expect our kids to learn <eob> if their diets are full of sugar <eol> and empty of nutrients? <eob>
What can they possibly learn <eob> if their bodies <eol> are literally going hungry? <eob>
And with all the resources <eol> that we are pouring into schools, <eob> we should stop and ask ourselves: <eob> Are we really setting our kids <eol> up for success? <eob>
Now, a few years ago, <eob> I was a judge on a cooking <eol> competition called "Chopped." <eob> Four chefs compete with mystery <eol> ingredients <eob> to see who can cook the best dishes. <eob>
Except for this episode -- <eol> it was a very special one. <eob>
Instead of four overzealous chefs <eol> trying to break into the limelight — <eob> something that I would know nothing about — <eob> (Laughter) these chefs were school chefs; <eob> you know, the women <eol> that you used to call "lunch ladies," <eob> but the ones I insist we call "school chefs." <eob> Now, these women — God bless these women — <eob> spend their day cooking for thousands of kids, <eob> breakfast and lunch, with only $2.68 per lunch, <eob> with only about a dollar of that actually <eol> going to the food. <eob>
In this episode, the main-course <eol> mystery ingredient was quinoa. <eob>
Now, I know it's been a long time <eob> since most of you have had a school lunch, <eob> and we've made a lot <eol> of progress on nutrition, <eob> but quinoa still is not a staple <eol> in most school cafeterias. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So this was a challenge. <eob> But the dish that I will never forget <eol> was cooked by a woman <eob> named Cheryl Barbara. <eob>
Cheryl was the nutrition director <eob> at High School in the Community <eol> in Connecticut. <eob>
She cooked this delicious pasta. <eob> It was amazing. <eob> It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage, <eob> kale, Parmesan cheese. <eob>
It was delicious, like, <eol> restaurant-quality good, except -- <eob> she basically just threw the quinoa, <eol> pretty much uncooked, <eob> into the dish. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> It was a strange choice, <eob> and it was super crunchy. <eob> So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing <eol> that you're supposed to do, <eob> and I asked her why she did that. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Cheryl responded, "Well, first, <eol> I don't know what quinoa is." <eob> "But I do know that it's a Monday, <eob> and that in my school, <eol> at High School in the Community, <eob> I always cook pasta." <eob>
See, Cheryl explained <eol> that for many of her kids, <eob> there were no meals on the weekends. <eob>
No meals on Saturday. <eob>
No meals on Sunday, either. <eob>
So she cooked pasta <eol> because she wanted to make sure <eob> she cooked something she knew <eol> her children would eat. <eob>
Something that would <eol> stick to their ribs, she said. <eob>
Something that would fill them up. <eob>
Cheryl talked about how, <eol> by the time Monday came, <eob> her kids' hunger pangs <eol> were so intense <eob> that they couldn't even begin <eol> to think about learning. <eob>
Food was the only thing on their mind. <eob> The only thing. <eob> And unfortunately, the stats -- <eol> they tell the same story. <eob>
So, let's put this <eol> into the context of a child. <eob>
And we're going to focus on <eob> the most important meal <eol> of the day, breakfast. <eob> Meet Allison. <eob> She's 12 years old, <eob> she's smart as a whip <eob> and she wants to be a physicist <eol> when she grows up. <eob>
If Allison goes to a school <eol> that serves a nutritious breakfast <eob> to all of their kids, <eob> here's what's going to follow. <eob>
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal, <eob> one with fruit and milk, <eol> one lower in sugar and salt, <eob> dramatically increase. <eob> Allison will have a lower rate <eol> of obesity than the average kid. <eob>
She'll have better behavior. <eob> She'll have better attendance, <eol> and she'll show up on time more often. <eob> Why? <eob> Well, because there's a good meal <eol> waiting for her at school. <eob>
Overall, Allison is in much better health <eob> than the average school kid. <eob>
So what about that kid <eob> who doesn't have a nutritious <eol> breakfast waiting for him? <eob> Well, meet Tommy. <eob> He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid. <eob>
He wants to be a doctor. <eob>
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten, <eob> he's already underperforming in math. <eob>
By the time he's in third grade, <eob> he's got lower math and reading scores. <eob>
By the time he's 11, <eob> it's more likely that Tommy will have <eol> to have repeated a grade. <eob>
Research shows that kids <eol> who do not have consistent nourishment, <eob> particularly at breakfast, <eob> have poor cognitive function overall. <eob>
So how widespread is this problem? <eob>
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive. <eob>
Let me give you two stats <eob> that seem like they're on opposite <eol> ends of the issue, <eob> but are actually two sides <eol> of the same coin. <eob>
On the one hand, <eob> one in six Americans are food insecure, <eob> including 16 million children — almost 20 percent — <eob> are food insecure. <eob>
In this city alone, in New York City, <eob> 474,000 kids under the age of 18 <eol> face hunger every year. <eob> It's crazy. <eob> On the other hand, <eob> diet and nutrition is the number one cause <eol> of preventable death and disease <eob> in this country, by far. <eob>
And fully a third of the kids <eol> that we've been talking about tonight <eob> are on track to have diabetes <eol> in their lifetime. <eob>
Now, what's hard <eol> to put together but is true <eob> is that, many times, <eol> these are the same children. <eob>
So they fill up on the unhealthy <eol> and cheap calories <eob> that surround them in their communities <eol> and that their families can afford. <eob>
But then by the end of the month, <eob> food stamps run out <eol> or hours get cut at work, <eob> and they don't have the money <eol> to cover the basic cost of food. <eob>
But we should be able <eol> to solve this problem, right? <eob>
We know what the answers are. <eob>
As part of my work at the White House, <eol> we instituted a program <eob> that for all schools that had 40 percent <eol> more low-income kids, <eob> we could serve breakfast and lunch <eol> to every kid in that school. <eob> For free. <eob>
This program has been <eol> incredibly successful, <eob> because it helped us overcome <eol> a very difficult barrier <eob> when it came to getting kids <eol> a nutritious breakfast. <eob>
And that was the barrier of stigma. <eob>
See, schools serve <eol> breakfast before school, <eob> and it was only available <eol> for the poor kids. <eob>
So everybody knew who was poor <eol> and who needed government help. <eob>
Now, all kids, no matter how much <eol> or how little their parents make, <eob> have a lot of pride. <eob> So what happened? <eob> Well, the schools that have <eol> implemented this program <eob> saw an increase in math and reading <eol> scores by 17.5 percent. <eob> 17.5 percent. <eob> And research shows that when kids <eol> have a consistent, nutritious breakfast, <eob> their chances of graduating <eol> increase by 20 percent. <eob> 20 percent. <eob> When we give our kids <eol> the nourishment they need, <eob> we give them the chance to thrive, <eob> both in the classroom and beyond. <eob>
Now, you don't have to trust me on this, <eob> but you should talk to Donna Martin. <eob>
I love Donna Martin. <eob>
Donna Martin is the school nutrition <eol> director at Burke County <eob> in Waynesboro, Georgia. <eob>
Burke County is one of the poorest <eol> districts <eob> in the fifth-poorest <eol> state in the country, <eob> and about 100 percent of Donna's students live <eol> at or below the poverty line. <eob>
A few years ago, <eob> Donna decided to get out ahead <eol> of the new standards that were coming, <eob> and overhaul her nutrition standards. <eob>
She improved and added <eol> fruit and vegetables and whole grains. <eob>
She served breakfast in the classroom <eol> to all of her kids. <eob>
Why? <eob> And she implemented a dinner program. <eob> Well, many of her kids didn't have <eol> dinner when they went home. <eob>
So how did they respond? <eob> Well, the kids loved the food. <eob>
They loved the better nutrition, <eob> and they loved not being hungry. <eob>
But Donna's biggest supporter came <eol> from an unexpected place. <eob>
His name from Eric Parker, <eob> and he was the head football coach <eol> for the Burke County Bears. <eob>
Now, Coach Parker had coached <eol> mediocre teams for years. <eob>
The Bears often ended <eol> in the middle of the pack — <eob> a big disappointment <eol> in one of the most passionate football states <eob> in the Union. <eob>
But the year Donna changed the menus, <eob> the Bears not only won their division, <eob> they went on to win <eol> the state championship, <eob> beating the Peach County Trojans <eob> 28-14. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And Coach Parker, <eob> he credited that championship <eol> to Donna Martin. <eob>
When we give our kids <eol> the basic nourishment, <eob> they're going to thrive. <eob>
And it's not just up <eol> to the Cheryl Barbaras <eob> and the Donna Martins of the world. <eob>
It's on all of us. <eob>
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition <eol> is just the starting point. <eob>
What I've laid out is really a model <eob> for so many of the most pressing <eol> issues that we face. <eob>
If we focus on the simple goal <eol> of properly nourishing ourselves, <eob> we could see a world <eol> that is more stable and secure; <eob> we could dramatically improve <eol> our economic productivity; <eob> we could transform our health care <eob> and we could go a long way <eob> in ensuring that the Earth can provide <eol> for generations to come. <eob>
Food is that place <eol> where our collective efforts <eob> can have the greatest impact. <eob>
So we have to ask ourselves: <eol> What is the right question? <eob>
What would happen <eob> if we fed ourselves more nutritious, <eol> more sustainably grown food? <eob>
What would be the impact? <eob>
Cheryl Barbara, <eob> Donna Martin, <eob> Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears -- <eob> I think they know the answer. <eob>
Thank you guys so very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Let's imagine a sculptor <eol> building a statue, <eob> just chipping away with his chisel. <eob>
Michelangelo had this elegant way <eol> of describing it when he said, <eob> "Every block of stone <eol> has a statue inside of it, <eob> and it's the task <eol> of the sculptor to discover it." <eob> But what if he worked <eol> in the opposite direction? <eob>
Not from a solid block of stone, <eob> but from a pile of dust, <eob> somehow gluing millions of these particles <eol> together to form a statue. <eob>
I know that's an absurd notion. <eob>
It's probably impossible. <eob>
The only way you get <eol> a statue from a pile of dust <eob> is if the statue built itself -- <eob> if somehow we could compel millions <eol> of these particles to come together <eob> to form the statue. <eob>
Now, as odd as that sounds, <eob> that is almost exactly the problem <eol> I work on in my lab. <eob>
I don't build with stone, <eob> I build with nanomaterials. <eob>
They're these just impossibly small, <eol> fascinating little objects. <eob>
They're so small that if this controller <eol> was a nanoparticle, <eob> a human hair would be the size <eol> of this entire room. <eob>
And they're at the heart of a field <eol> we call nanotechnology, <eob> which I'm sure we've all heard about, <eob> and we've all heard <eol> how it is going to change everything. <eob>
When I was a graduate student, <eob> it was one of the most exciting times <eol> to be working in nanotechnology. <eob>
There were scientific breakthroughs <eol> happening all the time. <eob>
The conferences were buzzing, <eob> there was tons of money <eol> pouring in from funding agencies. <eob>
And the reason is <eob> when objects get really small, <eob> they're governed by a different set <eol> of physics that govern ordinary objects, <eob> like the ones we interact with. <eob>
We call this physics quantum mechanics. <eob>
And what it tells you is <eol> that you can precisely tune their behavior <eob> just by making seemingly <eol> small changes to them, <eob> like adding or removing <eol> a handful of atoms, <eob> or twisting the material. <eob>
It's like this ultimate toolkit. <eob>
You really felt empowered; <eol> you felt like you could make anything. <eob>
And we were doing it -- <eob> and by we I mean my whole <eol> generation of graduate students. <eob>
We were trying to make blazing fast <eol> computers using nanomaterials. <eob>
We were constructing quantum dots <eob> that could one day go in your body <eol> and find and fight disease. <eob>
There were even groups <eol> trying to make an elevator to space <eob> using carbon nanotubes. <eob>
You can look that up, that's true. <eob>
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect <eob> all parts of science and technology, <eol> from computing to medicine. <eob>
And I have to admit, <eob> I drank all of the Kool-Aid. <eob> I mean, every last drop. <eob>
But that was 15 years ago, <eob> and -- <eob> fantastic science was done, <eol> really important work. <eob>
We've learned a lot. <eob>
We were never able to translate <eol> that science into new technologies -- <eob> into technologies <eol> that could actually impact people. <eob>
And the reason is, <eob> these nanomaterials — <eob> they're like a double-edged sword. <eob>
The same thing that makes <eol> them so interesting -- <eob> their small size -- <eob> also makes them impossible to work with. <eob>
It's literally like trying to build <eol> a statue out of a pile of dust. <eob>
And we just don't have the tools <eol> that are small enough to work with them. <eob>
But even if we did, <eol> it wouldn't really matter, <eob> because we couldn't one by one <eol> place millions of particles together <eob> to build a technology. <eob>
So because of that, <eob> all of the promise and all of the excitement <eob> has remained just that: <eol> promise and excitement. <eob>
We don't have any <eol> disease-fighting nanobots, <eob> there's no elevators to space, <eob> and the thing that I'm most interested in, <eol> no new types of computing. <eob>
Now that last one, <eol> that's a really important one. <eob>
We just have come to expect <eob> the pace of computing advancements <eol> to go on indefinitely. <eob>
We've built entire economies on this idea. <eob>
And this pace exists <eob> because of our ability <eol> to pack more and more devices <eob> onto a computer chip. <eob>
And as those devices get smaller, <eob> they get faster, they consume less power <eob> and they get cheaper. <eob>
And it's this convergence <eol> that gives us this incredible pace. <eob>
As an example: <eob> if I took the room-sized computer <eol> that sent three men to the moon and back <eob> and somehow compressed it -- <eob> compressed the world's <eol> greatest computer of its day, <eob> so it was the same size <eol> as your smartphone -- <eob> your actual smartphone, <eob> that thing you spent 300 bucks on <eol> and just toss out every two years, <eob> would blow this thing away. <eob>
You would not be impressed. <eob> It couldn't do anything <eol> that your smartphone does. <eob>
It would be slow, <eob> you couldn't put any of your stuff on it, <eob> you could possibly <eol> get through the first two minutes <eob> of a "Walking Dead" episode <eol> if you're lucky -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The point is the progress -- <eol> it's not gradual. <eob>
The progress is relentless. <eob> It's exponential. <eob> It compounds on itself year after year, <eob> to the point where <eol> if you compare a technology <eob> from one generation to the next, <eob> they're almost unrecognizable. <eob>
And we owe it to ourselves <eol> to keep this progress going. <eob>
We want to say the same thing <eol> 10, 20, 30 years from now: <eob> look what we've done <eol> over the last 30 years. <eob>
Yet we know this progress <eol> may not last forever. <eob>
In fact, the party's kind of winding down. <eob>
It's like "last call for alcohol," right? <eob>
If you look under the covers, <eob> by many metrics <eol> like speed and performance, <eob> the progress has already slowed to a halt. <eob>
So if we want to keep this party going, <eob> we have to do what we've <eol> always been able to do, <eob> and that is to innovate. <eob>
So our group's role <eol> and our group's mission <eob> is to innovate <eol> by employing carbon nanotubes, <eob> because we think that they can <eol> provide a path to continue this pace. <eob>
They are just like they sound. <eob>
They're tiny, hollow tubes <eol> of carbon atoms, <eob> and their nanoscale size, <eol> that small size, <eob> gives rise to these <eol> just outstanding electronic properties. <eob>
And the science tells us <eol> if we could employ them in computing, <eob> we could see up to a ten times <eol> improvement in performance. <eob>
It's like skipping through several <eol> technology generations in just one step. <eob>
So there we have it. <eob> We have this really important problem <eob> and we have what is basically <eol> the ideal solution. <eob>
The science is screaming at us, <eob> "This is what you should be doing <eol> to solve your problem." <eob> So, all right, let's get started, <eob> let's do this. <eob>
But you just run right back <eol> into that double-edged sword. <eob>
This "ideal solution" contains a material <eol> that's impossible to work with. <eob>
I'd have to arrange billions of them <eol> just to make one single computer chip. <eob>
It's that same conundrum, <eol> it's like this undying problem. <eob>
At this point, we said, "Let's just stop. <eob>
Let's not go down that same road. <eob>
Let's just figure out what's missing. <eob>
What are we not dealing with? <eob>
What are we not doing <eol> that needs to be done? <eob> "It's like in" The Godfather, "right? <eob>
When Fredo betrays his brother Michael, <eob> we all know what needs to be done. <eob> Fredo's got to go. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But Michael -- he puts it off. <eob> Fine, I get it. <eob> Their mother's still alive, <eol> it would make her upset. <eob>
What are we not dealing with? <eob> We just said, <eob> "What's the Fredo in our problem?" <eob>
What are we not doing, <eob> but needs to be done <eol> to make this a success?" <eob> And the answer is <eol> that the statue has to build itself. <eob>
We have to find a way, somehow, <eob> to compel, to convince <eol> billions of these particles <eob> to assemble themselves <eol> into the technology. <eob>
We can't do it for them. <eol> They have to do it for themselves. <eob>
And it's the hard way, <eol> and this is not trivial, <eob> but in this case, it's the only way. <eob>
Now, as it turns out, <eol> this is not that alien of a problem. <eob>
We just don't build anything this way. <eob>
People don't build anything this way. <eob>
But if you look around — and <eol> there's examples everywhere — <eob> Mother Nature builds everything this way. <eob>
Everything is built from the bottom up. <eob>
You can go to the beach, <eob> you'll find these simple organisms <eol> that use proteins -- <eob> basically molecules -- <eob> to template what is essentially sand, <eob> just plucking it from the sea <eob> and building these extraordinary <eol> architectures with extreme diversity. <eob>
And nature's not crude like us, <eol> just hacking away. <eob>
She's elegant and smart, <eob> building with what's available, <eol> molecule by molecule, <eob> making structures with a complexity <eob> and a diversity <eol> that we can't even approach. <eob>
And she's already at the nano. <eob>
She's been there <eol> for hundreds of millions of years. <eob>
We're the ones that are late to the party. <eob>
So we decided that we're going <eol> to use the same tool that nature uses, <eob> and that's chemistry. <eob>
Chemistry is the missing tool. <eob>
And chemistry works in this case <eob> because these nanoscale objects <eol> are about the same size as molecules, <eob> so we can use them <eol> to steer these objects around, <eob> much like a tool. <eob>
That's exactly what we've done in our lab. <eob>
We've developed chemistry <eol> that goes into the pile of dust, <eob> into the pile of nanoparticles, <eob> and pulls out exactly the ones we need. <eob>
Then we can use chemistry to arrange <eol> literally billions of these particles <eob> into the pattern <eol> we need to build circuits. <eob>
And because we can do that, <eob> we can build circuits <eol> that are many times faster <eob> than what anyone's been able <eol> to make using nanomaterials before. <eob>
Chemistry's the missing tool, <eob> and every day our tool gets sharper <eol> and gets more precise. <eob>
And eventually -- <eob> and we hope this is <eol> within a handful of years -- <eob> we can deliver on one <eol> of those original promises. <eob>
Now, computing is just one example. <eob>
It's the one that I'm interested in, <eol> that my group is really invested in, <eob> but there are others <eol> in renewable energy, in medicine, <eob> in structural materials, <eob> where the science is going to tell you <eol> to move towards the nano. <eob>
That's where the biggest benefit is. <eob>
But if we're going to do that, <eob> the scientists of today and tomorrow <eol> are going to need new tools -- <eob> tools just like the ones I described. <eob>
And they will need chemistry. <eob>
That's the point. <eob>
The beauty of science is that <eol> once you develop these new tools, <eob> they're out there. <eob>
They're out there forever, <eob> and anyone anywhere <eol> can pick them up and use them, <eob> and help to deliver on the promise <eol> of nanotechnology. <eob>
Thank you so much for your time. <eol> I appreciate it. <eob>
OK, so today I want to talk <eol> about how we talk about love. <eob>
And specifically, <eob> I want to talk about what's wrong <eol> with how we talk about love. <eob>
Most of us will probably <eol> fall in love a few times <eob> over the course of our lives, <eob> and in the English language, <eol> this metaphor, falling, <eob> is really the main way that we <eol> talk about that experience. <eob>
I don't know about you, <eob> but when I conceptualize this metaphor, <eob> what I picture is straight <eol> out of a cartoon -- <eob> like there's a man, <eob> he's walking down the sidewalk, <eob> without realizing it, he crosses <eol> over an open manhole, <eob> and he just plummets into the sewer below. <eob>
And I picture it this way <eol> because falling is not jumping. <eob>
Falling is accidental, <eob> it's uncontrollable. <eob>
It's something that happens to us <eol> without our consent. <eob>
And this -- <eob> this is the main way we talk <eol> about starting a new relationship. <eob>
I am a writer and I'm also <eol> an English teacher, <eob> which means I think <eol> about words for a living. <eob>
You could say that I get paid <eol> to argue that the language we use matters, <eob> and I would like to argue <eol> that many of the metaphors we use <eob> to talk about love -- <eob> maybe even most of them -- <eob> are a problem. <eob>
So, in love we fall. <eob> We're struck. <eob> We are crushed. <eob> We swoon. <eob> We burn with passion. <eob>
Love makes us crazy, <eob> and it makes us sick. <eob>
Our hearts ache, <eob> and then they break. <eob>
So our metaphors equate <eol> the experience of loving someone <eob> to extreme violence or illness. <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
They do. <eob> And they position us as the victims <eob> of unforeseen and totally <eol> unavoidable circumstances. <eob>
My favorite one of these is "smitten," <eob> which is the past participle <eol> of the word "smite." <eob> And if you look this word up <eol> in the dictionary -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> you will see that it can be defined <eol> as both "grievous affliction," <eob> and, "to be very much in love." <eob> I tend to associate the word "smite" <eol> with a very particular context, <eob> which is the Old Testament. <eob>
In the Book of Exodus alone, <eol> there are 16 references to smiting, <eob> which is the word that the Bible uses <eol> for the vengeance of an angry God. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Here we are using the same word <eol> to talk about love <eob> that we use to explain <eol> a plague of locusts. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Right? <eob>
So, how did this happen? <eob>
How have we come to associate love <eol> with great pain and suffering? <eob>
And why do we talk about <eol> this ostensibly good experience <eob> as if we are victims? <eob>
These are difficult questions, <eob> but I have some theories. <eob>
And to think this through, <eob> I want to focus on one <eol> metaphor in particular, <eob> which is the idea of love as madness. <eob>
When I first started <eol> researching romantic love, <eob> I found these madness <eol> metaphors everywhere. <eob>
The history of Western culture <eob> is full of language that equates <eol> love to mental illness. <eob> These are just a few examples. <eob> William Shakespeare: <eob> "Love is merely a madness," <eob> from "As You Like It." <eob> Friedrich Nietzsche: <eob> "There is always some madness in love." <eob> "Got me looking, got me <eol> looking so crazy in love —" (Laughter) <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> I fell in love for the first time <eol> when I was 20, <eob> and it was a pretty turbulent <eol> relationship right from the start. <eob>
And it was long distance <eol> for the first couple of years, <eob> so for me that meant very high highs <eol> and very low lows. <eob>
I can remember one moment in particular. <eob>
I was sitting on a bed <eol> in a hostel in South America, <eob> and I was watching the person <eol> I love walk out the door. <eob>
And it was late, <eob> it was nearly midnight, <eob> we'd gotten into an argument over dinner, <eob> and when we got back to our room, <eob> he threw his things in the bag <eol> and stormed out. <eob>
While I can no longer remember <eol> what that argument was about, <eob> I very clearly remember <eol> how I felt watching him leave. <eob>
I was 22, it was my first time <eol> in the developing world, <eob> and I was totally alone. <eob>
I had another week until my flight home, <eob> and I knew the name <eol> of the town that I was in, <eob> and the name of the city <eol> that I needed to get to to fly out, <eob> but I had no idea how to get around. <eob>
I had no guidebook and very little money, <eob> and I spoke no Spanish. <eob>
Someone more adventurous than me <eob> might have seen this as <eol> a moment of opportunity, <eob> but I just froze. <eob>
I just sat there. <eob>
And then I burst into tears. <eob>
But despite my panic, <eob> some small voice in my head thought, <eob> "Wow. That was dramatic. <eob> I must really be doing <eol> this love thing right." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> Because some part of me <eol> wanted to feel miserable in love. <eob>
And it sounds so strange <eol> to me now, but at 22, <eob> I longed to have dramatic experiences, <eob> and in that moment, I was irrational <eol> and furious and devastated, <eob> and weirdly enough, <eob> I thought that this somehow <eol> legitimized the feelings I had <eob> for the guy who had just left me. <eob>
I think on some level I wanted <eol> to feel a little bit crazy, <eob> because I thought that <eol> that was how loved worked. <eob>
This really should not be surprising, <eob> considering that according to Wikipedia, <eob> there are eight films, <eob> 14 songs, <eob> two albums and one novel <eol> with the title "Crazy Love." <eob>
About half an hour later, <eol> he came back to our room. <eob> We made up. <eob> We spent another mostly <eol> happy week traveling together. <eob>
And then, when I got home, <eob> I thought, "That was so <eol> terrible and so great. <eob>
This must be a real romance." <eob> I expected my first love <eol> to feel like madness, <eob> and of course, it met <eol> that expectation very well. <eob>
But loving someone like that -- <eob> as if my entire well-being depended <eol> on him loving me back -- <eob> was not very good for me <eob> or for him. <eob>
But I suspect this experience of love <eol> is not that unusual. <eob>
Most of us do feel a bit mad <eol> in the early stages of romantic love. <eob>
In fact, there is research to confirm <eol> that this is somewhat normal, <eob> because, neurochemically speaking, <eob> romantic love and mental illness <eol> are not that easily distinguished. <eob> This is true. <eob> This study from 1999 used blood tests <eob> to confirm <eob> that the serotonin <eol> levels of the newly in love <eob> very closely resembled <eob> the serotonin <eol> levels <eob> of people who had been diagnosed <eol> with obsessive-compulsive disorder. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Yes, and low levels of serotonin <eob> are also associated <eol> with seasonal affective disorder <eob> and depression. <eob>
So there is some evidence <eob> that love is associated with changes <eol> to our moods and our behaviors. <eob>
And there are other studies to confirm <eob> that most relationships begin this way. <eob>
Researchers believe <eol> that the low levels of serotonin <eob> is correlated with obsessive thinking <eol> about the object of love, <eob> which is like this feeling that someone <eol> has set up camp in your brain. <eob>
And most of us feel this way <eol> when we first fall in love. <eob>
But the good news is, <eol> it doesn't always last that long -- <eob> usually from a few months <eol> to a couple of years. <eob>
When I got back from my trip <eol> to South America, <eob> I spent a lot of time alone in my room, <eob> checking my email, <eob> desperate to hear from the guy I loved. <eob>
I decided that if my friends could not <eol> understand my grievous affliction, <eob> then I did not need their friendship. <eob>
So I stopped hanging out <eol> with most of them. <eob>
And it was probably the most <eol> unhappy year of my life. <eob>
But I think I felt like <eol> it was my job to be miserable, <eob> because if I could be miserable, <eob> then I would prove how much I loved him. <eob>
And if I could prove it, <eob> then we would have to end up <eol> together eventually. <eob>
This is the real madness, <eob> because there is no cosmic rule <eob> that says that great suffering <eol> equals great reward, <eob> but we talk about love as if this is true. <eob>
Our experiences of love <eol> are both biological and cultural. <eob>
Our biology tells us that love is good <eob> by activating these reward <eol> circuits in our brain, <eob> and it tells us that love is painful <eol> when, after a fight or a breakup, <eob> that neurochemical reward is withdrawn. <eob>
And in fact — and maybe <eol> you've heard this — <eob> neurochemically speaking, <eob> going through a breakup is a lot <eol> like going through cocaine withdrawal, <eob> which I find reassuring. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> And then our culture uses language <eob> to shape and reinforce <eol> these ideas about love. <eob>
In this case, we're talking <eol> about metaphors about pain <eob> and addiction and madness. <eob>
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop. <eob>
Love is powerful and at times painful, <eob> and we express this <eol> in our words and stories, <eob> but then our words and stories prime us <eob> to expect love to be powerful and painful. <eob>
What's interesting to me <eol> is that all of this happens <eob> in a culture that values <eol> lifelong monogamy. <eob>
It seems like we want it both ways: <eob> we want love to feel like madness, <eob> and we want it to last an entire lifetime. <eob> That sounds terrible. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> To reconcile this, <eob> we need to either change our culture <eol> or change our expectations. <eob>
So, imagine if we were all <eol> less passive in love. <eob>
If we were more assertive, more open-minded, <eol> more generous <eob> and instead of falling in love, <eob> we stepped into love. <eob>
I know that this is asking a lot, <eob> but I'm not actually <eol> the first person to suggest this. <eob>
In their book, "Metaphors We Live By," <eob> linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff <eol> suggest a really interesting solution <eob> to this dilemma, <eob> which is to change our metaphors. <eob>
They argue that metaphors really do shape <eol> the way we experience the world, <eob> and that they can even act <eol> as a guide for future actions, <eob> like self-fulfilling prophecies. <eob>
Johnson and Lakoff suggest <eol> a new metaphor for love: <eob> love as a collaborative work of art. <eob>
I really like this way <eol> of thinking about love. <eob>
Linguists talk about metaphors <eol> as having entailments, <eob> which is essentially a way of considering <eol> all the implications of, <eob> or ideas contained <eol> within, a given metaphor. <eob>
And Johnson and Lakoff <eol> talk about everything <eob> that collaborating <eol> on a work of art entails: <eob> effort, compromise, <eol> patience, shared goals. <eob>
These ideas align nicely <eol> with our cultural investment <eob> in long-term romantic commitment, <eob> but they also work well <eol> for other kinds of relationships -- <eob> short-term, casual, polyamorous, <eol> non-monogamous, asexual -- <eob> because this metaphor brings <eol> much more complex ideas <eob> to the experience of loving someone. <eob>
So if love is a collaborative work of art, <eob> then love is an aesthetic experience. <eob>
Love is unpredictable, <eob> love is creative, <eob> love requires communication <eol> and discipline, <eob> it is frustrating <eol> and emotionally demanding. <eob>
And love involves both joy and pain. <eob>
Ultimately, each experience <eol> of love is different. <eob>
When I was younger, <eob> it never occurred to me that I was allowed <eol> to demand more from love, <eob> that I didn't have to just accept <eol> whatever love offered. <eob>
Right? <eob> When 14-year-old Juliet first meets -- <eob> or, when 14-year-old Juliet <eol> cannot be with Romeo, <eob> whom she has met four days ago, <eob> she does not feel disappointed or angsty. <eob> Where is she? <eob> She wants to die. <eob> And just as a refresher, <eol> at this point in the play, <eob> act three of five, <eob> Romeo is not dead. <eob>
He's alive, <eob> he's healthy, <eob> he's just been banished from the city. <eob>
I understand that 16th-century Verona <eol> is unlike contemporary North America, <eob> and yet when I first read this play, <eob> also at age 14, <eob> Juliet's suffering made sense to me. <eob>
Reframing love as something <eol> I get to create with someone I admire, <eob> rather than something <eol> that just happens to me <eob> without my control or consent, <eob> is empowering. <eob>
It's still hard. <eob>
Love still feels totally maddening <eol> and crushing some days, <eob> and when I feel really frustrated, <eob> I have to remind myself: <eob> my job in this relationship <eol> is to talk to my partner <eob> about what I want to make together. <eob>
This isn't easy, either. <eob>
But it's just so much better <eol> than the alternative, <eob> which is that thing <eol> that feels like madness. <eob>
This version of love is not about winning <eol> or losing someone's affection. <eob>
Instead, it requires <eol> that you trust your partner <eob> and talk about things <eol> when trusting feels difficult, <eob> which sounds so simple, <eob> but is actually a kind <eol> of revolutionary, radical act. <eob>
This is because you get to stop <eol> thinking about yourself <eob> and what you're gaining <eol> or losing in your relationship, <eob> and you get to start thinking <eol> about what you have to offer. <eob>
This version of love <eol> allows us to say things like, <eob> "Hey, we're not very good collaborators. <eob>
Maybe this isn't for us. <eob> "Or," That relationship <eol> was shorter than I had planned, <eob> but it was still kind of beautiful. <eob> "The beautiful thing about <eol> the collaborative work of art <eob> is that it will not paint <eol> or draw or sculpt itself. <eob>
This version of love allows us <eol> to decide what it looks like. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
When I was a child, <eol> I knew I had superpowers. <eob> That's right. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I thought I was absolutely amazing <eol> because I could understand <eob> and relate to the feelings <eol> of brown people, <eob> like my grandfather, <eol> a conservative Muslim guy. <eob>
And also, I could understand <eol> my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father, <eob> not so religious <eol> but laid-back, fairly liberal. <eob>
And of course, I could understand <eob> and relate to the feelings <eol> of white people. <eob> The white Norwegians of my country. <eob>
You know, white, brown, whatever — <eob> I loved them all. <eob>
I understood them all, <eob> even if they didn't always <eol> understand each other, <eob> they were all my people. <eob>
My father, though, <eol> was always really worried. <eob>
He kept saying that <eol> even with the best education, <eob> I was not going to get a fair shake. <eob>
I would still face discrimination, <eol> according to him. <eob> And that the only way <eol> to be accepted by white people <eob> would be to become famous. <eob>
Now, mind you, he had this conversation <eol> with me when I was seven years old. <eob>
So while I'm seven years old, he said, <eob> "Look, so it's either got to be sports, <eol> or it's got to be music." <eob> He didn't know anything about sports -- <eol> bless him -- so it was music. <eob>
So when I was seven years old, <eol> he gathered all my toys, all my dolls, <eob> and he threw them all away. <eob>
In exchange he gave me <eol> a crappy little Casio keyboard and -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Yeah. And singing lessons. <eob> And he forced me, basically, to practice <eol> for hours and hours every single day. <eob>
Very quickly, he also had me performing <eol> for larger and larger audiences, <eob> and bizarrely, I became <eol> almost a kind of poster child <eob> for Norwegian multiculturalism. <eob>
I felt very proud, of course. <eob> Because even the newspapers at this point <eob> were starting to write <eol> nice things about brown people, <eob> so I could feel <eol> that my superpower was growing. <eob>
So when I was 12 years old, <eol> walking home from school, <eob> I took a little detour <eob> because I wanted to buy <eol> my favorite sweets called "salty feet." <eob> I know they sound kind of awful, <eob> but I absolutely love them. <eob>
They're basically these little <eol> salty licorice bits in the shape of feet. <eob>
And now that I say it out loud, <eol> I realize how terrible that sounds, <eob> but be that as it may, <eol> I absolutely love them. <eob>
So on my way into the store, <eob> there was this grown white guy <eol> in the doorway blocking my way. <eob>
So I tried to walk around him, <eol> and as I did that, he stopped me <eob> and he was staring at me, <eob> and he spit in my face, and he said, <eob> "Get out of my way <eob> you little black bitch, <eol> you little Paki bitch, <eob> go back home where you came from." <eob> I was absolutely horrified. <eob>
I was staring at him. <eob>
I was too afraid <eol> to wipe the spit off my face, <eob> even as it was mixing with my tears. <eob>
I remember looking around, <eol> hoping that any minute now, <eob> a grown-up is going to come <eol> and make this guy stop. <eob>
But instead, people kept hurrying past me <eol> and pretended not to see me. <eob>
I was very confused <eol> because I was thinking, well, <eob> "My white people, come on! <eol> Where are they? What's going on? <eob> How come they're not <eol> coming and rescuing me? <eob> So, needless to say, <eol> I didn't buy the sweets. <eob>
I just ran home as fast as I could. <eob>
Things were still OK, though, I thought. <eob>
As time went on, <eol> the more successful I became, <eob> I eventually started also <eol> attracting harassment from brown people. <eob>
Some men in my parent's community <eol> felt that it was unacceptable <eob> and dishonorable for a woman <eol> to be involved in music <eob> and to be so present in the media. <eob>
So very quickly, I was starting <eol> to become attacked at my own concerts. <eob>
I remember one of the concerts, <eol> I was onstage, I lean into the audience <eob> and the last thing I see <eol> is a young brown face <eob> and the next thing I know is some sort <eol> of chemical is thrown in my eyes <eob> and I remember I couldn't really see <eol> and my eyes were watering <eob> but I kept singing anyway. <eob>
I was spit in the face in the streets <eol> of Oslo, this time by brown men. <eob>
They even tried to kidnap me at one point. <eob>
The death threats were endless. <eob>
I remember one older bearded guy <eol> stopped me in the street one time, <eob> and he said, "The reason <eol> I hate you so much <eob> is because you make our daughters think <eob> they can do whatever they want." <eob> A younger guy warned me to watch my back. <eob>
He said music is un-Islamic <eol> and the job of whores, <eob> and if you keep this up, <eol> you are going to be raped <eob> and your stomach will be cut out so that <eol> another whore like you will not be born. <eob>
Again, I was so confused. <eob>
I couldn't understand what was going on. <eob>
My brown people now starting <eol> to treat me like this -- how come? <eob>
Instead of bridging the worlds, <eol> the two worlds, <eob> I felt like I was falling <eol> between my two worlds. <eob>
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite. <eob>
So by the time I was 17 years old, <eob> the death threats were endless, <eol> and the harassment was constant. <eob>
It got so bad, at one point <eol> my mother sat me down and said, <eob> "Look, we can no longer protect you, <eol> we can no longer keep you safe, <eob> so you're going to have to go." <eob> So I bought a one-way ticket to London, <eol> I packed my suitcase and I left. <eob>
My biggest heartbreak at that point <eol> was that nobody said anything. <eob>
I had a very public exit from Norway. <eob>
My brown people, my white people -- <eol> nobody said anything. <eob>
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong. <eob>
Support this girl, protect this girl, <eol> because she is one of us." <eob> Nobody said that. <eob>
Instead, I felt like -- <eol> you know at the airport, <eob> on the baggage carousel <eol> you have these different suitcases <eob> going around and around, <eob> and there's always <eol> that one suitcase left at the end, <eob> the one that nobody wants, <eol> the one that nobody comes to claim. <eob>
I felt like that. <eob>
I'd never felt so alone. <eol> I'd never felt so lost. <eob>
So, after coming to London, <eol> I did eventually resume my music career. <eob>
Different place, but unfortunately <eol> the same old story. <eob>
I remember a message sent to me <eol> saying that I was going to be killed <eob> and that rivers of blood <eol> were going to flow <eob> and that I was going to be raped <eol> many times before I died. <eob>
By this point, I have to say, <eob> I was actually getting used <eol> to messages like this, <eob> but what became different was that <eol> now they started threatening my family. <eob>
So once again, I packed my suitcase, <eol> I left music and I moved to the US. <eob>
I'd had enough. <eob>
I didn't want to have anything <eol> to do with this anymore. <eob>
And I was certainly not <eol> going to be killed for something <eob> that wasn't even my dream -- <eol> it was my father's choice. <eob>
So I kind of got lost. <eob> I kind of fell apart. <eob>
But I decided that what I wanted to do <eob> is spend the next <eol> however many years of my life <eob> supporting young people <eob> and to try to be there in some small way, <eob> whatever way that I could. <eob>
I started volunteering <eol> for various organizations <eob> that were working <eol> with young Muslims inside of Europe. <eob>
And, to my surprise, what I found was <eob> so many of these young people <eol> were suffering and struggling. <eob>
They were facing so many problems <eol> with their families and their communities <eob> who seemed to care more <eol> about their honor and their reputation <eob> than the happiness <eol> and the lives of their own kids. <eob>
I started feeling like maybe I wasn't <eol> so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird. <eob>
Maybe there are more <eol> of my people out there. <eob>
The thing is, <eol> what most people don't understand <eob> is that there are so many of us <eol> growing up in Europe <eob> who are not free to be ourselves. <eob>
We're not allowed to be who we are. <eob>
We are not free to marry <eob> or to be in relationships <eol> with people that we choose. <eob>
We can't even pick our own career. <eob>
This is the norm in the Muslim <eol> heartlands of Europe. <eob>
Even in the freest societies <eol> in the world, we're not free. <eob>
Our lives, our dreams, our future <eol> does not belong to us, <eob> it belongs to our parents <eol> and their community. <eob>
I found endless stories of young people <eob> who are lost to all of us, <eob> who are invisible to all of us <eob> but who are suffering, <eol> and they are suffering alone. <eob> Kids we are losing to forced marriages, <eol> to honor-based violence and abuse. <eob>
Eventually, I realized after several <eol> years of working with these young people, <eob> that I will not be able to keep running. <eob> I can't spend the rest of my life <eol> being scared and hiding <eob> and that I'm actually <eol> going to have to do something. <eob>
And I also realized <eol> that my silence, our silence, <eob> allows abuse like this to continue. <eob>
So I decided that I wanted to put <eol> my childhood superpower to some use <eob> by trying to make people on the different <eol> sides of these issues understand <eob> what it's like to be a young person stuck <eol> between your family and your country. <eob>
So I started making films, <eol> and I started telling these stories. <eob>
And I also wanted people to understand <eol> the deadly consequences of us <eob> not taking these problems seriously. <eob>
So the first film I made was about Banaz. <eob>
She was a 17-year-old <eol> Kurdish girl in London. <eob>
She was obedient, she did <eol> whatever her parents wanted. <eob>
She tried to do everything right. <eob>
She married some guy <eol> that her parents chose for her, <eob> even though he beat <eol> and raped her constantly. <eob>
And when she tried to go <eol> to her family for help, they said, <eob> "Well, you got to go back <eol> and be a better wife." <eob> Because they didn't want <eol> a divorced daughter on their hands <eob> because, of course, that would <eol> bring dishonor on the family. <eob>
She was beaten so badly <eol> her ears would bleed, <eob> and when she finally left <eol> and she found a young man that she chose <eob> and she fell in love with, <eob> the community and the family found out <eob> and she disappeared. <eob>
She was found three months later. <eob>
She'd been stuffed into a suitcase <eol> and buried underneath the house. <eob>
She had been strangled, <eol> she had been beaten to death <eob> by three men, three cousins, <eol> on the orders of her father and uncle. <eob>
The added tragedy of Banaz's story <eob> is that she had gone to the police <eol> in England five times asking for help, <eob> telling them that she was <eol> going to be killed by her family. <eob>
The police didn't believe her <eol> so they didn't do anything. <eob>
And the problem with this <eob> is that not only are so many of our kids <eol> facing these problems <eob> within their families <eol> and within their families' communities, <eob> but they're also meeting misunderstandings <eob> and apathy in the countries <eol> that they grow up in. <eob>
When their own families betray them, <eol> they look to the rest of us, <eob> and when we don't understand, <eob> we lose them. <eob>
So while I was making this film, <eol> several people said to me, <eob> "Well, Deeyah, you know, this is just their culture, <eob> this is just what those people <eol> do to their kids <eob> and we can't really interfere." <eob> I can assure you being murdered <eol> is not my culture. <eob> You know? <eob> And surely people who look like me, <eob> young women <eol> who come from backgrounds like me, <eob> should be subject to the same rights, <eol> the same protections <eob> as anybody else in our country, why not? <eob>
So, for my next film, <eol> I wanted to try and understand <eob> why some of our young <eol> Muslim kids in Europe <eob> are drawn to extremism and violence. <eob>
But with that topic, <eob> I also recognized that I was going <eol> to have to face my worst fear: <eob> the brown men with beards. <eob>
The same men, or similar men, <eob> to the ones that have hounded me <eol> for most of my life. <eob> Men that I've been afraid of <eol> most of my life. <eob> Men that I've also deeply disliked, <eob> for many, many years. <eob>
So I spent the next two years <eol> interviewing convicted terrorists, <eob> jihadis and former extremists. <eob>
What I already knew, <eol> what was very obvious already, <eob> was that religion, politics, <eol> Europe's colonial baggage, <eob> also Western foreign policy <eol> failures of recent years, <eob> were all a part of the picture. <eob>
But what I was more interested <eol> in finding out was what are the human, <eob> what are the personal reasons <eob> why some of our young people <eol> are susceptible to groups like this. <eob>
And what really surprised me <eol> was that I found wounded human beings. <eob>
Instead of the monsters <eol> that I was looking for, <eob> that I was hoping to find -- <eob> quite frankly because <eol> it would have been very satisfying -- <eob> I found broken people. <eob>
Just like Banaz, <eob> I found that these young men <eol> were torn apart <eob> from trying to bridge the gaps <eob> between their families <eol> and the countries that they were born in. <eob>
And what I also learned <eol> is that extremist groups, terrorist groups <eob> are taking advantage <eol> of these feelings of our young people <eob> and channeling that -- cynically -- <eol> channeling that toward violence. <eob> "Come to us," they say. <eob> "Reject both sides, <eol> your family and your country <eob> because they reject you. <eob>
For your family, their honor <eol> is more important than you <eob> and for your country, <eob> a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person <eol> will always be white and never you." <eob> They're also promising our young people <eol> the things that they crave: <eob> significance, heroism, <eol> a sense of belonging and purpose, <eob> a community that loves and accepts them. <eob>
They make the powerless feel powerful. <eob>
The invisible and the silent <eol> are finally seen and heard. <eob>
This is what they're doing <eol> for our young people. <eob>
Why are these groups doing this <eol> for our young people and not us? <eob>
The thing is, <eob> I'm not trying to justify <eob> or excuse any of the violence. <eob>
What I am trying to say <eol> is that we have to understand <eob> why some of our young people <eol> are attracted to this. <eob>
I would like to also show you, actually -- <eob> these are childhood photos <eol> of some of the guys in the film. <eob>
What really struck me <eol> is that so many of them -- <eob> I never would have thought this -- <eob> but so many of them <eol> have absent or abusive fathers. <eob>
And several of these young guys <eob> ended up finding caring <eol> and compassionate father figures <eob> within these extremist groups. <eob>
I also found men <eol> brutalized by racist violence, <eob> but who found a way <eol> to stop feeling like victims <eob> by becoming violent themselves. <eob>
In fact, I found something, <eol> to my horror, that I recognized. <eob>
I found the same feelings that I felt <eol> as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway. <eob> The same confusion, the same sorrow, <eob> the same feeling of being betrayed <eob> and not belonging to anyone. <eob>
The same feeling of being lost <eol> and torn between cultures. <eob>
Having said that, <eol> I did not choose destruction, <eob> I chose to pick up a camera <eol> instead of a gun. <eob>
And the reason I did that <eol> is because of my superpower. <eob>
I could see that understanding <eol> is the answer, instead of violence. <eob> Seeing human beings <eob> with all their virtues and all their flaws <eob> instead of continuing the caricatures: <eob> the us and them, the villains and victims. <eob>
I'd also finally <eol> come to terms with the fact <eob> that my two cultures <eol> didn't have to be on a collision course <eob> but instead became a space <eol> where I found my own voice. <eob>
I stopped feeling <eol> like I had to pick a side, <eob> but this took me many, many years. <eob>
There are so many <eol> of our young people today <eob> who are struggling with these same issues, <eob> and they're struggling with this alone. <eob>
And this leaves them open like wounds. <eob>
And for some, the worldview <eol> of radical Islam <eob> becomes the infection <eol> that festers in these open wounds. <eob>
There's an African proverb that says, <eob> "If the young are not <eol> initiated into the village, <eob> they will burn it down <eol> just to feel its warmth." <eob> I would like to ask -- <eob> to Muslim parents and Muslim communities, <eob> will you love and care for your children <eob> without forcing them <eol> to meet your expectations? <eob>
Can you choose them instead of your honor? <eob>
Can you understand <eol> why they're so angry and alienated <eob> when you put your honor <eol> before their happiness? <eob>
Can you try to be a friend to your child <eob> so that they can trust you <eob> and want to share with you <eol> their experiences, <eob> rather than having <eol> to seek it somewhere else? <eob>
And to our young people <eol> tempted by extremism, <eob> can you acknowledge <eol> that your rage is fueled by pain? <eob>
Will you find the strength <eol> to resist those cynical old men <eob> who want to use your blood <eol> for their own profits? <eob>
Can you find a way to live? <eob>
Can you see that the sweetest revenge <eob> is for you to live <eol> a happy, full and free life? <eob>
A life defined by you and nobody else. <eob>
Why do you want to become <eol> just another dead Muslim kid? <eob>
And for the rest of us, when will we start <eol> listening to our young people? <eob>
How can we support them <eob> in redirecting their pain <eol> into something more constructive? <eob>
They think we don't like them. <eob> They think we don't care <eol> what happens to them. <eob> They think we don't accept them. <eob>
Can we find a way <eol> to make them feel differently? <eob>
What will it take for us <eol> to see them and notice them <eob> before they become either the victims <eol> or the perpetrators of violence? <eob>
Can we make ourselves care about them <eol> and consider them to be our own? <eob>
And not just be outraged when the victims <eol> of violence look like ourselves? <eob>
Can we find a way to reject hatred <eol> and heal the divisions between us? <eob>
The thing is <eob> we cannot afford to give up <eol> on each other or on our kids, <eob> even if they've given up on us. <eob>
We are all in this together. <eob>
And in the long term, revenge and violence <eol> will not work against extremists. <eob>
Terrorists want us <eol> to huddle in our houses in fear, <eob> closing our doors and our hearts. <eob>
They want us to tear open <eol> more wounds in our societies <eob> so that they can use them <eol> to spread their infection more widely. <eob>
They want us to become like them: <eob> intolerant, hateful and cruel. <eob>
The day after the Paris attacks, <eob> a friend of mine <eol> sent this photo of her daughter. <eob>
This is a white girl and an Arab girl. <eob>
They're best friends. <eob>
This image is the kryptonite <eol> for extremists. <eob>
These two little girls <eol> with their superpowers <eob> are showing the way forward <eob> towards a society <eol> that we need to build together, <eob> a society that includes and supports, <eob> rather than rejects our kids. <eob>
Thank you for listening. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
For the past few years, <eob> I've been spending my summers <eol> in the marine biological laboratory <eob> in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. <eob>
And there, what I've been doing <eol> is essentially renting a boat. <eob>
What I would like to do is ask you <eob> to come on a boat ride with me tonight. <eob>
So, we ride off from Eel Pond <eol> into Vineyard Sound, <eob> right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, <eob> equipped with a drone <eol> to identify potential spots <eob> from which to peer into the Atlantic. <eob>
Earlier, I was going to say <eol> into the depths of the Atlantic, <eob> but we don't have to go too deep <eol> to reach the unknown. <eob>
Here, barely two miles away <eob> from what is arguably the greatest <eol> marine biology lab in the world, <eob> we lower a simple <eol> plankton net into the water <eob> and bring up to the surface <eob> things that humanity rarely <eol> pays any attention to, <eob> and oftentimes has never seen before. <eob>
Here's one of the organisms <eol> that we caught in our net. <eob>
This is a jellyfish. <eob>
But look closely, <eob> and living inside of this animal <eol> is another organism <eob> that is very likely entirely new to science. <eob>
A complete new species. <eob>
Or how about this other transparent beauty <eob> with a beating heart, <eob> asexually growing on top of its head, <eob> progeny that will move on <eol> to reproduce sexually. <eob>
Let me say that again: <eob> this animal is growing asexually <eol> on top of its head, <eob> progeny that is going to reproduce <eol> sexually in the next generation. <eob> A weird jellyfish? <eob> Not quite. <eob> This is an ascidian. <eob>
This is a group of animals <eob> that now we know we share <eol> extensive genomic ancestry with, <eob> and it is perhaps the closest <eol> invertebrate species to our own. <eob>
Meet your cousin, <eob> Thalia democratica. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot <eol> at your last family reunion <eob> for Thalia, <eob> but let me tell you, <eob> these animals are profoundly related to us <eob> in ways that we're just <eol> beginning to understand. <eob>
So, next time you hear anybody <eol> derisively telling you <eob> that this type of research <eol> is a simple fishing expedition, <eob> I hope that you'll remember <eol> the trip that we just took. <eob>
Today, many of the biological <eol> sciences only see value <eob> in studying deeper what we already know -- <eob> in mapping already-discovered continents. <eob>
But some of us are much more <eol> interested in the unknown. <eob>
We want to discover <eol> completely new continents, <eob> and gaze at magnificent <eol> vistas of ignorance. <eob>
We crave the experience <eol> of being completely baffled <eob> by something we've never seen before. <eob>
And yes, I agree <eob> there's a lot of little ego satisfaction <eol> in being able to say, <eob> "Hey, I was the first one <eol> to discover that." <eob> But this is not <eol> a self-aggrandizing enterprise, <eob> because in this type <eol> of discovery research, <eob> if you don't feel like a complete <eol> idiot most of the time, <eob> you're just not sciencing hard enough. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So every summer I bring onto the deck <eol> of this little boat of ours <eob> more and more things <eol> that we know very little about. <eob>
I would like tonight <eol> to tell you a story about life <eob> that rarely gets told <eol> in an environment like this. <eob>
From the vantage point of our 21st-century <eol> biological laboratories, <eob> we have begun to illuminate <eol> many mysteries of life with knowledge. <eob>
We sense that after centuries <eol> of scientific research, <eob> we're beginning to make <eol> significant inroads <eob> into understanding some of the most <eol> fundamental principles of life. <eob>
Our collective optimism is reflected <eol> by the growth of biotechnology <eob> across the globe, <eob> striving to utilize scientific knowledge <eol> to cure human diseases. <eob>
Things like cancer, aging, <eol> degenerative diseases; <eob> these are but some <eol> of the undesirables we wish to tame. <eob>
I often wonder: <eob> Why is it that we are having <eol> so much trouble <eob> trying to solve the problem of cancer? <eob>
Is it that we're <eob> trying to solve the problem of cancer, <eob> and not trying to understand life? <eob>
Life on this planet <eol> shares a common origin, <eob> and I can summarize 3.5 billion years <eol> of the history of life on this planet <eob> in a single slide. <eob>
What you see here are representatives <eol> of all known species in our planet. <eob>
In this immensity of life <eol> and biodiversity, <eob> we occupy a rather unremarkable position. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Homo sapiens. <eob> The last of our kind. <eob>
And though I don't really want <eol> to disparage at all <eob> the accomplishments of our species, <eob> as much as we wish it to be so <eol> and often pretend that it is, <eob> we are not the measure of all things. <eob>
We are, however, the measurers <eol> of many things. <eob>
We relentlessly quantify, <eol> analyze and compare, <eob> and some of this is absolutely invaluable <eol> and indeed necessary. <eob>
But this emphasis today on forcing <eol> biological research to specialize <eob> and to produce practical outcomes <eob> is actually restricting our ability <eol> to interrogate life <eob> to unacceptably narrow confines <eol> and unsatisfying depths. <eob>
We are measuring an astonishingly <eol> narrow sliver of life, <eob> and hoping that those numbers <eol> will save all of our lives. <eob>
How narrow do you ask? <eob>
Well, let me give you a number. <eob>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric <eol> Administration recently estimated <eob> that about 95 percent of our oceans <eol> remain unexplored. <eob> Now let that sink in for a second. <eob> 95 percent of our oceans <eol> remain unexplored. <eob>
I think it's very safe to say <eob> that we don't even know <eol> how much about life we do not know. <eob>
So, it's not surprising <eol> that every week in my field <eob> we begin to see the addition <eol> of more and more new species <eob> to this amazing tree of life. <eob>
This one for example -- <eob> discovered earlier this summer, <eob> new to science, <eob> and now occupying its lonely branch <eol> in our family tree. <eob>
What is even more tragic <eob> is that we know about a bunch <eol> of other species of animals out there, <eob> but their biology remains <eol> sorely under-studied. <eob>
I'm sure some of you <eol> have heard about the fact <eob> that a starfish can actually <eol> regenerate its arm after it's lost. <eob>
But some of you might not know <eob> that the arm itself can actually <eol> regenerate a complete starfish. <eob>
And there are animals out there <eol> that do truly astounding things. <eob>
I'm almost willing to bet <eob> that many of you have never heard <eol> of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea. <eob>
This little guy right here <eob> does things that essentially <eol> just blow my mind. <eob>
You can grab one of these animals <eol> and cut it into 18 different fragments, <eob> and each and every one of those fragments <eol> will go on to regenerate <eob> a complete animal <eob> in under two weeks. <eob>
18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries. <eob>
For the past decade and a half or so, <eob> I've been trying to figure out <eol> how these little dudes do what they do, <eob> and how they pull this magic trick off. <eob>
But like all good magicians, <eob> they're not really releasing <eol> their secrets readily to me. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So here we are, <eob> after 20 years of essentially <eol> studying these animals, <eob> genome mapping, chin scratching, <eob> and thousands of amputations <eol> and thousands of regenerations, <eob> we still don't fully understand <eol> how these animals do what they do. <eob>
Each planarian an ocean unto itself, <eob> full of unknowns. <eob>
One of the common characteristics <eob> of all of these animals <eol> I've been talking to you about <eob> is that they did not appear <eol> to have received the memo <eob> that they need to behave <eol> according to the rules <eob> that we have derived from a handful <eol> of randomly selected animals <eob> that currently populate the vast majority <eob> of biomedical laboratories <eol> across the world. <eob>
Meet our Nobel Prize winners. <eob>
Seven species, essentially, <eob> that have produced for us the brunt <eol> of our understanding <eob> of biological behavior today. <eob>
This little guy right here <eob> — <eob> three Nobel Prizes in 12 years. <eob>
And yet, after all the attention <eol> they have garnered, <eob> and all the knowledge they have generated, <eob> as well as the lion's share <eol> of the funding, <eob> here we are standing [before] the same <eol> litany of intractable problems <eob> and many new challenges. <eob>
And that's because, unfortunately, <eob> these seven animals essentially correspond <eob> to 0.0009 percent of all of the species <eol> that inhabit the planet. <eob>
So I'm beginning to suspect <eob> that our specialization is beginning <eol> to impede our progress at best, <eob> and at worst, is leading us astray. <eob>
That's because life <eol> on this planet and its history <eob> is the history of rule breakers. <eob>
Life started on the face of this planet <eol> as single-cell organisms, <eob> swimming for millions <eol> of years in the ocean, <eob> until one of those creatures decided, <eob> "I'm going to do things differently today; <eob> today I would like to invent <eol> something called multicellularity, <eob> and I'm going to do this." <eob> And I'm sure it wasn't a popular <eol> decision at the time -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but somehow, it managed to do it. <eob>
And then, multicellular <eol> organisms began to populate <eob> all these ancestral oceans, <eob> and they thrived. <eob>
And we have them here today. <eob>
Land masses began to emerge <eol> from the surface of the oceans, <eob> and another creature thought, <eob> "Hey, that looks like a really nice <eol> piece of real estate. <eob>
I'd like to move there." <eob> "Are you crazy? <eob>
You're going to desiccate out there. <eob>
Nothing can live out of water. <eob> "But life found a way, <eob> and there are organisms <eol> now that live on land. <eob>
Once on land, they may have <eol> looked up into the sky <eob> and said, "It would be nice <eol> to go to the clouds, <eob> I'm going to fly." <eob> "You can't break the law of gravity, <eol> there's no way you can fly." <eob> And yet, nature has invented -- <eob> multiple and independent times -- <eob> ways to fly. <eob>
I love to study these animals <eol> that break the rules, <eob> because every time they break a rule, <eol> they invent something new <eob> that made it possible for us <eol> to be able to be here today. <eob>
These animals did not get the memo. <eob>
They break the rules. <eob>
So if we're going to study animals <eol> that break the rules, <eob> shouldn't how we study them <eol> also break the rules? <eob>
I think we need to renew <eol> our spirit of exploration. <eob>
Rather than bring nature <eol> into our laboratories <eob> and interrogate it there, <eob> we need to bring our science <eob> into the majestic laboratory <eol> that is nature, <eob> and there, with our modern <eol> technological armamentarium, <eob> interrogate every new form <eol> of life we find, <eob> and any new biological attribute <eol> that we may find. <eob>
We actually need to bring <eol> all of our intelligence <eob> to becoming stupid again -- <eob> clueless [before] the immensity <eol> of the unknown. <eob>
Because after all, <eob> science is not really about knowledge. <eob>
Science is about ignorance. <eob>
That's what we do. <eob>
Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, <eob> "If you want to build a ship, <eob> don't drum up people to collect wood <eob> and don't assign them tasks and work, <eob> but rather teach them to long <eol> for the endless immensity of the sea ..." <eob> As a scientist and a teacher, <eob> I like to paraphrase this to read <eob> that we scientists need <eol> to teach our students <eob> to long for the endless <eol> immensity of the sea <eob> that is our ignorance. <eob>
We <eob> Homo sapiens <eob> are the only species we know of <eob> that is driven to scientific inquiry. <eob>
We, like all other species on this planet, <eob> are inextricably woven <eol> into the history of life on this planet. <eob>
And I think I'm a little wrong <eol> when I say that life is a mystery, <eob> because I think that life <eol> is actually an open secret <eob> that has been beckoning our species <eol> for millennia to understand it. <eob>
So I ask you: <eob> Aren't we the best chance <eol> that life has to know itself? <eob>
And if so, <eob> what the heck are we waiting for? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
How many of you have used <eol> an electronic spreadsheet, <eob> like Microsoft Excel? <eob> Very good. <eob> Now, how many of you have run a business <eol> with a spreadsheet by hand, <eob> like my dad did for his small <eol> printing business in Philadelphia? <eob> A lot less. <eob>
Well, that's the way it was done <eol> for hundreds of years. <eob>
In early 1978, <eol> I started working on an idea <eob> that eventually became VisiCalc. <eob>
And the next year it shipped <eob> running on something new <eol> called an Apple II personal computer. <eob>
You could tell that things <eol> had really changed when, six years later, <eob> the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial <eob> that assumed you knew what VisiCalc was <eol> and maybe even were using it. <eob>
Steve Jobs back in 1990 <eob> said that "spreadsheets <eol> propelled the industry forward." <eob> "VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple <eol> more than any other single event." <eob> On a more personal note, <eob> Steve said, "If VisiCalc had been written <eol> for some other computer, <eob> you'd be interviewing <eol> somebody else right now." <eob>
So, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting <eol> personal computers on business desks. <eob> How did it come about? <eob> What was it? What did I go through <eol> to make it be what it was? <eob>
Well, I first learned to program <eol> back in 1966, when I was 15 -- <eob> just a couple months <eol> after this photo was taken. <eob>
Few high schoolers had access <eol> to computers in those days. <eob>
But through luck <eol> and an awful lot of perseverance, <eob> I was able to get <eol> computer time around the city. <eob>
After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock, <eol> I went off to MIT to go to college, <eob> where to make money, <eol> I worked on the Multics Project. <eob>
Multics was a trailblazing <eol> interactive time-sharing system. <eob>
Have you heard of the Linux <eol> and Unix operating systems? <eob> They came from Multics. <eob>
I worked on the Multics versions <eob> of what are known <eol> as interpreted computer languages, <eob> that are used by people <eol> in noncomputer fields <eob> to do their calculations <eol> while seated at a computer terminal. <eob>
After I graduated from MIT, <eob> I went to work for <eol> Digital Equipment Corporation. <eob>
At DEC, I worked on software <eob> for the new area <eol> of computerized typesetting. <eob>
I helped newspapers <eol> replace their reporters' typewriters <eob> with computer terminals. <eob>
I'd write software <eob> and then I'd go out in the field <eol> to places like the Kansas City Star, <eob> where I would train users <eol> and get feedback. <eob>
This was real-world experience <eob> that is quite different <eol> than what I saw in the lab at MIT. <eob>
After that, I was project leader <eob> of the software for DEC's first <eol> word processor, again a new field. <eob>
Like with typesetting, the important thing <eol> was crafting a user interface <eob> that was both natural and efficient <eol> for noncomputer people to use. <eob>
After I was at DEC, I went <eol> to work for a small company <eob> that made microprocessor-based electronic <eol> cash registers for the fast-food industry. <eob>
But I had always wanted to start <eol> a company with my friend Bob Frankston <eob> that I met on the Multics project at MIT. <eob>
So I decided to go back to school to learn <eol> as much as I could about business. <eob>
And in the fall of 1977, <eob> I entered the MBA program <eol> at Harvard Business School. <eob>
I was one of the few <eol> percentage of students <eob> who had a background <eol> in computer programming. <eob>
There's a picture of me from the yearbook <eol> sitting in the front row. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Now, at Harvard, <eol> we learned by the case method. <eob>
We'd do about three cases a day. <eob>
Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages <eol> describing particular business situations. <eob>
They often have exhibits, <eol> and exhibits often have words and numbers <eob> laid out in ways that make sense <eol> for the particular situation. <eob>
They're usually all somewhat different. <eob> Here's my homework. <eob> Again, numbers, words, <eol> laid out in ways that made sense. <eob>
Lots of calculations -- <eol> we got really close to our calculators. <eob>
In fact, here's my calculator. <eob>
For Halloween, I went <eol> dressed up as a calculator. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At the beginning of each class, <eol> the professor would call on somebody <eob> to present the case. <eob>
What they would do is <eol> they would explain what was going on <eob> and then dictate information <eol> that the professor would transcribe <eob> onto the many motorized blackboards <eol> in the front of the class, <eob> and then we'd have a discussion. <eob>
One of the really frustrating things <eol> is when you've done all your homework, <eob> you come in the next day <eol> only to find out that you made an error <eob> and all of the other numbers <eol> you did were wrong. <eob>
And you couldn't participate as well. <eob>
And we were marked by class participation. <eob>
So, sitting there with 87 other people <eol> in the class, I got to daydream a lot. <eob>
Most programmers in those days <eol> worked on mainframes, <eob> building things like inventory systems, <eol> payroll systems and bill-paying systems. <eob>
But I had worked <eol> on interactive word processing <eob> and on-demand personal computation. <eob>
Instead of thinking <eol> about paper printouts and punch cards, <eob> I imagined a magic blackboard <eob> that if you erased one number <eol> and wrote a new thing in, <eob> all of the other numbers <eol> would automatically change, <eob> like word processing with numbers. <eob>
I imagined that my calculator <eol> had mouse hardware on the bottom of it <eob> and a head-up display, <eol> like in a fighter plane. <eob>
And I could type some numbers in, <eol> and circle it, and press the sum button. <eob>
And right in the middle of a negotiation <eol> I'd be able to get the answer. <eob>
Now I just had to take my fantasy <eol> and turn it into reality. <eob>
My father taught me about prototyping. <eob>
He showed me mock-ups <eob> that he'd make to figure out <eol> the placement on the page <eob> for the things for brochures <eol> that he was printing. <eob>
And he'd use it <eol> to get feedback from customers <eob> and OKs before he sent the job <eol> off to the presses. <eob>
The act of making a simple, working <eol> version of what you're trying to build <eob> forces you to uncover key problems. <eob>
And it lets you find solutions <eol> to those problems much less expensively. <eob>
So I decided to build a prototype. <eob>
I went to a video terminal connected to <eol> Harvard's time-sharing system <eob> and got to work. <eob>
One of the first problems <eol> that I ran into was: <eob> How do you represent values in formulas? <eob>
Let me show you what I mean. <eob>
I thought that you would point somewhere, <eob> type in some words, <eol> then type in some somewhere else, <eob> put in some numbers and some more numbers, <eol> point where you want the answer. <eob> And then point to the first, press minus, <eol> point to the second, <eob> and get the result. <eob>
The problem was: <eol> What should I put in the formula? <eob>
It had to be something <eol> the computer knew what to put in. <eob>
And if you looked at the formula, <eob> you needed to know <eol> where on the screen it referred to. <eob>
The first thing I thought was <eol> the programmer way of doing it. <eob>
The first time you pointed to somewhere, <eob> the computer would ask you <eol> to type in a unique name. <eob>
It became pretty clear pretty fast that <eol> that was going to be too tedious. <eob>
The computer had to automatically <eol> make up the name and put it inside. <eob>
So I thought, why not make it be <eol> the order in which you create them? <eob> I tried that. Value 1, value 2. <eob>
Pretty quickly I saw <eol> that if you had more than a few values <eob> you'd never remember <eol> on the screen where things were. <eob>
Then I said, why not instead of <eol> allowing you to put values anywhere, <eob> I'll restrict you to a grid? <eob>
Then when you pointed to a cell, <eob> the computer could put <eol> the row and column in as a name. <eob>
And, if I did it like a map and put ABC <eol> across the top and numbers along the side, <eob> if you saw B7 in a formula, <eob> you'd know exactly <eol> where it was on the screen. <eob>
And if you had to type the formula <eol> in yourself, you'd know what to do. <eob>
Restricting you to a grid <eol> helped solve my problem. <eob>
It also opened up new capabilities, <eol> like the ability to have ranges of cells. <eob>
But it wasn't too restrictive -- <eob> you could still put any value, <eol> any formula, in any cell. <eob>
And that's the way we do it to this day, <eol> almost 40 years later. <eob>
My friend Bob and I decided that we were <eol> going to build this product together. <eob>
I did more work figuring out exactly <eol> how the program was supposed to behave. <eob>
I wrote a reference card <eol> to act as documentation. <eob>
It also helped me ensure <eol> that the user interface I was defining <eob> could be explained concisely <eol> and clearly to regular people. <eob>
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment <eol> he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts. <eob>
This is the inside of the attic. <eob>
Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System <eob> to write computer code <eol> on a terminal like this. <eob>
And then he would download test versions <eol> to a borrowed Apple II <eob> over a phone line <eol> using an acoustic coupler, <eob> and then we would test. <eob>
For one of these tests I prepared <eol> for this case about the Pepsi Challenge. <eob>
Print wasn't working yet, <eol> so I had to copy everything down. <eob>
Save wasn't working, <eol> so every time it crashed, <eob> I had to type in all of the formulas <eol> again, over and over again. <eob>
The next day in class, I raised my hand; <eol> I got called on, and I presented the case. <eob>
I did five-year projections. <eob>
I did all sorts of different scenarios. <eob>
I aced the case. <eob>
VisiCalc was already useful. <eob>
The professor said, "How did you do it?" <eob> Well, I didn't want to tell him <eol> about our secret program. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I said, "I took this and added this <eob> and multiplied by this <eol> and subtracted that." <eob>
He said, "Well, <eol> why didn't you use a ratio?" <eob>
I said, "Hah! <eob>
A ratio — that wouldn't have been as exact! <eob> "What I didn't say was," <eol> Divide isn't working yet. <eob> " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Eventually, though, <eol> we did finish enough of VisiCalc <eob> to be able to show it to the public. <eob>
My dad printed up a sample reference card <eob> that we could use as marketing material. <eob>
In June of 1979, our publisher <eol> announced VisiCalc to the world, <eob> in a small booth at the giant National <eol> Computer Conference in New York City. <eob>
The New York Times had <eol> a humorous article about the conference. <eob> "The machines perform <eol> what seem religious rites ... <eob> Even as the believers gather, <eob> the painters in the Coliseum sign room <eol> are adding to the pantheon, <eob> carefully lettering 'VISICALC' <eol> in giant black on yellow. <eob>
All hail VISICALC!" <eob> (Gasp) New York Times: <eol> "All hail VISICALC." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That was the last mention <eol> of the electronic spreadsheet <eob> in the popular business press <eol> for about two years. <eob>
Most people didn't get it yet. <eob> But some did. <eob>
In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc. <eob>
It came in packaging <eol> that looked like this. <eob>
And it looked like this <eol> running on the Apple II. <eob>
And the rest, as they say, is history. <eob>
Now, there's an awful lot <eol> more to this story, <eob> but that'll have to wait for another day. <eob>
One thing, though, Harvard remembers. <eob> Here's that classroom. <eob> They put up a plaque <eol> to commemorate what happened there. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
But it also serves as a reminder <eob> that you, too, should take <eol> your unique backgrounds, skills and needs <eob> and build prototypes to discover <eol> and work out the key problems, <eob> and through that, change the world. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So earlier this year, <eob> I was informed that I would be <eol> doing a TED Talk. <eob>
So I was excited, then I panicked, <eob> then I was excited, then I panicked, <eob> and in between the excitement <eol> and the panicking, <eob> I started to do my research, <eob> and my research primarily consisted <eol> of Googling how to give a great TED Talk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And interspersed with that, <eob> I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. <eob>
How many of you know who that is? <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
So I was Googling her <eol> because I always Google her <eob> because I'm just a fan, <eob> but also because she always has <eol> important and interesting things to say. <eob>
And the combination of those searches <eob> kept leading me to her talk <eob> on the dangers of a single story, <eob> on what happens <eol> when we have a solitary lens <eob> through which to understand <eol> certain groups of people, <eob> and it is the perfect talk. <eob>
It's the talk that I would have given <eol> if I had been famous first. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know, and you know, <eol> like, she's African and I'm African, <eob> and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist, <eob> and she's a storyteller <eol> and I'm a storyteller, <eob> so I really felt like it's my talk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So I decided that I was going <eol> to learn how to code, <eob> and then I was going to hack the internet <eob> and I would take down all the copies <eol> of that talk that existed, <eob> and then I would memorize it, <eob> and then I would come here <eol> and deliver it as if it was my own speech. <eob>
So that plan was going really well, <eol> except the coding part, <eob> and then one morning a few months ago, <eob> I woke up <eob> to the news that the wife <eol> of a certain presidential candidate <eob> had given a speech that -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> (Applause) <eob>
that sounded eerily like a speech <eol> given by one of my other faves, <eob> Michelle Obama. <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
And so I decided that I should <eol> probably write my own TED Talk, <eob> and so that is what I am here to do. <eob>
I'm here to talk about <eol> my own observations about storytelling. <eob>
I want to talk to you <eol> about the power of stories, of course, <eob> but I also want to talk <eol> about their limitations, <eob> particularly for those of us <eol> who are interested in social justice. <eob>
So since Adichie gave that talk <eol> seven years ago, <eob> there has been a boom in storytelling. <eob>
Stories are everywhere, <eob> and if there was a danger <eol> in the telling of one tired old tale, <eob> then I think there has got to be <eol> lots to celebrate about the flourishing <eob> of so many stories and so many voices. <eob>
Stories are the antidote to bias. <eob>
In fact, today, if you are middle class <eol> and connected via the internet, <eob> you can download stories <eol> at the touch of a button <eob> or the swipe of a screen. <eob>
You can listen to a podcast <eob> about what it's like <eol> to grow up Dalit in Kolkata. <eob>
You can hear an indigenous <eol> man in Australia <eob> talk about the trials and triumphs <eol> of raising his children in dignity <eob> and in pride. <eob>
Stories make us fall in love. <eob>
They heal rifts and they bridge divides. <eob>
Stories can even make it easier for us <eob> to talk about the deaths <eol> of people in our societies <eob> who don't matter, <eol> because they make us care. <eob> Right? <eob>
I'm not so sure, <eob> and I actually work for a place <eol> called the Centre for Stories. <eob>
And my job is to help to tell stories <eob> that challenge mainstream narratives <eol> about what it means to be black <eob> or a Muslim or a refugee <eol> or any of those other categories <eob> that we talk about all the time. <eob>
But I come to this work <eob> after a long history <eol> as a social justice activist, <eob> and so I'm really interested in the ways <eob> that people talk <eol> about nonfiction storytelling <eob> as though it's about <eol> more than entertainment, <eob> as though it's about being <eol> a catalyst for social action. <eob>
It's not uncommon to hear people say <eob> that stories make <eol> the world a better place. <eob>
Increasingly, though, I worry <eol> that even the most poignant stories, <eob> particularly the stories about people <eol> who no one seems to care about, <eob> can often get in the way <eol> of action towards social justice. <eob>
Now, this is not because <eol> storytellers mean any harm. <eob> Quite the contrary. <eob> Storytellers are often do-gooders <eol> like me and, I suspect, yourselves. <eob>
And the audiences of storytellers <eob> are often deeply compassionate <eol> and empathetic people. <eob>
Still, good intentions <eol> can have unintended consequences, <eob> and so I want to propose that stories <eol> are not as magical as they seem. <eob>
So three -- because <eol> it's always got to be three -- <eob> three reasons why I think <eob> that stories don't necessarily <eol> make the world a better place. <eob>
Firstly, stories can create <eol> an illusion of solidarity. <eob>
There is nothing <eol> like that feel-good factor you get <eob> from listening to a fantastic story <eob> where you feel like you <eol> climbed that mountain, right, <eob> or that you befriended <eol> that death row inmate. <eob>
But you didn't. <eob> You haven't done anything. <eob>
Listening is an important <eob> but insufficient step <eol> towards social action. <eob>
Secondly, I think often we are drawn <eob> towards characters and protagonists <eob> who are likable and human. <eob>
And this makes sense, of course, right? <eob>
Because if you like someone, <eol> then you care about them. <eob>
But the inverse is also true. <eob>
If you don't like someone, <eob> then you don't care about them. <eob>
And if you don't care about them, <eob> you don't have to see yourself <eol> as having a moral obligation <eob> to think about the circumstances <eol> that shaped their lives. <eob>
I learned this lesson <eol> when I was 14 years old. <eob>
I learned that actually, <eol> you don't have to like someone <eob> to recognize their wisdom, <eob> and you certainly <eol> don't have to like someone <eob> to take a stand by their side. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So my bike was stolen <eob> while I was riding it -- <eob>
which is possible if you're <eol> riding slowly enough, which I was. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So one minute <eol> I'm cutting across this field <eob> in the Nairobi neighborhood <eol> where I grew up, <eob> and it's like a very bumpy path, <eob> and so when you're riding a bike, <eob> you don't want to be like, you know -- <eob>
And so I'm going like this, <eol> slowly pedaling, <eob> and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor. <eob>
I'm on the ground, and I look up, <eob> and there's this kid peddling away <eol> in the getaway vehicle, <eob> which is my bike, <eob> and he's about 11 or 12 years old, <eol> and I'm on the floor, <eob> and I'm crying because I saved <eol> a lot of money for that bike, <eob> and I'm crying and I stand up <eol> and I start screaming. <eob>
Instinct steps in, <eol> and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!" <eob> which means "thief" in Swahili. <eob>
And out of the woodworks, <eol> all of these people come out <eob> and they start to give chase. <eob>
Right? <eob> This is Africa, so mob justice in action. <eob> And I round the corner, <eol> and they've captured him, <eob> they've caught him. <eob>
The suspect has been apprehended, <eob> and they make him give me my bike back, <eob> and they also make him apologize. <eob>
Again, you know, <eol> typical African justice, right? <eob>
And so they make him say sorry. <eob>
And so we stand there facing each other, <eob> and he looks at me, and he says sorry, <eob> but he looks at me <eol> with this unbridled fury. <eob>
He is very, very angry. <eob>
And it is the first time that I have been <eol> confronted with someone <eob> who doesn't like me <eol> simply because of what I represent. <eob>
He looks at me <eol> with this look as if to say, <eob> "You, with your shiny skin <eol> and your bike, you're angry at me?" <eob>
So it was a hard lesson <eol> that he didn't like me, <eob> but you know what, he was right. <eob>
I was a middle-class kid <eol> living in a poor country. <eob>
I had a bike, and he barely had food. <eob>
Sometimes, it's the messages <eol> that we don't want to hear, <eob> the ones that make us <eol> want to crawl out of ourselves, <eob> that we need to hear the most. <eob>
For every lovable storyteller <eol> who steals your heart, <eob> there are hundreds more <eol> whose voices are slurred and ragged, <eob> who don't get to stand up on a stage <eol> dressed in fine clothes like this. <eob>
There are a million <eol> angry-boy-on-a-bike stories <eob> and we can't afford to ignore them <eob> simply because we don't like <eol> their protagonists <eob> or because that's not the kid <eol> that we would bring home with us <eob> from the orphanage. <eob>
that stories don't necessarily <eol> make the world a better place. <eob> The third reason that I think <eob> is that too often we are so invested <eol> in the personal narrative <eob> that we forget <eol> to look at the bigger picture. <eob>
And so we applaud someone <eob> when they tell us <eol> about their feelings of shame, <eob> but we don't necessarily <eol> link that to oppression. <eob>
We nod understandingly <eol> when someone says they felt small, <eob> but we don't link that to discrimination. <eob>
The most important stories, <eol> especially for social justice, <eob> are those that do both, <eob> that are both personal and allow us <eol> to explore and understand the political. <eob>
But it's not just <eol> about the stories we like <eob> versus the stories we choose to ignore. <eob>
Increasingly, we are living in a society <eol> where there are larger forces at play, <eob> where stories are actually for many people <eol> beginning to replace the news. <eob> Yeah? <eob> We live in a time where we are witnessing <eol> the decline of facts, <eob> when emotions rule <eob> and analysis, it's kind of boring, right? <eob>
Where we value what we feel <eol> more than what we actually know. <eob>
A recent report by the Pew Center <eol> on trends in America <eob> indicates that only 10 percent <eol> of young adults under the age of 30 <eob> "place a lot of trust in the media." <eob> Now, this is significant. <eob>
It means that storytellers <eol> are gaining trust <eob> at precisely the same moment <eob> that many in the media <eol> are losing the confidence in the public. <eob>
This is not a good thing, <eob> because while stories are important <eob> and they help us <eol> to have insights in many ways, <eob> we need the media. <eob>
From my years <eol> as a social justice activist, <eob> I know very well that we need <eol> credible facts from media institutions <eob> combined with the powerful voices <eol> of storytellers. <eob>
That's what pushes the needle forward <eol> in terms of social justice. <eob>
In the final analysis, of course, <eob> it is justice <eob> that makes the world a better place, <eob> not stories. <eob> Right? <eob> And so if it is justice <eol> that we are after, <eob> then I think we mustn't focus <eol> on the media or on storytellers. <eob>
We must focus on audiences, <eob> on anyone who has ever turned on a radio <eob> or listened to a podcast, <eob> and that means all of us. <eob>
So a few concluding thoughts <eob> on what audiences can do <eol> to make the world a better place. <eob>
So firstly, the world <eol> would be a better place, I think, <eob> if audiences were more curious <eol> and more skeptical <eob> and asked more questions <eol> about the social context <eob> that created those stories <eol> that they love so much. <eob>
Secondly, the world <eol> would be a better place <eob> if audiences recognized <eol> that storytelling is intellectual work. <eob>
And I think it would <eol> be important for audiences <eob> to demand more buttons <eol> on their favorite websites, <eob> buttons for example that say, <eob> "If you liked this story, <eob> click here to support a cause <eol> your storyteller believes in." <eob> Or "click here to contribute <eol> to your storyteller's next big idea." <eob> Often, we are committed to the platforms, <eob> but not necessarily <eol> to the storytellers themselves. <eob>
And then lastly, I think that audiences <eol> can make the world a better place <eob> by switching off their phones, <eob> by stepping away from their screens <eob> and stepping out into the real world <eol> beyond what feels safe. <eob>
Alice Walker has said, <eob> "Look closely at the present <eol> you are constructing. <eob>
It should look like the future <eol> you are dreaming." <eob> Storytellers can help us to dream, <eob> but it's up to all of us <eol> to have a plan for justice. <eob> Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
"You can't sue someone <eol> for calling them a cunt." <eob>
"If you can't handle the Internet, <eol> fuck off, whore." <eob>
"I wish Ashley Judd <eol> would die a horrible death. <eob>
She is the absolute worst." <eob>
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason <eol> women shouldn't vote." <eob>
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie, <eob> I don't even want to rape it." <eob>
"Whatever you do, <eob> don't tell Ashley Judd. <eob>
She'll die alone <eol> with a dried out vagina. " <eob>
"If I had to fuck an older woman, <eob> oh my God, <eob> I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, <eob> that bitch is hot af. <eob>
The unforgivable shit I would do to her." <eob>
Online misogyny is a global <eol> gender rights tragedy, <eob> and it is imperative that it ends. <eob>
Girls' and women's voices, <eob> and our allies' voices <eol> are constrained in ways <eob> that are personally, economically, <eob> professionally and politically damaging. <eob>
And when we curb abuse, <eob> we will expand freedom. <eob>
I am a Kentucky basketball fan, <eob> so on a fine March day last year, <eob> I was doing one of the things I do best: <eob> I was cheering for my Wildcats. <eob>
The daffodils were blooming, <eob> but the referees were not blowing <eol> the whistle when I was telling them to. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Funny, they're very friendly <eol> to me before the opening tip, <eob> but they really ignore me during the game. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Three of my players were bleeding, <eol> so I did the next best thing ... <eob> I tweeted. <eob>
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss <eol> my team's free throw making a -- <eob> @KySportsRadio @marchmadness <eol> @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] <eob>
It is routine for me to be treated <eol> in the ways I've already described to you. <eob>
It happens to me every single day <eob> on social media platforms <eol> such as Twitter and Facebook. <eob>
Since I joined Twitter in 2011, <eob> misogyny and misogynists <eol> have amply demonstrated <eob> they will dog my every step. <eob>
My spirituality, my faith, <eob> being a hillbilly -- <eol> I can say that, you can't -- <eob> all of it is fair game. <eob>
And I have responded to this <eol> with various strategies. <eob>
I've tried engaging people. <eob>
This one guy was sending me <eol> hypersexual, nasty stuff, <eob> and there was a girl in his avatar. <eob>
I wrote him back and said ... <eob> "Is that your daughter? <eob>
I feel a lot of fear <eol> that you may think about <eob> and talk to women this way." <eob> And he surprised me by saying, <eob> "You know what? <eol> You're right. I apologize." <eob> Sometimes people <eol> want to be held accountable. <eob>
This one guy was musing <eol> to I don't know who <eob> that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. <eob>
I was married to a Scot for 14 years, <eob> so I said, "Cunt means many <eol> different things in different countries -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize <eol> the global standard of a dick." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I've tried to rise above it, <eol> I've tried to get in the trenches, <eob> but mostly I would scroll through <eol> these social media platforms <eob> with one eye partially closed, <eol> trying not to see it, <eob> but you can't make <eol> a cucumber out of a pickle. <eob>
What is seen goes in. <eob> It's traumatic. <eob> And I was always secretly hoping <eol> in some part of me <eob> that what was being said to me <eol> and about me wasn't ... <eob> true. <eob>
Because even I, <eob> an avowed, self-declared feminist, <eob> who worships at the altar of Gloria -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
internalize the patriarchy. <eob> This is really critical. <eob>
Patriarchy is not boys and men. <eob> It is a system <eol> in which we all participate, <eob> including me. <eob>
On that particular day, for some reason, <eob> that particular tweet <eol> after the basketball game <eob> triggered something called a "cyber mob." <eob> This vitriolic, global outpouring <eol> of the most heinous hate speech: <eob> death threats, rape threats. <eob>
And don't you know, <eob> when I was sitting at home <eol> alone in my nightgown, <eob> I got a phone call, <eol> and it was my beloved former husband, <eob> and he said on a voice mail, <eob> "Loved one ... <eob> what is happening to you is not OK." <eob>
And there was something about him <eol> taking a stand for me that night ... <eob> that allowed me <eol> to take a stand for myself. <eob>
And I started to write. <eob>
I started to write about sharing the fact <eob> that I'm a survivor <eol> of all forms of sexual abuse, <eob> including three rapes. <eob>
And the hate speech <eol> I get in response to that -- <eob> these are just some of the comments <eol> posted to news outlets. <eob>
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun. <eob>
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] <eob>
May your grace and mercy shine. <eob>
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, <eol> it is entitled, <eob> "Forget Your Team: <eob> It Is Your Online Gender Violence <eol> Toward Girls And Women <eob> That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And I did that alone, <eol> and I published it alone, <eob> because my chief advisor said, <eob> "Please don't, <eob> the rain of retaliatory garbage <eol> that is inevitable -- <eob> I fear for you." <eob> But I trust girls and I trust women, <eob> and I trust our allies. <eob>
It was published, it went viral, <eob> it proves that every single day <eob> online misogyny is a phenomenon <eol> endured by us all, <eob> all over the world, <eob> and when it is intersectional, <eob> it is worse. <eob>
Sexual orientation, gender identity, <eob> race, ethnicity, religion — <eob> you name it, <eob> it amplifies the violence <eol> endured by girls and women, <eob> and for our younger girls, <eob> it is worse. <eob>
It's clearly traumatizing. <eob> Our mental health, <eol> our emotional well-being <eob> are so gravely affected <eob> because the threat of violence <eob> is experienced <eol> neurobiologically as violence. <eob>
The cortisol shoots up, <eol> the limbic system gets fired, <eob> we lose productivity at work. <eob>
And let's talk about work. <eob> Our ability to work is constrained. <eob>
Online searches of women applying for jobs <eol> reveal nude pictures of them, <eob> false allegations they have STDs, <eob> their addresses indicating <eol> that they are available for sex <eob> with real examples <eob> of people showing up <eol> at this house for said sex. <eob>
Our ability to go to school is impaired. <eob>
96 percent of all postings <eob> of sexual images of our young people ... <eob> girls. <eob> Our girls. <eob> Our boys are two to three <eol> times more likely -- <eob> nonconsensually -- <eob> to share images. <eob>
And I want to say a word <eol> about revenge porn. <eob>
Part of what came out of this tweet <eob> was my getting connected <eol> with allies and other activists <eob> who are fighting <eol> for a safe and free internet. <eob>
We started something <eol> called the Speech Project; <eob> curbing abuse, expanding freedom. <eob>
And that website <eol> provides a critical forum, <eob> because there is no global, legal thing <eob> to help us figure this out. <eob>
But we do provide on that website <eol> a standardized list of definitions, <eob> because it's hard to attack <eol> a behavior in the right way <eob> if we're not all sharing <eol> a definition of what that behavior is. <eob>
And I learned that revenge porn <eol> is often dangerously misapplied. <eob>
It is the nonconsensual <eol> sharing of an image <eob> used tactically to shame <eol> and humiliate a girl or woman <eob> that attempts to pornography us. <eob>
Our natural sexuality is -- <eob> I don't know about yours -- <eol> pretty gorgeous and wonderful. <eob>
And my expressing it <eol> does not pornography make. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, I have all these resources <eob> that I'm keenly aware <eol> so many people in the world do not. <eob>
I was able to start <eol> the Speech Project with colleagues. <eob>
I can often get a social media <eol> company's attention. <eob>
I have a wonderful visit <eol> to Facebook HQ coming up. <eob>
Hasn't helped the idiotic <eol> reporting standards yet ... <eob> I actually pay someone <eol> to scrub my social media feeds, <eob> attempting to spare my brain <eob> the daily iterations <eol> of the trauma of hate speech. <eob> And guess what? <eob> I get hate speech for that. <eob> "Oh, you live in an echo chamber." <eob> Well, guess what? <eob>
Having someone post a photograph <eol> of me with my mouth open <eob> saying they "can't wait <eol> to cum on my face," <eob> I have a right to set that boundary. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And this distinction <eol> between virtual and real is specious <eob> because guess what -- <eob> that actually happened to me <eol> once when I was a child, <eob> and so that tweet brought up that trauma, <eob> and I had to do work on that. <eob>
But you know what we do? <eol> We take all of this hate speech, <eob> and we disaggregate it, <eob> and we code it, <eob> and we give that data <eob> so that we understand <eol> the intersectionality of it: <eob> when I get porn, <eob> when it's about political affiliation, <eob> when it's about age, <eol> when it's about all of it. <eob>
We're going to win this fight. <eob>
There are a lot of solutions -- <eob> thank goodness. <eob>
I'm going to offer just a few, <eob> and of course I challenge you <eol> to create and contribute your own. <eob>
Number one: we have to start <eol> with digital media literacy, <eob> and clearly it must have a gendered lens. <eob>
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: <eob> it's essential. <eob>
Two... <eob> shall we talk about our friends in tech? <eob>
Said with dignity and respect, <eob> the sexism in your workplaces must end. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
(Cheers) <eob>
EDGE, <eob> the global standard for gender equality, <eob> is the minimum standard. <eob>
And guess what, <eob> Silicon Valley? <eob>
If L'Oréal in India, <eob> in the Philippines, in Brazil <eob> and in Russia can do it, <eob> you can, too. <eob> Enough excuses. <eob> Only when women have critical mass <eol> in every department at your companies, <eob> including building platforms <eol> from the ground up, <eob> will the conversations <eol> about priorities and solutions change. <eob>
And more love for my friends in tech: <eob> profiteering off misogyny <eol> in video games must end. <eob>
I'm so tired of hearing you <eol> talk to me at cocktail parties -- <eob> like you did a couple <eol> weeks ago in Aspen -- <eob> about how deplorable #Gamergate was, <eob> when you're still making <eol> billions of dollars off games <eob> that maim and dump women for sport. <eob> Basta! -- as the Italians would say. <eob> Enough. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Our friends in law enforcement <eol> have much to do, <eob> because we've seen <eob> that online violence <eol> is an extension of in-person violence. <eob>
In our country, <eob> more girls and women have been murdered <eol> by their intimate partners <eob> than died on 9 / 11 <eob> and have died since in Afghanistan <eol> and Iraq combined. <eob>
And it's not cool to say that, <eob> but it is <eob> true. <eob>
We care so much geopolitically <eol> about what men are doing over there <eob> to women over there ... <eob> In 2015, <eob> 72,828 women used intimate <eol> partner violence services in this country. <eob>
That is not counting the girls <eol> and women and boys who needed them. <eob>
Law enforcement must be empowered <eob> with up-to-date internet technology, <eob> the devices and an understanding <eol> of these platforms -- <eob> how they work. <eob>
The police wanted to be helpful <eol> when Amanda Hess called <eob> about the death threat <eol> she was getting on Twitter, <eob> but they couldn't really when they said, <eob> "What's Twitter?" <eob>
Our legislators must write <eol> and pass astute legislation <eob> that reflects today's technology <eob> and our notions of free and hate speech. <eob>
In New York recently, the law <eol> could not be applied to a perpetrator <eob> because the crimes <eol> must have been committed -- <eob> even if it was anonymous -- <eob> they must have been committed <eol> by telephone, in mail, <eob> by telegraph -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
The language must be <eol> technologically neutral. <eob>
So apparently, <eob> I've got a pretty bold voice. <eob>
So, let's talk about our friends ... <eob> white men. <eob>
You have a role to play <eol> and a choice to make. <eob>
You can do something, <eob> or you can do nothing. <eob>
We're cool in this room, <eob> but when this goes out, everyone will say, <eob> "Oh my God, she's a reverse racist." <eob> That quote was said <eol> by a white man, Robert Moritz, <eob> chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, <eob> he asked me to include it in my talk. <eob>
We need to grow support lines <eol> and help groups, <eob> so victims can help each other <eob> when their lives and finances <eol> have been derailed. <eob>
We must as individuals disrupt <eol> gender violence as it is happening. <eob>
92 percent of young people <eob> 29 and under witness it. <eob>
72 percent of us have witnessed it. <eob>
We must have the courage and urgency <eob> to practice stopping it <eol> as it is unfolding. <eob>
And lastly, <eob> believe her. <eob> Believe her. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
This is fundamentally <eol> a problem of human interaction. <eob>
And as I believe that human interaction <eol> is at the core of our healing, <eob> trauma not transformed <eol> will be trauma transferred. <eob>
Edith Wharton said, <eol> "The end is latent in the beginning," <eob> so we are going to end this talk <eol> replacing hate speech with love speech. <eob>
Because I get lonely in this, <eob> but I know that we are allies. <eob>
I recently learned <eob> about how gratitude and affirmations <eol> offset negative interactions. <eob>
It takes five of those <eol> to offset one negative interaction, <eob> and gratitude in particular -- <eob> free, available globally <eol> any time, anywhere, <eob> to anyone in any dialect -- <eob> it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, <eob> a watershed part of the brain <eob> that floods it with great, good stuff. <eob>
So I'm going to say <eol> awesome stuff about myself. <eob>
I would like for you <eol> to reflect it back to me. <eob>
It might sound something like this -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I am a powerful and strong woman, <eol> and you would say, "Yes, you are." <eob>
Audience: Yes, you are. <eob>
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. <eob>
A: Yes, she does. <eob>
AJ: I did a great job with my talk. <eob>
A: Yes, you did. <eob>
AJ: I have a right to be here. <eob>
A: Yes, you do. <eob>
AJ: I'm really cute. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
AJ: God does good work. <eob>
A: Yes, He does. <eob>
AJ: And I love you. <eob>
Thank you so much <eol> for letting me be of service. <eob>
If I asked you to picture the air, <eob> what do you imagine? <eob>
Most people think about either empty space <eob> or clear blue sky <eob> or sometimes trees dancing in the wind. <eob>
And then I remember my high school <eol> chemistry teacher with really long socks <eob> at the blackboard, <eob> drawing diagrams of bubbles <eol> connected to other bubbles, <eob> and describing how they vibrate <eol> and collide in a kind of frantic soup. <eob>
But really, we tend not to think <eol> about the air that much at all. <eob>
We notice it mostly <eob> when there's some kind of unpleasant <eol> sensory intrusion upon it, <eob> like a terrible smell <eol> or something visible like smoke or mist. <eob>
But it's always there. <eob>
It's touching all of us right now. <eob>
It's even inside us. <eob>
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate. <eob>
And yet, it's so easily forgotten. <eob>
So what is the air? <eob>
It's the combination of the invisible <eol> gases that envelop the Earth, <eob> attracted by the Earth's <eol> gravitational pull. <eob>
And even though I'm a visual artist, <eob> I'm interested in <eol> the invisibility of the air. <eob>
I'm interested in how we imagine it, <eob> how we experience it <eob> and how we all have an innate <eol> understanding of its materiality <eob> through breathing. <eob>
All life on Earth changes the air <eol> through gas exchange, <eob> and we're all doing it right now. <eob>
Actually, why don't we all <eol> right now together take <eob> one big, collective, deep breath in. <eob>
Ready? In. (Inhales) <eob> And out. (Exhales) <eob>
That air that you just exhaled, <eob> you enriched a hundred times <eol> in carbon dioxide. <eob>
So roughly five liters of air per breath, <eol> 17 breaths per minute <eob> of the 525,600 minutes per year, <eob> comes to approximately <eol> 45 million liters of air, <eob> enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide, <eob> just for you. <eob>
Now, that's equivalent to about 18 <eol> Olympic-sized swimming pools. <eob>
For me, air is plural. <eob>
It's simultaneously <eol> as small as our breathing <eob> and as big as the planet. <eob>
And it's kind of hard to picture. <eob>
Maybe it's impossible, <eol> and maybe it doesn't matter. <eob>
Through my visual arts practice, <eob> I try to make air, not so much picture it, <eob> but to make it visceral <eol> and tactile and haptic. <eob>
I try to expand this notion <eol> of the aesthetic, how things look, <eob> so that it can include things <eol> like how it feels on your skin <eob> and in your lungs, <eob> and how your voice sounds <eol> as it passes through it. <eob>
I explore the weight, density and smell, <eol> but most importantly, <eob> I think a lot about the stories we attach <eol> to different kinds of air. <eob>
This is a work I made in 2014. <eob>
It's called "Different Kinds <eol> of Air: A Plant's Diary," <eob> where I was recreating the air <eol> from different eras in Earth's evolution, <eob> and inviting the audience <eol> to come in and breathe them with me. <eob>
And it's really surprising, <eol> so drastically different. <eob>
Now, I'm not a scientist, <eob> but atmospheric scientists <eol> will look for traces <eob> in the air chemistry in geology, <eob> a bit like how rocks can oxidize, <eob> and they'll extrapolate <eol> that information and aggregate it, <eob> such that they can <eol> pretty much form a recipe <eob> for the air at different times. <eob>
Then I come in as the artist <eol> and take that recipe <eob> and recreate it using the component gases. <eob>
I was particularly interested <eol> in moments of time <eob> that are examples <eol> of life changing the air, <eob> but also the air that can influence <eol> how life will evolve, <eob> like Carboniferous air. <eob>
It's from about 300 to 350 <eol> million years ago. <eob>
It's an era known <eol> as the time of the giants. <eob>
So for the first time <eol> in the history of life, <eob> lignin evolves. <eob>
That's the hard stuff <eol> that trees are made of. <eob>
So trees effectively invent <eol> their own trunks at this time, <eob> and they get really big, <eol> bigger and bigger, <eob> and pepper the Earth, <eob> releasing oxygen, releasing <eol> oxygen, releasing oxygen, <eob> such that the oxygen levels <eol> are about twice as high <eob> as what they are today. <eob>
And this rich air supports <eol> massive insects -- <eob> huge spiders and dragonflies <eol> with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters. <eob>
To breathe, this air is really clean <eol> and really fresh. <eob>
It doesn't so much have a flavor, <eob> but it does give your body <eol> a really subtle kind of boost of energy. <eob>
It's really good for hangovers. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Or there's the air of the Great Dying -- <eob> that's about 252.5 million years ago, <eob> just before the dinosaurs evolve. <eob>
It's a really short time period, <eol> geologically speaking, <eob> from about 20- to 200,000 years. <eob> Really quick. <eob> This is the greatest extinction event <eol> in Earth's history, <eob> even bigger than when <eol> the dinosaurs died out. <eob>
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species <eol> at this time die out, <eob> and simultaneous to that is a huge, <eol> dramatic spike in carbon dioxide, <eob> that a lot of scientists agree <eob> comes from a simultaneous <eol> eruption of volcanoes <eob> and a runaway greenhouse effect. <eob>
Oxygen levels at this time go <eol> to below half of what they are today, <eob> so about 10 percent. <eob>
So this air would definitely not <eol> support human life, <eob> but it's OK to just have a breath. <eob>
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting. <eob>
It's really calming, it's quite warm <eob> and it has a flavor a little bit <eol> like soda water. <eob>
It has that kind of spritz, <eol> quite pleasant. <eob>
So with all this thinking <eol> about air of the past, <eob> it's quite natural to start thinking <eol> about the air of the future. <eob>
And instead of being speculative with air <eob> and just making up what I think <eol> might be the future air, <eob> I discovered this human-synthesized air. <eob>
That means that it doesn't occur <eol> anywhere in nature, <eob> but it's made by humans in a laboratory <eob> for application in different <eol> industrial settings. <eob>
Why is it future air? <eob>
Well, this air is a really stable molecule <eob> that will literally be part of the air <eol> once it's released, <eob> for the next 300 to 400 years, <eol> before it's broken down. <eob>
So that's about 12 to 16 generations. <eob>
And this future air has <eol> some very sensual qualities. <eob>
It's very heavy. <eob> It's about eight times heavier <eol> than the air we're used to breathing. <eob>
It's so heavy, in fact, <eol> that when you breathe it in, <eob> whatever words you speak <eol> are kind of literally heavy as well, <eob> so they dribble down your chin <eol> and drop to the floor <eob> and soak into the cracks. <eob>
It's an air that operates <eol> quite a lot like a liquid. <eob>
Now, this air comes <eol> with an ethical dimension as well. <eob>
Humans made this air, <eob> but it's also the most potent <eol> greenhouse gas <eob> that has ever been tested. <eob>
Its warming potential is 24,000 times <eol> that of carbon dioxide, <eob> and it has that longevity <eol> of 12 to 16 generations. <eob>
So this ethical confrontation <eol> is really central to my work. <eob> (In a lowered voice) It has <eol> another quite surprising quality. <eob>
It changes the sound of your voice <eol> quite dramatically. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So when we start to think -- ooh! <eol> It's still there a bit. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
When we think about climate change, <eob> we probably don't think about <eol> giant insects and erupting volcanoes <eob> or funny voices. <eob>
The images that more readily come to mind <eob> are things like retreating glaciers <eol> and polar bears adrift on icebergs. <eob>
We think about pie charts <eol> and column graphs <eob> and endless politicians <eol> talking to scientists wearing cardigans. <eob>
But perhaps it's time we start <eol> thinking about climate change <eob> on the same visceral level <eol> that we experience the air. <eob>
Like air, climate change is simultaneously <eol> at the scale of the molecule, <eob> the breath and the planet. <eob>
It's immediate, vital and intimate, <eob> as well as being amorphous and cumbersome. <eob>
And yet, it's so easily forgotten. <eob>
Climate change is the collective <eol> self-portrait of humanity. <eob>
It reflects our decisions as individuals, <eob> as governments and as industries. <eob>
And if there's anything <eol> I've learned from looking at air, <eob> it's that even though <eol> it's changing, it persists. <eob>
It may not support the kind of life <eol> that we'd recognize, <eob> but it will support something. <eob>
And if we humans are such a vital <eol> part of that change, <eob> I think it's important <eol> that we can feel the discussion. <eob>
Because even though it's invisible, <eob> humans are leaving <eol> a very vibrant trace in the air. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
Cybercrime is out of control. <eob> It's everywhere. <eob> We hear about it every single day. <eob>
This year, <eob> over two billion records lost or stolen. <eob>
And last year, 100 million of us, <eol> mostly Americans, <eob> lost our health insurance data <eol> to thieves -- myself included. <eob>
What's particularly concerning about this <eol> is that in most cases, <eob> it was months before anyone even <eol> reported that these records were stolen. <eob>
So if you watch the evening news, <eob> you would think that most of this <eol> is espionage or nation-state activity. <eob>
And, well, some of it is. <eob>
Espionage, you see, is an accepted <eol> international practice. <eob>
But in this case, <eob> it is only a small portion <eol> of the problem that we're dealing with. <eob>
How often do we hear about a breach <eob> followed by, "... it was the result <eol> of a sophisticated nation-state attack?" <eob> Well, often that is companies <eol> not being willing to own up <eob> to their own lackluster <eol> security practices. <eob>
There is also a widely held belief <eob> that by blaming an attack <eol> on a nation-state, <eob> you are putting regulators at bay -- <eob> at least for a period of time. <eob>
So where is all of this coming from? <eob>
The United Nations estimates <eol> that 80 percent of it <eob> is from highly organized <eol> and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs. <eob>
To date, <eob> this represents one of the largest <eol> illegal economies in the world, <eob> topping out at, now get this, <eob> 445 billion dollars. <eob>
Let me put that in perspective <eol> for all of you: <eob> 445 billion dollars <eob> is larger than the GDP <eob> of 160 nations, <eob> including Ireland, Finland, <eol> Denmark and Portugal, <eob> to name a few. <eob>
So how does this work? <eob> How do these criminals operate? <eob>
Well, let me tell you a little story. <eob>
About a year ago, <eob> our security researchers were tracking <eob> a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated <eol> banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf. <eob>
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer <eob> via you clicking on a link <eol> in a phishing email <eob> that you probably shouldn't have. <eob> It would then sit and wait. <eob> It would wait until you logged <eol> into your bank account. <eob>
And when you did, <eol> the bad guys would reach in, <eob> steal your credentials, <eob> and then use that to steal your money. <eob>
This sounds terrible, <eob> but the reality is, <eol> in the security industry, <eob> this form of attack <eol> is somewhat commonplace. <eob>
However, the Dyre Wolf had <eol> two distinctly different personalities -- <eob> one for these small transactions, <eob> but it took on an entirely <eol> different persona <eob> if you were in the business of moving <eol> large-scale wire transfers. <eob>
Here's what would happen. <eob>
You start the process <eol> of issuing a wire transfer, <eob> and up in your browser would pop <eol> a screen from your bank, <eob> indicating that there's a problem <eol> with your account, <eob> and that you need to call <eol> the bank immediately, <eob> along with the number <eol> to the bank's fraud department. <eob>
So you pick up the phone and you call. <eob>
And after going through <eol> the normal voice prompts, <eob> you're met with an English-speaking operator. <eob> "Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank. <eob>
How can I help you? <eob> "And you go through the process <eol> like you do every time you call your bank, <eob> of giving them your name and your account number, <eob> going through the security checks to verify you <eol> are who you said you are. <eob>
Most of us may not know this, <eob> but in many large-scale wire transfers, <eob> it requires two people to sign off <eol> on the wire transfer, <eob> so the operator then asks you <eol> to get the second person on the line, <eob> and goes through the same set <eol> of verifications and checks. <eob>
Sounds normal, right? <eob> Only one problem: <eob> you're not talking to the bank. <eob>
You're talking to the criminals. <eob>
They had built <eol> an English-speaking help desk, <eob> fake overlays to the banking website. <eob>
And this was so flawlessly executed <eob> that they were moving <eol> between a half a million <eob> and a million and a half <eol> dollars per attempt <eob> into their criminal coffers. <eob>
These criminal organizations operate <eob> like highly regimented, <eol> legitimate businesses. <eob>
Their employees work <eol> Monday through Friday. <eob>
They take the weekends off. <eob> How do we know this? <eob> We know this because <eol> our security researchers see <eob> repeated spikes of malware <eol> on a Friday afternoon. <eob>
The bad guys, after a long weekend <eol> with the wife and kids, <eob> come back in to see how well things went. <eob>
The Dark Web is where <eol> they spend their time. <eob>
That is a term used to describe <eol> the anonymous underbelly of the internet, <eob> where thieves can operate with anonymity <eob> and without detection. <eob>
Here they peddle their attack software <eob> and share information <eol> on new attack techniques. <eob>
You can buy everything there, <eob> from a base-level attack <eol> to a much more advanced version. <eob>
In fact, in many cases, you even see <eob> gold, silver and bronze levels of service. <eob>
You can check references. <eob>
You can even buy attacks <eob> that come with a money-back guarantee -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
if you're not successful. <eob>
Now, these environments, <eol> these marketplaces -- <eob> they look like an Amazon or an eBay. <eob>
You see products, prices, <eol> ratings and reviews. <eob>
Of course, if you're going <eol> to buy an attack, <eob> you're going to buy from a reputable <eol> criminal with good ratings, right? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This isn't any different <eob> than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor <eol> before going to a new restaurant. <eob> So, here is an example. <eob> This is an actual screenshot <eol> of a vendor selling malware. <eob>
Notice they're a vendor level four, <eob> they have a trust level of six. <eob>
They've had 400 positive reviews <eol> in the last year, <eob> and only two negative reviews <eol> in the last month. <eob>
We even see things like licensing terms. <eob>
Here's an example of a site you can go to <eob> if you want to change your identity. <eob>
They will sell you a fake ID, <eob> fake passports. <eob>
But note the legally binding terms <eol> for purchasing your fake ID. <eob> Give me a break. <eob> What are they going to do -- <eol> sue you if you violate them? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
This occurred a couple of months ago. <eob>
One of our security <eol> researchers was looking <eob> at a new Android malware application <eol> that we had discovered. <eob>
It was called Bilal Bot. <eob>
In a blog post, <eob> she positioned Bilal Bot <eol> as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative <eob> to the much more advanced GM Bot <eob> that was commonplace <eol> in the criminal underground. <eob>
This review did not sit well <eol> with the authors of Bilal Bot. <eob>
So they wrote her this very email, <eob> pleading their case <eol> and making the argument <eob> that they felt she had evaluated <eol> an older version. <eob>
They asked her to please update <eol> her blog with more accurate information <eob> and even offered to do an interview <eob> to describe to her in detail <eob> how their attack software was now <eol> far better than the competition. <eob>
So look, <eob> you don't have to like what they do, <eob> but you do have to respect <eol> the entrepreneurial nature <eob> of their endeavors. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So how are we going to stop this? <eob>
It's not like we're going to be able <eol> to identify who's responsible -- <eob> remember, they operate with anonymity <eob> and outside the reach of the law. <eob>
We're certainly not going to be able <eol> to prosecute the offenders. <eob>
I would propose that we need <eol> a completely new approach. <eob>
And that approach needs <eol> to be centered on the idea <eob> that we need to change <eol> the economics for the bad guys. <eob>
And to give you a perspective <eol> on how this can work, <eob> let's think of the response we see <eol> to a healthcare pandemic: <eob> SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika. <eob>
What is the top priority? <eob>
It's knowing who is infected <eol> and how the disease is spreading. <eob>
Now, governments, private institutions, <eol> hospitals, physicians -- <eob> everyone responds openly and quickly. <eob>
This is a collective and altruistic effort <eob> to stop the spread in its tracks <eob> and to inform anyone not infected <eob> how to protect or inoculate themselves. <eob>
Unfortunately, this is not at all <eol> what we see in response to a cyber attack. <eob>
Organizations are far more likely <eol> to keep information on that attack <eob> to themselves. <eob> Why? <eob> Because they're worried <eol> about competitive advantage, <eob> litigation <eob> or regulation. <eob>
We need to effectively democratize <eol> threat intelligence data. <eob>
We need to get all of these organizations <eol> to open up and share <eob> what is in their private arsenal <eol> of information. <eob>
The bad guys are moving fast; <eob> we've got to move faster. <eob>
And the best way to do that is to open up <eob> and share data on what's happening. <eob>
Let's think about this in the construct <eol> of security professionals. <eob>
Remember, they're programmed right <eol> into their DNA to keep secrets. <eob>
We've got to turn <eol> that thinking on its head. <eob>
We've got to get governments, <eol> private institutions <eob> and security companies <eob> willing to share information at speed. <eob>
And here's why: <eob> because if you share the information, <eob> it's equivalent to inoculation. <eob>
And if you're not sharing, <eob> you're actually part of the problem, <eob> because you're increasing the odds <eol> that other people could be impacted <eob> by the same attack techniques. <eob>
But there's an even bigger benefit. <eob>
By destroying criminals' devices <eol> closer to real time, <eob> we break their plans. <eob>
We inform the people they aim to hurt <eob> far sooner than they had ever anticipated. <eob>
We ruin their reputations, <eob> we crush their ratings and reviews. <eob>
We make cybercrime not pay. <eob>
We change the economics for the bad guys. <eob>
But to do this, <eol> a first mover was required -- <eob> someone to change the thinking <eol> in the security industry overall. <eob>
About a year ago, <eob> my colleagues and I had a radical idea. <eob>
What if IBM were to take our data -- <eob> we had one of the largest threat <eol> intelligence databases in the world -- <eob> and open it up? <eob>
It had information not just <eol> on what had happened in the past, <eob> but what was happening in near-real time. <eob>
What if we were to publish it all <eol> openly on the internet? <eob>
As you can imagine, <eol> this got quite a reaction. <eob>
First came the lawyers: <eob> What are the legal <eol> implications of doing that? <eob>
Then came the business: <eob> What are the business <eol> implications of doing that? <eob>
And this was also met with a good dose <eob> of a lot of people just asking <eol> if we were completely crazy. <eob>
But there was one conversation <eol> that kept floating to the surface <eob> in every dialogue that we would have: <eob> the realization that if we didn't do this, <eob> then we were part of the problem. <eob>
So we did something unheard of <eol> in the security industry. <eob> We started publishing. <eob> Over 700 terabytes of actionable <eol> threat intelligence data, <eob> including information on real-time attacks <eob> that can be used to stop <eol> cybercrime in its tracks. <eob>
And to date, <eob> over 4,000 organizations <eol> are leveraging this data, <eob> including half of the Fortune 100. <eob>
And our hope as a next step <eol> is to get all of those organizations <eob> to join us in the fight, <eob> and do the same thing <eob> and share their information <eob> on when and how <eol> they're being attacked as well. <eob>
We all have the opportunity to stop it, <eob> and we already all know how. <eob>
All we have to do is look <eol> to the response that we see <eob> in the world of health care, <eob> and how they respond to a pandemic. <eob>
Simply put, <eob> we need to be open and collaborative. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So you probably have the sense, <eol> as most people do, <eob> that polarization <eol> is getting worse in our country, <eob> that the divide <eol> between the left and the right <eob> is as bad as it's been <eol> in really any of our lifetimes. <eob>
But you might also reasonably wonder <eol> if research backs up your intuition. <eob>
And in a nutshell, <eol> the answer is sadly yes. <eob>
In study after study, we find <eob> that liberals and conservatives <eol> have grown further apart. <eob>
They increasingly wall themselves off <eol> in these ideological silos, <eob> consuming different news, <eol> talking only to like-minded others <eob> and more and more choosing <eol> to live in different parts of the country. <eob>
And I think that <eol> most alarming of all of it <eob> is seeing this rising <eol> animosity on both sides. <eob>
Liberals and conservatives, <eob> Democrats and Republicans, <eob> more and more they just <eol> don't like one another. <eob>
You see it in many different ways. <eob>
They don't want to befriend one another. <eob>
They don't want to date one another. <eob>
If they do, if they find out, <eol> they find each other less attractive, <eob> and they more and more don't want <eol> their children to marry someone <eob> who supports the other party, <eob> a particularly shocking statistic. <eob>
You know, in my lab, <eol> the students that I work with, <eob> we're talking about <eol> some sort of social pattern -- <eob> I'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like, <eob> what kind of movie are we in here <eol> with this pattern? <eob>
So what kind of movie are we in <eol> with political polarization? <eob>
Well, it could be a disaster movie. <eob>
It certainly seems like a disaster. <eob>
Could be a war movie. <eob> Also fits. <eob> But what I keep thinking is that <eol> we're in a zombie apocalypse movie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right? You know the kind. <eob>
There's people wandering around in packs, <eob> not thinking for themselves, <eob> seized by this mob mentality <eob> trying to spread their disease <eol> and destroy society. <eob>
And you probably think, as I do, <eob> that you're the good guy <eol> in the zombie apocalypse movie, <eob> and all this hate and polarization, <eol> it's being propagated by the other people, <eob> because we're Brad Pitt, right? <eob>
Free-thinking, righteous, <eob> just trying to hold on <eol> to what we hold dear, <eob> you know, not foot soldiers <eol> in the army of the undead. <eob> Not that. <eob> Never that. <eob>
But here's the thing: <eob> what movie do you suppose <eol> they think they're in? <eob> Right? <eob> Well, they absolutely think <eol> that they're the good guys <eob> in the zombie apocalypse movie. Right? <eob> And you'd better believe <eol> that they think that they're Brad Pitt <eob> and that we, we are the zombies. <eob>
And who's to say that they're wrong? <eob>
I think that the truth is <eol> that we're all a part of this. <eob>
And the good side of that <eol> is that we can be a part of the solution. <eob>
So what are we going to do? <eob>
What can we do to chip away <eol> at polarization in everyday life? <eob>
What could we do to connect with <eol> and communicate with <eob> our political counterparts? <eob>
Well, these were exactly the questions <eol> that I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg, <eob> became fascinated with a few years ago, <eob> and we started <eol> doing research on this topic. <eob>
And one of the first things <eol> that we discovered <eob> that I think is really helpful <eol> for understanding polarization <eob> is to understand <eob> that the political divide in our country <eol> is undergirded by a deeper moral divide. <eob>
So one of the most robust findings <eol> in the history of political psychology <eob> is this pattern identified <eol> by Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham, <eob> psychologists, <eob> that liberals and conservatives <eol> tend to endorse different values <eob> to different degrees. <eob>
So for example, we find that liberals <eol> tend to endorse values like equality <eob> and fairness and care and protection <eol> from harm <eob> more than conservatives do. <eob>
And conservatives tend to endorse <eol> values like loyalty, patriotism, <eob> respect for authority and moral purity <eob> more than liberals do. <eob>
And Matt and I were thinking <eol> that maybe this moral divide <eob> might be helpful <eol> for understanding how it is <eob> that liberals and conservatives <eol> talk to one another <eob> and why they so often <eol> seem to talk past one another <eob> when they do. <eob>
So we conducted a study <eob> where we recruited liberals to a study <eob> where they were supposed <eol> to write a persuasive essay <eob> that would be compelling to a conservative <eol> in support of same-sex marriage. <eob>
And what we found was that liberals <eol> tended to make arguments <eob> in terms of the liberal moral values <eol> of equality and fairness. <eob>
So they said things like, <eob> "Everyone should have the right <eol> to love whoever they choose," <eob> and, "They" -- they being gay Americans -- <eob> "deserve the same equal rights <eol> as other Americans." <eob> Overall, we found <eol> that 69 percent of liberals <eob> invoked one of the more liberal <eol> moral values in constructing their essay, <eob> and only nine percent invoked <eol> one of the more conservative moral values, <eob> even though they were supposed <eol> to be trying to persuade conservatives. <eob>
And when we studied conservatives <eol> and had them make persuasive arguments <eob> in support of making English <eol> the official language of the US, <eob> a classically conservative <eol> political position, <eob> we found that they weren't <eol> much better at this. <eob>
59 percent of them made arguments <eob> in terms of one of the more <eol> conservative moral values, <eob> and just eight percent <eol> invoked a liberal moral value, <eob> even though they were supposed <eol> to be targeting liberals for persuasion. <eob>
Now, you can see right away <eol> why we're in trouble here. <eob> Right? <eob> People's moral values, <eol> they're their most deeply held beliefs. <eob>
People are willing <eol> to fight and die for their values. <eob>
Why are they going to give <eol> that up just to agree with you <eob> on something that they don't particularly <eol> want to agree with you on anyway? <eob>
If that persuasive appeal that <eol> you're making to your Republican uncle <eob> means that he doesn't <eol> just have to change his view, <eob> he's got to change <eol> his underlying values, too, <eob> that's not going to go very far. <eob>
So what would work better? <eob>
Well, we believe it's a technique <eol> that we call moral reframing, <eob> and we've studied it <eol> in a series of experiments. <eob>
In one of these experiments, <eob> we recruited liberals <eol> and conservatives to a study <eob> where they read one of three essays <eob> before having their environmental <eol> attitudes surveyed. <eob>
And the first of these essays <eob> was a relatively conventional <eol> pro-environmental essay <eob> that invoked the liberal values <eol> of care and protection from harm. <eob>
It said things like, <eol> "In many important ways <eob> we are causing real harm <eol> to the places we live in," <eob> and, "It is essential <eol> that we take steps now <eob> to prevent further destruction <eol> from being done to our Earth." <eob> Another group of participants <eob> were assigned to read <eol> a really different essay <eob> that was designed to tap into <eol> the conservative value of moral purity. <eob>
It was a pro-environmental essay as well, <eob> and it said things like, <eob> "Keeping our forests, drinking water, <eol> and skies pure is of vital importance." <eob> "We should regard the pollution <eob> of the places we live in <eol> to be disgusting." <eob> And, "Reducing pollution <eol> can help us preserve <eob> what is pure and beautiful <eol> about the places we live." <eob> And then we had a third group <eob> that were assigned <eol> to read just a nonpolitical essay. <eob>
It was just a comparison group <eol> so we could get a baseline. <eob>
And what we found when we surveyed people <eob> about their environmental <eol> attitudes afterwards, <eob> we found that liberals, <eol> it didn't matter what essay they read. <eob> They tended to have highly <eol> pro-environmental attitudes regardless. <eob> Liberals are on board <eol> for environmental protection. <eob>
Conservatives, however, <eob> were significantly more supportive <eol> of progressive environmental policies <eob> and environmental protection <eob> if they had read the moral purity essay <eob> than if they read <eol> one of the other two essays. <eob>
We even found that conservatives <eol> who read the moral purity essay <eob> were significantly more likely to say <eol> that they believed in global warming <eob> and were concerned about global warming, <eob> even though this essay <eol> didn't even mention global warming. <eob>
That's just a related environmental issue. <eob>
But that's how robust <eol> this moral reframing effect was. <eob>
And we've studied this on a whole slew <eol> of different political issues. <eob>
So if you want to move conservatives <eob> on issues like same-sex marriage <eol> or national health insurance, <eob> it helps to tie these liberal <eol> political issues to conservative values <eob> like patriotism and moral purity. <eob>
And we studied it the other way, too. <eob>
If you want to move liberals <eol> to the right on conservative policy issues <eob> like military spending and making English <eol> the official language of the US, <eob> you're going to be more persuasive <eob> if you tie those conservative <eol> policy issues to liberal moral values <eob> like equality and fairness. <eob>
All these studies <eol> have the same clear message: <eob> if you want to persuade <eol> someone on some policy, <eob> it's helpful to connect that policy <eol> to their underlying moral values. <eob>
And when you say it like that <eob> it seems really obvious. <eob> Right? <eob> Like, why did we come here tonight? <eob> Why — <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's incredibly intuitive. <eob> And even though it is, <eol> it's something we really struggle to do. <eob>
You know, it turns out that when we go <eol> to persuade somebody on a political issue, <eob> we talk like we're speaking into a mirror. <eob>
We don't persuade so much <eol> as we rehearse our own reasons <eob> for why we believe <eol> some sort of political position. <eob>
We kept saying when we were designing <eol> these reframed moral arguments, <eob> "Empathy and respect, <eol> empathy and respect." <eob> If you can tap into that, <eob> you can connect <eob> and you might be able to persuade <eol> somebody in this country. <eob>
So thinking again <eob> about what movie we're in, <eob> maybe I got carried away before. <eob> Maybe it's not a zombie apocalypse movie. <eob> Maybe instead it's a buddy cop movie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Just roll with it, just go with it please. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You know the kind: <eol> there's a white cop and a black cop, <eob> or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop. <eob>
Whatever it is, they don't get along <eob> because of this difference. <eob>
But in the end, when they have <eol> to come together and they cooperate, <eob> the solidarity that they feel, <eob> it's greater because of that gulf <eol> that they had to cross. Right? <eob> And remember that in these movies, <eob> it's usually worst in the second act <eob> when our leads are further apart <eol> than ever before. <eob>
And so maybe that's <eol> where we are in this country, <eob> late in the second act <eol> of a buddy cop movie -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
torn apart but about <eol> to come back together. <eob>
It sounds good, <eob> but if we want it to happen, <eob> I think the responsibility <eol> is going to start with us. <eob>
So this is my call to you: <eob> let's put this country back together. <eob>
Let's do it despite the politicians <eob> and the media and Facebook and Twitter <eob> and Congressional redistricting <eob> and all of it, <eol> all the things that divide us. <eob>
Let's do it because it's right. <eob>
And let's do it <eol> because this hate and contempt <eob> that flows through all of us every day <eob> makes us ugly and it corrupts us, <eob> and it threatens <eol> the very fabric of our society. <eob>
We owe it to one another and our country <eob> to reach out and try to connect. <eob>
We can't afford to hate them any longer, <eob> and we can't afford <eol> to let them hate us either. <eob> Empathy and respect. <eob> Empathy and respect. <eob> If you think about it, it's the very least <eol> that we owe our fellow citizens. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I'm a relationship builder. <eob>
When you think of a relationship builder, <eob> don't you just automatically <eol> think "architect?" <eob> Probably not. <eob> That's because most people think <eol> architects design buildings and cities, <eob> but what we really design <eol> are relationships, <eob> because cities are about people. <eob>
They're places where people come together <eol> for all kinds of exchange. <eob>
And besides, skylines <eol> are highly specific urban habitats <eob> with their own insects, <eol> plants and animals, <eob> and even their own weather. <eob>
But today, urban habitats <eol> are out of balance. <eob>
Climate change, together with political <eol> and economic troubles, <eob> are having an impact; <eob> they're adding up <eol> and stressing out cities and us, <eob> the people who live in them. <eob>
For me, the field of ecology <eol> has provided important insight, <eob> because ecologists don't just look <eol> at individual species on their own, <eob> they look at the relationships <eol> between living things <eob> and their environment. <eob>
They look at how all the diverse parts <eol> of the ecosystem are interconnected, <eob> and it's actually this balance, <eol> this web of life, that sustains life. <eob>
My team and I have been applying <eol> insights from ecology to architecture <eob> to see how physical space <eol> can help build stronger relationships. <eob>
The projects I'm going to show you today <eob> use the idea of building relationships <eol> as the key driver for design. <eob>
Here's an example of what I mean. <eob>
Recently, we were asked to design <eol> a center for social justice leadership <eob> called the Arcus Center. <eob>
They asked us for a building <eol> that could break down traditional barriers <eob> between different groups <eob> and in doing so, create possibilities <eol> for meaningful conversations <eob> around social justice. <eob>
The students wanted a place <eol> for cultural exchange. <eob>
They thought a place for preparing <eol> food together could do that. <eob>
And they wanted to be welcoming <eol> to the outside community. <eob>
They thought a fireplace <eol> could draw people in <eob> and help start conversations. <eob>
And everybody wanted the work <eol> of social justice to be visible <eob> to the outside world. <eob>
There really wasn't a precedent <eol> for this kind of space, <eob> so we looked around the globe <eol> and found examples <eob> of community meeting houses. <eob>
Community meeting houses are places <eob> where there's very specific <eol> relationships between people, <eob> like this one in Mali, <eol> where the elders gather. <eob>
The low roof keeps everybody seated <eol> and at equal eye level. <eob>
It's very egalitarian. <eob>
I mean, you can't stand up <eol> and take over the meeting. <eob>
You'd actually bump your head. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
In meeting houses, <eol> there's always a central space <eob> where you can sit around a circle <eol> and see each other. <eob>
So we designed a space just like that <eob> right in the middle of the Arcus Center, <eob> and we anchored it <eol> with a fireplace and a kitchen. <eob>
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen <eol> and a fireplace in a building like this <eob> with the building codes, <eob> but it was so important <eol> to the concept, we got it done. <eob>
And now the central space <eol> works for big social gatherings <eob> and a place to meet one-on-one <eol> for the very first time. <eob>
It's almost like <eol> this three-way intersection <eob> that encourages bumping into people <eol> and starting a conversation. <eob>
Now you can always pass the kitchen <eol> and see something going on. <eob>
You can sit by the fireplace <eol> and share stories. <eob>
You can study together <eol> in big groups or in small ones, <eob> because the architecture <eol> sets up these opportunities. <eob>
Even the construction <eol> is about building relationships. <eob>
It's made of cordwood masonry, <eob> which is using logs <eol> the way you would use bricks. <eob>
It's super low-tech and easy to do <eol> and anyone can do it -- <eob> and that's the entire point. <eob>
The act of making is a social activity. <eob>
And it's good for the planet, too: <eob> the trees absorbed carbon <eol> when they were growing up, <eob> and they gave off oxygen, <eob> and now that carbon <eol> is trapped inside the walls <eob> and it's not being released <eol> into the atmosphere. <eob>
So making the walls is equivalent <eol> to taking cars right off the road. <eob>
We chose the building method <eob> because it connects people <eol> to each other and to the environment. <eob>
But is it working? <eob> Is it creating relationships <eol> and nurturing them? <eob>
How can we know? <eob> Well, more and more people <eol> are coming here, for one, <eob> and as a result of the fireside chats <eob> and a full calendar of programming, <eob> people are applying <eol> for the Arcus Fellowships. <eob>
In fact, applications have increased tenfold <eol> for the Arcus Fellowship <eob> since the building opened. <eob> It's working. It's bringing people together. <eob>
So I've shown how architecture <eol> can connect people <eob> on this kind of horizontal campus scale. <eob>
But we wondered if social relationships <eol> could be scaled up -- <eob> or rather, upward -- in tall buildings. <eob>
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend <eol> themselves to being social buildings. <eob>
They can seem isolating and inward. <eob>
You might only see people <eol> in those awkward elevator rides. <eob>
But in several major cities, <eol> I've been designing tall buildings <eob> that are based on creating <eol> relationships between people. <eob>
This is Aqua. <eob> It's a residential high-rise in Chicago <eob> aimed at young urban professionals <eol> and empty nesters, <eob> many of them new to the city. <eob>
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see <eol> if we could use architecture <eob> to help people get to know <eol> their neighbors, <eob> even when their homes are organized <eol> in the vertical dimension. <eob>
So we invented a way to use balconies <eol> as the new social connectors. <eob>
The shapes of the floor slabs <eol> vary slightly and they transition <eob> as you go up the tower. <eob>
The result of this <eol> is that you can actually see people <eob> from your balcony. <eob>
The balconies are misregistered. <eob>
You can lean over your balcony <eol> and say, "Hey!" <eob> just like you would across the backyard. <eob>
To make the balconies more comfortable <eob> for a longer period of time <eol> during the year, <eob> we studied the wind <eol> with digital simulations, <eob> so the effect of the balcony shapes <eol> breaks up the wind <eob> and confuses the wind <eob> and makes the balconies <eol> more comfortable and less windy. <eob>
Now, just by being able <eol> to go outside on your balcony <eob> or on the third floor roof terrace, <eob> you can be connected to the outdoors, <eob> even when you're way above <eol> the ground plane. <eob>
So the building acts to create community <eob> within the building and the city <eol> at the same time. <eob> It's working. <eob> And people are starting to meet each other <eol> on the building surface <eob> and we've heard — <eob> (Laughter) <eob> they've even starting getting together as couples. <eob>
But besides romantic relationships, <eob> the building has a positive social effect <eob> on the community, <eob> as evidenced by people <eol> starting groups together <eob> and starting big projects together, <eob> like this organic community garden <eol> on the building's roof terrace. <eob>
So I've shown how tall buildings <eol> can be social connectors, <eob> but what about public architecture? <eob>
How can we create better <eol> social cohesion in public buildings <eob> and civic spaces, <eob> and why is it important? <eob>
Public architecture <eol> is just not as successful <eob> if it comes from the top down. <eob>
About 15 years ago in Chicago, <eob> they started to replace <eol> old police stations, <eob> and they built this identical model <eol> all over the city. <eob>
And even though they had good intentions <eob> of treating all neighborhoods equally, <eob> the communities didn't feel <eol> invested in the process <eob> or feel a sense of ownership <eol> of these buildings. <eob>
It was equality in the sense that <eol> everybody gets the same police station, <eob> but it wasn't equity <eol> in the sense of responding <eob> to each community's individual needs. <eob>
And equity is the key issue here. <eob>
You know, in my field, there's a debate <eob> about whether architecture <eol> can even do anything <eob> to improve social relationships. <eob>
But I believe that we need architecture <eol> and every tool in our tool kit <eob> to improve these relationships. <eob>
In the US, policy reforms <eol> have been recommended <eob> in order to rebuild trust. <eob>
But my team and I wondered <eob> if design and a more inclusive <eol> design process <eob> could help add something positive <eol> to this policy conversation. <eob>
We asked ourselves simply: <eob> Can design help rebuild trust? <eob>
So we reached out to community members <eol> and police officers in North Lawndale; <eob> it's a neighborhood in Chicago <eob> where the police station <eol> is perceived as a scary fortress <eob> surrounded by a parking lot. <eob>
In North Lawndale, <eol> people are afraid of police <eob> and of going anywhere <eol> near the police station, <eob> even to report a crime. <eob>
So we organized this brainstorming session <eob> with both groups participating, <eob> and we came up with this whole <eol> new idea for the police station. <eob>
It's called "Polis Station." <eob> "Polis" is a Greek word that means <eol> a place with a sense of community. <eob>
It's based on the idea <eob> that if you can increase opportunities <eol> for positive social interactions <eob> between police and community members, <eob> you can rebuild that relationship <eob> and activate the neighborhood <eol> at the same time. <eob>
Instead of the police station <eol> as a scary fortress, <eob> you get highly active spaces <eol> on the public side of the station — <eob> places that spark conversation, <eob> like a barbershop, <eol> a coffee shop <eob> or sports courts as well. <eob>
Both cops and kids said they love sports. <eob>
These insights came directly <eol> from the community members <eob> and the police officers themselves, <eob> and as designers, our role <eol> was just to connect the dots <eob> and suggest the first step. <eob>
So with the help <eol> of the city and the parks, <eob> we were able to raise funds <eol> and design and build a half-court, <eob> right on the police station parking lot. <eob>
It's a start. <eob> But is it rebuilding trust? <eob>
The people in North Lawndale say <eol> the kids are using the courts every day <eob> and they even organize tournaments <eol> like this one shown here, <eob> and once in a while an officer joins in. <eob>
But now, they even have basketballs <eol> inside the station <eob> that kids can borrow. <eob>
And recently they've asked us <eol> to expand the courts <eob> and build a park on the site. <eob>
And parents report something astonishing. <eob>
Before, there was fear of going <eol> anywhere the station, and now they say <eob> there's a sense that the court is safer <eol> than other courts nearby, <eob> and they prefer their kids to play here. <eob>
So maybe in the future, <eob> on the public side of the station, <eob> you might be able to drop in <eol> for a haircut at the barbershop <eob> or reserve the community room <eol> for a birthday party <eob> or renew your driver's license <eob> or get money out of an ATM. <eob>
It can be a place for neighbors <eol> to meet each other <eob> and to get to know <eol> the officers, and vice versa. <eob>
This is not a utopian fantasy. <eob>
It's about how do you design <eol> to rebuild trust, <eob> trusting relationships? <eob>
You know, every city has parks, <eol> libraries, schools <eob> and other public buildings <eob> that have the potential <eol> to be reimagined as social connectors. <eob>
But reimagining the buildings <eol> for the future is going to require <eob> engaging the people who live there. <eob>
Engaging the public can be intimidating, <eol> and I've felt that, too. <eob>
But maybe that's because <eol> in architecture school, <eob> we don't really learn how to engage <eol> the public in the act of design. <eob>
We're taught to defend <eol> our design against criticism. <eob>
But I think that can change, too. <eob>
So if we can focus the design mind <eob> on creating positive, <eol> reinforcing relationships <eob> in architecture and through architecture, <eob> I believe we can do much more <eol> than create individual buildings. <eob>
We can reduce the stress <eol> and the polarization <eob> in our urban habitats. <eob>
We can create relationships. <eob>
We can help steady <eol> this planet we all share. <eob>
See? <eob> Architects really are <eol> relationship builders. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
How many of you are creatives, <eob> designers, engineers, <eol> entrepreneurs, artists, <eob> or maybe you just have <eol> a really big imagination? <eob>
Show of hands? (Cheers) <eob>
That's most of you. <eob>
I have some news for us creatives. <eob>
Over the course of the next 20 years, <eob> more will change around <eol> the way we do our work <eob> than has happened in the last 2,000. <eob>
In fact, I think we're at the dawn <eol> of a new age in human history. <eob>
Now, there have been four major historical <eol> eras defined by the way we work. <eob>
The Hunter-Gatherer Age <eol> lasted several million years. <eob>
And then the Agricultural Age <eol> lasted several thousand years. <eob>
The Industrial Age lasted <eol> a couple of centuries. <eob>
And now the Information Age <eol> has lasted just a few decades. <eob>
And now today, we're on the cusp <eol> of our next great era as a species. <eob>
Welcome to the Augmented Age. <eob>
In this new era, your natural human capabilities <eol> are going to be augmented <eob> by computational systems that help you think, <eob> robotic systems that help you make, <eob> and a digital nervous system <eob> that connects you to the world <eol> far beyond your natural senses. <eob>
Let's start with cognitive augmentation. <eob>
How many of you are augmented cyborgs? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I would actually argue <eol> that we're already augmented. <eob>
Imagine you're at a party, <eob> and somebody asks you a question <eol> that you don't know the answer to. <eob>
If you have one of these, <eol> in a few seconds, you can know the answer. <eob>
But this is just a primitive beginning. <eob>
Even Siri is just a passive tool. <eob>
In fact, for the last <eol> three-and-a-half million years, <eob> the tools that we've had <eol> have been completely passive. <eob>
They do exactly what we tell them <eol> and nothing more. <eob>
Our very first tool only cut <eol> where we struck it. <eob>
The chisel only carves <eol> where the artist points it. <eob>
And even our most advanced tools <eol> do nothing without our explicit direction. <eob>
In fact, to date, and this <eol> is something that frustrates me, <eob> we've always been limited <eob> by this need to manually <eol> push our wills into our tools -- <eob> like, manual, <eol> literally using our hands, <eob> even with computers. <eob>
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I want to have a conversation <eol> with a computer. <eob>
I want to say, "Computer, <eol> let's design a car," <eob> and the computer shows me a car. <eob>
And I say, "No, more fast-looking, <eol> and less German," <eob> and bang, the computer shows me an option. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
That conversation might be <eol> a little ways off, <eob> probably less than many of us think, <eob> but right now, <eob> we're working on it. <eob>
Tools are making this leap <eol> from being passive to being generative. <eob>
Generative design tools <eol> use a computer and algorithms <eob> to synthesize geometry <eob> to come up with new designs <eol> all by themselves. <eob>
All it needs are your goals <eol> and your constraints. <eob>
I'll give you an example. <eob>
In the case of this aerial drone chassis, <eob> all you would need to do <eol> is tell it something like, <eob> it has four propellers, <eob> you want it to be <eol> as lightweight as possible, <eob> and you need it to be <eol> aerodynamically efficient. <eob>
Then what the computer does <eol> is it explores the entire solution space: <eob> every single possibility that solves <eol> and meets your criteria -- <eob> millions of them. <eob>
It takes big computers to do this. <eob>
But it comes back to us with designs <eob> that we, by ourselves, <eol> never could've imagined. <eob>
And the computer's coming up <eol> with this stuff all by itself -- <eob> no one ever drew anything, <eob> and it started completely from scratch. <eob>
And by the way, it's no accident <eob> that the drone body looks just like <eol> the pelvis of a flying squirrel. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
It's because the algorithms <eol> are designed to work <eob> the same way evolution does. <eob>
What's exciting is we're starting <eol> to see this technology <eob> out in the real world. <eob>
We've been working with Airbus <eol> for a couple of years <eob> on this concept plane for the future. <eob>
It's a ways out still. <eob>
But just recently we used <eol> a generative-design AI <eob> to come up with this. <eob>
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition <eol> that's been designed by a computer. <eob>
It's stronger than the original <eol> yet half the weight, <eob> and it will be flying <eol> in the Airbus A320 later this year. <eob>
So computers can now generate; <eob> they can come up with their own solutions <eol> to our well-defined problems. <eob>
But they're not intuitive. <eob>
They still have to start from scratch <eol> every single time, <eob> and that's because they never learn. <eob> Unlike Maggie. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Maggie's actually smarter <eol> than our most advanced design tools. <eob> What do I mean by that? <eob> If her owner picks up that leash, <eob> Maggie knows with a fair <eol> degree of certainty <eob> it's time to go for a walk. <eob> And how did she learn? <eob>
Well, every time the owner picked up <eol> the leash, they went for a walk. <eob> And Maggie did three things: <eob> she had to pay attention, <eob> she had to remember what happened <eob> and she had to retain and create <eol> a pattern in her mind. <eob>
Interestingly, that's exactly what <eob> computer scientists <eol> have been trying to get AIs to do <eob> for the last 60 or so years. <eob>
Back in 1952, <eob> they built this computer <eol> that could play Tic-Tac-Toe. <eob> Big deal. <eob> Then 45 years later, in 1997, <eob> Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess. <eob>
2011, Watson beats these two <eol> humans at Jeopardy, <eob> which is much harder for a computer <eol> to play than chess is. <eob>
In fact, rather than working <eol> from predefined recipes, <eob> Watson had to use reasoning <eol> to overcome his human opponents. <eob>
And then a couple of weeks ago, <eob> DeepMind's AlphaGo beats <eol> the world's best human at Go, <eob> which is the most difficult <eol> game that we have. <eob>
In fact, in Go, there are more <eol> possible moves <eob> than there are atoms in the universe. <eob>
So in order to win, <eob> what AlphaGo had to do <eol> was develop intuition. <eob>
And in fact, at some points, <eol> AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand <eob> why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing. <eob>
And things are moving really fast. <eob>
I mean, consider -- <eol> in the space of a human lifetime, <eob> computers have gone from a child's game <eob> to what's recognized as the pinnacle <eol> of strategic thought. <eob>
What's basically happening <eob> is computers are going <eol> from being like Spock <eob> to being a lot more like Kirk. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Right? From pure logic to intuition. <eob>
Would you cross this bridge? <eob>
Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And you arrived at that decision <eol> in a split second. <eob>
You just sort of knew <eol> that bridge was unsafe. <eob>
And that's exactly the kind of intuition <eob> that our deep-learning systems <eol> are starting to develop right now. <eob>
Very soon, you'll literally be able <eob> to show something you've made, you've designed, <eob> to a computer, <eob> and it will look at it and say, <eob> "Sorry, homie, that'll never work. <eob>
You have to try again. <eob> "Or you could ask it if people <eol> are going to like your next song, <eob> or your next flavor <eol> of ice cream. <eob>
Or, much more importantly, <eob> you could work with a computer <eol> to solve a problem <eob> that we've never faced before. <eob>
For instance, climate change. <eob>
We're not doing a very <eol> good job on our own, <eob> we could certainly use <eol> all the help we can get. <eob>
That's what I'm talking about, <eob> technology amplifying <eol> our cognitive abilities <eob> so we can imagine and design things <eol> that were simply out of our reach <eob> as plain old un-augmented humans. <eob>
So what about making <eol> all of this crazy new stuff <eob> that we're going to invent and design? <eob>
I think the era of human augmentation <eol> is as much about the physical world <eob> as it is about the virtual, <eol> intellectual realm. <eob>
How will technology augment us? <eob>
In the physical world, robotic systems. <eob>
OK, there's certainly a fear <eob> that robots are going to take <eol> jobs away from humans, <eob> and that is true in certain sectors. <eob>
But I'm much more interested in this idea <eob> that humans and robots working together <eol> are going to augment each other, <eob> and start to inhabit a new space. <eob>
This is our applied research lab <eol> in San Francisco, <eob> where one of our areas of focus <eol> is advanced robotics, <eob> specifically, human-robot collaboration. <eob>
And this is Bishop, one of our robots. <eob>
As an experiment, we set it up <eob> to help a person working in construction <eol> doing repetitive tasks -- <eob> tasks like cutting out holes for outlets <eol> or light switches in drywall. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, Bishop's human partner <eol> can tell what to do in plain English <eob> and with simple gestures, <eob> kind of like talking to a dog, <eob> and then Bishop executes <eol> on those instructions <eob> with perfect precision. <eob>
We're using the human <eol> for what the human is good at: <eob> awareness, perception and decision making. <eob>
And we're using the robot <eol> for what it's good at: <eob> precision and repetitiveness. <eob>
Here's another cool project <eol> that Bishop worked on. <eob>
The goal of this project, <eol> which we called the HIVE, <eob> was to prototype the experience <eol> of humans, computers and robots <eob> all working together to solve <eol> a highly complex design problem. <eob>
The humans acted as labor. <eob> They cruised around the construction site, <eol> they manipulated the bamboo -- <eob> which, by the way, <eol> because it's a non-isomorphic material, <eob> is super hard for robots to deal with. <eob>
But then the robots <eol> did this fiber winding, <eob> which was almost impossible <eol> for a human to do. <eob>
And then we had an AI <eol> that was controlling everything. <eob>
It was telling the humans what to do, <eol> telling the robots what to do <eob> and keeping track of thousands <eol> of individual components. <eob>
What's interesting is, <eob> building this pavilion <eol> was simply not possible <eob> without human, robot and AI <eol> augmenting each other. <eob>
OK, I'll share one more project. <eob>
This one's a little bit crazy. <eob>
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist <eol> Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D <eob> to generatively design <eol> and robotically print <eob> the world's first autonomously <eol> manufactured bridge. <eob>
So, Joris and an AI are designing <eol> this thing right now, as we speak, <eob> in Amsterdam. <eob>
And when they're done, <eol> we're going to hit "Go," <eob> and robots will start 3D printing <eol> in stainless steel, <eob> and then they're going to keep printing, <eol> without human intervention, <eob> until the bridge is finished. <eob>
So, as computers are going <eol> to augment our ability <eob> to imagine and design new stuff, <eob> robotic systems are going to help us <eol> build and make things <eob> that we've never been able to make before. <eob>
But what about our ability <eol> to sense and control these things? <eob>
What about a nervous system <eol> for the things that we make? <eob>
Our nervous system, <eol> the human nervous system, <eob> tells us everything <eol> that's going on around us. <eob>
But the nervous system of the things <eol> we make is rudimentary at best. <eob>
For instance, a car doesn't tell <eol> the city's public works department <eob> that it just hit a pothole at the corner <eol> of Broadway and Morrison. <eob>
A building doesn't tell its designers <eob> whether or not the people inside <eol> like being there, <eob> and the toy manufacturer doesn't know <eob> if a toy is actually being played with -- <eob> how and where and whether <eol> or not it's any fun. <eob>
Look, I'm sure that the designers <eol> imagined this lifestyle for Barbie <eob> when they designed her. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But what if it turns out that Barbie's <eol> actually really lonely? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
If the designers had known <eob> what was really happening <eol> in the real world <eob> with their designs -- the road, <eol> the building, Barbie -- <eob> they could've used that knowledge <eol> to create an experience <eob> that was better for the user. <eob>
What's missing is a nervous system <eob> connecting us to all of the things <eol> that we design, make and use. <eob>
What if all of you had that kind <eol> of information flowing to you <eob> from the things you create <eol> in the real world? <eob>
With all of the stuff we make, <eob> we spend a tremendous amount <eol> of money and energy -- <eob> in fact, last year, <eol> about two trillion dollars -- <eob> convincing people to buy <eol> the things we've made. <eob>
But if you had this connection <eol> to the things that you design and create <eob> after they're <eob> out in the real world, <eob> after they've been sold <eol> or launched or whatever, <eob> we could actually change that, <eob> and go from making people want our stuff, <eob> to just making stuff that people want <eol> in the first place. <eob>
The good news is, we're working <eol> on digital nervous systems <eob> that connect us to the things we design. <eob>
We're working on one project <eob> with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles <eol> called the Bandito Brothers <eob> and their team. <eob>
And one of the things these guys do <eol> is build insane cars <eob> that do absolutely insane things. <eob> These guys are crazy -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
in the best way. <eob> And what we're doing with them <eob> is taking a traditional race-car chassis <eob> and giving it a nervous system. <eob>
So we instrumented it <eol> with dozens of sensors, <eob> put a world-class driver behind the wheel, <eob> took it out to the desert <eol> and drove the hell out of it for a week. <eob>
And the car's nervous system <eol> captured everything <eob> that was happening to the car. <eob>
We captured four billion data points; <eob> all of the forces <eol> that it was subjected to. <eob>
And then we did something crazy. <eob>
We took all of that data, <eob> and plugged it into a generative-design AI <eol> we call "Dreamcatcher." <eob> So what do get when you give <eol> a design tool a nervous system, <eob> and you ask it to build you <eol> the ultimate car chassis? <eob> You get this. <eob> This is something that a human <eol> could never have designed. <eob>
Except a human did design this, <eob> but it was a human that was augmented <eol> by a generative-design AI, <eob> a digital nervous system <eob> and robots that can actually <eol> fabricate something like this. <eob>
So if this is the future, <eol> the Augmented Age, <eob> and we're going to be augmented <eol> cognitively, physically and perceptually, <eob> what will that look like? <eob>
What is this wonderland going to be like? <eob>
I think we're going to see a world <eob> where we're moving <eol> from things that are fabricated <eob> to things that are farmed. <eob>
Where we're moving from things <eol> that are constructed <eob> to that which is grown. <eob>
We're going to move from being isolated <eob> to being connected. <eob>
And we'll move away from extraction <eob> to embrace aggregation. <eob>
I also think we'll shift <eol> from craving obedience from our things <eob> to valuing autonomy. <eob>
Thanks to our augmented capabilities, <eob> our world is going to change dramatically. <eob>
We're going to have a world <eol> with more variety, more connectedness, <eob> more dynamism, more complexity, <eob> more adaptability and, of course, <eob> more beauty. <eob>
The shape of things to come <eob> will be unlike anything <eol> we've ever seen before. <eob> Why? <eob> Because what will be shaping those things <eol> is this new partnership <eob> between technology, nature and humanity. <eob>
That, to me, is a future <eol> well worth looking forward to. <eob>
Thank you all so much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Every summer, my family and I <eol> travel across the world, <eob> 3,000 miles away <eob> to the culturally diverse <eol> country of India. <eob>
Now, India is a country infamous <eol> for its scorching heat and humidity. <eob>
For me, the only relief from this heat <eol> is to drink plenty of water. <eob>
Now, while in India, <eob> my parents always remind me <eol> to only drink boiled or bottled water, <eob> because unlike here in America, <eob> where I can just turn on a tap <eol> and easily get clean, potable water, <eob> in India, the water is often contaminated. <eob>
So my parents have to make sure <eob> that the water we drink is safe. <eob>
However, I soon realized <eob> that not everyone is fortunate enough <eob> to enjoy the clean water we did. <eob>
Outside my grandparents' house <eol> in the busy streets of India, <eob> I saw people standing in long lines <eob> under the hot sun <eob> filling buckets with water from a tap. <eob>
I even saw children, <eob> who looked the same age as me, <eob> filling up these clear plastic bottles <eob> with dirty water <eol> from streams on the roadside. <eob>
Watching these kids <eob> forced to drink water <eob> that I felt was too dirty to touch <eob> changed my perspective on the world. <eob>
This unacceptable social injustice <eob> compelled me to want to find a solution <eob> to our world's clean water problem. <eob>
I wanted to know <eol> why these kids lacked water, <eob> a substance that is essential for life. <eob>
And I learned that we are facing <eob> a global water crisis. <eob>
Now, this may seem surprising, <eob> as 75 percent of our planet <eol> is covered in water, <eob> but only 2.5 percent <eol> of that is freshwater, <eob> and less than one percent <eol> of Earth's freshwater supply <eob> is available for human consumption. <eob>
With rising populations, <eob> industrial development <eol> and economic growth, <eob> our demand for clean water is increasing, <eob> yet our freshwater resources <eol> are rapidly depleting. <eob>
According to the <eol> World Health Organization, <eob> 660 million people in our world <eob> lack access to a clean water source. <eob>
Lack of access to clean water <eol> is a leading cause of death <eob> in children under the age of five <eol> in developing countries, <eob> and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children <eob> die every day from <eol> a water-related disease. <eob>
So after returning home <eol> one summer in eighth grade, <eob> I decided that I wanted <eol> to combine my passion <eob> for solving the global water crisis <eob> with my interest in science. <eob>
So I decided that the best thing to do <eob> would be to convert my garage <eol> into a laboratory. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Actually, at first I converted <eol> my kitchen into a laboratory, <eob> but my parents didn't really approve <eol> and kicked me out. <eob>
I also read a lot of journal papers <eol> on water-related research, <eob> and I learned that currently <eol> in developing countries, <eob> something called solar disinfection, <eob> or SODIS, is used to purify water. <eob>
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles <eol> are filled with contaminated water <eob> and then exposed to sunlight <eol> for six to eight hours. <eob>
The UV radiation from the sun <eob> destroys the DNA <eol> of these harmful pathogens <eob> and decontaminates the water. <eob>
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use <eol> and energy-efficient, <eob> as it only uses solar energy, <eob> it's really slow, <eob> as it can take up to two days <eol> when it's cloudy. <eob>
So in order to make <eol> the SODIS process faster, <eob> this new method called photocatalysis <eob> has recently been used. <eob>
So what exactly is this photocatalysis? <eob>
Let's break it down: <eob> "photo" means from the sun, <eob> and a catalyst is something <eol> that speeds up a reaction. <eob>
So what photocatalysis is doing <eob> is it's just speeding up <eol> this solar disinfection process. <eob>
When sunlight comes in <eol> and strikes a photocatalyst, <eob> like TiO2, or titanium dioxide, <eob> it creates these <eol> really reactive oxygen species, <eob> like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide <eol> and hydroxyl radicals. <eob>
These reactive oxygen species <eob> are able to remove bacteria and organics <eob> and a whole lot of contaminants <eol> from drinking water. <eob>
But unfortunately, <eol> there are several disadvantages <eob> to the way photocatalytic SODIS <eol> is currently deployed. <eob>
See, what they do is they take <eol> the clear plastic bottles <eob> and they coat the inside <eol> with this photocatalytic coating. <eob>
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide <eob> are actually commonly used in sunscreens <eob> to block UV radiation. <eob>
So when they're coated <eol> on the inside of these bottles, <eob> they're actually blocking <eol> some of the UV radiation <eob> and diminishing the efficiency <eol> of the process. <eob>
Also, these photocatalytic coatings <eob> are not tightly bound <eol> to the plastic bottle, <eob> which means they wash off, <eol> and people end up drinking the catalyst. <eob>
While TiO2 is safe and inert, <eob> it's really inefficient <eol> if you keep drinking the catalyst, <eob> because then you have <eol> to continue to replenish it, <eob> even after a few uses. <eob>
So my goal was <eol> to overcome the disadvantages <eob> of these current treatment methods <eob> and create a safe, sustainable, <eob> cost-effective and eco-friendly <eol> method of purifying water. <eob>
What started off as an eighth grade <eol> science fair project <eob> is now my photocatalytic composite <eol> for water purification. <eob>
The composite combines <eol> titanium dioxide with cement. <eob>
The cement-like composite can be formed <eol> into several different shapes, <eob> which results in an extremely <eol> versatile range of deployment methods. <eob>
For example, you could create a rod <eob> that can easily be placed <eol> inside water bottles for individual use <eob> or you could create a porous filter <eol> that can filter water for families. <eob>
You can even coat the inside <eol> of an existing water tank <eob> to purify larger amounts of water <eob> for communities <eol> over a longer period of time. <eob>
Now, over the course of this, <eob> my journey hasn't really been easy. <eob>
You know, I didn't have access <eol> to a sophisticated laboratory. <eob>
I was 14 years old when I started, <eob> but I didn't let my age deter me <eob> in my interest <eol> in pursuing scientific research <eob> and wanting to solve <eol> the global water crisis. <eob>
See, water isn't <eol> just the universal solvent. <eob>
Water is a universal human right. <eob>
And for that reason, <eob> I'm continuing to work <eol> on this science fair project from 2012 <eob> to bring it from the laboratory <eol> into the real world. <eob>
And this summer, <eol> I founded Catalyst for World Water, <eob> a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing <eol> solutions to the global water crisis. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Alone, a single drop of water <eol> can't do much, <eob> but when many drops come together, <eob> they can sustain life on our planet. <eob>
Just as water drops <eol> come together to form oceans, <eob> I believe that we all must come together <eob> when tackling this global problem. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
As an archaeologist, <eob> I'm most often asked <eol> what my favorite discovery is. <eob>
The answer's easy: <eob> my husband, Greg. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
We met in Egypt on my first dig. <eob>
It was my first lesson in finding <eol> unexpected, wonderful things. <eob>
This began an incredible <eol> archaeological partnership. <eob>
Years later, I proposed to him <eol> in front of our favorite pair statue <eob> of the Prince and Princess <eol> Rahotep and Nofret, <eob> in the Cairo Museum, <eob> dating to 4,600 years ago. <eob>
I thought if I was going to ask Greg <eol> to spend the rest of this life with me, <eob> then I should ask him <eol> in front of two people <eob> who had pledged <eol> to be together for eternity. <eob>
These symbols endure <eol> because when we look at them, <eob> we're looking at mirrors. <eob>
They are powerful reminders <eob> that our common humanity has not changed. <eob>
The thrill of archaeological discovery <eol> is as powerful as love, <eob> because ancient history is the most <eol> seductive mistress imaginable. <eob>
Many archaeologists <eol> have devoted their lives <eob> to unraveling the mysteries of the past <eob> under hot suns <eob> and Arctic winds <eob> and in dense rainforests. <eob> Many seek. <eob> Some discover. <eob> All worship at the temple of possibility <eob> that one discovery might change history. <eob>
On my first day in Egypt, <eol> I worked at a site <eob> in the Northeast Egyptian Delta <eol> called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago, <eob> in a cemetery. <eob>
That's a picture of me -- <eob> I'm just in my bliss. <eob>
On the dig, surrounded <eol> by emerald green rice paddies, <eob> I discovered an intact pot. <eob>
Flipping it over, <eob> I discovered a human thumbprint <eol> left by whoever made the vessel. <eob>
For a moment, time stood still. <eob>
I didn't know where I was. <eob>
It was because at that moment I realized, <eob> when we dig, <eob> we're digging for people, <eob> not things. <eob>
Never are we so present as when <eol> we are in the midst of the great past. <eob>
I can't tell you how many times I've stood <eol> in front of the Pyramids of Giza, <eob> and they leave me speechless. <eob>
I feel like the luckiest <eol> person in the world. <eob>
They're a monument to our human brilliance <eol> and everything that is possible. <eob>
Many cannot process <eol> their brilliance as human -- <eob> they think aliens built them. <eob>
But this is ridiculous. <eob>
All you need to do <eol> is get up close and personal, <eob> and see the hidden hand of man <eob> in the chisel marks left <eol> by the tools that built them. <eob>
The Great Pyramid of Giza <eol> was built one stone at a time <eob> with 2.3 million blocks, <eob> with incredible bureaucratic efficiency. <eob>
It is not the pyramids <eol> that stand the test of time; <eob> it is human ingenuity. <eob>
That is our shared human brilliance. <eob>
History may be cyclical, <eob> but we are singular. <eob>
I love what I do, <eob> because I learn that we haven't changed. <eob>
I get to read about mother-in-law <eol> jokes from Mesopotamia <eob> from 3,500 years ago. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I get to hear about neighbors <eol> cursing each other <eob> from 4,600 years ago in Egypt. <eob>
And my absolute favorite, <eol> from 3,300 years ago in Luxor: <eob> an inscription that describes schoolboys <eol> who cut class to go drinking. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Kids these days. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
I get to see the most <eol> incredible architecture, <eob> see stunning sculptures -- <eob> I mean, this is basically <eol> a selfie in stone -- <eob> and see that we've always <eol> rocked serious bling. <eob>
And also, we've been posting on walls <eob> and obsessing about cats -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
for thousands of years. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Archaeologists are the cultural <eol> memory preservers <eob> and the spokespeople <eob> for the billions of people <eol> and the thousands of cultures <eob> that came before us. <eob>
Good science, imagination <eol> and a leap of faith <eob> are the trifecta we use to raise the dead. <eob>
In the last year, <eob> archaeologists have made <eol> incredible discoveries, including: <eob> new human ancestors from South Africa; <eob> tools from 3.3 million years ago -- <eob> these are the oldest tools <eol> ever discovered -- <eob> in Kenya. <eob>
And this, from a series <eol> of medical implements found <eob> from Blackbeard's ship from 1718. <eob>
What you're looking at is a medical tool <eol> used to treat syphilis. <eob> Ouch! <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
For each of these, <eob> there are thousands of other <eol> incredibly important discoveries <eob> made by my colleagues, <eob> that do not make headlines. <eob>
However, I believe that the most <eol> important thing we do as archaeologists <eob> is acknowledge that past people existed <eob> and lived lives worth learning about. <eob>
Can you even imagine <eol> what the world would be like today <eob> if we acknowledged all <eol> human beings in this way? <eob>
So, on a dig, we have a challenge: <eob> it often looks like this. <eob>
You can't see anything. <eob>
Where are we going to start digging? <eob>
This is from a site south of Cairo. <eob>
Let's have a look from space. <eob>
Again, you can't really see much. <eob>
What you're looking at <eol> is a WorldView-3 satellite image, <eob> which has a .3 meter resolution. <eob> That's 10 inches. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
This means I use satellite <eol> images and process them using algorithms, <eob> and look at subtle differences <eol> in the light spectrum <eob> that indicate buried things <eol> under the ground <eob> that I get to go excavate and survey. <eob>
By the way -- <eob> NASA has a Space Archaeology program, <eob> so it's a real job. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So, let's have a look again. <eob>
We're back at the site <eol> just south of Cairo. <eob>
You can't see anything. <eob>
Keep your eye on the red rectangle. <eob>
When we process the image <eol> using algorithms -- <eob> think like a space-based CAT scan -- <eob> this is what you see. <eob>
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb <eob> that is previously unknown <eol> and unexcavated, <eob> and you all are the first people <eol> to see it in thousands of years. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
I believe we have barely <eol> scratched the surface <eob> in terms of what's left to discover. <eob>
In the Egyptian Delta alone, <eob> we've excavated less <eol> than one-1000th of one percent <eob> of the total volume of Egyptian sites. <eob>
When you add to that <eol> the thousands of other sites <eob> my team and I have discovered, <eob> what we thought we knew <eol> pales in comparison <eob> to what we have left to discover. <eob>
When you look at the incredible work <eob> that my colleagues are doing <eol> all around the world <eob> and what they're finding, <eob> I believe that there are millions <eol> of undiscovered archaeological sites <eob> left to find. <eob>
Discovering them will do nothing less <eob> than unlock the full potential <eol> of our existence. <eob>
But we have a challenge. <eob>
Over the last year, <eob> we've seen horrible headlines <eob> of incredible destruction <eol> going on to archaeological sites, <eob> and massive looting by people like ISIL. <eob>
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra. <eob>
Who blows up a temple? <eob>
They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah. <eob>
And we've seen looting <eol> at sites so rampant, <eob> it looks like craters of the moon. <eob>
Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy <eol> modern human lives, <eob> it's a natural extension for them <eol> to destroy cultural identity as well. <eob>
Countless invading armies <eol> have done the same throughout history. <eob>
We know that ISIL is profiting <eol> from the looting of sites, <eob> but we don't know the scale. <eob>
This means that any object <eol> purchased on the market today <eob> from the Middle East <eob> could potentially be funding terrorism. <eob>
When a site is looted, <eob> it's as if a puzzle already missing <eol> 90 percent of it pieces <eob> has had the rest obscured <eol> beyond recognition. <eob>
This is ancient identity theft writ large. <eob>
We know that there are two kinds <eol> of looting going on: <eob> looting by criminal elements like ISIL, <eob> and then more local looting <eol> by those that are desperate for money. <eob>
We would all do the same <eol> to feed our families; <eob> I don't blame the local looters. <eob>
I blame the middlemen, <eol> the unethical traffickers <eob> and an international art market <eob> that exploits often ambiguous <eol> or even completely nonexistent laws. <eob>
We know looting is going on <eol> on a global scale and it's increasing, <eob> but presently we don't have <eol> any tools to stop it. <eob>
This is beginning to change. <eob>
My team and I have just completed a study <eol> looking at looting in Egypt. <eob>
We looked at open-source data <eob> and mapped the entirety <eol> of looting across Egypt <eob> from 2002 to 2013. <eob>
We found evidence of looting <eol> and site destruction at 267 sites, <eob> and mapped over 200,000 looting pits. <eob> It's astonishing. <eob> And putting that data together -- <eob> you can see the looting pits marked here. <eob>
At one site, the looting got bad <eol> from 2009, 2011, 2012 -- <eob> hundreds and hundreds of pits. <eob>
Putting all the data together, <eob> what we found is that, <eol> contrary to popular opinion, <eob> looting did not start to get worse <eol> in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring, <eob> but in 2009, after the global recession. <eob>
Thus, we've shown with big data <eob> that looting is fundamentally <eol> an economic issue. <eob>
If we do nothing to stop the problem, <eob> all of Egypt's sites will be affected <eol> by looting by 2040. <eob>
Thus, we are at a tipping point. <eob>
We are the generation with all the tools <eol> and all the technologies <eob> to stop looting, <eob> but we're not working fast enough. <eob>
Sometimes an archaeological site <eol> can surprise you with its resilience. <eob>
I am just back from the field, <eob> where I co-led a joint mission <eol> with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities <eob> at a site called Lisht. <eob>
This site dates to the Middle Kingdom <eol> of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC. <eob>
The Middle Kingdom was Ancient <eol> Egypt's Renaissance period. <eob>
After a time of intense internal strife <eol> and environmental challenges, <eob> Egypt rebounded <eob> with an incredible resurgence <eol> of art, architecture and literature. <eob>
It's a favorite period of time <eol> to study in Egypt, <eob> because it teaches us so much <eol> about how we can survive and thrive <eob> after great disasters. <eob>
Now at this site, we had already mapped <eol> countless looting pits. <eob>
Lisht is a royal site; <eob> there would have been thousands <eol> of people buried there <eob> who lived and worked <eol> at the court of Pharaoh. <eob>
You can see this before and after; <eol> you see dozens of looting pits. <eob> North Lisht. <eob> This is in South Lisht, before and after. <eob>
When we first visited the site, <eob> we could see the tombs <eol> of many high-ranking officials <eob> that had been looted. <eob>
Let me put into perspective <eol> for you what was taken. <eob>
Imagine a two meter by two meter area <eol> full of coffins, jewelry <eob> and incredible statuary. <eob>
Multiply that times over a thousand. <eob>
That's what was taken. <eob>
So, when we started work, <eob> my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef, <eol> approached me and said, <eob> "We must work at this one particular tomb. <eob>
It's been attacked by looters. <eob>
If we don't do anything, they'll be back." <eob> Of course I agreed, <eol> but I didn't think we'd find anything. <eob>
I thought the looters <eol> had stolen everything. <eob>
What we started to find <eol> were the most incredible reliefs. <eob>
Look at this painting -- <eol> it's just stunning. <eob>
We started finding engraved inscriptions. <eob>
And even the titles of the tomb owner -- <eob> he had titles like, <eol> "Overseer of the Army," <eob> "Overseer of the Treasury." <eob> I began to have hope. <eob>
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name. <eob>
For the ancient Egyptians, having <eol> their name last for eternity <eob> was their goal. <eob>
And then one day, <eob> this appeared. <eob>
This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef. <eob>
You can see it written out <eol> here, in hieroglyphs. <eob>
Working together with my Egyptian team, <eob> we had restored someone's name <eol> from 3,900 years ago. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Working together <eol> with my Egyptian colleagues, <eob> we celebrated this moment <eol> of shared discovery. <eob>
What we were doing together <eol> was right and true. <eob>
We found this incredible <eol> false door, mostly intact. <eob>
On it we read about Intef <eol> and his inscriptions. <eob>
You can actually even see him seated here. <eob>
What I realized is that everything <eol> I had assumed about looted sites <eob> had been proven wrong. <eob>
Every day on site we worked <eol> together with 70 Egyptians <eob> as colleagues and friends. <eob>
In the face of so much <eol> hatred and ignorance <eob> against those in the Middle East, <eob> every moment on site felt like <eol> a protest for peace. <eob>
When you work with those <eol> that don't look like you, <eob> or think like you, or speak like you, <eob> your shared mission <eol> of archaeological discovery <eob> erases all superficial differences. <eob>
What I learned this season <eob> is that archaeology <eol> isn't about what you find. <eob> It's about what you can prove possible. <eob>
Sometimes when you travel, <eol> you end up finding long-lost family -- <eob> not those with whom you share genes, <eob> but a shared entry in the book of life. <eob>
This is Omer Farrouk, my brother. <eob>
Omer's a Gufti from a village <eol> just North of Luxor, called Guft. <eob>
Guftis are part of a celebrated <eol> tradition in Egyptology. <eob>
They help with digging <eol> and work crew organization. <eob>
Omer is my COO and CFO. <eob>
I simply couldn't do work without him. <eob>
One day many years ago, <eol> when I was a young graduate student <eob> and Omer was a young Gufti <eol> who couldn't speak much English, <eob> we learned, completely randomly, <eob> that we were born in the same year, <eob> the same month <eob> and the same day, six hours apart. <eob> Twins. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
Separated by an ocean, <eol> but forever connected <eob> for Ancient Egypt is our mother. <eob>
I knew then we'd always work together -- <eob> not in my brain, <eob> but in the part of your soul that knows <eol> not everything can be explained. <eob>
(Arabic) Omer by brother, <eob> I will always love you. <eob>
(English) Omer my brother, <eob> I will always love you. <eob>
So, just before my first dig in Egypt, <eob> my mentor, the very famous <eol> Egyptologist Professor William Kelly Simpson, <eob> called me into his office. <eob>
He handed me a check for $2,000, <eob> and said, "This is to cover your expenses. <eob>
Have a glorious adventure this summer. <eob>
Someday you will do this <eol> for someone else." <eob> Thus, my TED Prize wish <eol> is partial payback, plus interest -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
for a great human being's <eol> generosity and kindness. <eob>
So, my wish. <eob> I wish for us to discover <eob> the millions of unknown <eol> archaeological sites <eob> around the world. <eob>
By creating a 21st-century army <eol> of global explorers, <eob> we'll find and protect <eol> the world's hidden heritage, <eob> which contains clues <eol> to humankind's collective resilience <eob> and creativity. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So how are we going to do this? <eob> We are going to build <eol> with the TED Prize money <eob> an online, crowdsource, <eol> citizen science platform <eob> to allow anyone in the world <eol> to engage with discovering <eob> archaeological sites. <eob>
There are only a couple hundred <eol> of us space archaeologists <eob> around the world. <eob>
It is my dream to engage the world <eob> with helping to find sites <eol> and protect them. <eob>
What you'll do is sign in, <eol> create a username -- <eob> note that this particular username <eol> is already taken. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
You'll take a tutorial <eol> and you'll start work. <eob>
I want to note at the outset <eob> that in no way will be sharing <eol> GPS data or mapping data for sites. <eob>
We want to treat them <eol> like human patient data, <eob> and not reveal their locations. <eob>
You'll then be dealt a card from a deck -- <eol> 20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters, <eob> and you'll be looking for features. <eob>
My team and I will have batch-processed <eob> large amounts of satellite data <eol> using algorithms <eob> in order for you to find things, <eob> so you'll be doing really good science. <eob> You'll then be starting to look. <eob>
Do you see a pyramid? <eob> Do you see any potential site <eol> damage or site looting? <eob>
You'll then begin to mark what's there. <eob> And off to the side are always <eol> going to be rich examples <eob> of exactly what you're seeing, <eol> to help guide you. <eob>
All the data that you help us collect <eol> will be shared with vetted authorities, <eob> and will help create <eol> a new global alarm system <eob> to help protect sites. <eob>
But it's not just going to stop there. <eob>
All the archaeologists with whom <eol> we share your discoveries <eob> will take you with them <eol> as they begin to excavate them, <eob> by using Periscope, Google Plus <eol> and social media. <eob>
A hundred years ago, <eol> archaeology was for the rich. <eob>
Fifty years ago, <eob> it was for men. <eob>
Now it's primarily for academics. <eob>
Our goal is to democratize the process <eol> of archaeological discovery, <eob> and allow anyone to participate. <eob>
Ninety-four years ago, <eob> Howard Carter discovered <eol> the tomb of King Tut. <eob>
Who is the next Howard Carter? <eob> It might be you. <eob>
that came before us. <eob> By creating this platform, <eob> we will find the millions of places <eol> occupied by the billions of people <eob>
If we want to answer the big questions <eol> about who we are <eob> and where we've come from, <eob> the answers to those questions <eol> do not lie in pyramids or palaces, <eob> but in the cities and villages of those <eob> that came before us. <eob>
If we want to learn about the past, <eob> it's time we inverted the pyramids. <eob>
Acknowledging that the past <eol> is worth saving <eob> means so much more. <eob>
It means that we're worth saving, too. <eob>
And the greatest story ever told <eob> is the story of our shared human journey. <eob>
But the only way we're going <eol> to be able to write it <eob> is if we do it together. <eob> Come with me. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Back in 2003, <eob> the UK government carried out a survey. <eob>
And it was a survey that measured <eol> levels of numeracy <eob> in the population. <eob>
And they were shocked to find out <eob> that for every 100 working age <eol> adults in the country, <eob> 47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills. <eob>
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills -- <eol> that's low-end GCSE score. <eob>
It's the ability to deal with fractions, <eol> percentages and decimals. <eob>
So this figure prompted <eol> a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall. <eob>
Policies were changed, <eob> investments were made, <eob> and then they ran <eol> the survey again in 2011. <eob>
So can you guess <eol> what happened to this number? <eob> It went up to 49. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> But I preferred, actually, <eol> the reaction of a schoolchild <eob> when I presented <eol> at a school this information, <eob> who raised their hand and said, <eob> "How do we know that the person <eol> who made that number <eob> isn't one of the 49 percent either?" <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So clearly, there's a numeracy issue, <eob> because these are important skills for life, <eob> and a lot of the changes <eol> that we want to introduce in this century <eob> involve us becoming <eol> more comfortable with numbers. <eob>
Now, it's not just an English problem. <eob>
OECD this year released some figures <eol> looking at numeracy in young people, <eob> and leading the way, the USA -- <eob> nearly 40 percent of young people <eol> in the US have low numeracy. <eob>
Now, England is there too, <eob> but there are seven OECD countries <eol> with figures above 20 percent. <eob>
That is a problem, <eol> because it doesn't have to be that way. <eob>
If you look at the far end of this graph, <eob> you can see the Netherlands and Korea <eol> are in single figures. <eob>
So there's definitely a numeracy <eol> problem that we want to address. <eob>
Now, as useful as studies like these are, <eob> I think we risk herding people <eol> inadvertently into one of two categories; <eob> that there are two kinds of people: <eob> those people that are comfortable <eol> with numbers, that can do numbers, <eob> and the people who can't. <eob>
And what I'm trying <eol> to talk about here today <eob> is to say that I believe <eol> that is a false dichotomy. <eob>
It's not an immutable pairing. <eob>
I think you don't have to have <eol> tremendously high levels of numeracy <eob> to be inspired by numbers, <eob> and that should be the starting point <eol> to the journey ahead. <eob>
And one of the ways in which <eol> we can begin that journey, for me, <eob> is looking at statistics. <eob> Now, I am the first to acknowledge <eol> that statistics has got somewhat <eob> of an image problem. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> It's the part of mathematics <eob> that even mathematicians <eol> don't particularly like, <eob> because whereas the rest of maths <eol> is all about precision and certainty, <eob> statistics is almost the reverse of that. <eob>
But actually, I was a late convert <eol> to the world of statistics myself. <eob>
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors <eob> what two subjects would I be least likely <eol> to excel in after university, <eob> they'd have told you statistics <eol> and computer programming, <eob> and yet here I am, about to show you <eol> some statistical graphics <eob> that I programmed. <eob>
So what inspired that change in me? <eob>
What made me think that statistics <eol> was actually an interesting thing? <eob>
It's really because <eol> statistics are about us. <eob>
If you look at the etymology <eol> of the word statistics, <eob> it's the science of dealing with data <eob> about the state or the community <eol> that we live in. <eob>
So statistics are about us as a group, <eob> not us as individuals. <eob>
And I think as social animals, <eob> we share this fascination about how <eol> we as individuals relate to our groups, <eob> to our peers. <eob>
And statistics in this way <eol> are at their most powerful <eob> when they surprise us. <eob> And there's been some really wonderful <eol> surveys carried out recently <eob> by Ipsos MORI in the last few years. <eob>
They did a survey of over <eol> 1,000 adults in the UK, <eob> and said, for every 100 people <eol> in England and Wales, <eob> how many of them are Muslim? <eob> Now the average answer from this survey, <eob> which was supposed to be representative <eol> of the total population, was 24. <eob>
That's what people thought. <eob>
British people think 24 out of every 100 <eol> people in the country are Muslim. <eob>
Now, official figures reveal <eol> that figure to be about five. <eob>
So there's this big variation <eol> between what we think, our perception, <eob> and the reality as given by statistics. <eob>
And I think that's interesting. <eob>
What could possibly be causing <eol> that misperception? <eob>
And I was so thrilled with this study, <eob> I started to take questions <eol> out in presentations. <eob>
I was referring to it. <eob> Now, I did a presentation <eob> at St. Paul's School for Girls in Hammersmith, <eob> and I had an audience <eol> rather like this, <eob> except it was comprised entirely <eol> of sixth-form girls. <eob>
And I said, "Girls, <eob> how many teenage girls do you think <eol> the British public think <eob> get pregnant every year?" <eob> And the girls were apoplectic when I said <eob> the British public think that 15 <eol> out of every 100 teenage girls <eob> get pregnant in the year. <eob>
And they had every right to be angry, <eob> because in fact, I'd have to have <eol> closer to 200 dots <eob> before I could color one in, <eob> in terms of what <eol> the official figures tell us. <eob>
And rather like numeracy, <eol> this is not just an English problem. <eob>
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey <eol> in recent years to go across the world. <eob>
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians, <eob> for every 100 adults in your country, <eob> how many of them are overweight or obese? <eob> And the average answer from the Saudis <eol> was just over a quarter. <eob>
That's what they thought. <eob> Just over a quarter of adults <eol> are overweight or obese. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> The official figures show, actually, <eol> it's nearer to three-quarters. <eob> So again, a big variation. <eob>
And I love this one: they asked in Japan, <eol> they asked the Japanese, <eob> for every 100 Japanese people, <eob> how many of them live in rural areas? <eob> The average was about a 50-50 split, <eol> just over halfway. <eob>
They thought 56 out of every 100 <eol> Japanese people lived in rural areas. <eob>
The official figure is seven. <eob>
So extraordinary variations, <eol> and surprising to some, <eob> but not surprising to people <eol> who have read the work <eob> of Daniel Kahneman, for example, <eol> the Nobel-winning economist. <eob>
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky, <eol> spent years researching this disjoint <eob> between what people perceive <eol> and the reality, <eob> the fact that people are actually <eol> pretty poor intuitive statisticians. <eob>
And there are many reasons for this. <eob>
Individual experiences, certainly, <eol> can influence our perceptions, <eob> but so, too, can things like the media <eol> reporting things by exception, <eob> rather than what's normal. <eob>
Kahneman had a nice way <eol> of referring to that. <eob> He said, "We can be blind <eol> to the obvious" -- <eob> so we've got the numbers wrong -- <eob> "but we can be blind <eol> to our blindness about it." <eob> And that has enormous <eol> repercussions for decision making. <eob>
So at the statistics office <eol> while this was all going on, <eob> I thought this was really interesting. <eob>
I said, this is clearly a global problem, <eob> but maybe geography is the issue here. <eob>
These were questions that were all about, <eol> how well do you know your country? <eob>
So in this case, it's how well <eol> do you know 64 million people? <eob>
Not very well, it turns out. <eob>
I can't do that. <eob>
So I had an idea, <eob> which was to think about <eol> this same sort of approach <eob> but to think about it <eol> in a very local sense. <eob> Is this a local? <eob> If we reframe the questions and say, <eob> how well do you know your local area, <eob> would your answers be any more accurate? <eob>
So I devised a quiz: <eob> How well do you know your area? <eob>
It's a simple Web app. <eob>
You put in a post code <eob> and then it will ask you questions <eol> based on census data <eob> for your local area. <eob>
And I was very conscious <eol> in designing this. <eob>
I wanted to make it open <eol> to the widest possible range of people, <eob> not just the 49 percent <eol> who can get the numbers. <eob> I wanted everyone to engage with it. <eob>
So for the design of the quiz, <eob> I was inspired by the isotypes <eob> of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s. <eob>
Now, these are methods <eol> for representing numbers <eob> using repeating icons. <eob>
And the numbers are there, <eol> but they sit in the background. <eob>
So it's a great way <eol> of representing quantity <eob> without resorting to using terms <eol> like "percentage," <eob> "fractions" and "ratios." <eob> So here's the quiz. <eob> The layout of the quiz is, <eob> you have your repeating icons <eol> on the left-hand side there, <eob> and a map showing you the area <eol> we're asking you questions about <eob> on the right-hand side. <eob>
There are seven questions. <eob>
Each question, there's a possible answer <eol> between zero and a hundred, <eob> and at the end of the quiz, <eob> you get an overall score <eol> between zero and a hundred. <eob>
And so because this is TEDxExeter, <eob> I thought we would have <eol> a quick look at the quiz <eob> for the first few questions of Exeter. <eob>
And so the first question is: <eob> For every 100 people, <eol> how many are aged under 16? <eob>
Now, I don't know Exeter very well <eol> at all, so I had a guess at this, <eob> but it gives you an idea <eol> of how this quiz works. <eob>
You drag the slider <eol> to highlight your icons, <eob> and then just click "Submit" to answer, <eob> and we animate away the difference <eol> between your answer and reality. <eob>
And it turns out, I was a pretty <eol> terrible guess: five. <eob>
How about the next question? <eob>
This is asking about <eol> what the average age is, <eob> so the age at which half <eol> the population are younger <eob> and half the population are older. <eob>
And I thought 35 — that sounds <eol> middle-aged to me. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Actually, in Exeter, <eol> it's incredibly young, <eob> and I had underestimated the impact <eol> of the university in this area. <eob>
The questions get harder <eol> as you go through. <eob>
So this one's now asking <eol> about homeownership: <eob> For every 100 households, how many <eol> are owned with a mortgage or loan? <eob>
And I hedged my bets here, <eob> because I didn't want to be more <eol> than 50 out on the answer. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> And actually, these get harder, these questions, <eob> because when you're in an area, <eol> when you're in a community, <eob> things like age — there are clues <eol> to whether a population is old or young. <eob>
Just by looking around <eol> the area, you can see it. <eob>
Something like homeownership <eol> is much more difficult to see, <eob> so we revert to our own heuristics, <eob> our own biases about how many people <eol> we think own their own homes. <eob>
Now the truth is, <eol> when we published this quiz, <eob> the census data that it's based on <eol> was already a few years old. <eob>
We've had online applications <eol> that allow you to put in a post code <eob> and get statistics back for years. <eob>
So in some senses, <eob> this was all a little bit old <eol> and not necessarily new. <eob>
But I was interested to see <eol> what reaction we might get <eob> by gamifying the data <eol> in the way that we have, <eob> by using animation <eob> and playing on the fact <eol> that people have their own preconceptions. <eob>
It turns out, the reaction was, um ... <eob> was more than I could have hoped for. <eob> It was a long-held ambition of mine <eol> to bring down a statistics website <eob> due to public demand. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> This URL contains the words <eol> "statistics," "gov" and "UK," <eob> which are three of people's least <eol> favorite words in a URL. <eob>
And the amazing thing about this <eol> was that the website came down <eob> at quarter to 10 at night, <eob> because people were actually <eol> engaging with this data <eob> of their own free will, <eob> using their own personal time. <eob>
I was very interested to see <eob> that we got something like <eol> a quarter of a million people <eob> playing the quiz within the space <eol> of 48 hours of launching it. <eob>
And it sparked an enormous discussion <eol> online, on social media, <eob> which was largely dominated <eob> by people having fun <eol> with their misconceptions, <eob> which is something that <eol> I couldn't have hoped for any better, <eob> in some respects. <eob>
I also liked the fact that people started <eol> sending it to politicians. <eob>
How well do you know the area <eol> you claim to represent? <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> And then just to finish, <eob> going back to the two kinds of people, <eob> I thought it would be <eol> really interesting to see <eob> how people who are good with numbers <eol> would do on this quiz. <eob>
The national statistician <eol> of England and Wales, John Pullinger, <eob> you would expect he would be pretty good. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> He got 44 for his own area. <eob> Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly, <eol> after a glass of wine -- 36. <eob> Even worse. <eob> It just shows you that the numbers <eol> can inspire us all. <eob> They can surprise us all. <eob>
So very often, we talk about statistics <eob> as being the science of uncertainty. <eob>
My parting thought for today is: <eob> actually, statistics is the science of us. <eob>
And that's why we should <eol> be fascinated by numbers. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
One summer afternoon in 2013, <eob> DC police detained, questioned <eol> and searched a man <eob> who appeared suspicious <eol> and potentially dangerous. <eob>
This wasn't what I was wearing <eol> the day of the detention, to be fair, <eob> but I have a picture of that as well. <eob>
I know it's very frightening -- <eol> try to remain calm. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At this time, I was interning <eob> at the Public Defender Service <eol> in Washington DC, <eob> and I was visiting <eol> a police station for work. <eob>
I was on my way out, <eob> and before I could make it to my car, <eob> two police cars pulled up <eol> to block my exit, <eob> and an officer approached me from behind. <eob>
He told me to stop, take my backpack off <eob> and put my hands on the police car <eol> parked next to us. <eob>
About a dozen officers <eol> then gathered near us. <eob>
All of them had handguns, <eob> some had assault rifles. <eob>
They rifled through my backpack. <eob> They patted me down. <eob>
They took pictures of me <eol> spread on the police car, <eob> and they laughed. <eob>
And as all this was happening -- <eob> as I was on the police car trying <eol> to ignore the shaking in my legs, <eob> trying to think clearly <eol> about what I should do -- <eob> something stuck out to me as odd. <eob>
When I look at myself in this photo, <eob> if I were to describe myself, <eob> I think I'd say something like, <eob> "19-year-old Indian male, <eol> bright T-shirt, wearing glasses." <eob> But they weren't including <eol> any of these details. <eob>
Into their police radios <eol> as they described me, <eob> they kept saying, "Middle Eastern male <eol> with a backpack. <eob>
Middle Eastern male with a backpack." <eob> And this description carried on <eol> into their police reports. <eob>
I never expected to be described <eol> by my own government in these terms: <eob> "lurking," <eob> "nefarious," <eob> "terrorist." <eob> And the detention dragged on like this. <eob>
They sent dogs trained to smell explosives <eol> to sweep the area I'd been in. <eob>
They called the federal government <eol> to see if I was on any watch lists. <eob>
They sent a couple of detectives <eol> to cross-examine me on why, <eob> if I claimed I had nothing to hide, <eob> I wouldn't consent to a search of my car. <eob>
And I could see <eol> they weren't happy with me, <eob> but I felt I had no way of knowing <eol> what they'd want to do next. <eob>
At one point, the officer <eol> who patted me down <eob> scanned the side of the police station <eol> to see where the security camera was <eob> to see how much of this <eol> was being recorded. <eob>
And when he did that, <eob> it really sank in how completely <eol> I was at their mercy. <eob>
I think we're all normalized <eol> from a young age <eob> to the idea of police officers <eol> and arrests and handcuffs, <eob> so it's easy to forget how demeaning <eol> and coercive a thing it is <eob> to seize control over <eol> another person's body. <eob>
I know it sounds like <eol> the point of my story <eob> is how badly treated I was <eol> because of my race -- <eob> and yes, I don't think I would've been <eol> detained if I were white. <eob>
But actually, what I have in mind <eol> today is something else. <eob>
What I have in mind is how <eol> much worse things might've been <eob> if I weren't affluent. <eob>
I mean, they thought I might be trying <eol> to plant an explosive, <eob> and they investigated that possibility <eol> for an hour and a half, <eob> but I was never put in handcuffs, <eob> I was never taken to a jail cell. <eob>
I think if I were from one of Washington <eol> DC's poor communities of color, <eob> and they thought I was <eol> endangering officers' lives, <eob> things might've ended differently. <eob>
And in fact, in our system, I think <eol> it's better to be an affluent person <eob> suspected of trying <eol> to blow up a police station <eob> than it is to be a poor person <eob> who's suspected of much, <eol> much less than this. <eob>
I want to give you an example <eol> from my current work. <eob>
Right now, I'm working <eol> at a civil rights organization in DC, <eob> called Equal Justice Under Law. <eob>
Let me start by asking you all a question. <eob>
How many of you have ever gotten <eol> a parking ticket in your life? <eob> Raise your hand. <eob> Yeah. So have I. <eob> And when I had to pay it, <eob> it felt annoying and it felt bad, <eob> but I paid it and I moved on. <eob>
I'm guessing most of you <eol> have paid your tickets as well. <eob>
But what would happen if you <eol> couldn't afford the amount on the ticket <eob> and your family doesn't have <eol> the money either, what happens then? <eob>
Well, one thing that's not supposed <eol> to happen under the law is, <eob> you're not supposed to be <eol> arrested and jailed <eob> simply because you can't afford to pay. <eob>
That's illegal under federal law. <eob>
But that's what local governments <eol> across the country are doing <eob> to people who are poor. <eob>
And so many of our lawsuits <eol> at Equal Justice Under Law <eob> target these modern-day debtors' prisons. <eob>
One of our cases is against <eol> Ferguson, Missouri. <eob>
And I know when I say Ferguson, <eob> many of you will think of police violence. <eob>
But today I want to talk <eol> about a different aspect <eob> of the relationship between <eol> their police force and their citizens. <eob>
Ferguson was issuing an average <eol> of over two arrest warrants, <eob> per person, per year, <eob> mostly for unpaid debt to the courts. <eob>
When I imagine what that would feel like <eol> if, every time I left my house, <eob> there was a chance a police officer <eol> would run my license plate, <eob> see a warrant for unpaid debt, <eob> seize my body they way the did in DC <eob> and then take me to a jail cell, <eob> I feel a little sick. <eob>
I've met many of the people in Ferguson <eol> who have experienced this, <eob> and I've heard some of their stories. <eob>
In Ferguson's jail, <eob> in each small cell, <eol> there's a bunk bed and a toilet, <eob> but they'd pack four people <eol> into each cell. <eob>
So there'd be two people on the bunks <eol> and two people on the floor, <eob> one with nowhere to go except <eol> right next to the filthy toilet, <eob> which was never cleaned. <eob>
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned, <eob> so the floor and the walls were lined <eol> with blood and mucus. <eob>
No water to drink, <eob> except coming out of a spigot <eol> connected to the toilet. <eob>
The water looked and tasted dirty, <eob> there was never enough food, <eob> never any showers, <eob> women menstruating <eol> without any hygiene products, <eob> no medical attention whatsoever. <eob>
When I asked a woman <eol> about medical attention, <eob> she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no. <eob>
The only attention you get <eol> from the guards in there is sexual." <eob>
So, they'd take the debtors <eol> to this place and they'd say, <eob> "We're not letting you leave <eol> until you make a payment on your debt." <eob> And if you could -- if you <eol> could call a family member <eob> who could somehow come up with some money, <eob> then maybe you were out. <eob>
If it was enough money, you were out. <eob>
But if it wasn't, you'd stay there <eol> for days or weeks, <eob> and every day the guards <eol> would come down to the cells <eob> and haggle with the debtors <eol> about the price of release that day. <eob>
You'd stay until, at some point, <eol> the jail would be booked to capacity, <eob> and they'd want to book someone new in. <eob>
And at that point, they'd think, <eob> "OK, it's unlikely this person <eol> can come up with the money, <eob> it's more likely this new person will." <eob> You're out, they're in, <eol> and the machine kept moving like that. <eob>
I met a man who, <eob> nine years ago, was arrested <eol> for panhandling in a Walgreens. <eob>
He couldn't afford his fines <eol> and his court fees from that case. <eob>
When he was young <eol> he survived a house fire, <eob> only because he jumped out <eol> of the third-story window to escape. <eob>
But that fall left him <eol> with damage to his brain <eob> and several parts of this body, <eol> including his leg. <eob>
So he can't work, <eob> and he relies on social security <eol> payments to survive. <eob>
When I met him in his apartment, <eob> he had nothing of value there -- <eol> not even food in his fridge. <eob>
He's chronically hungry. <eob>
He had nothing of value in his apartment <eol> except a small piece of cardboard <eob> on which he'd written <eol> the names of his children. <eob>
He cherished this a lot. <eol> He was happy to show it to me. <eob>
But he can't pay his fines and fees <eol> because he has nothing to give. <eob>
In the last nine years, <eol> he's been arrested 13 times, <eob> and jailed for a total of 130 days <eol> on that panhandling case. <eob> One of those stretches lasted 45 days. <eob>
Just imagine spending from right now <eol> until sometime in June <eob> in the place that I described to you <eol> a few moments ago. <eob>
He told me about all the suicide attempts <eol> he's seen in Ferguson's jail; <eob> about the time a man found <eol> a way to hang himself <eob> out of reach of the other inmates, <eob> so all they could do <eol> was yell and yell and yell, <eob> trying to get the guards' attention <eob> so they could come down and cut him down. <eob>
And he told me that it took the guards <eol> over five minutes to respond, <eob> and when they came, <eol> the man was unconscious. <eob>
So they called the paramedics <eol> and the paramedics went to the cell. <eob>
They said, "He'll be OK," <eob> so they just left him there on the floor. <eob>
I heard many stories like this <eol> and they shouldn't have surprised me, <eob> because suicide is the single leading <eol> cause of death in our local jails. <eob>
This is related to the lack <eol> of mental health care in our jails. <eob>
I met a woman, single mother of three, <eol> making seven dollars an hour. <eob>
She relies on food stamps <eol> to feed herself and her children. <eob>
About a decade ago, <eob> she got a couple of traffic tickets <eol> and a minor theft charge, <eob> and she can't afford her fines <eol> and fees on those cases. <eob>
Since then, she's been jailed <eol> about 10 times on those cases, <eob> but she has schizophrenia <eol> and bipolar disorder, <eob> and she needs medication every day. <eob>
She doesn't have access <eol> to those medications in Ferguson's jail, <eob> because no one has access <eol> to their medications. <eob>
She told me about what it was like <eol> to spend two weeks in a cage, <eob> hallucinating people and shadows <eol> and hearing voices, <eob> begging for the medication <eol> that would make it all stop, <eob> only to be ignored. <eob>
And this isn't anomalous, either: <eob> thirty percent of women in our local jails <eol> have serious mental health needs <eob> just like hers, <eob> but only one in six receives <eol> any mental health care while in jail. <eob>
And so, I heard all these stories <eol> about this grotesque dungeon <eob> that Ferguson was operating <eol> for its debtors, <eob> and when it came time <eol> for me to actually see it <eob> and to go visit Ferguson's jail, <eob> I'm not sure what I was expecting to see, <eob> but I wasn't expecting this. <eob>
It's an ordinary government building. <eob>
It could be a post office or a school. <eob>
It reminded me that these illegal <eol> extortion schemes <eob> aren't being run somewhere in the shadows, <eob> they're being run out in the open <eol> by our public officials. <eob>
They're a matter of public policy. <eob>
And this reminded me <eol> that poverty jailing in general, <eob> even outside the debtors' prison context, <eob> plays a very visible and central role <eol> in our justice system. <eob>
What I have in mind is our policy of bail. <eob>
In our system, whether <eol> you're detained or free, <eob> pending trial is not a matter <eol> of how dangerous you are <eob> or how much of a flight risk you pose. <eob> It's a matter of whether you can afford <eol> to post your bail amount. <eob>
So Bill Cosby, whose bail <eol> was set at a million dollars, <eob> immediately writes the check, <eol> and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell. <eob>
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail, <eob> was only there because her family <eol> was unable to come up with 500 dollars. <eob>
In fact, there are half a million <eol> Sandra Blands across the country -- <eob> 500,000 people who are in jail right now, <eob> only because they can't afford <eol> their bail amount. <eob>
We're told that our jails <eol> are places for criminals, <eob> but statistically that's not the case: <eob> three out of every five people <eol> in jail right now are there pretrial. <eob>
They haven't been convicted of any crime; <eob> they haven't pled guilty to any offense. <eob>
Right here in San Francisco, <eob> 85 percent of the inmates <eol> in our jail in San Francisco <eob> are pretrial detainees. <eob>
This means San Francisco is spending <eol> something like 80 million dollars <eob> every year <eob> to fund pretrial detention. <eob>
Many of these people who are in jail <eol> only because they can't post bail <eob> are facing allegations so minor <eob> that the amount of time it would take <eol> for them to sit waiting for trial <eob> is longer than the sentence <eol> they would receive if convicted, <eob> which means they're guaranteed <eol> to get out faster <eob> if they just plead guilty. <eob>
So now the choice is: <eob> Should I stay here in this horrible place, <eob> away from my family and my dependents, <eob> almost guaranteed to lose my job, <eob> and then fight the charges? <eob>
Or should I just plead guilty to whatever <eol> the prosecutor wants and get out? <eob>
And at this point, they're pretrial <eol> detainees, not criminals. <eob>
But once they take that plea deal, <eol> we'll call them criminals, <eob> even though an affluent person <eol> would never have been in this situation, <eob> because an affluent person <eol> would have simply been bailed out. <eob>
At this point you might be wondering, <eob> "This guy's in the inspiration section, <eol> what is he doing -- <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"This is extremely depressing. <eob>
I want my money back. " <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
But in actuality, <eob> I find talking about jailing much less <eol> depressing than the alternative, <eob> because I think if we don't talk <eol> about these issues <eob> and collectively change <eol> how we think about jailing, <eob> at the end of all of our lives, <eob> we'll still have jails full of poor people <eol> who don't belong there. <eob>
That really is depressing to me. <eob>
But what's exciting to me is the thought <eol> that these stories can move us <eob> to think about jailing in different terms. <eob>
Not in sterile policy terms <eol> like "mass incarceration," <eob> or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders," <eob> but in human terms. <eob>
When we put a human being in a cage <eol> for days or weeks or months <eob> or even years, <eob> what are we doing <eol> to that person's mind and body? <eob>
Under what conditions <eol> are we really willing to do that? <eob>
And so if starting with a few <eol> hundred of us in this room, <eob> we can commit to thinking about <eol> jailing in this different light, <eob> then we can undo that normalization <eol> I was referring to earlier. <eob>
If I leave you with anything today, <eol> I hope it's with the thought <eob> that if we want anything <eol> to fundamentally change -- <eob> not just to reform our policies <eol> on bail and fines and fees -- <eob> but also to make sure that whatever <eol> new policies replace those <eob> don't punish the poor and the marginalized <eol> in their own new way. <eob>
If we want that kind of change, <eob> then this shift in thinking <eol> is required of each of us. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So many of you have probably seen <eol> the movie "The Martian." <eob> But for those of you who did not, <eol> it's a movie about an astronaut <eob> who is stranded on Mars, <eol> and his efforts to stay alive <eob> until the Earth can send a rescue mission <eol> to bring him back to Earth. <eob>
Gladly, they do re-establish communication <eob> with the character, <eol> astronaut Watney, at some point <eob> so that he's not as alone <eol> on Mars until he can be rescued. <eob>
So while you're watching the movie, <eol> or even if you haven't, <eob> when you think about Mars, <eob> you're probably thinking about <eol> how far away it is and how distant. <eob>
And, what might not <eol> have occurred to you is, <eob> what are the logistics really like <eol> of working on another planet -- <eob> of living on two planets <eob> when there are people on the Earth <eol> and there are rovers or people on Mars? <eob>
So think about when you have friends, <eol> families and co-workers <eob> in California, on the West Coast <eol> or in other parts of the world. <eob>
When you're trying to <eol> communicate with them, <eob> one of the things you <eol> probably first think about is: <eob> wait, what time is it in California? <eob>
Will I wake them up? <eob>
Is it OK to call? <eob>
So even if you're interacting <eol> with colleagues who are in Europe, <eob> you're immediately thinking about: <eob> What does it take to coordinate <eol> communication when people are far away? <eob> So we don't have people on Mars <eol> right now, but we do have rovers. <eob>
And actually right now, on Curiosity, it is 6: 10 in the morning. <eob>
So, 6: 10 in the morning on Mars. <eob>
We have four rovers on Mars. <eob>
The United States has put four rovers <eol> on Mars since the mid-1990s, <eob> and I have been privileged enough <eol> to work on three of them. <eob>
So, I am a spacecraft engineer, <eol> a spacecraft operations engineer, <eob> at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory <eol> in Los Angeles, California. <eob>
And these rovers are our <eol> robotic emissaries. <eob>
So, they are our eyes and our ears, <eol> and they see the planet for us <eob> until we can send people. <eob>
So we learn how to operate <eol> on other planets through these rovers. <eob>
So before we send people, we send robots. <eob>
So the reason there's a time difference <eol> on Mars right now, <eob> from the time that we're at <eob> is because the Martian day <eol> is longer than the Earth day. <eob>
Our Earth day is 24 hours, <eob> because that's how long it takes <eol> the Earth to rotate, <eob> how long it takes to go around once. <eob>
So our day is 24 hours. <eob>
It takes Mars 24 hours and <eol> approximately 40 minutes to rotate once. <eob>
So that means that the Martian day <eol> is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day. <eob>
So teams of people who are operating <eol> the rovers on Mars, like this one, <eob> what we are doing is we are <eol> living on Earth, but working on Mars. <eob>
So we have to think as if we are actually <eol> on Mars with the rover. <eob>
Our job, the job of this team, <eol> of which I'm a part of <eob> is to send commands to the rover <eol> to tell it what to do the next day. <eob>
To tell it to drive or drill <eol> or tell her whatever she's supposed to do. <eob>
So while she's sleeping -- <eol> and the rover does sleep at night <eob> because she needs <eol> to recharge her batteries <eob> and she needs to weather <eol> the cold Martian night. <eob>
And so she sleeps. <eob>
So while she sleeps, we work <eol> on her program for the next day. <eob>
So I work the Martian night shift. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So in order to come to work <eol> on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars — <eob> like, let's say I need to be at work at 5: 00 p.m., this team needs <eol> to be at work at 5: 00 p.m. Mars time every day, <eob> then we have to come to work <eol> on the Earth 40 minutes later every day, <eob> in order to stay in sync with Mars. <eob>
That's like moving a time zone every day. <eob>
So one day you come in at 8: 00, the next day 40 minutes later at 8: 40, the next day 40 minutes later at 9: <eol> 20, the next day at 10: 00. <eob>
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day, <eob> until soon you're coming to work <eol> in the middle of the night -- <eob> the middle of the Earth night. <eob> Right? So you can imagine <eol> how confusing that is. <eob>
Hence, the Mars watch. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> This weights in this watch <eol> have been mechanically adjusted <eob> so that it runs more slowly. <eob> Right? And we didn't start out — <eob> I got this watch in 2004 <eob> when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then. <eob>
We didn't start out thinking <eob> that we were going to need Mars watches. <eob> Right? We thought, OK, <eol> we'll just have the time on our computers <eob> and on the mission control screens, <eol> and that would be enough. <eob>
Yeah, not so much. <eob>
Because we weren't just <eol> working on Mars time, <eob> we were actually living on Mars time. <eob>
And we got just instantaneously confused <eol> about what time it was. <eob>
So you really needed something <eol> on your wrist to tell you: <eob> What time is it on the Earth? <eob>
What time is it on Mars? <eob>
And it wasn't just the time on Mars <eol> that was confusing; <eob> we also needed to be able <eol> to talk to each other about it. <eob>
So a "sol" is a Martian day -- <eol> again, 24 hours and 40 minutes. <eob>
So when we're talking about something <eol> that's happening on the Earth, <eob> we will say, today. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob> So, for Mars, we say, "tosol." <eob> Yesterday became "yestersol" ' for Mars. <eob>
Again, we didn't start out thinking, <eol> "Oh, let's invent a language." <eob> It was just very confusing. <eob>
I remember somebody walked up to me and said, <eob> "I would like to do this activity <eol> on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover." <eob> And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, <eol> or Mars, tomorrow?" <eob> We started this terminology because we needed <eol> a way to talk to each other. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow." <eob> Because people have different preferences <eol> for the words they use. <eob>
Some of you might say "soda" and some of you might say "pop." <eob> So we have people who say <eol> "nextersol" or "solorrow." <eob> And then something that I noticed <eol> after a few years of working on these missions, <eob> was that the people who work on the rovers, we say "tosol." <eob> The people who work on the landed missions <eol> that don't rove around, <eob> they say "tosoul." <eob> So I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So we have the watches and the language, and you're detecting a theme here, right? <eob>
So that we don't get confused. <eob>
But even the Earth daylight <eol> could confuse us. <eob>
If you think that right now, <eol> you've come to work <eob> and it's the middle of the Martian night <eob> and there's light streaming in <eol> from the windows <eob> that's going to be confusing as well. <eob>
So you can see from <eol> this image of the control room <eob> that all of the blinds are down. <eob>
So that there's no light to distract us. <eob>
The blinds went down all over the building <eol> about a week before landing, <eob> and they didn't go up <eol> until we went off Mars time. <eob>
So this also works <eol> for the house, for at home. <eob>
I've been on Mars time three times, <eol> and my husband is like, <eob> OK, we're getting ready for Mars time. <eob>
And so he'll put foil all over the windows <eol> and dark curtains and shades <eob> because it also affects your families. <eob>
And so here I was living in kind of <eol> this darkened environment, but so was he. <eob>
And he'd gotten used to it. <eob>
But then I would get these plaintive <eol> emails from him when he was at work. <eob>
Should I come home? Are you awake? <eob> What time is it on Mars? <eob>
And I decided, OK, <eol> so he needs a Mars watch. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> But of course, it's 2016, <eol> so there's an app for that. <eob> (Laughter) <eob> So now instead of the watches, <eol> we can also use our phones. <eob>
But the impact on families <eol> was just across the board; <eob> it wasn't just those of us <eol> who were working on the rovers <eob> but our families as well. <eob>
This is David Oh, one of our flight directors, <eob> and he's at the beach in Los Angeles <eol> with his family at 1: 00 in the morning. (Laughter) <eob> So because we landed in August <eob> and his kids didn't have to go back <eol> to school until September, <eob> they actually went on to Mars time <eol> with him for one month. <eob>
They got up 40 minutes later every day. <eob>
And they were on dad's work schedule. <eob>
So they lived on Mars time for a month <eol> and had these great adventures, <eob> like going bowling <eol> in the middle of the night <eob> or going to the beach. <eob>
And one of the things <eol> that we all discovered <eob> is you can get anywhere <eol> in Los Angeles <eob> at 3: 00 in the morning <eol> when there's no traffic. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
So we would get off work, <eob> and we didn't want to go home <eol> and bother our families, <eob> and we were hungry, so instead of <eol> going locally to eat something, <eob> we'd go, "Wait, there's this great <eol> all-night deli in Long Beach, <eob> and we can get there in 10 minutes!" <eob> So we would drive down -- <eol> it was like the 60s, no traffic. <eob>
We would drive down there, <eol> and the restaurant owners would go, <eob> "Who are you people? <eob>
And why are you at my restaurant <eol> at 3: 00 in the morning? <eob> "So they came to realize that there <eol> were these packs of Martians, <eob> roaming the LA freeways, <eol> in the middle of the night — <eob> in <eob> the middle of the Earth night. <eob>
And we did actually <eol> start calling ourselves Martians. <eob>
So those of us who were on Mars time <eol> would refer to ourselves as Martians, <eob> and everyone else as Earthlings. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
And that's because when you're moving <eol> a time-zone every day, <eob> you start to really feel separated <eol> from everyone else. <eob>
You're literally in your own world. <eob>
So I have this button on that says, <eol> "I survived Mars time. <eob>
Sol 0-90. <eob> "And there's a picture <eol> of it up on the screen. <eob>
So the reason we got these buttons <eol> is because we work on Mars time <eob> in order to be as efficient as possible <eol> with the rover on Mars, <eob> to make the best use of our time. <eob>
But we don't stay on Mars time <eol> for more than three to four months. <eob>
Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars <eol> time, which is what we're working now. <eob>
And that's because it's hard on <eol> your bodies, it's hard on your families. <eob>
In fact, there were sleep researchers <eol> who actually were studying us <eob> because it was so unusual for humans <eol> to try to extend their day. <eob>
And they had about 30 of us <eob> that they would do <eol> sleep deprivation experiments on. <eob>
So I would come in and take the test <eol> and I fell asleep in each one. <eob>
And that was because, again, <eol> this eventually becomes hard on your body. <eob>
Even though it was a blast. <eob>
It was a huge bonding experience with <eol> the other members on the team, <eob> but it is difficult to sustain. <eob>
So these rover missions are our <eol> first steps out into the solar system. <eob>
We are learning how to live <eol> on more than one planet. <eob>
We are changing our perspective <eol> to become multi-planetary. <eob>
So the next time you see <eol> a Star Wars movie, <eob> and there are people going from <eol> the Dagobah system to Tatooine, <eob> think about what it really means to have <eol> people spread out so far. <eob> What it means in terms of <eol> the distances between them, <eob> how they will start to feel <eol> separate from each other <eob> and just the logistics of the time. <eob>
We have not sent people to Mars yet, <eol> but we hope to. <eob>
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA <eob> and all of the international <eol> space agencies of the world, <eob> we hope to do that <eol> in the next few decades. <eob>
So soon we will have people on Mars, <eol> and we truly will be multi-planetary. <eob>
And the young boy or the young girl <eob> who will be going to Mars could be <eol> in this audience or listening today. <eob>
I have wanted to work at JPL <eol> on these missions since I was 14 years old <eob> and I am privileged to be a part of it. <eob>
And this is a remarkable time <eol> in the space program, <eob> and we are all in this journey together. <eob>
So the next time you think <eol> you don't have enough time in your day, <eob> just remember, it's all a matter <eol> of your Earthly perspective. <eob>
Thank you. <eob> (Applause) <eob>
Tom Stranger: In 1996, <eol> when I was 18 years old, <eob> I had the golden opportunity to go <eol> on an international exchange program. <eob>
Ironically, I'm an Australian <eol> who prefers proper icy cold weather, <eob> so I was both excited and tearful <eol> when I got on a plane to Iceland, <eob> after just having farewelled <eol> my parents and brothers goodbye. <eob>
I was welcomed into the home <eol> of a beautiful Icelandic family <eob> who took me hiking, <eob> and helped me get a grasp <eol> of the melodic Icelandic language. <eob>
I struggled a bit with the initial <eol> period of homesickness. <eob>
I snowboarded after school, <eob> and I slept a lot. <eob>
Two hours of chemistry class in a language <eol> that you don't yet fully understand <eob> can be a pretty good sedative. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
My teacher recommended <eol> I try out for the school play, <eob> just to get me a bit more socially active. <eob>
It turns out I didn't end up <eol> being part of the play, <eob> but through it I met Thordis. <eob>
We shared a lovely teenage romance, <eob> and we'd meet at lunchtimes <eol> to just hold hands <eob> and walk around old downtown Reykjavík. <eob>
I met her welcoming family, <eol> and she met my friends. <eob>
We'd been in a budding relationship <eol> for a bit over a month <eob> when our school's Christmas Ball was held. <eob>
Thordis Elva: I was 16 <eol> and in love for the first time. <eob>
Going together to the Christmas dance <eob> was a public confirmation <eol> of our relationship, <eob> and I felt like the luckiest <eol> girl in the world. <eob>
No longer a child, but a young woman. <eob>
High on my newfound maturity, <eob> I felt it was only natural to try drinking <eol> rum for the first time that night, too. <eob>
That was a bad idea. <eob>
I became very ill, <eob> drifting in and out of consciousness <eob> in between spasms of convulsive vomiting. <eob>
The security guards wanted <eol> to call me an ambulance, <eob> but Tom acted as my knight <eol> in shining armor, <eob> and told them he'd take me home. <eob>
It was like a fairy tale, <eob> his strong arms around me, <eob> laying me in the safety of my bed. <eob>
But the gratitude that I felt <eol> towards him soon turned to horror <eob> as he proceeded to take off my clothes <eol> and get on top of me. <eob>
My head had cleared up, <eob> but my body was still <eol> too weak to fight back, <eob> and the pain was blinding. <eob>
I thought I'd be severed in two. <eob>
In order to stay sane, <eob> I silently counted the seconds <eol> on my alarm clock. <eob>
And ever since that night, <eob> I've known that there are 7,200 <eol> seconds in two hours. <eob>
Despite limping for days <eol> and crying for weeks, <eob> this incident didn't fit my ideas <eol> about rape like I'd seen on TV. <eob>
Tom wasn't an armed lunatic; <eob> he was my boyfriend. <eob>
And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway, <eob> it happened in my own bed. <eob>
By the time I could identify <eol> what had happened to me as rape, <eob> he had completed his exchange program <eob> and left for Australia. <eob>
So I told myself it was pointless <eol> to address what had happened. <eob>
And besides, <eob> it had to have been my fault, somehow. <eob>
I was raised in a world <eol> where girls are taught <eob> that they get raped for a reason. <eob>
Their skirt was too short, <eob> their smile was too wide, <eob> their breath smelled of alcohol. <eob>
And I was guilty of all of those things, <eob> so the shame had to be mine. <eob>
It took me years to realize <eob> that only one thing could have stopped me <eol> from being raped that night, <eob> and it wasn't my skirt, <eob> it wasn't my smile, <eob> it wasn't my childish trust. <eob>
The only thing that could've stopped me <eol> from being raped that night <eob> is the man who raped me -- <eob> had he stopped himself. <eob>
TS: I have vague memories of the next day: <eob> the after effects of drinking, <eob> a certain hollowness <eol> that I tried to stifle. <eob> Nothing more. <eob> But I didn't show up at Thordis's door. <eob>
It is important to now state <eob> that I didn't see my deed for what it was. <eob>
The word "rape" didn't echo <eol> around my mind as it should've, <eob> and I wasn't crucifying myself <eol> with memories of the night before. <eob>
It wasn't so much a conscious refusal, <eob> it was more like any acknowledgment <eol> of reality was forbidden. <eob>
My definition of my actions completely <eol> refuted any recognition <eob> of the immense trauma I caused Thordis. <eob>
To be honest, <eob> I repudiated the entire act <eol> in the days afterwards <eob> and when I was committing it. <eob>
I disavowed the truth by convincing <eol> myself it was sex and not rape. <eob>
And this is a lie I've felt <eol> spine-bending guilt for. <eob>
I broke up with Thordis <eol> a couple of days later, <eob> and then saw her a number of times <eob> during the remainder <eol> of my year in Iceland, <eob> feeling a sharp stab <eol> of heavyheartedness each time. <eob>
Deep down, I knew I'd done <eol> something immeasurably wrong. <eob>
But without planning it, <eol> I sunk the memories deep, <eob> and then I tied a rock to them. <eob>
What followed is a nine-year period <eob> that can best be titled <eol> as "Denial and Running." <eob> When I got a chance to identify <eol> the real torment that I caused, <eob> I didn't stand still long enough to do so. <eob>
Whether it be via distraction, <eob> substance use, <eob> thrill-seeking <eob> or the scrupulous policing <eol> of my inner speak, <eob> I refused to be static and silent. <eob>
And with this noise, <eob> I also drew heavily <eol> upon other parts of my life <eob> to construct a picture of who I was. <eob>
I was a surfer, <eob> a social science student, <eob> a friend to good people, <eob> a loved brother and son, <eob> an outdoor recreation guide, <eob> and eventually, a youth worker. <eob>
I gripped tight to the simple notion <eol> that I wasn't a bad person. <eob>
I didn't think I had this in my bones. <eob>
I thought I was made up of something else. <eob>
In my nurtured upbringing, <eob> my loving extended family and role models, <eob> people close to me were warm and genuine <eob> in their respect shown towards women. <eob>
It took me a long time to stare down <eol> this dark corner of myself, <eob> and to ask it questions. <eob>
TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance, <eob> I was 25 years old, <eob> and headed straight <eol> for a nervous breakdown. <eob>
My self-worth was buried <eol> under a soul-crushing load of silence <eob> that isolated me from everyone <eol> that I cared about, <eob> and I was consumed <eol> with misplaced hatred and anger <eob> that I took out on myself. <eob>
One day, I stormed out <eol> of the door in tears <eob> after a fight with a loved one, <eob> and I wandered into a café, <eob> where I asked the waitress for a pen. <eob>
I always had a notebook with me, <eob> claiming that it was to jot down ideas <eol> in moments of inspiration, <eob> but the truth was that I needed <eol> to be constantly fidgeting, <eob> because in moments of stillness, <eob> I found myself counting seconds again. <eob>
But that day, I watched in wonder <eol> as the words streamed out of my pen, <eob> forming the most pivotal letter <eol> I've ever written, <eob> addressed to Tom. <eob>
Along with an account of the violence <eol> that he subjected me to, <eob> the words, "I want to find forgiveness" <eob> stared back at me, <eob> surprising nobody more than myself. <eob>
But deep down I realized that this <eol> was my way out of my suffering, <eob> because regardless of whether or not <eol> he deserved my forgiveness, <eob> I deserved peace. <eob>
My era of shame was over. <eob>
Before sending the letter, <eob> I prepared myself for all kinds <eol> of negative responses, <eob> or what I found likeliest: <eol> no response whatsoever. <eob>
The only outcome <eol> that I didn't prepare myself for <eob> was the one that I then got -- <eob> a typed confession from Tom, <eol> full of disarming regret. <eob>
As it turns out, he, too, <eol> had been imprisoned by silence. <eob>
And this marked the start <eol> of an eight-year-long correspondence <eob> that God knows was never easy, <eob> but always honest. <eob>
I relieved myself of the burdens <eol> that I'd wrongfully shouldered, <eob> and he, in turn, wholeheartedly <eol> owned up to what he'd done. <eob>
Our written exchanges became a platform <eob> to dissect the consequences of that night, <eob> and they were everything <eol> from gut-wrenching <eob> to healing beyond words. <eob>
And yet, it didn't bring about <eol> closure for me. <eob>
Perhaps because the email format <eol> didn't feel personal enough, <eob> perhaps because it's easy to be brave <eob> when you're hiding behind a computer <eol> screen on the other side of the planet. <eob>
But we'd begun a dialogue <eob> that I felt was necessary <eol> to explore to its fullest. <eob>
So, after eight years of writing, <eob> and nearly 16 years after that dire night, <eob> I mustered the courage <eol> to propose a wild idea: <eob> that we'd meet up in person <eob> and face our past once and for all. <eob>
TS: Iceland and Australia <eol> are geographically like this. <eob>
In the middle of the two is South Africa. <eob>
We decided upon the city of Cape Town, <eob> and there we met for one week. <eob>
The city itself proved to be <eol> a stunningly powerful environment <eob> to focus on reconciliation <eol> and forgiveness. <eob>
Nowhere else has healing <eol> and rapprochement been tested <eob> like it has in South Africa. <eob>
As a nation, South Africa sought <eol> to sit within the truth of its past, <eob> and to listen to the details <eol> of its history. <eob>
Knowing this only magnified the effect <eol> that Cape Town had on us. <eob>
Over the course of this week, <eob> we literally spoke <eol> our life stories to each other, <eob> from start to finish. <eob>
And this was about analyzing <eol> our own history. <eob>
We followed a strict policy <eol> of being honest, <eob> and this also came <eol> with a certain exposure, <eob> an open-chested vulnerability. <eob>
There were gutting confessions, <eob> and moments where we just <eol> absolutely couldn't fathom <eob> the other person's experience. <eob>
The seismic effects of sexual violence <eol> were spoken aloud and felt, <eob> face to face. <eob>
At other times, though, <eob> we found a soaring clarity, <eob> and even some totally unexpected <eol> but liberating laughter. <eob>
When it came down to it, <eob> we did out best to listen <eol> to each other intently. <eob>
And our individual realities <eol> were aired with an unfiltered purity <eob> that couldn't do any less <eol> than lighten the soul. <eob>
TE: Wanting to take revenge <eol> is a very human emotion -- <eob> instinctual, even. <eob>
And all I wanted to do for years <eob> was to hurt Tom back as deeply <eol> as he had hurt me. <eob>
But had I not found a way <eol> out of the hatred and anger, <eob> I'm not sure I'd be standing here today. <eob>
That isn't to say that I didn't have <eol> my doubts along the way. <eob>
When the plane bounced <eol> on that landing strip in Cape Town, <eob> I remember thinking, <eob> "Why did I not just get myself <eol> a therapist and a bottle of vodka <eob> like a normal person would do?" <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
At times, our search <eol> for understanding in Cape Town <eob> felt like an impossible quest, <eob> and all I wanted to do was to give up <eob> and go home to my loving <eol> husband, Vidir, <eob> and our son. <eob>
But despite our difficulties, <eob> this journey did result <eol> in a victorious feeling <eob> that light had triumphed over darkness, <eob> that something constructive <eol> could be built out of the ruins. <eob>
I read somewhere <eob> that you should try and be the person <eol> that you needed when you were younger. <eob>
And back when I was a teenager, <eob> I would have needed to know <eol> that the shame wasn't mine, <eob> that there's hope after rape, <eob> that you can even find happiness, <eob> like I share with my husband today. <eob>
Which is why I started writing feverishly <eol> upon my return from Cape Town, <eob> resulting in a book co-authored by Tom, <eob> that we hope can be of use <eol> to people from both ends <eob> of the perpetrator-survivor scale. <eob>
If nothing else, <eob> it's a story that we would've needed <eol> to hear when we were younger. <eob>
Given the nature of our story, <eob> I know the words <eol> that inevitably accompany it -- <eob> victim, rapist -- <eob> and labels are a way to organize concepts, <eob> but they can also be dehumanizing <eol> in their connotations. <eob>
Once someone's been deemed a victim, <eob> it's that much easier to file them away <eol> as someone damaged, <eob> dishonored, <eob> less than. <eob>
And likewise, once someone <eol> has been branded a rapist, <eob> it's that much easier <eol> to call him a monster -- <eob> inhuman. <eob>
But how will we understand <eol> what it is in human societies <eob> that produces violence <eob> if we refuse to recognize <eol> the humanity of those who commit it? <eob> And how -- <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
And how can we empower survivors <eol> if we're making them feel <eob> less than? <eob>
How can we discuss solutions <eol> to one of the biggest threats <eob> to the lives of women and children <eol> around the world, <eob> if the very words we use <eol> are part of the problem? <eob>
TS: From what I've now learnt, <eob> my actions that night in 1996 <eol> were a self-centered taking. <eob>
I felt deserving of Thordis's body. <eob>
I've had primarily positive <eol> social influences <eob> and examples of equitable <eol> behavior around me. <eob>
But on that occasion, <eob> I chose to draw upon the negative ones. <eob>
The ones that see women <eol> as having less intrinsic worth, <eob> and of men having some unspoken <eol> and symbolic claim to their bodies. <eob>
These influences I speak of <eol> are external to me, though. <eob>
And it was only me in that room <eol> making choices, <eob> nobody else. <eob>
When you own something <eob> and really square up to your culpability, <eob> I do think a surprising thing can happen. <eob>
It's what I call a paradox of ownership. <eob>
I thought I'd buckle <eol> under the weight of responsibility. <eob>
I thought my certificate <eol> of humanity would be burnt. <eob>
Instead, I was offered <eol> to really own what I did, <eob> and found that it didn't possess <eol> the entirety of who I am. <eob>
Put simply, <eob> something you've done doesn't have <eol> to constitute the sum of who you are. <eob>
The noise in my head abated. <eob>
The indulgent self-pity <eol> was starved of oxygen, <eob> and it was replaced <eol> with the clean air of acceptance -- <eob> an acceptance that I did hurt <eol> this wonderful person standing next to me; <eob> an acceptance that I am part of a large <eol> and shockingly everyday grouping of men <eob> who have been sexually violent <eol> toward their partners. <eob>
Don't underestimate the power of words. <eob>
Saying to Thordis that I raped her <eol> changed my accord with myself, <eob> as well as with her. <eob>
But most importantly, <eob> the blame transferred from Thordis to me. <eob>
Far too often, <eob> the responsibility is attributed <eol> to female survivors of sexual violence, <eob> and not to the males who enact it. <eob>
Far too often, <eob> the denial and running leaves all parties <eol> at a great distance from the truth. <eob>
There's definitely a public <eol> conversation happening now, <eob> and like a lot of people, <eob> we're heartened <eol> that there's less retreating <eob> from this difficult <eol> but important discussion. <eob>
I feel a real responsibility <eol> to add our voices to it. <eob>
TE: What we did is not a formula <eol> that we're prescribing for others. <eob>
Nobody has the right to tell anyone else <eol> how to handle their deepest pain <eob> or their greatest error. <eob>
Breaking your silence is never easy, <eob> and depending on where <eol> you are in the world, <eob> it can even be deadly <eol> to speak out about rape. <eob>
I realize that even the most <eol> traumatic event of my life <eob> is still a testament to my privilege, <eob> because I can talk about it <eol> without getting ostracized, <eob> or even killed. <eob>
But with that privilege of having a voice <eob> comes the responsibility of using it. <eob>
That's the least I owe <eol> my fellow survivors who can't. <eob>
The story we've just relayed is unique, <eob> and yet it is so common with sexual <eol> violence being a global pandemic. <eob>
But it doesn't have to be that way. <eob>
One of the things that I found useful <eol> on my own healing journey <eob> is educating myself about sexual violence. <eob>
And as a result, <eol> I've been reading, writing <eob> and speaking about this issue <eol> for over a decade now, <eob> going to conferences around the world. <eob>
And in my experience, <eob> the attendees of such events <eol> are almost exclusively women. <eob>
But it's about time that we stop treating <eol> sexual violence as a women's issue. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A majority of sexual violence <eol> against women and men <eob> is perpetrated by men. <eob>
And yet their voices are sorely <eol> underrepresented in this discussion. <eob>
But all of us are needed here. <eob>
Just imagine all the suffering <eol> we could alleviate <eob> if we dared to face this issue together. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Most of us go through life trying <eol> to do our best at whatever we do, <eob> whether it's our job, family, school <eob> or anything else. <eob> I feel that way. I try my best. <eob>
But some time ago, I came to a realization <eob> that I wasn't getting much better <eol> at the things I cared most about, <eob> whether it was being a husband or a friend <eob> or a professional or teammate, <eob> and I wasn't improving <eol> much at those things <eob> even though I was spending a lot of time <eob> working hard at them. <eob>
I've since realized from conversations <eol> I've had and from research <eob> that this stagnation, despite hard work, <eob> turns out to be pretty common. <eob>
So I'd like to share with you <eol> some insights into why that is <eob> and what we can all do about it. <eob>
What I've learned <eol> is that the most effective people <eob> and teams in any domain <eob> do something we can all emulate. <eob>
They go through life deliberately <eol> alternating between two zones: <eob> the learning zone <eol> and the performance zone. <eob>
The learning zone <eol> is when our goal is to improve. <eob>
Then we do activities <eol> designed for improvement, <eob> concentrating on what <eol> we haven't mastered yet, <eob> which means we have to expect <eol> to make mistakes, <eob> knowing that we will learn from them. <eob>
That is very different from what we do <eol> when we're in our performance zone, <eob> which is when our goal is to do something <eol> as best as we can, to execute. <eob>
Then we concentrate <eol> on what we have already mastered <eob> and we try to minimize mistakes. <eob>
Both of these zones <eol> should be part of our lives, <eob> but being clear about <eol> when we want to be in each of them, <eob> with what goal, focus and expectations, <eob> helps us better perform <eol> and better improve. <eob>
The performance zone maximizes <eol> our immediate performance, <eob> while the learning zone <eol> maximizes our growth <eob> and our future performance. <eob>
The reason many of us don't improve much <eob> despite our hard work <eob> is that we tend to spend almost <eol> all of our time in the performance zone. <eob>
This hinders our growth, <eob> and ironically, over the long term, <eol> also our performance. <eob>
So what does the learning zone look like? <eob>
Take Demosthenes, a political leader <eob> and the greatest orator <eol> and lawyer in ancient Greece. <eob>
To become great, <eol> he didn't spend all his time <eob> just being an orator or a lawyer, <eob> which would be his performance zone. <eob>
But instead, he did activities <eol> designed for improvement. <eob> Of course, he studied a lot. <eob> He studied law and philosophy <eol> with guidance from mentors, <eob> but he also realized that being a lawyer <eol> involved persuading other people, <eob> so he also studied great speeches <eob> and acting. <eob>
To get rid of an odd habit he had <eol> of involuntarily lifting his shoulder, <eob> he practiced his speeches <eol> in front of a mirror, <eob> and he suspended a sword from the ceiling <eob> so that if he raised his shoulder, <eob> it would hurt. <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
To speak more clearly despite a lisp, <eob> he went through his speeches <eol> with stones in his mouth. <eob>
He built an underground room <eob> where he could practice <eol> without interruptions <eob> and not disturb other people. <eob>
And since courts at the time <eol> were very noisy, <eob> he also practiced by the ocean, <eob> projecting his voice <eol> above the roar of the waves. <eob>
His activities in the learning zone <eob> were very different <eol> from his activities in court, <eob> his performance zone. <eob>
In the learning zone, <eob> he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson <eol> calls deliberate practice. <eob> This involves breaking down <eol> abilities into component skills, <eob> being clear about what subskill <eol> we're working to improve, <eob> like keeping our shoulders down, <eob> giving full concentration <eol> to a high level of challenge <eob> outside our comfort zone, <eob> just beyond what we can currently do, <eob> using frequent feedback <eol> with repetition and adjustments, <eob> and ideally engaging the guidance <eol> of a skilled coach, <eob> because activities <eol> designed for improvement <eob> are domain-specific, <eob> and great teachers and coaches <eol> know what those activities are <eob> and can also give us expert feedback. <eob>
It is this type of practice <eol> in the learning zone <eob> which leads to substantial improvement, <eob> not just time on task performing. <eob>
For example, research shows <eol> that after the first couple of years <eob> working in a profession, <eob> performance usually plateaus. <eob>
This has been shown to be true <eol> in teaching, general medicine, <eob> nursing and other fields, <eob> and it happens because once we think <eol> we have become good enough, <eob> adequate, <eob> then we stop spending time <eol> in the learning zone. <eob>
We focus all our time <eol> on just doing our job, <eob> performing, <eob> which turns out not to be <eol> a great way to improve. <eob>
But the people who continue <eol> to spend time in the learning zone <eob> do continue to always improve. <eob>
The best salespeople at least once a week <eob> do activities with <eol> the goal of improvement. <eob>
They read to extend their knowledge, <eob> consult with colleagues or domain experts, <eob> try out new strategies, <eol> solicit feedback and reflect. <eob>
The best chess players <eob> spend a lot of time <eol> not playing games of chess, <eob> which would be their performance zone, <eob> but trying to predict the moves <eol> grand masters made and analyzing them. <eob>
Each of us has probably spent <eol> many, many, many hours <eob> typing on a computer <eob> without getting faster, <eob> but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day <eob> fully concentrating <eol> on typing 10 to 20 percent faster <eob> than our current reliable speed, <eob> we would get faster, <eob> especially if we also identified <eol> what mistakes we're making <eob> and practiced typing those words. <eob>
That's deliberate practice. <eob>
In what other parts of our lives, <eob> perhaps that we care more about, <eob> are we working hard but not improving much <eob> because we're always <eol> in the performance zone? <eob>
Now, this is not to say <eol> that the performance zone has no value. <eob>
It very much does. <eob>
When I needed a knee surgery, <eol> I didn't tell the surgeon, <eob> "Poke around in there <eol> and focus on what you don't know." <eob>
(Laughter) <eob>
"We'll learn from your mistakes!" <eob> I looked for a surgeon <eol> who I felt would do a good job, <eob> and I wanted her to do a good job. <eob>
Being in the performance zone <eob> allows us to get things done <eol> as best as we can. <eob>
It can also be motivating, <eob> and it provides us with information <eol> to identify what to focus on next <eob> when we go back to the learning zone. <eob>
So the way to high performance <eob> is to alternate between <eob> the learning zone <eol> and the performance zone, <eob> purposefully building our skills <eol> in the learning zone, <eob> then applying those skills <eol> in the performance zone. <eob>
When Beyoncé is on tour, <eob> during the concert, <eol> she's in her performance zone, <eob> but every night when she <eol> gets back to the hotel room, <eob> she goes right back <eol> into her learning zone. <eob>
She watches a video <eol> of the show that just ended. <eob>
She identifies opportunities <eol> for improvement, <eob> for herself, her dancers <eol> and her camera staff. <eob>
And the next morning, <eob> everyone receives pages of notes <eol> with what to adjust, <eob> which they then work on during the day <eol> before the next performance. <eob>
It's a spiral <eob> to ever-increasing capabilities, <eob> but we need to know when we seek to learn, <eol> and when we seek to perform, <eob> and while we want <eol> to spend time doing both, <eob> the more time we spend <eol> in the learning zone, <eob> the more we'll improve. <eob>
So how can we spend <eol> more time in the learning zone? <eob>
First, we must believe and understand <eob> that we can improve, <eob> what we call a growth mindset. <eob>
Second, we must want <eol> to improve at that particular skill. <eob>
There has to be a purpose we care about, <eob> because it takes time and effort. <eob>
Third, we must have an idea <eol> about how to improve, <eob> what we can do to improve, <eob> not how I used to practice <eol> the guitar as a teenager, <eob> performing songs over and over again, <eob> but doing deliberate practice. <eob>
And fourth, we must be <eol> in a low-stakes situation, <eob> because if mistakes are to be expected, <eob> then the consequence of making them <eol> must not be catastrophic, <eob> or even very significant. <eob>
A tightrope walker doesn't practice <eol> new tricks without a net underneath, <eob> and an athlete wouldn't set out <eol> to first try a new move <eob> during a championship match. <eob>
One reason that in our lives <eob> we spend so much time <eol> in the performance zone <eob> is that our environments <eol> often are, unnecessarily, high stakes. <eob>
We create social risks for one another, <eob> even in schools which are supposed <eol> to be all about learning, <eob> and I'm not talking <eol> about standardized tests. <eob>
I mean that every minute of every day, <eob> many students in elementary <eol> schools through colleges <eob> feel that if they make a mistake, <eol> others will think less of them. <eob>
No wonder they're always stressed out <eob> and not taking the risks <eol> necessary for learning. <eob>
But they learn <eol> that mistakes are undesirable <eob> inadvertently <eob> when teachers or parents <eol> are eager to hear just correct answers <eob> and reject mistakes <eol> rather than welcome and examine them <eob> to learn from them, <eob> or when we look for narrow responses <eob> rather than encourage <eol> more exploratory thinking <eob> that we can all learn from. <eob>
When all homework or student work <eol> has a number or a letter on it, <eob> and counts towards a final grade, <eob> rather than being used for practice, <eol> mistakes, feedback and revision, <eob> we send the message <eol> that school is a performance zone. <eob>
The same is true in our workplaces. <eob>
In the companies I consult with, <eol> I often see flawless execution cultures <eob> which leaders foster <eol> to encourage great work. <eob>
But that leads employees <eol> to stay within what they know <eob> and not try new things, <eob> so companies struggle <eol> to innovate and improve, <eob> and they fall behind. <eob>
We can create more spaces for growth <eob> by starting conversations with one another <eob> about when we want to be in each zone. <eob>
What do we want to get better at and how? <eob>
And when do we want <eol> to execute and minimize mistakes? <eob>
That way, we gain clarity <eol> about what success is, <eob> when, and how to best support one another. <eob>
But what if we find ourselves <eol> in a chronic high-stakes setting <eob> and we feel we can't <eol> start those conversations yet? <eob>
Then here are three things <eol> that we can still do as individuals. <eob>
First, we can create low-stakes islands <eol> in an otherwise high-stakes sea. <eob>
These are spaces where mistakes <eol> have little consequence. <eob>
For example, we might find <eol> a mentor or a trusted colleague <eob> with whom we can exchange ideas <eol> or have vulnerable conversations <eob> or even role-play. <eob>
Or we can ask for feedback-oriented <eol> meetings as projects progress. <eob>
Or we can set aside time to read <eol> or watch videos or take online courses. <eob>
Those are just some examples. <eob>
Second, we can execute <eol> and perform as we're expected, <eob> but then reflect on what <eol> we could do better next time, <eob> like Beyoncé does, <eob> and we can observe and emulate experts. <eob>
The observation, reflection <eol> and adjustment is a learning zone. <eob>
And finally, we can lead <eob> and lower the stakes for others <eol> by sharing what we want to get better at, <eob> by asking questions <eol> about what we don't know, <eob> by soliciting feedback <eol> and by sharing our mistakes <eob> and what we've learned from them, <eob> so that others <eol> can feel safe to do the same. <eob>
Real confidence is about <eol> modeling ongoing learning. <eob>
What if, instead of spending <eol> our lives doing, doing, doing, <eob> performing, <eob> performing, performing, <eob> we spent more time exploring, <eob> asking, <eob> listening, <eob> experimenting, reflecting, <eob> striving and becoming? <eob>
What if we each always had something <eob> we were working to improve? <eob>
What if we created more low-stakes islands <eob> and waters? <eob>
And what if we got clear, <eob> within ourselves and with our teammates, <eob> about when we seek to learn <eol> and when we seek to perform, <eob> so that our efforts <eol> can become more consequential, <eob> our improvement never-ending <eob> and our best even better? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
"You have cancer." <eob> Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear <eol> those three words within our lifetime, <eob> and half will not survive. <eob>
This means that two out of five <eol> of your closest friends and relatives <eob> will be diagnosed <eol> with some form of cancer, <eob> and one will die. <eob>
Beyond the physical hardships, <eob> roughly one-third <eol> of cancer survivors here in the US <eob> will go into debt from treatment. <eob>
And they're at least two and a half times <eol> more likely to declare bankruptcy <eob> than those without cancer. <eob>
This disease is pervasive. <eob>
It's emotionally draining <eob> and, for many, <eob> financially destructive. <eob>
But a cancer diagnosis <eol> doesn't have to be a death sentence. <eob>
Finding cancer early, <eob> closer its genesis, <eob> is one of the critical factors <eol> to improving treatment options, <eob> reducing its emotional impact <eob> and minimizing financial burdens. <eob>
Most importantly, <eob> finding cancer early -- <eob> which is one of the primary <eol> aims of my research -- <eob> greatly enhances your odds of survival. <eob>
If we just look at the case <eol> of breast cancer for example, <eob> we find that those who are diagnosed <eol> and treated at stage one <eob> have a five-year survival rate <eol> of nearly 100 percent -- <eob> odds that decrease to just 22 percent <eol> if treated at stage four. <eob>
And similar trends are found <eol> for colorectal and ovarian cancer. <eob>
Now, we're all aware <eol> that an early diagnosis that is accurate <eob> is critical for survival. <eob>
The problem is that many <eol> cancer diagnostic tools are invasive, <eob> costly, <eob> often inaccurate <eob> and they can take an agonizing <eol> amount of time to get the results back. <eob>
Still worse, when it comes <eol> to some forms of cancer, <eob> such as ovarian, <eol> liver or pancreatic cancer, <eob> good screening methods simply don't exist, <eob> meaning that often people wait <eol> until physical symptoms surface, <eob> which are themselves already <eol> indicators of late-stage progression. <eob>
Like a tornado strike in an area <eol> without an early warning system, <eob> there is no alarm to warn, <eob> for the danger is already at your doorstep <eob> when your odds of survival <eol> are greatly reduced. <eob>
Having the convenience and accessibility <eol> of regular screening options <eob> that are affordable, noninvasive <eol> and could provide results much sooner, <eob> would provide us with a formidable <eol> weapon in the fight against cancer. <eob>
An early warning would allow us <eol> to get out ahead of the disease <eob> instead of merely <eol> following in its relentless wake. <eob>
And this is exactly what I've been doing. <eob>
For the past three years, <eol> I've been developing technologies <eob> that could ultimately aid clinicians <eob> with rapid, early-stage <eol> cancer diagnostics. <eob>
And I've been fueled <eol> by a deep scientific curiosity, <eob> and a passion to change these statistics. <eob>
Last year however, <eob> this fight became much more personal <eob> when my wife was diagnosed <eol> with breast cancer. <eob>
It was an experience that added a strong <eol> and unexpected emotional dimension <eob> to these efforts. <eob>
I know firsthand how life-altering <eol> treatment can be, <eob> and I'm keenly aware <eol> of the emotional havoc <eob> that cancer can wreak on a family, <eob> which in our case <eol> included our two young daughters. <eob>
Because we found it early <eol> during a routine mammogram, <eob> we were able to focus <eol> primarily on treatment options <eob> for the localized tumor, <eob> reaffirming to me <eol> how important an early diagnosis is. <eob>
Unlike other forms of cancer, <eob> mammograms do offer an early-stage <eol> screening option for breast cancer. <eob>
Still, not everyone has this done, <eob> or they may develop breast cancer <eob> before the middle age recommendation <eol> for having a mammogram. <eob>
So, there's still <eol> a lot of room for improvement, <eob> even for cancers <eol> that do have screening options, <eob> and, of course, considerable benefits <eol> for those that don't. <eob>
A key challenge then <eol> for cancer researchers <eob> is to develop methods <eob> that make regular screening <eol> for many types of cancers <eob> much more accessible. <eob>
Imagine a scenario <eol> where during your regular checkup, <eob> your doctor can take <eol> a simple, noninvasive urine sample, <eob> or other liquid biopsy, <eob> and present you with the results <eol> before you even leave the doctor's office. <eob>
Such a technology could <eol> dramatically reduce the number of people <eob> who slip through the net <eol> of an early-stage cancer diagnosis. <eob>
My research team <eol> of engineers and biochemists <eob> is working on exactly this challenge. <eob>
We're working on ways to frequently <eol> activate an early-stage cancer alarm <eob> by enabling regular screenings <eol> that would start when a person is healthy <eob> so that action could be taken <eol> to stop cancer the moment it emerges, <eob> and before it can progress <eol> beyond its infancy. <eob>
The silver bullet in this case <eol> are tiny vesicles, <eob> little escape pods regularly shed <eol> by cells called exosomes. <eob>
Exosomes are important biomarkers <eob> that provide an early-warning system <eol> for the development of cancer. <eob>
And because they're abundantly present <eol> in just about every bodily fluid, <eob> including blood, urine and saliva, <eob> they're extremely attractive <eol> for noninvasive liquid biopsies. <eob>
There's just one problem. <eob>
An automated system for rapidly sorting <eol> these important biomarkers <eob> is not currently available. <eob>
We've created a technology <eol> that we call nano-DLD <eob> that is capable of precisely this: <eob> automated exosome isolation <eob> to aid rapid cancer diagnostics. <eob>
Exosomes are the newest <eol> early-warning weapon, if you will, <eob> to emerge on the liquid biopsy front. <eob>
And they're really, really small. <eob>
They measure just 30 to 150 <eol> nanometers in diameter. <eob>
This is so tiny <eob> that you could fit about a million <eol> of them into a single red blood cell. <eob>
That's roughly the difference <eol> between a golf ball <eob> and a fine grain piece of sand. <eob>
Once thought to be little bins <eol> for unwanted cellular waste, <eob> it has been found <eol> that cells actually communicate <eob> by producing and absorbing these exosomes <eob> which contain surface receptors, <eob> proteins and other genetic material <eol> collected from their cell of origin. <eob>
When absorbed by a neighboring cell, <eob> exosomes release their contents <eol> into the receiving cell, <eob> and can set in motion <eol> fundamental changes in gene expression -- <eob> some good, <eob> and this is where cancer comes in, <eob> some bad. <eob>
Because they are clothed <eol> in the material of the mother cell, <eob> and contain a sample of its environment, <eob> they provide a genetic snapshot <eol> of that cell's health and its origin. <eob>
All of these qualities <eol> make exosomes invaluable messengers <eob> that potentially allow physicians <eob> to eavesdrop on your health <eol> at the cellular level. <eob>
To catch cancer early, however, <eob> you have to frequently <eol> intercept these messages <eob> to determine when cancer-causing <eol> troublemakers within your body <eob> decide to start staging a coup, <eob> which is why regular <eol> screening is so critical <eob> and why we're developing <eol> technologies to make this possible. <eob>
While the first exosome-based diagnostics <eol> emerged on the market just this year, <eob> they are not yet part <eol> of mainstream healthcare options. <eob>
In addition to their recent emergence, <eob> another factor that's limiting <eol> their widespread adoption <eob> is that currently, no <eob> automated exosome isolation <eob> system exists <eob> to make regular <eol> screening economically accessible. <eob>
The current gold standard <eol> for exosome isolation <eob> includes ultracentrifugation, <eob> a process requiring <eol> expensive laboratory equipment, <eob> a trained lab tech <eob> and about 30 hours of time <eol> to process a sample. <eob>
We've come up with a different <eol> approach for achieving <eob> automated exosome isolation <eob> from a sample such as urine. <eob>
We use a chip-based, continuous flow <eol> separation technique <eob> called deterministic lateral displacement. <eob>
And we have done with it <eob> what the semiconductor industry has done <eol> so successfully for the past 50 years. <eob>
