Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.
These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light.
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.
As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone.
So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red.
This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are.
One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules.
And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein.
So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role.
And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.
So, how do I study this?
In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.
And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals.
We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this.
In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish.
It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter.
And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real.
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely.
So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.
And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.
So I wanted to seek this out further.
So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life.
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home." We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.
And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.
It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.
They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.
But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.
Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time.
But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there.
After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluores cent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock.
The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral.
Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.
These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them.
And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé.
He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.
He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.
So this is the male seahorse.
They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head.
The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures.
So he stayed awake for days.
He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment.
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying.
And here's our footage.
(Music)
They're the most cryptic fish.
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.
But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ... sharks.
So I'm, like, a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am.
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."
(Laughter)
It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.
And then we found it.
In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.
And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.
Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.
But this is all beautiful to see.
I was like, this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark? Can they see this? And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision.
So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green.
So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green.
It's creating contrast that they can indeed see.
So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.
And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them.
But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands.
Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.
So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision.
And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.
And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them.
So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them.
In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go?
Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?
So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here.
And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off.
There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness.
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.
And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking.
As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.
(Laughter)
But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?
Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore.
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.
The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this.
At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research.
Back to the powerful applied applications. Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections.
It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better.
And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage.
So he could see when a single neuron fires.
You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures.
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.
From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind.
And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums.
And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff.
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.
At last -- a long corridor, a stair and a door.
You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.
So what are you expecting? Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? We don't really have any of that there.
Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel.
Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life.
The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there.
Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave.
So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds?
Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.
Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world.
This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance.
The first one was rather limited in scope.
It reflected the rather parochial perspective.
The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global.
The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world.
There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people.
The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio.
These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar.
With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent.
But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well.
And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story.
Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him -- he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture.
There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through.
And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.
But genius rose to the challenge.
In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters.
He, too, would tell a story -- no Apostles -- but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis.
Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling.
How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below?
The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths.
Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within.
Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius.
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power.
And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums.
Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right.
The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.
So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global.
No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color.
And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning.
And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark.
Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space.
The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next.
He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation.
Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists.
He focused on the act of creation.
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good."
So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man.
Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background.
But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee.
Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness.
That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam.
It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
Who is in that other arm?
Eve, first woman.
No, she's not an afterthought.
She's part of the plan.
She's always been in his mind.
Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm.
And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me.
Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women -- so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam.
And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.
You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling.
You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church.
The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve.
The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us.
You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God.
Maybe he's the savior.
Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn.
It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.
And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.
But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.
Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.
You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers.
They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space.
This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.
All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again.
The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean.
How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world?
Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence.
Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies.
They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple.
It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us.
They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise.
Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world.
The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle.
There you find men and women completely nude like athletes.
They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes.
So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight.
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.
This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes.
But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body.
And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power.
Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did.
Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.
And so now we stand in the here and now.
We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience.
The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror.
Who am I in this picture? Am I one of the crowd?
Am I the athlete? And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time.
But actually the story is bigger.
It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures.
This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.
Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous.
The printing press made sure that everybody saw it.
And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks.
It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, "You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.
Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?" And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.
BG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
(Laughter)
EL: I don't know, is that an ad?
(Laughter) BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement.
The experience of art today is encountering problems.
Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did.
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look.
But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped.
It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space.
BG: Liz, grazie.
BG: Thank you. (Applause)
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting.
But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference.
So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, "Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ... oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ... oh, and of course, there's gene patents."
"Gene patents?"
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
"No! You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body?
That can't be right."
I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.
And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office. "Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
(Laughter)
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics.
I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer.
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.
First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene.
Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" -- namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.
Gene patent proponents say, "See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene." And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.
And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene.
So what does that mean?
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder.
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing.
Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.
Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death.
The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.
But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.
So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement.
So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available.
During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible.
You can't patent products of nature -- the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.
And you can't patent laws of nature -- the law of gravity, E = mc2.
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none.
It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts -- scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law.
All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero.
Why is that? Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years.
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes.
The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere.
So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," seemed all the more reason to take on this fight.
So we set out to build our case.
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue.
We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that.
This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients.
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case -- more like a civil rights case.
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.
It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
It charged a lot of money for its test -- over 3,000 dollars.
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community.
And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.
It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer -- a negative test result that should have been positive.
This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad.
The test was negative.
The family was relieved.
That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.
But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result.
Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.
Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems.
We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents.
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science.
So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA? How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately.
And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold.
So isolating DNA -- it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed.
You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself.
It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold.
And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example -- still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.
In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion -- 152 pages -- and a complete victory for our side.
In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good.
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time?
We just could not comprehend how this had happened.
So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist.
He was not just a scientist -- he had a PhD in molecular biology.
(Laughter)
What an incredible stroke of luck!
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
And here things got really interesting.
First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides.
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.
This was a really big deal, totally unexpected.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.
So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.
But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons.
The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong.
(Laughter)
He decided Myriad had created a new chemical -- made absolutely no sense.
Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.
The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.
But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry." The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us.
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court.
And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.
Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, "wherein this" and "therefore that." We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.
Four words: Are human genes patentable?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, "Well, I don't know.
I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"
"Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago."
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours.
The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting — long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2: 30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse.
Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career.
I was clearly more nervous than he was.
But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."
(Laughter)
The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake.
The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years.
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon.
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."
(Laughter)
We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero.
"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated.
And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything."
Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes.
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.
Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering.
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad.
It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need.
A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail.
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case.
I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.
(Laughter)
We took a big risk in taking this case.
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing.
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way.
A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Code is the next universal language.
In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.
In the eighties, it was probably money.
But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world.
And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth.
My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14.
I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.
And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.
I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here.
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.
So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving.
And that is how programming started for me.
It started as a means of self-expression.
Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.
And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.
But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.
And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.
Here's what I think today.
Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, "What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?" And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
It's the parents who do.
It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers.
That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics.
And they are partly right about that.
There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming.
And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.
We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them.
And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one.
But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?" Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?" Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?" We adults, we grow oddly silent. "It's magic," some of us say. "It's too complicated," the others say.
Well, it's neither.
It's not magic and it's not complicated.
It all just happened really, really, really fast.
Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces.
And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.
And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them.
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer.
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.
The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.
But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators.
This whole quest led me to this little girl.
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.
She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.
And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this.
Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed.
And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together.
And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture.
She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.
And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.
And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.
And idealistic foxes, and so on.
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.
And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump." And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.
And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg.
And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.
When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions.
I would start by showing the kids these four pictures.
I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.
And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?" And the kids would be very conservative and go, "None of these is a computer.
I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time." But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it.
And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it.
And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms.
And kids, you know what?
(Laughter) In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them.
And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on / off button on them.
And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer." And again, the kids go, "Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this." But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either.
They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things.
But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors." And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer, we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector." And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change.
Final story, we also built a computer.
And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things.
And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it.
And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.
And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application.
And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth.
And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.
Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more colorful and better the world will look like.
So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians.
Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology.
They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world.
A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.
When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller.
I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley.
In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines.
And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia.
And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me.
I still create worlds.
Instead of stories, I do them with code.
Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices.
Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Melati Wijsen: Bali — island of gods.
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
MW: Or ... a paradise lost.
Bali: island of garbage.
IW: In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day.
That's about a 14-story building.
And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.
MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island.
It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean.
And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered.
IW: So we decided to do something about it.
And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.
And we have had some significant successes.
MW: We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali.
Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches.
We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match.
IW: One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi.
Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant.
Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant?
We wanted to do something now.
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.
And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage.
But that is a huge problem.
So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags.
And the idea was born.
IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags.
And you know what?
We don't even need them.
MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags." MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot.
Lesson number one: you cannot do it all by yourself.
You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.
The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools.
And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.
And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island.
IW: We run a pilot village, home of 800 families.
The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.
We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen.
The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free.
Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed.
So we thought, "Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures.
They can't ignore us, right?"
MW: Right!
IW: But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
(Laughter)
We got stuck -- till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box.
Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
MW: But how do we get into the airport?
And here comes lesson number three: persistence.
Off we headed to the airport.
We got past the janitor.
And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again.
And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports.
And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
IW: In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures.
How cool is that?
Lesson number four: you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people.
And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities.
Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions --
(Laughter)
even if kids ask nicely.
But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations.
MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network.
She started with just one Roots & amp; Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world.
We are one of them.
She's a real inspiration.
If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you.
We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International.
IW: But we have also learned much about patience,
MW: how to deal with frustrations,
IW: leadership,
MW: teamwork,
IW: friendship,
MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture
IW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.
MW: It's not always easy.
Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.
We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi.
We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals.
Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, "We're going on a hunger strike!"
MW: And you can probably imagine their faces.
It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well.
Isabel and I were serious about doing this.
So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.
IW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started.
We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school.
What were these two girls doing?
We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike -- we could have gone to jail.
But, hey, it worked.
Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor.
MW: And there he was --
(Applause)
waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.
He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags.
And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made.
And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.
IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public.
IW: Our short-term campaign, "One Island / One Voice," is all about this.
We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali.
And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker.
(Laughter)
MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this?
Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach.
But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things.
We can make things happen.
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this.
We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas -- just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us.
All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home.
Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs.
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it! Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy.
We're telling you it's going to be worth it.
Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future.
MW: We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be
Both: "Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
Om shanti shanti shanti om.
Thank you.
This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl.
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
So you might ask, why did we design this robot?
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things.
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
And my goal is to understand how this works.
There are four main components behind animal locomotion.
The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.
Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.
A third component are central pattern generators.
These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals.
And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion.
But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem.
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion.
Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.
Especially in humans, very hard to do.
A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components.
So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help.
So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots.
And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain -- stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job.
The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.
There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.
So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.
And here we want to start simple.
So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals.
And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models.
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.
Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD.
But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.
Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.
Why not have a real robot and real physics?
So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.
You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.
It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.
So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- it's not so nice but you remove the head -- and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.
If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.
And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits.
And in fact, the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop.
Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.
And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.
And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail.
That's what we did.
So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D.
And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do.
And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.
So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible.
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal.
So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait.
If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.
But even better, we can do swimming.
So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --
(Laughter)
and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.
And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.
The physics of interaction are complex.
Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics.
But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this.
So let's go to the spinal cord.
So here what we did with Jean-Mar ie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits.
And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion.
And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits.
And we tested that on board of a robot.
And this is how it looks.
So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot.
And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain.
And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.
For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.
And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.
So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.
And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs.
The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.
So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments.
A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.
Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly.
The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces.
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
It will just jump, in fact.
And this very elastic property is also very important.
And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.
And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.
To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us.
This is a small perturbation.
I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over.
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.
But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right.
And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion?
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates.
And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans.
That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects.
The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord.
Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion.
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations.
And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL. My colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate.
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.
This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals.
Thank you. (Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim.
But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose.
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot — We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you.
And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you.
But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back.
Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.
I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.
Actually, it was exhausting.
The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.
So what's going on here?
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories!
... Survival! "We eat the food, we taste it — it tastes good.
And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating and where you found it." We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time.
See food, eat food, feel good, repeat.
Trigger, behavior, reward.
Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what?
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is.
You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better.
Same process, just a different trigger.
Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat.
Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." So we start smoking.
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.
Trigger, behavior, reward. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat.
And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit.
So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet.
Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits.
Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ... but added a twist?
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?
I'll give you an example.
In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking.
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times.
Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.
In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do."
And what did they notice?
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.
She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program.
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit.
(Laughter)
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken.
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.
We call this cognitive control.
We're using cognition to control our behavior.
Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience.
We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful.
We just can't help ourselves.
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important.
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior.
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones.
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment.
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding.
What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious?
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body sensations come and go.
These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on.
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being.
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
So it actually works.
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play.
Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride.
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down.
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most.
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it.
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better — notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat.
Thank you.

Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity.
In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation.
And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
Economic growth matters. With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth.
You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today?
Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts.
Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods.
But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China.
But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction.
Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships.
More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work.
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
What do you say to those who react that way?
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion.
There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards.
And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
Do you see that happening?
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes.
And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
Is that what you're suggesting?
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
The second largest economy is China.
It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.
BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris.
If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded.
As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want.
Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R & amp; D. And so they have to come to the table as well.
But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.

As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru.
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed.
Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory.
They would go into towns and ask the Inca, "Where's another civilization we can conquer?
Where's more gold? "And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them," Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there.
In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold." The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled.
All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist?
I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no.
And this makes sense.
You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes.
You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation.
And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru.
So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.
Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, "But no, Andrés, I've been there.
I've swum in that river. "
(Laughter)
Then my uncle jumps in. "No, Andrés, she's not kidding.
You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman.
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."
(Laughter)
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"
You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."
But then ... I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer.
It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees.
And then, I saw this.
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C. This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough.
The river flowed hot and fast.
I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river.
And this is what's bizarre -- It starts off as a cold stream.
And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water.
And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life.
The next morning, I woke up and --
(Laughter)
I asked for tea. I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river.
To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems.
What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it.
It was just part of their everyday life.
They drink its water.
They take in its vapor.
They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it.
I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle.
He asked for my intentions and listened carefully.
Then, to my tremendous relief -- I was freaking out, to be honest with you -- a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.
(Laughter)
I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home.
I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous.
One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine.
I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling.
And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest.
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.
The temperature differential made it all white.
It was a whiteout. Intense.
Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries.
Well, first off, it's not a legend. Surprise!
(Laughter)
When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful.
There were just no good maps.
Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this.
Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, "boiled with the heat of the sun," indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us.
So why does the river boil?
(Bubbling sounds)
It actually took me three years to get that footage.
Fault-fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults.
Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.
What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place.
Next time you cross the road, think about this.
The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path.
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall -- and all with near-boiling water.
We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork.
And the results were just awesome.
Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out.
And it showed this amazing trend.
You see, the river starts off cold.
It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river.
Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee. Yes? Good. Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60.
So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this.
There you have your hot coffee.
Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee.
And these are average water temperatures.
We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.
But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience.
Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water.
You need to be careful.
It can be deadly.
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same.
So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes.
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.
They turn this milky-white color.
The stream is carrying them.
They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot.
So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out.
(Laughter)
A bit sadistic, aren't we? Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer.
What's, again, amazing are these temperatures.
They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.
But here's the thing: the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism.
It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.
How can a boiling river exist like this?
I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So, still -- how does it work? Where do we get this heat?
There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.
Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets.
We refer to this as the geothermal gradient.
The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting.
Now, we found that in and around the river -- this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells, and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis -- we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river.
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river?
What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle?
And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?
To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site.
To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.
But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit.
And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development.
My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance.
Because that's the question, one of significance.
And the thing there is, we define significance. It's us. We have that power.
We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial.
And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data.
There remains so much to explore.
We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria.
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy.
They show their spirit.
And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was frightening, frightening for us all.
We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding.
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
It could've stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously.
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human.
Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing.
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating.
And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it.
And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us." And help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released.
Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this. Let's work together, and let's make this happen."
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it.
So we were waiting for more data to release that. and the data has still not come.
We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together.
And this just -- we can't accept that. Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives.
But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word "Kenema," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze." That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always.
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hello. My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
(Applause)
I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport.
By the way, all that is through Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population.
People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
That's the word "retard" or "retarded" used in a derogatory manner.
They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know the World Games happened this year?
I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA.
There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.
Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching.
For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.
We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and those of so many others.
And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated.
For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society.
No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.
(Applause)
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends.
When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provin cial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.
(Applause)
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport.
Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.
(Applause)
The change in them was amazing.
They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them.
And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.
Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.
This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.
Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a casual term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, "Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
See if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
(Applause)
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition.
So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --
(Applause)
setting huge new records for Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
(Applause)
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
(Applause)
I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.
(Applause)
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability.
The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts.
I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
(Applause)
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports has the power to change the world." Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I come from the tallest people on the planet -- the Dutch.
It hasn't always been this way.
In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.
In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.
And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat.
In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs.
In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.
And we know that globally, we are getting richer.
And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today.
And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.
At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace.
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half.
And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.
And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.
But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.
It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today.
We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.
We need to alleviate the pressure on it.
And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse.
Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
So how do we fix this? What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?
We could all become vegan.
Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.
And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands.
The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.
It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.
People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources.
For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems.
We must do better and there is a solution.
And that solution lies in aquaculture -- the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.
As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.
That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting." Fish is the last food that we hunt.
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!" over fish that we know virtually nothing about?
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.
We don't know.
Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice.
It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat.
And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous.
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up.
And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point.
And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.
I know I sound fish-obsessed --
(Laughter)
Let me explain: My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago.
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009.
We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans.
Mission Blue truly changed our lives.
We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation -- something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together.
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.
But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need.
We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right.
And to talk about stats -- right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year.
Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.
Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.
But now this: Demand is going to go up.
In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number.
It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.
It needs to come from farming.
And talk about farming -- for farming you need resources.
As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal.
A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat.
Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.
We just don't have enough feed or water.
And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.
And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply.
We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet.
And now let's compare that with fish farming.
You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less.
And why is that?
Well, that's because fish, first of all, float.
They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.
And most fish are cold-blooded -- they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills.
(Laughter)
And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.
Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects.
for human consumption. How much we've learned since. For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
This is madness. Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed.
Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.
It's destroying our oceans.
The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it.
Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute.
Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems — they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is.
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on.
In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on.
And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach.
It's not sustainable, it's not healthy.
Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean? Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes.
Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind.
But it's had a really bad reputation.
There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients.
How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was.
Once you know, you know. You can't go back.
It's not fun.
We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food.
But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better.
We can now farm fish without any of these issues.
I think of agriculture before the green revolution -- we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.
New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae.
Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet.
Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal -- at scale.
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.
You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.
And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale.
We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.
I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint.
Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other -- off of each other, mimicking nature.
You need very little feed, very little footprint.
I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.
There's great technologies popping up all over the globe.
From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution.
Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices.
There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe.
And make no mistake -- all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today.
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt.
And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.
Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction.
This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead.
It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think. It's possible.
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.
We want to eat good and healthy.
And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.
We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives.
And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe -- this is for all of us.
Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money.
People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about.
We're all the same.
The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.
You can help speed this up.
Ask questions when you order seafood.
Where does my fish come from?
Who raised it, and what did it eat?
Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available.
And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.
So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you.
And eventually, they will listen.
And all of us will benefit.
Thank you.

15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test.
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire.
One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American.
I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds?
In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for "black." But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?
In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African?
And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman?
After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons.
Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes.
Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, "Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself." So I check "black," but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice.
It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases.
And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.
Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction.
When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world.
As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races.
And it's not just the view of social scientists.
You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?
President Bill Clinton famously declared, "I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same." And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes.
Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton. "I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race."
Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.
But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.
Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.
Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race.
As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American. Why?
I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races.
But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?
Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.
It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for.
But race is a bad proxy.
In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
It's just a distraction.
But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have -- all more evidence-based than the patient's race.
Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being.
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race.
Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes.
Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction.
The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.
A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients.
The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects.
It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs.
But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients.
In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.
For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people.
One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, "Give me what the white people are taking!"
(Laughter)
And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine." He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently.
Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons.
He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them.
He wrote in a medical journal, "It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom." To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.
Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people.
Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled "race" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race.
It's a well-known function called "correcting for race."
The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.
Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.
You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference.
Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.
Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill.
It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine.
I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race.
Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?
Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?
What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?
What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?
Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity.
It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.
So I'm a neurosurgeon. And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.
I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident.
And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair.
And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap.
And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies.
You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function.
It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain.
I think that we are approaching this dream.
And I would like to show you that we are very close to this.
And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.
So the story started 15 years ago.
At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room.
I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.
You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.
And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.
So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.
It's not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family.
So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive.
So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
And after many attempts, Jean-François did it.
And that's what he saw under his microscope.
And that was, for us, a major surprise. Why? Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.
And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body.
The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain.
So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.
And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.
And they never die, they're immortal cells.
But these cells behave differently.
They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died.
So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
All of you have them in your brain.
They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.
They have a very important role during the development stage.
When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself.
But why do they stay in your head?
This, we don't know.
We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions.
But it's not so sure.
But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture.
And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain.
And we had to prove this.
So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm.
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.
And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain.
And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual.
We call these autologous grafts -- autografts.
So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?" Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.
So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons.
And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.
Those are the cells that were re-implanted.
And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.
But we could not stop here, of course.
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?
So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.
They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.
They were very good at it.
And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.
So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore.
And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke.
Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.
He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion.
He's not so accurate, not so quick.
And look now when we re-implant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.
(Applause)
It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.
Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.
We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on.
We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this." I do, in any case.
And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.
BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
BG: If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.
It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.
Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?
And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients.
So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.
And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.
You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.
BG: And safe, of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this. BG: Thank you.
On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.
Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.
The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts "a crime against world cultural heritage." And he was right -- or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.
In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn.
Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity.
What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate.
But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy.
Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents.
The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps.
What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works?
Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past.
Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music -- or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture.
These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist.
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.
For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel.
How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text.
As an academic, I was a mere reader.
I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years -- Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch -- and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.
What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip -- or, actually, with the whip.
(Laughter) And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.
And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.
At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love," the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited.
And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.
For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me.
And so I did what many people do. I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest.
A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.
And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea.
And to my surprise, he actually wrote back.
With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic.
So how does multispectral imaging actually work?
Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.
The same is true with invisible writing.
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.
Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz.
There are about five of these in the world.
And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA.
The results can be spectacular.
You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing.
Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.
Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century.
This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.
This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church.
In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis.
Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years.
Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution.
The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.
That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.
Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.
So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.
More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.
Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress.
Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten.
The word overwritten was "citizens." Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was. "Subjects." There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.
This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located.
The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert.
Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented.
The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.
Ultraviolet did very little for it.
Multispectral gave us everything.
In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body.
In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.
Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation.
Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us.
What about the future? There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever.
That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call "textual science." Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar -- the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them -- with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition.
Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.
As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.
Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.
This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud.
In that moment, he became a scholar.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change, and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take.
Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me, because trusting big institutions, not really part of my family legacy.
My mother escaped North Korea when she was 10 years old.
To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols.
Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States, she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest.
Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States.
Because of her bravery and passion, I've had all the opportunities that she never did, and that has made my story so different.
Instead of running away from big institutions, I've actually run toward them.
I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal, the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world, where I lead sustainable investing.
Now, these institutions are like tankers, and working inside of them, I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets, the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world, that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal, if we ask it to be.
Now, I know some of you are thinking, global capital markets, positive social change, not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.
I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean.
It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires.
So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones, but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides, don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.
But why is that? Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us, and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us, as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets, why aren't we able to make our voices heard?
Why can't we make some waves?
So let me ask you a different question: did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks? OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have?
Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
So why do we do these things? Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion combustion engine vehicles.
One fish is just one fish in the sea.
And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
But we do these things because we believe they matter, that our actions add up, that our choices might influence others and collectively, what an impact we can have.
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.
It's a reusable mug.
It has all these things printed on it.
Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
"This one cup can be used again and again."
"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."
"This one cup helps save the planet." I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
(Laughter)
So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters, but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't?
Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care, that we care about fair labor standards, that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities?
Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars, but we would vote with our lattes?
So I think it has something to do with the myths, the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?
If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil," it would fill up with sweet porridge.
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop," it would stop.
But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen, and things could go terribly awry.
So I think when it comes to markets, we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.
We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command: make more money.
Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold.
Add in some extra words like "protect the environment," the spell might not work.
Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice," and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
So we asked people, what do you really think?
And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors, and we found something fascinating.
Overwhelmingly, people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.
71 percent of people said yes, they were interested in sustainable investing, which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance. 71 percent wanted that.
72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially.
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.
But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks, they thought that they would make less money.
So is it true? Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it?
Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben & amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so. Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each.
But here's the important thing. Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments, they had to preserve that socially conscious mission.
If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious, those brands wouldn't make more money.
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?
The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round, they need to stick to making more money.
So, Harvard Business School actually researched this, and they found something fascinating.
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter, that one dollar would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues, that one dollar would have grown to 28 dollars and 36 cents. almost twice as much sweet porridge.
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity.
Now, Harvard's not alone.
Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results, and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency, lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price.
And then there's Al Gore.
So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House, he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change.
Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation, where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process.
And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views. Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.
Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix, he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.
Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite.
It is not just about private equity for billionaires.
It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.
It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.
It's about mutual funds.
It's about all the things we already see in the market today.
So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal.
First, the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right, preserving all the same good principles of investing, the traditional sphere, can pay. It makes sense.
Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads.
We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge.
And once you get rid of the fable, you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.
And third, the future is already here.
Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry. In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.
It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States.
So what are we waiting for? For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.
She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story.
She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle, no big institution stand in her way.
She made it to the States, and she became a teacher, an award-winning author and a mother, and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.
And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.
It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means "passionate clarity."
Passionate clarity: that's what I think we need to drive change.
Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course.
We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices.
We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.
So change your perspective. Vote with your small change.
Invest in the change you want to see in the world.
Change the fables and change the markets.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Food crisis. It's in the news every day.
But what is it?
Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much.
Other places, GMO is saving the world.
Maybe GMO is the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, attenuation of nutrition.
They go on and on.
And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering.
So how do we bring that to something that we understand?
How is this apple food crisis?
You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think it was from when it was picked? Two weeks? Two months? Eleven months -- the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the cold storage -- there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew this?
Why didn't I know this?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all of the antioxidants -- are gone by the time we get it.
It's basically a little ball of sugar.
How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know platforms -- I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young.
I did very weird things --
on this platform. But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel empowered to question: What if?
For me, I questioned: What if climate was democratic?
So, this is a map of climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They shift and they change, and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers.
China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a slave to climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What would that change about how we live?
What would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
The last generation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a huge analog farm.
All these traces -- these are cars, planes, trains and automobiles.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food.
What if... we built a digital farm?
A digital world farm.
What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side? What if?
Going through some of these quotes, you know, they inspire me to do what I do.
First one:
["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."]
That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70 percent of their own food.
But it's not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the American population is involved in farming.
What good answer comes from two percent of any population?
As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18.
Eighty percent don't want to be farmers. Farming is hard. The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable.
They go into the city.
In India: farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities, more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that.
It's uncomfortable to talk about.
Where are they going? Into the city. No young people, and everyone's headed in.
So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine.
A number of years ago now, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking.
And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all -- a lot.
(Laughter)
I eventually got them to survive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!
Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants.
What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life.
Inside of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food.
And there's a lot of interesting technology in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white roots, deep, green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can tell you one thing for sure: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.
(Laughter)
We get our salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, ripping roots off and thinking, "Huh.
I know something about — I could make this happen, I want to try. "
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it away; it's kind of precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.
(Laughter)
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause)
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.
It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!" And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me.
Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology.
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this.
We want to see what people can create, so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.
And then we built it.
So on the facade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant.
If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenome, right? The phenomena. When you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico," you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like.
So if you're coding climate -- this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- you're coding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on.
If you think of your houseplants, and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad, because you're like, "Why are you dying?
Won't you talk to me? "
(Laughter)
Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity.
Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.
We trend those data points over time.
We correlate those data points to individual plants.
These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.
(Laughter)
We have IP-addressable broccoli.
(Applause)
So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profile.
And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it achieve the nutrition that I need?
When does it achieve the taste that I desire?
Is it getting too much water?
Is it getting too much sun? Alerts. It can talk to me, it's conversant, we have a language.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?
That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends.
(Laughter)
And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now.
And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act.
So this is my lab now. It's a little bit more systematized, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
And so -- inside of this environment, we're experimenting with all kinds of things.
This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space.
What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
It's like the plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world.
So we've grown all kinds of things.
These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks? Banks of seed. It's amazing. They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten.
I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato.
Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook, so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great.
But we've done things with protein -- we've grown all kinds of things.
We've grown humans --
(Laughter)
Well maybe you could, but we didn't.
But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive.
I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars.
Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one.
This project was actually one of my student's -- mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.
So Camille and I and my team, we iterated all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it.
Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade.
And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.
So I went into this school and I said, "Set it to 65 percent humidity."
The seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."
He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me. Actually -- don't trust me, right?
Set it to 100. He sets it to 100 and what happens?
It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain. Why didn't you just tell me that?"
(Laughter)
We've created an interface for this that's much like a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone, on their tablet.
They have different parts of the bots -- the physical, the sensors.
They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world.
They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it's growing, they make changes. They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway?
Isn't CO2 bad?
It kills people." Crank up CO2, plant dies.
Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.
Harvest plant, and you've created a new digital recipe.
It's an iterative design and development and exploration process.
They can download, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do -- was it better or was it worse?
Imagine these as little cores of processing.
We're going to learn so much.
Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three weeks' time.
This is three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer -- or that he would want to be a farmer.
So, we've open-sourced all of this.
It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be difficult -- I'm just telling you.
We're in the beginning, but it's all there.
It's very important to me that this is easily accessible.
We're going to keep making it more so.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, economist, urban planners. On one platform, doing what they're good at.
But we got a little too big.
This is my new facility that I'm just starting.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this. These exist right now.
One grows greens, one grows Ebola vaccine. Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola.
The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant.
So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, all they way down to lettuce.
But these two things look nothing alike, and that's where I am with my field. Everything is different. We're in that weird "We're alright" stage and it's like, "Here's my black box --" "No, buy mine." "No, no, no -- I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable.
Don't buy his, buy mine."
And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shifting, too.
When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food.
And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget, the most mysterious food it em of all time -- they are now basing their marketing plan on that -- everything is changing.
So into the world now. Personal food computers, food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome.
Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actuate and grow.
What does this look like in a world?
You remember the world connected by strings?
We start having beacons.
We start sending information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not just my fantasy, this is where we're already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centers, connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
We know what's wrong with this.
The future of food is about net working the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
(Applause)
There are a few things that all of us need.
We all need air to breathe. We need clean water to drink. We need food to eat.
We need shelter and love. You know. Love is great, too.
And we all need a safe place to pee.
(Laughter) Yeah?
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate, the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.
(Applause) Trans people and trans issues, they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.
And this is a great and necessary thing, but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals, most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous, and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college, or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school.
Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
Public bathrooms. They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
(Laughter)
Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.
I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.
I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.
I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about, and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection.
(Laughter)
And I know what some of you are thinking, and you're mostly right.
I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.
But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.
I'm a trans person.
And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.
Have you heard about these?
They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth.
And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right? Panty checks? Really. Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?
There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway.
They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia.
They don't make anyone safer.
But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.
Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms, but also universities, hospitals, libraries.
Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.
If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places.
We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not. I never have. And this starts very early.
I know a little girl.
She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
She's a self-identified tomboy.
I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
One time I asked her what her favorite color was.
She told me, "Camouflage."
(Laughter)
So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right?
It's so good.
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
Her and her classmates were four years old.
They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.
She was four years old.
She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her.
She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem, and that problem started with her and was hers alone.
So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter, and I did.
I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away, but I knew that wasn't true.
I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older, but I couldn't.
So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened, asked her to tell me how it made her feel. "Mad and sad," she told me.
So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her, and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.
I said yes, I had, but not for a really long time.
(Laughter)
Which of course was a lie, because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze, when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching. Don't lie. It happens. Right? She doesn't need to know that, I figure.
(Laughter)
I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
When you get old like me, you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer, I promised her.
"Until you can get home?" she asked me.
I said, "Yes, until you can get home." She seemed to take some comfort in that.
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.
We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute.
This we can do. So let's just do it.
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, does care about the rest of the population.
If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me, then what about women and girls with body image issues?
What about anyone with body image stuff going on?
What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates, whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey? Oh, grade eight, what a cruel master you can be. Right? What about people with anxiety issues?
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?
What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason, don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?
How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers, and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise?
Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities?
We can't change transphobic minds overnight, but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
Thank you.
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.
I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak
Conservation Photographer
In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find.
They are becoming more compressed and more threatened.
As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images.
And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle.
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists.
Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.
(Music)
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply.
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls.
They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast.
Close behind are sharks.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water.
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey.
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
(Music)
However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
(Music)
When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development.
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area.
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons." And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.
(Music)
Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path.
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California.
And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
(Music)
This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
But don't take my word for it -- come with me.
On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to be creators of hope.
And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean. Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.
(Music)
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?
(Laughter)
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
(Laughter)
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --
(Laughter)
are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history.
We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face.
There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
And he said this: "I came to realize..."
(Laughter)
"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills.
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap.
(Laughter)
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.
(Laughter)
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.
We've all had really great conversations.
We've had them before.
We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.
Number one: Don't multitask.
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment.
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.
Number two: Don't pontificate.
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.
(Laughter)
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring.
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that.
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener.
Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
Number three: Use open-ended questions.
In this case, take a cue from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know.
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.
Number four: Go with the flow.
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.
We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that.
And we do the exact same thing.
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
(Laughter)
And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you.
You need to let them come and let them go.
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution.
Talk should not be cheap.
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job.
It's not the same. It is never the same.
All experiences are individual.
And, more importantly, it is not about you.
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered.
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea.
People who brag about their IQs are losers. "
(Laughter)
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot.
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
Don't do that.
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.
Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care.
What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out.
Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop.
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
(Laughter)
Why do we not listen to each other?
Number one, we'd rather talk.
When I'm talking, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the center of attention.
I can bolster my own identity.
But there's another reason: We get distracted.
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.
(Laughter)
You have to listen to one another.
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
We listen with the intent to reply."
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister]
(Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home.
People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the runner-up to Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer. "And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.
You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
Thanks.
(Applause)
So you go to the doctor and get some tests.
The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it.
So you get a pillbox.
You have some confidence, your physician has some confidence that this is going to work.
The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.
They studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it.
They have a rough idea of how it works, they have a rough idea of what the side effects are. It should be OK. You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue, haven't felt like yourself, you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do.
Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression.
I'm going to have to give you another pill."
So now we're talking about two medications.
This pill also -- millions of people have taken it, the company did studies, the FDA looked at it -- all good.
Think things should go OK. Think things should go OK.
Well, wait a minute. How much have we studied these two together?
Well, it's very hard to do that.
In fact, it's not traditionally done.
We totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance," after the drugs hit the market.
How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications? Three? Five? Seven? Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on.
Why do I care about this problem? I care about it deeply.
I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe.
So let me tell you a data science story.
And it begins with my student Nick.
Let's call him "Nick," because that's his name.
(Laughter)
Nick was a young student. I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding. But the FDA has made available an amazing database. It's a database of adverse events.
They literally put on the web -- publicly available, you could all download it right now -- hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists.
And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.
It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose.
Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.
Let's see if we can understand glucose response. I sent Nick off. Nick came back.
"Russ," he said, "I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database, and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."
He did it. It was very simple, in a way.
He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose, and said, "What's the difference in their side effects? Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?" All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor. He said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose."
I said, "Nick, that's great." He's a young student, you have to build his confidence. "But Nick, there's a problem.
It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose, because it's core to our practice.
So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting, definitely not publishable."
(Laughter)
He said, "I know, Russ.
I thought you might say that. "Nick is smart." I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment.
I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal."
And I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list." And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting.
But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs: paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.
And I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs." In fact, we learned later, 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin, and a million, we estimated, on both.
So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up. But I said, "It's still not publishable, because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo, with the machine learning, but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have." So we have to do something else.
Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record.
We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information. And I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose."
Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin.
But we needed special patients. We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement, then got the second one and had another glucose measurement, all within a reasonable period of time -- something like two months.
And when we did that, we found 10 patients.
However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P -- we call this P and P -- when they got the second P. Either one could be first, the second one comes up, glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter.
Just as a reminder, you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic, with a glucose of around 90. And if it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes. So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.
I said, "Nick, this is very cool.
But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper, because this is 10 patients and -- give me a break -- it's not enough patients."
So we said, what can we do? And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt, who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, who also have electronic medical records similar to ours.
Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements in that range that we need.
God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients, same trend.
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.
So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose.
When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.
This was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this." We submitted the paper.
It was all data evidence, data from the FDA, data from Stanford, data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.
We had not done a single real experiment.
But we were nervous. So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab.
We found somebody who knew about lab stuff.
I don't do that.
I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes.
They taught us how to feed mice drugs.
We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine. We gave some other mice pravastatin.
And we gave a third group of mice both of them. And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice.
So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.
That was great, and the story could have ended there.
But I still have six and a half minutes.
(Laughter)
So we were sitting around thinking about all of this, and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said, "I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia.
They could and they should.
How would we ever determine that?" We said, well, what do you do?
You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking, and you type in "side effects." What are you experiencing?
So we said OK, let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us, so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches.
Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request.
So I was bummed.
I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, "We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer." He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."
(Laughter)
Yeah. That's great. Now I felt like I was --
(Laughter)
I felt like I was talking to Nick again.
He works for one of the largest companies in the world, and I'm already trying to make him feel better.
But he said, "No, Russ -- you might not understand.
We not only have Bing searches, but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google, Yahoo, Bing, any... Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only. "I said," Now you're talking! "This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.
So we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia, like "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" -- forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in.
So we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words." And we did first a baseline.
And it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.
So that's our baseline rate.
If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.
If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query, it goes up to 10 percent, a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in, and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.
We published this, and it got some attention.
The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches.
We brought this to the attention of the FDA. They were interested. They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft, which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others, to look at Twitter feeds, to look at Facebook feeds, to look at search logs, to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together, are causing problems. What do I take from this?
Why tell this story? Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions. How do drugs work? This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use.
Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now.
He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs.
He found several very important interactions, and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions.
However, there's a couple of things.
We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time.
As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs.
Have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction?
Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, being taken by the same patient, perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected?
We really have no idea.
It's a blue sky, open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs.
Two more lessons: I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors, the people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, to be used for research.
People are worried about data.
They're worried about their privacy and security -- they should be.
We need secure systems.
But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.
And the final thing I want to say is, in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story.
The two drugs actually caused problems. They increased glucose. They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes, and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together, perhaps not together, make different choices when you're prescribing.
But there was another possibility.
We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way.
We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective.
If we think about drug treatment today, all the major breakthroughs -- for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes -- it's always a cocktail of drugs.
And so the upside here, and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments, new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.
Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment, graffiti-style -- or, more specifically, without permission and unsanctioned.
But when I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious notions about it, I had no visions of grandeur.
All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.
So I wrapped the door handle.
I call this the Alpha Piece.
Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.
So clearly the reaction was interesting.
It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?" Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?
So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.
The reaction was wild.
People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it, and scratch their heads and stare at it, and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it, and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.
And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.
So at this point I'm smitten. I'm hooked. This was all seductive. I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground.
So this is some of my early work.
I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.
And this was fun for me.
It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life.
So... I think we all see the humor in this, but —
(Laughter)
I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.
I wanted to analyze it. I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, why were other people reacting so strongly to it.
And I realized something.
We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.
I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, and billboards and advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.
So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually -- weirdly -- you find a connection to it, that is the moment.
That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others.
So at this point, my curiosity grew.
It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material.
Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
So that's when the bus happened.
This was a real game changer for me.
I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.
At this point, people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale, and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
So at this point, I'm experiencing, or I'm witnessing something interesting.
I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore.
It had reached global status. People from all over the world were doing this.
And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.
So as I pursued my own goals with my art -- this is a lot of my recent work -- so was yarn bombing. Yarn bombing was also growing. And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world.
It was through this granny hobby -- this unassuming hobby -- that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with.
So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing -- building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals -- and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone.
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.
But if you think about it, what would happen if you put those things down? What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life.
But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before.
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this -- I'm a math major actually.
So I didn't think this was in the cards for me, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this.
And when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.
So as we ponder the future, know that your future might not be so seamless.
And one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So a while ago, I tried an experiment. For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.
Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to.
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes.
Did I want to be on live TV?
No, but yes.
Did I want to try acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear, made it not scary.
My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.
It's amazing, the power of one word. "Yes" changed my life. "Yes" changed me.
But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler.
I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey." as though she's a Southern waitress.
(Laughter)
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."
(Laughter)
The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes." And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.
I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time. Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.
And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career.
See, I have what most people would call a dream job. I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living. Dream job. No. I'm a titan. Dream job. I create television. I executive produce television.
I make television, a great deal of television.
In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV —
Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars.
Let's just say five.
A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV, that's 350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night.
Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people.
My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.
You know who else is doing that? Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan. Dream job.
(Applause)
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.
I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer." I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling.
For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.
It is manning the troops.
It is painting a canvas.
It is hitting every high note.
It is running a marathon.
It is being Beyoncé.
And it is all of those things at the same time. I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum.
There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.
A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever.
And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy.
And don't get me wrong, it does.
But the hum -- it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.
The hum is more than writing.
The hum is action and activity.
The hum is a drug.
The hum is music. The hum is light and air.
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.
And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness.
That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.
That's called the hum.
(Laughter) Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.
Maybe it's called genius.
Maybe it's called ego.
Maybe it's just fear of failure.
I don't know.
I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.
I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
But here's the thing: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.
And what did I say about work? I love working, right? The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum.
I like that hum.
I love that hum.
I need that hum.
I am that hum.
Am I nothing but that hum?
And then the hum stopped.
Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out. The hum stopped.
Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny." And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand." They're children of a titan.
They're baby titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.
The hum of the engine died.
I stopped loving work.
I couldn't restart the engine. The hum would not come back.
My hum was broken.
I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.
But there was no hum.
Inside me was silence.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time... I was the perfect titan.
I was a titan you could take home to your mother.
All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.
And it was my life.
It was all I did.
I was the hum, and the hum was me.
So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, "Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."
(Laughter)
But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you? What are you? What am I? Am I still a titan?
If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.
I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, "Momma, wanna play?" And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.
One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey." She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.
When did that happen?
I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes.
And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?" And I say, "Yes." There's nothing special about it.
We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
(Laughter) And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention. I focus. I am still. The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of. (Laughter)
It's all peace and simplicity.
The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.
I can barely believe I'm breathing.
Play is the opposite of work.
And I am happy.
Something in me loosens.
A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes.
And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen. I feel it. A hum creeps back.
Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.
Not the hum, but a hum.
And now I feel like I know a very magical secret.
Well, let's not get carried away.
It's just love.
That's all it is. No magic. No secret. It's just love.
It's just something we forgot.
The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement.
If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is.
The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.
The hum is joy-specific.
The real hum is love-specific.
The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.
The real hum is confidence and peace.
The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.
The real hum is singular and original.
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
It's just love. We could all use a little more love, a lot more love.
Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes.
I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt.
It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum.
I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing.
I don't like it.
I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.
The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.
I don't like playing.
I work all the time because I like working.
I like working more than I like being at home.
Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
Well, me. I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.
(Laughter) I've got issues.
And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.
(Laughter)
We run around the yard, up and back and up and back.
We have 30-second dance parties.
We sing show tunes.
We play with balls.
I blow bubbles and they pop them.
And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.
I itch for my cell phone always.
But it is OK.
My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.
I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place.
You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play.
Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?
You're right, but you can still do this. You have time. You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.
(Laughter) Your child does not think you're that interesting.
You only need 15 minutes.
My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else.
It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
(Laughter)
And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year. (Laughter)
15 minutes is all you need.
I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.
Uninterrupted is the key.
No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.
You have a busy life.
You have to get dinner on the table.
You have to force them to bathe.
But you can do 15 minutes.
My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good.
It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy. It's about playing in general. Give yourself the 15 minutes.
Find what makes you feel good.
Just figure it out and play in that arena.
I'm not perfect at it.
In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space. "Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown. 15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes? Turns out, nothing. The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.
Work doesn't work without play.
It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again.
But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.
I don't need that hum.
I am not that hum.
That hum is not me, not anymore.
I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.
I am that hum. Life's hum. Love's hum. Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful.
And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.
I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.
My brain is still global.
My campfires still burn.
The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the freer my mind becomes.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum.
The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me.
The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.
That part of the job, that's living the dream.
That's the dream of the job.
Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more play.
Titans need not apply. Wanna play?
Thank you.
(Applause)
1.3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, falling inexorably towards each other and collided, converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe.
It was a very big bang.
But they didn't release their energy in light. I mean, you know, they're black holes.
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.
1.3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.
Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.
And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes.
Now, most people thought they were nuts.
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.
So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details.
And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth. And they passed through you and me. And they passed through the detector.
(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that. One is the birth of my daughter. The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.
You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.
Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, for the past 23 years.
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time.
As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other.
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity. "It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.
For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21.
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, and a one.
That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom.
And that's preposterous.
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome." Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded.
Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone. And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you.
Sound is different. Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long. And that makes it really difficult -- in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about.
Your child's face.
Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds.
That's Alice talking.
That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob.
So, the same is true of gravitational waves.
We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.
But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling.
And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.
So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.
For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
AA: So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this:
[Whirring sound]
So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender.
AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide. Just imagine the power of that. It's fantastic. And we know it because we heard it.
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.
It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before.
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible.
And there's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle.
So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.
They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.
The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon.
We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- totally transparent.
The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.
With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined -- things that we'll only discover by listening.
And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect.
Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe.
They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology.
So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess.
AA: Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
Our job is to dream up and build new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories -- on the ground, in space.
I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Our job now is to dream big. Dream with us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.
Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world.
For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.
By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.
They can also autonomously build tensile structures.
Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world.
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.
Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight.
Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.
For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.
The only external commands are high-level ones such as "take off" and "land."
This is a so-called tail-sitter.
It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.
Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility.
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.
One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.
We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation.
The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time.
(Applause)
OK.
When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter.
For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?
Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm.
It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.
We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.
This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago.
It has only one moving part, a propeller.
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller.
Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.
Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right.
And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess.
What can you do with all this surplus?
The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.
As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.
This gives it an extraordinary capability.
It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating.
It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers.
Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.
Let's take a look.
(Applause)
If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.
This one wants to spin clockwise.
This other one wants to spin counterclockwise.
When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.
If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.
We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.
(Applause)
This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression.
We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms.
Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines.
That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
(Laughter)
The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology.
And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.
It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.
(Laughter)
And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.
And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news.
I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news.
But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive.
So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?" And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern environmental movement.
18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized.
And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space.
And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us.
One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky.
As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground.
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet.
That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized.
We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead.
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going to go through them all.
I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.
Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.
And you can see from this image that after World War II, the emission rates started really accelerating.
And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year.
Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth.
Now it's a big planet, but --
(Explosion sound)
that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.
And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.
Let's look at the atmosphere.
This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.
The white represents normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days.
But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.
And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days.
In the 90s, the curve shifted further.
And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days.
In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago.
So we're having record-breaking temperatures.
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century.
The hottest of all was last year.
Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average.
And for the first time, not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average.
These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems.
But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans.
And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters.
And this, too, is accelerating.
It goes back more than a century.
And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years. This has consequences.
The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger.
Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.
Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that.
Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey.
The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.
The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.
Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.
And it creates these atmospheric rivers.
The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers." And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.
This is from Montana.
Take a look at this storm last August.
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona. It literally splashes off the city.
These downpours are really unusual.
Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.
That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed.
These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.
This one is from Chile last year.
And you'll see that warehouse going by.
There are oil tankers cars going by.
This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.
Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.
(Laughter)
I mean, really.
The insurance industry has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up.
They're not under any illusions about what's happening.
And the causality requires a moment of discussion.
We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect -- one cause, one effect.
This is systemic causation.
As the great Kevin Trenberth says, "All storms are different now.
There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor.
Every storm is different now." So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now.
It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America.
There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.
More lightning, as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also.
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability.
The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War.
And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now.
The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees, food and water shortages and pandemic disease.
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.
But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.
The Zika epidemic now -- we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.
But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years -- that's something new, that ought to get our attention.
The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this a medical emergency now.
And there are many factors because of it.
This is also connected to the extinction crisis.
We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century.
And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day.
Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.
And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level.
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica.
The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.
When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk.
Number three: New York and Newark.
I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days.
And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey.
And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now.
Not with rain -- they call it "sunny-day flooding." It comes up through the storm sewers.
And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens.
This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day.
We have to move beyond partisanship.
And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans --
(Applause)
who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth about the climate crisis.
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.
It's an enormous burden.
I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy.
So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing.
If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.
Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars.
The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- unburnable.
Risk to the global economy.
That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative.
So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?" is yes, we have to change.
Second question, "Can we change?" This is the exciting news!
The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity.
We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.
We see an exponential curve for wind installations now.
We see the cost coming down dramatically.
Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind.
A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.
More good news: energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem.
With solar, the news is even more exciting!
The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010.
When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.
This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.
We're going to win this. We are going to prevail.
The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.
When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was.
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves.
(Applause)
And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years.
And it's continuing to come down.
Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing the grid parity point.
Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.
Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels.
That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius.
It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water.
And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.
This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector.
We are seeing an explosion of new investment.
Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils.
The gap has been growing ever since.
The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically.
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology?
Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.
In 1980, AT & amp; T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then. "How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.
McKinsey came back and said, "900,000." And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days.
And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.
And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.
So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?
I've asked that question myself, "Why?"
(Laughter)
And I think the answer is in three parts.
First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up.
And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid -- they leap-frogged to the new technology.
The big expansion has been in the developing counties.
So what about the electricity grids in the developing world?
Well, not so hot.
And in many areas, they don't exist.
There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America.
So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable.
Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
This is a village market.
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day.
And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.
It's actually a little bit less than an hour.
So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?" is clearly "Yes." And it's an ever-firmer "yes."
Last question, "Will we change?" Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot.
But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.
China has already announced that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.
They will likely link up with the European Union.
The United States has already been changing.
All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled. All of these existing coal plants were retired.
All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.
All of them -- canceled. We are moving forward. Last year -- if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar.
We are solving this crisis.
The only question is: how long will it take to get there?
So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change.
Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this.
Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world.
And so, I am extremely optimistic.
As I said before, we are going to win this.
I'll finish with this story.
When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years.
And I heard adults of that day and time say, "That's reckless, expensive, may well fail." But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.
Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.
We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced.
One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: "After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes', the future world depends." When the abolitionists started their movement, they met with no after no after no.
And then came a yes.
The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.
The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere.
After the final "no" comes a "yes."
When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.
Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this.
We have everything we need.
Some still doubt that we have the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills.
You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language.
No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing.
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.
Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris. But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it.
And that's the key to trying to communicate.
CA: So, your talk.
First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful.
How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed in the first part?
AG: I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years.
But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than.
Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.
(Laughter)
And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change.
We are regularly surprised by these developments.
The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said, "Things take longer to happen then you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could." I really think that's where we are.
Some people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now, meaning when it gets below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice.
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down.
And I just don't think it's going to work.
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party.
They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations.
(Laughter) And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request.
And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And they defeated the proposal.
So, finally, the answer to your question is, this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché, but 10 years ago -- and Christiana referred to this -- there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves.
And it didn't work out economically for some of them, but it kick-started this global revolution.
And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this.
But it matters a lot how fast we win it.
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.
If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, but you bring along people from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day -- boy, that's really exciting.
Thank you so much.
AG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED. Thank you!
What do you think when you look at me?
A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist.
Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true.
(Laughter)
If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.
That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me.
One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.
And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.
I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
(Laughter)
Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you.
Let me tell you who I am.
I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.
It was a choice.
When I was 17, I decided to come out.
No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.
My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.
I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.
I wrestled with the Quran.
I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed.
My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight.
It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran.
Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.
I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway?
That's how it feels.
And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.
(Laughter)
I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.
And then that terrible morning of September, 2001.
I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.
I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage.
Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear,
"... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God.
Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect.
That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school.
And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world.
And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."
I stayed inside all week.
And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship.
And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.
Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street.
Mosques were actually firebombed.
And I thought, we should just stay home.
And yet, something didn't feel right.
Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country.
I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.
I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough.
Today we hear people actually saying things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.
They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America.
And the only question is, are we malignant or benign?
You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.
The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.
Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?
It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement.
And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.
And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates.
So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque.
Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.
After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.
Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
(Applause)
Thank you.
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
(Applause)
Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.
But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book.
It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.
He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS.
And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble.
And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution.
What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.
He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world.
What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.
I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it impact ordinary Americans?
How does it impact everyone else?
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?
Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.
We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice.
One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.
Now, this isn't just academic.
When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.
It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected.
It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens.
Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine.
We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.
(Applause)
And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was in dental school, talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew.
She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed.
She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.
So, back to my story. What happened after 9 / 11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?
Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely.
So we decided to go to the mosque.
And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.
I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop.
The place was completely full.
And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.
(Applause)
I just break down at this time.
These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose? What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who say we are better than that?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary.
I'm not an exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as they come.
When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace.
So I am not in any way an exception.
When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it.
HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.
(Applause)
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ... not self-driving cars.
But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.
Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.
And if it had survived, the future of transportation would probably already be here.
So let me introduce you to the jitney.
In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.
He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.
Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.
He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel.
And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country.
And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ... 100 years later.
And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time.
They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.
And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.
And there were all kinds of regulations.
There were licenses -- often they were pricey.
In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney.
But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light -- install it in every Jitney -- to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.
(Laughter)
All right. So what happened? Well, within a year this thing had taken off.
But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.
That's unfortunate ... because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.
And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.
And that phenomenon had gone global.
In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.
Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.
In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic.
160 billion dollars in lost productivity, of course also sitting in traffic, and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.
Now, that's only four percent of our problem though.
Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.
And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel.
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.
That's the world we live in today.
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
It's called mass transit.
And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day. Why is that? Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep.
And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world.
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.
We didn't have any grand ambitions.
But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.
We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place.
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.
Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper — up to 50 percent cheaper — and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
And so the big question for us was: would it work?
Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it?
And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.
In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.
And the bright colors is where we have the most cars.
And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors.
More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road.
It looks like uberPOOL is working.
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago.
And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
But the part that I'm really --
(Applause)
But my favorite statistic -- remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day.
And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too. And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done." How do we get that to a million? And in China, well, that could be several million.
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.
But what about the suburbs?
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.
And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work.
So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars -- and literally there's tens of millions of them -- how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.
You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver.
And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing.
There's just one hitch ... it's called regulation.
So 54 cents a mile, what is that?
Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.
You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less.
But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.
But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?
And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?
If we could, it's obviously something we should do.
And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.
If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going.
How would our cities be different today?
Would we have parks in the place of parking lots?
Well, we lost that chance.
But technology has given us another opportunity.
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality?
With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
Travis Kalanick: Thank you.
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.
You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool.
But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds.
So first of all, last week I think it was, I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app.
You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.
TK: Sure.
CA: How did it go?
Did you notice other people not finding the app that day?
Are you going to win people over for this redesign?
TK: Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish.
And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense.
Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars.
It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class. And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car.
And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors.
And to be more iconic, because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit, and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.
And so that was a little bit what it was about.
Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got -- you know, you're a little worried.
What we saw is a lot of people -- actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it.
And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.
CA: OK, that's cool.
Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.
Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way, believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth, is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor, which you've certainly proved to be.
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know -- like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.
How did it feel like inside the company during that period?
Did you notice a loss of business?
Did you learn anything from that?
TK: Well, look, I think -- I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have -- In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us, it was about a year and a half ago, and for us it was hard times, too.
Now, inside, we felt like -- I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident.
And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of -- We'd gone from a very small company -- I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500.
And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time.
And make sure that people are constantly checking to say, "Are we good people doing good work?" And if you check those boxes, the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story.
And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger.
But it was certainly a difficult period.
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn, you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time.
Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely -- they claim -- barely afford the deal anymore.
How -- You know, you said that you started this originally -- just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride.
This thing's taken off, you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point.
You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global visionary who's changing the world. I mean -- who are you? Do you want that? Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --
(Laughter)
First is on the pricing side -- I mean, keep in mind, right?
UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.
It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi.
And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.
And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off, they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.
And so what that means is more trips per hour, more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually, earnings come up.
And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time.
So even in New York -- We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" -- compare the earnings September after September after September.
Same month every year.
And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down.
And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever.
And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop, we bring the prices back up.
So that addresses that first part.
And then the enigma and all of this -- I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.
And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor. You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor.
And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them.
But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor.
CA: In a couple years' time -- say five years' time, I don't know when -- you roll out your incredible self-driving cars, at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride.
What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
TK: Explain that again -- at which time?
CA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming --
TK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.
CA: What do you say to a driver?
TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take — it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect. That's part one.
Part two is it's going to also take -- there's going to be a long transition.
These cars will work in certain places and not in others.
For us it's an interesting challenge, right?
Because, well -- Google's been investing in this since 2007, Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it, the manufacturers are going to be doing it.
This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason.
A million people die a year in cars.
And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.
And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety-ridden.
So I think there's a lot of good.
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one for optimistic leadership, Where instead of resisting -- resisting technology, maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry -- we have to embrace it or be a part of the future.
But how do we optimistically lead through it?
Are there ways to partner with cities?
Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc., for that transition period.
It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect, especially that transition period.
But it is a world that's going to exist, and it is going to be a better world.
CA: Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly.
Thank you so much. TK: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free.
A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.
By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.
Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement.
But there were daunting challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive.
I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We did condom demonstrations.
We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was.
But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier.
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.
I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.
And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS.
And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive.
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism.
Whites were largely unscathed.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners.
Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.
I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population.
I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research.
So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS.
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginal ization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more. It was true of AIDS.
It was true just recently of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent.
We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together.
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.
I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable.
And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health.
But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short.
That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman.
And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.
New York City's not exceptional.
These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death.
There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word "racism" in our research and our work.
You've probably felt something every time I've said it.
Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality.
And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.
(Applause)
I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale.
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff.
And he buys a piece of art that I made.
And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps.
So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.
Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired.
As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?" And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place." And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!" What do you do?
We've all been there, right?
Do I offer to host this guy?
But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.
That's a small trunk!
So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room." And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"
That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done?
There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.
What if he's psychotic?" My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.
It turns out he was not psychotic.
We've kept in touch ever since.
And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.
This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered.
The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.
So now it's two years later. I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.
And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out.
And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.
So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning. Ha!"
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.
But they loved it, and so did we.
I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.
We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other.
Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent? The wheels had started to turn.
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder.
And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.
Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.
And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.
It's going to be huge!"
(Laughter)
We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. It did not. No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes. Why? Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.
Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design.
In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.
We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met.
Could design make that happen?
Is it possible to design for trust?
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve.
I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone. If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
OK, I need you to take out your phones. Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone.
Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.
(Laughter)
That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --
(Laughter)
is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?
Most of us feel really responsible.
That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.
And it's because of this that our company can even exist.
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
(Laughter)
Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
OK, you can hand your phones back now.
So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.
What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment?
What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
(Laughter)
Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?
It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
And we didn't actually get it right the first time.
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.
We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willing ness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us.
The more different somebody is, the less we trust them.
Now, that's a natural social bias.
But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.
Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you've got more than 10, everything changes.
High reputation beats high similarity.
The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure.
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down.
And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother,"
(Laughter)
acceptance rates also go down.
But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place.
Coming for vacation with my family. "So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
There's three things happening here.
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
The second is the efforts of our team.
And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
Now, things have been going pretty well.
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes.
Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone.
I was at the front lines of trust breaking.
And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them.
And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.
Turns out, people are justified in their trust.
And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack.
The host rushed him to the hospital.
They donated their own blood for his operation.
Let me read you his review.
(Laughter)
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.
The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.
(Laughter)
Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you.
They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.
They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.
And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommended!"
(Applause)
Of course, not every stay is like that. But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.
Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up.
How do sharing and transactions go together?
So let's be clear; it is about commerce.
But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete.
The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.
People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic.
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences?
What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.
Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?
I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this.
They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents.
They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms. And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups.
Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs.
Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.
We didn't invent anything new.
Hospitality has been around forever.
There's been many other websites like ours.
So, why did ours eventually take off?
Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that.
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias.
And that's amazing to me. It blows my mind.
I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.
Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.
But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
Thank you.
(Applause)
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid.
I ran for Congress.
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run.
The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.
She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.
But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo.
The polls, however, told a very different story.
My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win.
But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.
I swore I was going to win.
I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.
I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running.
But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes.
Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure.
Nor is it about leaning in.
I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect.
And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why.
Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.
We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's.
Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.
And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk.
They're rewarded for it.
It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.
In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave.
Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave.
The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look.
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them.
She found that bright girls were quick to give up.
The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.
Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge.
They found it energizing.
They were more likely to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability.
The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge.
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence.
But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers.
And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave.
Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure.
Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection.
We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect.
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story.
During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor.
If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen.
But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.
She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right.
Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust.
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code.
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students.
When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something wrong with me." We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone.
Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.
I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day.
Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming.
Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls.
Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer.
These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance.
And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams.
And those dreams have never been more important for our country.
For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population.
We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now.
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old.
We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous.
And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision.
Tell me how it's going.
How many girls are involved now in your program?
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
(Applause) This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states. And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7, 500 women in computer science.
Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly.
CA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming graduates from your program?
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there.
And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.
CA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams, good things happen.
RS: Great things happen.
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.
Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men.
We own the Internet, and we should be building the companies of tomorrow.
And I think when companies have diverse teams, and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things, and we see it every day.
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work.
This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you.
There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European.
In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
There are just so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet -- we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees.
What are we doing? How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.
Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution.
But today, that system is failing.
In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from.
But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong. It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee regime actually work?
But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee.
So imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira. And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble.
And so Amira can't go back there.
But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.
Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.
There's restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years.
It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.
But there, there's great difficulty as well.
Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
They don't usually get significant access to assistance.
And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.
Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
But I think it's a false choice.
I think we can reconsider that choice.
The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not.
Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.
We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But they don't have to. They can contribute.
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves.
And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.
All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries. It's not. It's exceptional. Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community.
In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.
Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films.
He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that.
We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken.
Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment. So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria?
We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing.
It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.
(Applause)
The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match.
Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.
The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.
So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all.
So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.
Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable.
It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described.
But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities?
They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe.
It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.
It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.
And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
There is a historical precedent for it as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy.
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.
They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not going to go away.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.
A room like this, nonetheless.
With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention.
(Laughter)
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability.
And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could.
I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early.
And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.
And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot.
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself. It would be hard --
(Laughter)
but I knew I could do it.
(Laughter)
But planning time was over now. It was 11: 50pm. We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.
So every faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives -- or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them --
(Laughter)
took first position in front of the altar.
You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.
And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her.
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the prayers got louder.
And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still.
And the organ rolled on in to add the dirge.
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.
And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field.
My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.
And then a voice rang out above us: "Amen."
It was over. I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now.
But I was upset on their behalf.
They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them.
I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could.
I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot-inducing baptism pool. I had believed. Now what?
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world.
It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones.
(Laughter)
And this made me feel even more ridiculous -- hurt, really.
But there on that night, I did not stop believing.
I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth.
And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
(Laughter)
So hopeful --
(Laughter)
that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again.
(Laughter)
But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America." But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me.
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power.
But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead.
And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die.
So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School --
(Laughter)
this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.
The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: "What if we took a road trip?"
(Laughter)
We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country.
So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow.
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line.
And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
(Laughter)
And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today.
It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning. It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help.
But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it.
There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time.
But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today.
It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars.
We looked over all that we had made, and it was good.
(Laughter)
But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day.
All of them lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day.
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver.
He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources.
He told me that he would take any help that he could get.
And I was there as that help.
But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day.
And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again.
I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled.
But this time, the false savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started.
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief -- no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth.
And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation.
But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time.
So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line.
I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact.
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question, "Why?" With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business.
We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply, very simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
In case you are wondering, no, I'm not wearing a dress, and no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.
(Laughter)
This is a gho. This is my national dress.
This is how all men dress in Bhutan.
That is how our women dress.
Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show off our legs.
(Laughter)
Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country.
Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique, and this is what I'd like to speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral.
But before I proceed, I should set you the context.
I should tell you our story.
Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas.
We've been called Shangri-La, even the last Shangri-La.
But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La.
My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks.
(Laughter)
The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth, China and India.
The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country doing our best to survive.
But we are doing OK. We are surviving. In fact, we are thriving, and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed with extraordinary kings.
Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance.
We call this holistic approach to development "Gross National Happiness," or GNH.
Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan, Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.
(Applause)
Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people.
But that's easier said than done, especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.
Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars.
I know that some of you here are worth more --
(Laughter)
individually than the entire economy of my country.
So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting.
Education is completely free.
All citizens are guaranteed free school education, and those that work hard are given free college education.
Healthcare is also completely free.
Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines: they are all provided by the state.
We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully, and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH, which is development with values.
Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it.
Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment.
Today, our culture is flourishing.
We continue to celebrate our art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries.
And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too.
This is why I can wear my gho with pride.
Here's a fun fact: you're looking at the world's biggest pocket.
(Laughter)
It starts here, goes around the back, and comes out from inside here.
In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads, office files and books.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But sometimes -- sometimes even precious cargo.
So our culture is flourishing, but so is our environment.
72 percent of my country is under forest cover.
Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time.
(Applause)
Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us.
Incidentally, our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us.
You see, we the people didn't want democracy.
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it, and we certainly didn't fight for it.
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution.
But he went further.
He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings, and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of 65.
Fact is, we already have a king in retirement: our previous king, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity.
He was all of 51 years at that time.
So as I was saying, 72 percent of our country is under forest cover, and all that forest is pristine.
That's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world, and that's why we are a carbon neutral country.
In a world that is threatened with climate change, we are a carbon neutral country.
Turns out, it's a big deal.
Of the 200-odd countries in the world today, it looks like we are the only one that's carbon neutral.
Actually, that's not quite accurate.
Bhutan is not carbon neutral.
Bhutan is carbon negative.
Our entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year.
But that's not all.
(Applause)
We export most of the renewable electricity we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.
So today, the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.
And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential, and that's exactly what we are working at, the clean, green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.
So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink.
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.
And this is important stuff.
You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality.
Climate change is affecting my country.
Our glaciers are melting, causing flash floods and landslides, which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country.
I was at that lake recently. It's stunning. That's how it looked 10 years ago, and that's how it looked 20 years ago.
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.
It was a solid glacier.
A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
That destruction was caused by one glacier lake.
We have 2,700 of them to contend with.
The point is this: my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences.
And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous, it is very difficult.
But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing.
We will fight climate change.
That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.
We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody noticed.
Governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change, that when a small country raised our hands and announced, "We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time," nobody heard us. Nobody cared.
Last December in Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come.
This time, we were heard.
We were noticed, and everybody cared.
What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change, and were willing to come together and act together and work together.
All countries, from the very small to the very large, committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept, we'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees Celsius.
By the way, I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame.
It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments.
As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral.
Here are some of the ways we are doing it.
We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.
The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food.
We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles.
Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights, and our entire government is trying to go paperless.
We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program, and we are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program.
But it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy.
Our protected areas are our carbon sink.
They are our lungs.
Today, more than half our country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.
But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors.
Now, what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country.
Take this tiger, for example.
It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level in the hot, subtropical jungles.
Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains.
Isn't that awesome?
(Applause)
We must keep it that way.
We must keep our parks awesome.
So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in our parks, and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change, and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
But that is expensive. Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment.
In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.
But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards.
This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life.
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.
It gives us breathing room.
It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government can take over on our own fully.
The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors, corporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed.
So multiparty, single closing: an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.
This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan.
It's something like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake.
Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund to protect our parks, giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period.
After that, our government guarantees full funding forever.
We are almost there. We expect to close later this year.
Naturally, I'm pretty excited.
(Applause)
The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey, and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan and across the world.
(Applause)
Whew, it is getting warm in here.
I thank you for listening to our story, a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral, a story of how we are keeping our country pristine, for ourselves, our children, for your children and for the world.
But we are not here to tell stories, are we?
We are here to dream together.
So in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have.
What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time.
After all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face.
They too have natural resources that can help win the world's fight for sustainability, only they may not have the ability to invest in them now.
So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?
I invite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planet's future.
After all, we're here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to protect our planet together.
Because the reality is we are in it together.
Some of us might dress differently, but we are in it together.
Thank you very much, and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
The following are my opinions, and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office.
(Laughter)
I am a prosecutor. I believe in law and order.
I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.
I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities.
I love my job and the people that do it.
I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better.
By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?
(Laughter)
All right.
How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight -- yes, even with a sibling?
Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions?
How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?
(Laughter)
Point taken.
When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.
But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part.
I went to law school to make money.
I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.
Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime.
My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.
I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: "Not guilty." They were predominately black and brown.
And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.
They were predominately white.
As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here?
I wanted to know their stories.
And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that.
That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense.
Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any.
My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.
Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.
And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom.
Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.
(Applause)
My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help.
They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help.
They were in need of our assistance.
But we weren't giving them any.
Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them.
The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.
The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.
The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor.
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.
We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.
We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color.
And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms.
But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.
When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things.
We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison.
We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.
In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.
He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school.
He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school.
In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.
This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.
The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.
But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.
I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk.
And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands.
I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life.
Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer.
For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent.
Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless.
History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary.
We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.
We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities.
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.
They have little appreciation for what we can do.
Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today.
With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.
Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.
The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system, the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all at tremendous social cost to his children, to his family and to his peers.
And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.
When I came out of law school, I did the same thing as everybody else.
I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice, but I never learned what justice was in my classes -- none of us do.
None of us do.
And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system.
Our power is virtually boundless.
In most cases, not the judge, not the police, not the legislature, not the mayor, not the governor, not the President can tell us how to prosecute our cases.
The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine.
I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony, for a misdemeanor, or at all.
I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial, and ultimately, I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail.
These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered, and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions.
One night this past summer, I was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city.
As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth, as you do as public servant --
I noticed across the room, a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me.
And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where, and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me.
And thanking me. "You cared about me, and you changed my life." It was Christopher.
See, I never arraigned Christopher.
He never faced a judge or a jail, he never had a criminal record.
Instead, I worked with Christopher; first on being accountable for his actions, and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend.
We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to Best Buy, and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn't recover.
Christopher did community service.
He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community.
He applied to college, he obtained financial aid, and he went on to graduate from a four-year school.
(Applause)
After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag, to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston.
Christopher had accomplished -- and making a lot more money than me --
(Laughter)
He had accomplished all of this in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court.
I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success, but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.
There are thousands of Christophers out there, some locked in our jails and prisons.
We need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them.
An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one.
It's a bigger win for all of us.
In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher makes perfect sense.
When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court, I didn't see a criminal standing there.
I saw myself -- a young person in need of intervention.
As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens, I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system.
Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney, my supervisor and judges, I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them.
And that's how we do it in Boston.
We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job.
Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager, we secured mental health treatment and community supervision.
A runaway girl who was arrested for prostituting, to survive on the streets, needed a safe place to live and grow -- something we could help her with.
I even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school, that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack, he put a loaded 9-millimeter.
We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.
Which is the better way to spend our time?
How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs?
Why are we spending 80 billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing, when we could take that money and reallocate it into education, into mental health treatment, into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?
(Applause)
So why should this matter to you?
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money. Our money. It costs 109,000 dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year, with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system.
That is a terrible return on investment.
Number two: it's the right thing to do.
If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem, it's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us.
And number three: your voice and your vote can make that happen.
The next time there's a local district attorney's election in your jurisdiction, ask candidates these questions.
One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer?
Two: What data are you collecting, and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it's working?
And number three: If it's not working for everybody, what are you doing to fix it?
If they can't answer the questions, they shouldn't be doing the job.
Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity, of intervention, of support and of love.
While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever malfeasances you committed, barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today -- some of the greatest minds on the planet.
Every day, thousands of times a day, prosecutors around the United States wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, intervention, support and yes, even love.
Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community, and a strong community is a safe one.
If our communities are broken, don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail, not putting them in.
Demand better. You deserve it, your children deserve it, the people who are tied up in the system deserve it, but most of all, the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.
We must, we must do better.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
In India, we have these huge families.
I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.
Which means that there are a lot of family events.
So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.
But the one thing that I always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins.
And there was always this one uncle who used to be there, always ready, jumping around with us, having games for us, making us kids have the time of our lives.
This man was extremely successful: he was confident and powerful.
But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system, which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult.
My uncle started using a walker to walk, and to take a turn, he literally had to take one step at a time, like this, and it took forever.
So this person, who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering, was suddenly hiding behind people.
He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
And he's not the only one in the world.
Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, and this number is only rising.
As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems, one solution that solves it all, but it need not always be like that.
You can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact.
So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's, but to make their everyday tasks much more simple, and then make an impact.
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?
My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment, so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
It works just purely on its form.
The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors, and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.
But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.
It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person, and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.
So, well, one problem solved, many more to go.
All this while, I was interviewing him, questioning him, and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information, or just answers to my questions.
But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.
So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks, while he's eating, while he's watching TV.
And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table, it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land, how does he climb a staircase?
Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries.
One actually has to climb the stairs.
So he told me, "Well, let me show you how I do it." Let's take a look at what I saw.
So he took really long to reach this position, and then all this while, I'm thinking, "Oh my God, is he really going to do it?
Is he really, really going to do it without his walker? "And then...
(Laughter)
And the turns, he took them so easily.
So -- shocked? Well, I was too. So this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.
There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker, but the moment he's put on a cycle, all his symptoms vanish, because it is a continuous motion.
So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land.
And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him, but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
He walked faster, right?
(Applause)
I call this the staircase illusion, and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze, and this is called freezing of gait.
So it happens a lot, so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms, making them feel much more confident?
You know, technology is not always it.
What we need are human-centered solutions.
I could have easily made it into a projection, or a Google Glass, or something like that.
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.
This print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome.
What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient feel like my uncle felt that day.
He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.
"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech, and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day.
But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective?
All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity, to go out there, observe.
But let's not stop at that.
Let's find these complex problems.
Don't be scared of them.
Break them, boil them down into much smaller problems, and then find simple solutions for them.
Test these solutions, fail if needed, but with newer insights to make it better.
Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions.
What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions?
Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski.
She's a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting, because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored, about the size of the palm of my hand.
It was just lying on the surface.
LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts.
But that night, back at camp ...
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.
Maybe it's a preservation thing, but it looks really like ... bone.
LN: Huh. So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone, most of them really tiny.
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.
It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But it was challenging.
(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
(Laughter)
LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
LN: How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way?
Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.
LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been either of those.
It was just too big.
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge.
It's a really big animal.
LN: So what animal could it be?
Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, and they had an idea.
(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
And usually, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting." It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.
So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel.
(Laughter)
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.
LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one.
However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.
So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.
(Audience reacts)
Yeah. Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
(Laughter)
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.
(Laughter) (Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)
They started here. For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.
You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.
So those ones you probably would not recognize.
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?
LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.
And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.
So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.
Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.
Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over.
You'd have blizzards.
You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.
Like, how ... How?
How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?
(Laughter)
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's kind of brilliant.
What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter?
What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat --
(Laughter)
was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce?
And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?
Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body.
So it helps heat dissipate easier.
It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.
But I love it for a totally different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.
So I was trained as a historian.
And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.
And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right?
That's a great story!
It's totally adapted for that.
Clearly, it always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.
You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does.
And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.
It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere.
(Applause)
This is Azuri. Azuri, hi, how are you doing?
OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
(Laughter)
So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall.
(Laughter)
That's not even a joke. Anyway --
But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one.
It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.
(Laughter)
Right, Azuri?
And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit.
And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
(Laughter)
And I went on the road as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.
And by the end of my 20s, I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain. What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complained.
They supported me all the way through it.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, he's taking a gap decade."
(Laughter)
And — There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about.
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I was visiting my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was quiet, too quiet. Something was wrong. And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?" And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you." And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republicans?"
(Laughter)
Now, the truth is, I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.
But I had a bit of an epiphany, and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.
You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism, and I want to tell you why that is.
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty.
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.
That's not even close.
The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.
And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.
It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it.
It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.
Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid? Or to people just like him all over the world?
And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people?
Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
But here's the truth.
Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.
From 1970 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation, that percentage has declined by 80 percent.
There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid.
And I didn't even know about it.
This, my friends, that's a miracle.
That's something we ought to celebrate.
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind, and it happened in our lifetimes.
(Applause)
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, have been pulled out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.
And I went in search of an answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know what, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center.
And here it is. Here are the reasons.
There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.
Number one: globalization.
Number two: free trade.
Number three: property rights.
Number four: rule of law.
Number five: entrepreneurship.
It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did that.
Now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world.
But that is great.
And that's beyond politics.
Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
At its best, it's about aspiration, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system.
And we've got to share it with more people.
Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home.
The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions out of poverty."
Who said it? It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan. Wrong. President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he said it to me. Crazy. And I said, "Hallelujah." But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of 2015.
And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What? It's coming together around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us the most.
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polarization.
It's risen to critical, crisis levels. It's unpleasant. It's not right.
There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West.
And it was an article in 2014 on political motive asymmetry. What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate.
It's common in world conflict.
You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry.
A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate. Think about it. Think about it. Most people are walking around saying, "You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me." You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry. It's impossible.
How do we solve it? Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really naïve. There's a lot of good research on this.
A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He's a psychology professor at New York University.
He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ.
And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important.
For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.
And conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences, right? We'll never come together. Wrong. That is diversity in which lies our strength.
Remember what pulled up the poor.
It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm. How are we going to get that? It's a tricky thing, isn't it. We need innovative thinking.
A lot of it's on this stage. Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal. We need investment overseas in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But you know what we really need?
We need a new day in flexible ideology. We need to be less predictable. Don't we? Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable? Kinda conventional? Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you? Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.
And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality. Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you.
But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today, those are distractions.
We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.
That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it.
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me. Number one. Action item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.
It's not good enough.
We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools. Now, what are you going to do?
We're blessed with leadership. When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology, then maybe people will listen.
Maybe progress will start at that point.
That's number one. Number two. Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines, who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.
If you're a conservative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly.
If we do that, we get two things.
Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get. And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hannah is excited to be going to college.
She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house, to prove to them that she's an adult, and to prove to her new friends that she belongs.
She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on. Let's call him Mike.
The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache. She can only remember the night in flashes.
But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her, wanting it to stop, then shakily stumbling home.
She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"
One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States.
Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police.
And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.
Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.
But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties, she's worried about them.
After graduation, Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.
And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders.
But with such low reporting rates, it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported, much less anything happen if they are.
In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison.
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.
This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States.
Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.
I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.
So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.
So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago, it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.
And so we did.
We started by talking to college survivors.
And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple; they wanted a website, one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options, with the ability to electronically report their assault, rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them.
With the option to create a secure, timestamped document of what happened to them, preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.
And lastly, and perhaps most critically, with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant.
You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.
It changes the way you frame your own experience, it changes the way you think about your perpetrator, it means that if you do come forward, you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.
We created a website that actually does this and we launched it [...] in August, on two college campuses.
And we included a unique matching system where if Mike's first victim had come forward, saved her record, entered into the matching system and named Mike, and Mike's second victim had done the same thing a few months later, they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up.
If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers, it's more likely that they would have reported, that they would have been believed, and that Mike would have been kicked off campus, gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.
And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place.
We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.
And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault, for perhaps the first time, maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.
The type of system I'm describing, the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow, meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, such as a match.
The application that we built is for college campuses.
But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace.
We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it.
We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable, where survivors get the support and justice they deserve, where the authorities get the information they need, and where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers.
Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know --
(Laughter)
you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.
(Laughter)
And I would want to do that like that.
That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.
(Laughter)
And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project.
So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
This is how the year would go.
So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase.
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff.
So we had an awesome new revised plan.
(Laughter)
And then --
(Laughter)
But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here.
And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks.
And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.
I thought that was the end of everything.
But a week later I get a call, and it's the school.
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah." And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis." And I say, "OK." And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen."
(Laughter)
That did not happen.
(Laughter)
It was a very, very bad thesis.
(Laughter)
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
(Laughter)
No, no, it was very, very bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are.
Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people.
And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them.
I actually brought them here to show you today.
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
(Laughter)
Now... here's my brain.
(Laughter)
There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened.
(Laughter)
Then --
Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.
(Laughter)
"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!" (Sigh)
Now, what is going on here?
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success!
(Laughter)
And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK.
But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
We can visualize the future.
We can see the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of that into account.
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture.
And that's when we have a conflict.
And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
I call it the Dark Playground.
(Laughter)
Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings.
And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster.
(Laughter)
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence.
And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk.
(Laughter)
Now, of course, I said yes.
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
(Laughter)
(Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
We need to sit down and work on this right now." And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."
(Laughter)
So that's what we did that day.
(Laughter)
As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers.
And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me.
And guess who woke up?
(Laughter)
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
(Laughter)
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree!
And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.
Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages.
And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
When I did, I was amazed by the response.
Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things.
These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students.
(Laughter)
And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem too." But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails.
These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them.
And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines.
And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going.
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever.
And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
It's usually suffered quietly and privately.
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place.
It's not that they're cramming for some project.
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives.
The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.
Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,
(Laughter)
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this a Life Calendar.
That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
That's a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
(Laughter)
You know. Sometime soon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers.
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up.
And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.
And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes, "Keep going.
I'm with you. "But of course his eyes were glazed over, and the moment was dead.
Meanwhile across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group.
He was swiping through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking.
And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together.
See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire.
And that's exactly what tools should do, I think. They should extend our bodies. And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way.
You're hunched over these rectangles, fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.
And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world.
We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them.
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here.
It's called the Meta 2. Let's try it out. Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.
And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We're going to come back to this in just a bit.
(Applause)
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a few.
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2D floor plans.
She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor.
This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.
And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, courtesy of UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story -- a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around.
Now... in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.
We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world.
Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information.
And that's what I'm very passionate about.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years -- this is not the smallest device -- in about five years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms.
And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.
And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface.
And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windows scares me.
(Laughter)
To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.
And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."
At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms.
In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience.
First and foremost, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they take your brain extra steps to decode them.
We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.
You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for -- or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
(Laughter)
Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second interface guideline we call "touch to see." What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?
They try and reach out and touch it.
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.
Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception -- that's the sense of our body parts in space.
So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more deeply.
Hence, touch to see.
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We're inherently these social primates.
And this leads me to our third guideline, the holographic campfire from our first story.
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk.
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connecting.
My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, reminding me that I am the operating system.
And now my proprioception is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call -- Ray?
(Ringing)
Hey Ray, how's it going?
Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
And he is photo-realistic.
(Applause)
Thank you.
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long.
Ray, how's it going?
Ray: Great. We're live today.
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier.
Guys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collaborate.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray: You're welcome.
(Applause)
MG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens.
It's right here, inside of us.
(Applause)
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future, it's right here in 2016.
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta, including the administrative staff, the executives, the designers, the engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing, because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there.
And there's sometimes a debate among technologists about, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen?
There's this issue of field of view, that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses.
Were we seeing the real deal there?
MG: Absolutely the real deal.
Not only that, we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here.
We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glasses, and not cut any corners.
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
In 1962 at Rice University, JFK told the country about a dream he had, a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. The eponymous moonshot.
No one knew if it was possible to do but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible.
That's how great dreams are.
Great dreams aren't just visions, they're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.
I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory.
At X -- formerly called Google X -- you'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts.
These inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies that we hope can make the world a wonderful place.
We use the word "moonshots" to remind us to keep our visions big -- to keep dreaming.
And we use the word "factory" to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions -- concrete plans to make them real.
Here's our moonshot blueprint. Number one: we want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people.
Number two: we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.
And then number three: there has to be some reason to believe that the technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.
But I have a secret for you.
The moonshot factory is a messy place.
But rather than avoid the mess, pretend it's not there, we've tried to make that our strength.
We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we're wrong.
That's it, that's the secret.
Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first.
Get excited and cheer, "Hey! How are we going to kill our project today?"
We've got this interesting balance going where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions. But then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism to breathe life, breathe reality into those visions.
I want to show you a few of the projects that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor, and also a few of the gems that at least so far, have not only survived that process, but have been accelerated by it.
Last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming.
This is some of the lettuce that we grew.
One in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment.
So this is a moonshot that needs to happen.
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming.
And because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed, you don't have to transport it large distances.
We made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting.
But unfortunately, we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way.
So we killed the project.
Here's another huge problem. We pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide.
Economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure. The radical solution? A lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship.
This has the potential to lower, at least overall, the cost, time and carbon footprint of shipping without needing runways.
We came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs that together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough that we could actually make these ships -- inexpensively enough in volume.
But however cheap they would have been to make in volume it turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars to design and build the first one.
200 million dollars is just way too expensive.
Because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs, we can't spend 200 million dollars to get the first data point about whether we're on the right track or not.
If there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects, we want to know it now, up front, not way down the road.
So we killed this project, too.
Discovering a major flaw in a project doesn't always mean that it ends the project.
Sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path.
This is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype, which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal.
But that wasn't actually our goal when we started.
With 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year, building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take.
Three and a half years ago, when we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing, they were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers to find out what they thought of the experience.
And what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan.
It wasn't safe because the users didn't do their job.
They didn't stay alert in case the car needed to hand control back to them.
This was a major crisis for the team. It sent them back to the drawing board.
And they came up with a beautiful, new perspective.
Aim for a car where you're truly a passenger.
You tell the car where you want to go, you push a button and it takes you from point A to point B by itself.
We're really grateful that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did.
And it's shaped everything we've done since then.
And now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles, and they're out everyday on the streets of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas.
The cars team shifted their perspective.
This is one of X's mantras. Sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.
Take wind energy. It's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting.
There's no way that we're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry.
But we found a way to get up higher into the sky, and so get access to faster, more consistent winds, and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there.
Our Makani energy kite rises up from its perch by spinning up those propellers along its wing. And it pulls out a tether as it rises, pulling energy up through the tether.
Once the tether's all the way out, it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.
And now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines.
And that sends energy back down the tether.
We haven't yet found a way to kill this project. And the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world.
Probably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon.
We're trying to make balloon-powered Internet.
A network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world.
This could bring online as many as four billion more people, who today have little or no internet connection.
But you can't just take a cell tower, strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky.
The winds are too strong, it would be blown away. And the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground.
Here comes the crazy moment.
What if, instead, we let the balloons drift and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go?
It turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata.
So we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world, we could maneuver the balloons a bit, getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds.
The idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area, there's another balloon ready to float into place, handing off the internet connection, just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway.
We get how crazy that vision sounds -- there's the name of the project to remind us of that.
So since 2012, the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project.
The first thing that they did was try to get a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere down to an antenna on the ground. It worked. And I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to.
So we kept going.
Could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets, so that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver? Yeah.
Could we get the balloon band width high enough so it was a real Internet connection?
So that people could have something more than just SMS?
The early tests weren't even a megabit per second, but now we can do up to 15 megabits per second.
Enough to watch a TED Talk.
Could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas? Check.
Could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than 100 days, while costing less than five percent of what traditional, long-life balloons have cost to make? Yes. In the end. But I promise you, you name it, we had to try it to get there.
We made round, silvery balloons.
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons. We made balloons the size of a blue whale.
We busted a lot of balloons.
(Laughter)
Since one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky, one of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon.
So there are two compartments here, one with air and then one with helium.
The balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier, or lets air out to make it lighter.
And these weight changes allow it to rise or fall, and that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism.
It floats up or down, hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants.
But is that good enough for it to navigate through the world?
Barely at first, but better all the time.
This particular balloon, our latest balloon, can navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky and can sail itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go from 20,000 kilometers away.
We have lots more to do in terms of fine-tuning the system and reducing costs.
But last year, a balloon built inexpensively went around the world 19 times over 187 days.
So we're going to keep going.
(Applause)
Our balloons today are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do.
We're in discussions with telcos around the world, and we're going to fly over places like Indonesia for real service testing this year.
This probably all sounds too good to be true, and you're right.
Being audacious and working on big, risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable.
You cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast. People resist. They worry. "What will happen to me if I fail?
Will people laugh at me?
Will I be fired?"
I started with our secret.
I'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen.
The only way to get people to work on big, risky things -- audacious ideas -- and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first, is if you make that the path of least resistance for them.
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.
Teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they're rewarded for it. They get applause from their peers.
Hugs and high fives from their manager, me in particular.
They get promoted for it.
We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects, from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30.
We believe in dreams at the moonshot factory.
But enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism.
It's optimism's perfect partner.
It unlocks the potential in every idea.
We can create the future that's in our dreams.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Thousands of years from now, we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time -- the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space, interacting with technology as if we were machines; a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated, were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen.
Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens.
What happened to interacting with each other?
I don't know about you, but I feel limited inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels.
And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator.
Put simply: I want to create a new reality, a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other, a reality where people, not devices, are the center of everything.
I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel; a reality where technology no longer gets in our way, but instead embraces who we are.
I dream of technology on a human path.
We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people, products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.
This is the next step in the evolution.
This is Microsoft HoloLens, the first fully untethered holographic computer.
Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content right into our world, enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.
Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future.
I'm talking about today.
We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens; universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn; and my personal favorite, NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically.
Now, this is important.
By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing.
Put it this way: temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms.
We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.
Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day.
And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us.
Now, as I put this HoloLens on, let me explain the setup a little bit.
It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens, and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED.
Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage, just as clearly as I can see all of you.
Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors.
So let's start our journey.
And what better place to begin our journey, than in the computer cave of 2D.
Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens, and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.
The computer universe is both marvel ous and primitive.
It's a universe based on causality.
As developers, we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects.
Double click on an icon, that's a cause. Open an application, that's an effect.
Now when we compare this to our physical universe, it is overly constraining, because our universe is not digital.
Our universe is analog.
Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one, true or false, or black or white.
We exist in a world governed by quantum physics, a universe of zero and one both at the same time, a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray.
You can see how these two worlds collide.
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life?
We see screens from the moment we wake up, to the moment we fall asleep. Why?
I think it's because computers give us superpowers.
Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time.
It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment, productivity or communication.
Think of it this way: let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television.
This is theater -- time and space displaced.
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk, I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. That's displacement of space.
Now, these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations of our current digital world.
But what if we didn't have to?
What if we could have these same digital powers in our world?
You can already see glimmers of this, but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology.
It's remarkable to dream of this world, a world where technology truly understands us -- where we live, work and communicate -- with tools that enhance the human experience, not machines that limit our humanity.
So how do we get there? For me, the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective.
It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine.
If you're a machine trying to sense our world, how would you actually break the problem down?
You'd probably try to classify things as a human, an environment or an object.
But how would that machine then interact with reality?
And I can think of three ways.
First, as a machine, I would observe or I would input reality.
Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective.
Secondly, as a machine, I could place digital information, or output information, into reality.
Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective.
Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics.
Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object, or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force.
With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix.
Now here's a secret: as an engineer, I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix.
From self-driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head, machines are becoming capable of understanding our world.
And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways.
Now, imagine having granular control over everything in the world.
Move the dial one way, and you get reality. Move the dial the other way, and you get virtual reality.
Now, imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds.
I love it down here.
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves.
When technology truly understands our world, it will again transform the ways we interact, the ways we work and the ways we play.
Less than half a century ago, two courageous men landed on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets.
Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy, black-and-white televisions. And the world? The world was mesmerized.
Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world.
We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist.
And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future.
In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far, let's try doing something else even more crazy.
I invite you to experience, for the first time anywhere in the world, here on the TED stage, a real-life holographic teleportation, between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?
(Applause)
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.
I'm standing in a room across the street, while I'm standing on this stage with you, while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.
AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy! Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from?
JN: Absolutely. This is a precise holographic replica of Mars, built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover, that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth.
Humans are natural explorers.
We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it.
We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and length en our reach.
But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards.
Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.
Today, a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before -- an alien world made a little more familiar, because they're finally exploring it as humans should.
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there.
When we dial this real world to the virtual, we can do magical things.
We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain.
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it.
We're taking the first steps.
But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next, because this is not a journey for a few, but for all of us.
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.
Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.
(Applause)
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.
AK: Bye, Jeff.
I dream about this future every single day.
I take inspiration from our ancestors.
We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together.
We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today — technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels, and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3D world.
It's a phenomenal time to be human.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
I have some questions.
AK: OK.
HW: So there's been some talk in the press. And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer.
There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product.
Talk about this field of view issue.
Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?
AK: It's a great question, Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year.
If you do your research, I haven't answered that question.
I've purposely ignored it, because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask.
That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time, and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?" The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant.
What we should be talking about is the density of lights, or radiance, that shows up. Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see.
So from that perspective, what you saw -- you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens. So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.
HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.
It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is.
So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera, which is the thing that matters: how many points of light can I get in a given volume?
That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one.
Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?
HW: Jesus Christ! (Laughter)
AK: He did show up!
I told you he'd show up. Come this way.
HW: Oh, shit.
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.
HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.
AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye.
But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same.
HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute -- so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage --
AK: That's right.
HW: So help me out here: if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, I don't need to map my apartment, right?
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second, with this technology that we call spatial mapping.
So in your home, as soon as you put it on, holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home.
In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down, we don't take the risk of trying to do this live.
So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home, and then we store it, so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this, between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, we don't have things disappear.
Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.
So if I lose connectivity, you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.
HW: And it was beautiful. Um ... Jeff?
JN: Yes?
HW: Hi.
AK: I'll take a step back.
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars, you were here, you were in a room across the street.
Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight but you don't have touch, you don't have smell.
Is this scientifically useful now?
That's my question for a hologram.
JN: Thanks for the question.
Absolutely, I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now, and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA.
So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars. We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station. We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft.
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
Alex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.
AK: Thank you.
HW: Thank you. Thank you.
It began with one question: If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing?
I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa, which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country.
But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid, I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach.
And then I waited. And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line.
So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with.
And then I waited again, but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself, no, to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.
But luckily, I didn't have to do that for very long.
Very soon, people were participating.
In fact, by the end of that week in July, the hashtag #ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world.
People were using the hashtag to do many different things.
To poke fun at their stereotypes: [#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee, all he needs is the bouncer's account details.]
To criticize government spending: [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay]
To make light of geopolitical tensions: [#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.]
To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist: [#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]
And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa: [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]
And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround: [#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
But most importantly, people were using the hashtag to connect.
People were connecting over their Africanness.
So for one week in July, Twitter became a real African bar.
And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other.
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, I'm 22 years old and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries.
My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa.
It's only slightly bigger than Germany.
This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy.
And it has some very progressive social policies.
My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland.
It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa.
It is Africa's last complete monarchy.
So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition, for a very long time.
On paper, these countries seem very different.
And when I was a kid, I could see the difference.
It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other.
But outside of that, I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places.
But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me.
You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other.
When we moved to Botswana, I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else.
So I was being introduced to my new home, my new cultural identity, as a complete outsider, incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward.
But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.
And when I would go back to Swaziland, I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.
Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system, whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you, and I would have a very peculiar adolescence.
But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously.
I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.
Since then, I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean.
I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies.
When I began to read, I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness.
And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas, I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.
So when Twitter came, I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.
The year was 2011 and all over southern Africa and the whole continent, affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get.
So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity.
On long commutes to work, in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to, on our lunch breaks, we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African.
But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody.
So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet, one, you had to tweet in English. Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online.
You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.
And suddenly, your whole world opened up.
And my whole world did open up.
I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent, taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica.
Because at that time, if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.
(Laughter)
But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors.
It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria. It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent.
We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy.
But almost invariably, every single time, we would end up discussing Twitter.
And that's when I realized what this was.
We were standing in the middle of something amazing, because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time, without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.
Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole.
This is by accident, but sometimes, it's by design.
For example, in apartheid South Africa, black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure.
And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation.
Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system, which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s -- and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years, but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country.
And to me, this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not, the fates of African people are deeply intertwined.
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, we share the consequences.
When Burundians flee political turmoil, they go to us, to other African countries.
Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers.
What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem.
So to me, there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems, only African problems because eventually, we share the turmoil.
So if we share the problems, why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes?
How can we do that? Well, in the long term, we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade, removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed.
But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.
Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists, so I'm not inventing anything totally new here.
But political Pan-Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite.
And who does that benefit?
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.
No, what I'm talking about is the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African.
Young Africans like me, we are bursting with creative energy, with innovative ideas.
But with bad governance and shaky institutions, all of this potential could go to waste.
On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive, we are in desperate need of something new, something that works.
And I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.
My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation.
My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant, they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country," and then give up.
My dream is that young Africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas, is our home.
Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively, we can begin to innovate together.
In Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone, but if you want to go far, you go together." And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.
And this is already happening.
Access to these online networks has given young Africans something we've always had to violently take: a voice.
We now have a platform.
Before now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa, you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth --
(Laughter)
to wake up in the morning, take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time.
Before now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government, you were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care.
But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before.
We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees.
We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament.
We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained.
For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most: other Africans.
I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can begin to rescue each other, and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his "I Have A Dream" speech.
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression, but a lasting one that remains.
I was born in a family full of colors.
My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone.
He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents.
The matriarch, my grandma, has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.
My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, like my uncle and my cousin.
My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian, with a pinch of hazel and honey, and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk, but with a lot of coffee.
She has two sisters.
One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other, also adopted, more on the beige side, like a pancake.
(Laughter)
Growing up in this family, color was never important for me.
Outside home, however, things were different soon.
Color had many other meanings.
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings.
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil.
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.
My skin was brown, and people said I was black.
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.
Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny.
By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party, people thought I was the maid.
I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends.
And many times, visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings, I was invited not to use the main elevator.
Because in the end, with this color and this hair, I cannot belong to some places.
In some way, I get to used to it and accept part of it.
However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.
Years later I married a Spaniard.
But not any Spaniard.
I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.
(Laughter)
Since then, a new question started to chase me.
What will be the color of your children?
As you can understand, this is my last concern.
But thinking about it, with my previous background, my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer.
And that is how Humanae was born.
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors, rather than the untrue white, red, black or yellow associated with race.
It's a kind of game to question our codes.
It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.
I portray the subjects in a white background.
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.
I started with my family and friends, then more and more people joined the adventure, thanks to public calls coming through the social media.
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain.
The snowball started to roll.
The project had a great welcome -- invitations, exhibitions, physical formats, galleries and museums ... just happened.
And among them, my favorite: when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street, it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community.
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, 19 different cities around the world.
Just to mention some of them -- from someone included in the Forbes list, to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat.
In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter.
And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
All kinds of beliefs, gender identities or physical impairments, a newborn or terminally ill.
We all together build Humanae.
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other.
When modern science is questioning the race concept, what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red?
Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair?
Or does it have to do with our origin, nationality or bank account?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery.
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people.
It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me.
I have hundreds of that, I will share with you, too.
A mother of 11 years -- A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, "Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence, as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway.
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me."
A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote, "All my life, people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group, a stereotype, a box.
Perhaps we should stop.
Instead of framing, ask the individual, 'How would you label yourself?' Then I would say, 'Hi. I'm Massiel. I'm a Dominican-Dutch, I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman.' "
Besides these unexpected and touching reactions, Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields.
Just to show you some examples, illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies.
It's a collection of faces.
Researchers in the fields of anthropology, physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity, optophysiology, face recognition or Alzheimer's.
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, one of the most relevant political publications.
And talking about foreign affairs, I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ... teachers.
They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes.
Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes, but this time as a teacher myself.
My students, both adults and kids, paint their self-portraits, trying to discover their own unique color.
As a photographer, I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate.
As an individual, as Angélica, every time I take a picture, I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist.
All the frustration, fear and loneliness that I once felt ... becomes love.
The last country -- the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born, Brazil.
We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination.
That remains a common practice worldwide, and that will not disappear by itself.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.
Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers, it probably powers much of the Internet.
And I think that there are, like, a billion and a half active Android devices out there.
Your software is in every single one of them.
It's kind of amazing.
You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.
I mean, this is -- this is the Linux world headquarters.
(Laughter)
Linus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.
And I have to say, the most interesting part in this picture, that people mostly react to, is the walking desk.
It is the most interesting part in my office and I'm not actually using it anymore.
And I think the two things are related.
The way I work is ... I want to not have external stimulation.
You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.
I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.
(Laughter)
It's like a calming color, it's not something that really stimulates you.
What you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen, but the main thing I worry about in my computer is -- it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that -- it really has to be completely silent.
I know people who work for Google and they have their own small data center at home, and I don't do that.
My office is the most boring office you'll ever see.
And I sit there alone in the quiet.
If the cat comes up, it sits in my lap.
And I want to hear the cat purring, not the sound of the fans in the computer.
CA: So this is astonishing, because working this way, you're able to run this vast technology empire -- it is an empire -- so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.
Tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of Linux.
LT: I mean, I still work alone.
Really -- I work alone in my house, often in my bathrobe.
When a photographer shows up, I dress up, so I have clothes on.
(Laughter)
And that's how I've always worked.
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.
I did not start Linux as a collaborative project.
I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just enjoyed programming.
So it was about the end of the journey, which, 25 years later, we still have not reached.
But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.
And what happened is ... the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.
Really, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!" And trust me -- it was not that great back then.
I made it publicly available, and it wasn't even open source at that point.
At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today to improve it.
It was more like, "Look, I've been working on this for half a year, I'd love to have comments."
And other people approached me.
At the University of Helsinki, I had a friend who was one of the open source -- it was called mainly "free software" back then -- and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey, you can use these open-source licenses that had been around.
And I thought about it for a while.
I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.
I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?
And I decided, "What the hell?" And --
CA: And then at some point, someone contributed some code that you thought, "Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.
This could actually improve this."
LT: It didn't even start by people contributing code, it was more that people started contributing ideas.
And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project -- and I'm sure it's true of other things, too, but it's definitely true in code -- is that somebody else takes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actually give you feedback and give you ideas. That was a huge thing for me.
I was 21 at the time, so I was young, but I had already programmed for half my life, basically.
And every project before that had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people just started commenting, started giving feedback on your code.
And even before they started giving code back, that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said, "I love other people!" Don't get me wrong -- I'm actually not a people person.
(Laughter)
I don't really love other people --
(Laughter)
But I love computers, I love interacting with other people on email, because it kind of gives you that buffer.
But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.
And it made it so much more.
CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge, not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?
LT: Not really. I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little.
The big point for me was not being alone and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved -- that was a big point.
Then everything else was very gradual.
Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal -- to me.
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --
If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal -- don't get me wrong.
But if you're interested in the technology and you're interested in the project, the big part was getting the community.
Then the community grew gradually.
And there's actually not a single point where I went like, "Wow, that just took off!" because it -- I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.
CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work.
And it's not just Linux, it's this thing called Git, which is this management system for software development.
Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.
LT: So one of the issues we had, and this took a while to start to appear, is when you... When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which — I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, roughly two or three months.
Some of those people don't do a lot.
There's a lot of people who make small, small changes.
But to maintain this, the scale changes how you have to maintain it.
And we went through a lot of pain.
And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.
CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used, and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated.
CA: (Laughs)
LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways, I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people.
So Git is my second big project, which was only created for me to maintain my first big project.
And this is literally how I work.
I don't code for — well, I do code for fun — but I want to code for something meaningful so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed and —
CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people.
LT: Absolutely. Yes.
CA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.
(Applause)
And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to try and understand why it is.
You've given us some clues, but ... Here's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.
You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11, half your life.
Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd, were you the star at school who could do everything?
What were you like as a kid?
LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.
I mean, I was ... I was not a people person back then.
That's my younger brother.
I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube than my younger brother.
(Laughter)
My younger sister, who's not in the picture, when we had family meetings -- and it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins -- she would prep me beforehand.
Like, before I stepped into the room she would say, "OK. That's so-and-so ..." Because I was not -- I was a geek.
I was into computers, I was into math, I was into physics.
I was good at that.
I don't think I was particularly exceptional.
Apparently, my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.
CA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.
You would not let go.
So that's not about being a geek and being smart, that's about being ... stubborn?
LT: That's about being stubborn.
That's about, like, just starting something and not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else -- Look: shiny!"
And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.
And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley, for the whole time.
That is unheard of.
That's not how Silicon Valley works.
The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot.
And that's not the kind of person I am.
CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself, that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people. Talk about that a bit. Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?
How would you describe what happened?
LT: I don't know if it's essential.
Going back to the "I'm not a people person," — sometimes I'm also... shall we say, "myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings, and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.
And I'm not proud of that.
But, at the same time, it's -- I get people who tell me that I should be nice.
And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice, maybe you should be more aggressive, they see that as me being not nice.
(Laughter)
What I'm trying to say is we are different.
I'm not a people person; it's not something I'm particularly proud of, but it's part of me.
And one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together.
We don't have to like each other -- and sometimes we really don't like each other.
Really -- I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.
But you can, actually, you can find things that -- you don't even agree to disagree, it's just that you're interested in really different things.
And coming back to the point where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work, it turned out, and very quickly turned out, that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.
And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing, and they had completely different goals.
And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.
But because it was open source they could do it, and it actually works really beautifully together.
And I actually think it works the same way.
You need to have the people-people, the communicators, the warm and friendly people who like --
(Laughter)
really want to hug you and get you into the community.
But that's not everybody.
And that's not me.
I care about the technology.
There are people who care about the UI.
I can't do UI to save my life.
I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI, I'd die there.
(Laughter)
So there's different kinds of people, and I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.
CA: Now, when we talked last week, you talked about some other trait that you have, which I found really interesting.
It's this idea called taste.
And I've just got a couple of images here.
I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code, and this one is better taste, which one can immediately see.
What is the difference between these two?
LT: So this is -- How many people here actually have coded?
CA: Oh my goodness.
LT: So I guarantee you, everybody who raised their hand, they have done what's called a singly-linked list.
And it's taught -- This, the first not very good taste approach, is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.
And you don't have to understand the code.
The most interesting part to me is the last if statement.
Because what happens in a singly-linked list -- this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list -- and there's a difference between if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle.
Because if it's the first entry, you have to change the pointer to the first entry.
If it's in the middle, you have to change the pointer of a previous entry.
So they're two completely different cases.
CA: And that's better.
LT: And this is better.
It does not have the if statement.
And it doesn't really matter -- I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case.
And that's good code. But this is simple code. This is CS 101.
This is not important -- although, details are important.
To me, the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste, which is how ... I sent you this stupid example that is not relevant because it's too small.
Good taste is much bigger than this.
Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.
CA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.
You have taste, in a way that's meaningful to software people. You're --
CA: You're a very smart computer coder, and you're hellish stubborn.
But there must be something else.
I mean, you've changed the future.
You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.
You're a visionary, right?
LT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED for the last two days, because there's a lot of vision going on, right?
And I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer.
And I think it's really -- I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there." But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in.
This is the kind of person I am.
(Cheers)
(Applause)
CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.
Who are they and how do you relate to them?
LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.
And people love Tesla.
I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.
(Laughter)
The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is -- I mean, his most famous quote is, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." And I'm in the Edison camp, even if people don't always like him.
Because if you actually compare the two, Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days, but who actually changed the world?
Edison may not have been a nice person, he did a lot of things -- he was maybe not so intellectual, not so visionary.
But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.
CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams -- big, bold, audacious dreams.
You're really the antidote to that.
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.
(Laughter) We embrace you, we embrace you.
Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably, like, billions of dollars out of your software. Does that piss you off?
LT: No. No, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.
I'm really doing fine.
But the other reason is -- I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is.
And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking, but at the same time, this is an experience. Trust me. So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man and thinking I did the right choices.
CA: Is the open source idea -- this is, I think we'll end here -- is the open source idea fully realized now in the world, or is there more that it could go, are there more things that it could do?
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.
I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white.
There's often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly and this is not done well.
Code either works or it doesn't, which means that there's less room for arguments.
And we have arguments despite this, right?
In many other areas -- I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that -- and it's really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because the black and white turns into not just gray, but different colors.
So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.
Science was there first.
But then science ended up being pretty closed, with very expensive journals and some of that going on.
And open source is making a comeback in science, with things like arXiv and open journals.
Wikipedia changed the world, too.
So there are other examples, I'm sure there are more to come.
CA: But you're not a visionary, and so it's not up to you to name them.
LT: No.
(Laughter)
It's up to you guys to make them, right?
CA: Exactly.
Linus Torvalds, thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet, thank you for all those Android phones.
Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.
LT: Thank you.
I'm here to talk to you today about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe is not possible.
It's a story about a living, breathing start-up flourishing in an unlikely environment: the United States government.
Now, this start-up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out.
But before I get there, let's start with the problem.
For me, the problem begins with a number: 137.
137 is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA. 137 days. Now, in order to file that application in the first place, she has to navigate over 1,000 different websites and over 900 different call-in numbers, all owned and operated by the United States government.
Now, we live in times of incredible change.
The private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time.
For that matter, it's removing every single inconvenience in my life that I could possibly think of.
I could be sitting on my couch in my apartment, and from my phone, I can order a warm, gluten-free meal that can arrive at my door in less than 10 minutes.
But meanwhile, a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family has to complete an arduous, complicated application which she might not even be able to do online.
And the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can't spare.
And this growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time --
(Applause)
Because government's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most. It's impacting the students trying to go to college, the single mothers trying to get health care, the veterans coming home from battle.
They can't get what they need when they need it.
And for these Americans, government is more than just a presidential election every four years.
Government is a lifeline that provides services they need and depend on and deserve.
Which is, quite frankly, why government needs to get its shit together and catch up. Just saying.
Now, this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about.
When I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008, we brought the tech industry's best practices into politics.
We earned more money, we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history.
We were a cutting-edge start-up that changed the game of politics forever.
So when the President asked a small group of us to bring that very same disruption directly into government, I knew it wasn't going to be easy work, but I was eager and showed up ready to get to work.
Now, on my first day in DC, my first day in government, I walked into the office and they handed me a laptop.
And the laptop was running Windows 98.
(Laughter)
I mean, three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on that computer. Three elections! Which is when we realized this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined.
Let me paint the picture for you.
The federal government is the largest institution in the world.
It spends over 86 billion dollars a year -- 86 billion -- on federal IT projects.
For context: that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends annually -- on everything.
Now, the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for, because 94 percent of federal IT projects are over budget or behind schedule. 94 percent! For those of you keeping score, yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
(Laughter)
There's another problem: 40 percent of those never end up seeing the light of day.
They are completely scrapped or abandoned.
Now, this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization, because it means as government continues to operate as it's programmed to do, failure is nearly inevitable.
And when the status quo is the riskiest option, that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption.
So, what do we do about it? How do we fix this?
Well, the irony of all of this is that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard, because right here in America are the very ideas, the very people, who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago.
So what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house?
What would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government?
Well, my friends, here's where we get to talk about some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered for creating change in government.
Enter the United States Digital Service.
The United States Digital Service is a new network of start-ups, a team of teams, organizing themselves across government to create radical change.
The mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government deliver world-class digital services for students, immigrants, children, the elderly -- everybody -- at dramatically lower costs.
We are essentially trying to build a more awesome government, for the people, by the people, today.
We don't care — (Applause) Thank you.
Who doesn't want a more awesome government, right?
We don't care about politics. We care about making government work better, because it's the only one we've got.
(Applause)
Now, you can think of our team -- well, it's pretty funny -- you can think of our team a little bit like the Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6.
We're like the Peace Corps for nerds, but instead of traveling to crazy, interesting, far-off places, you spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers, helping restore the fabric of our democracy.
(Laughter)
Now, this team -- our playbook for the United States Digital Service is pretty simple.
The first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer, and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government.
These are the very people who have helped build the products and companies that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world.
Second, we pair these incredible people from the tech core with the dedicated civil servants already inside government on the ground creating change.
Third, we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation at the most mission-critical, life-changing, important services that government offers.
And finally, we give them massive air cover, from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the President himself, to transform these services for the better.
Now, this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out.
If you study classic patterns of disruption, one very common pattern is rather simple.
It's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it's a radical departure from the status quo.
Think about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment.
The United States Digital Service is doing exactly that.
We are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard work about how to build planetary-scale digital services that delight users at lower cost, and we're applying that to government, where it is a radical departure from the status quo.
Now, the good news is: it's starting to work.
We know this because we can already see the results from some of our early projects, like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov, when that went off the rails.
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play, and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number of government's most important citizen-facing services.
Now, if I can take a moment and brag about the team for a second -- it is the highest concentration of badasses I could have ever dreamed of.
We have top talent from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes, all on staff today, all choosing to join their government.
And what's incredible is, everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent.
And I might add, by the way, over half of us are women.
(Applause)
The best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it's working out in the wild.
I'm going to give you two examples quickly.
The first one is about immigration.
This, my friends, is your typical immigration application.
Yes, you guessed it -- it's almost entirely paper-based.
In the best case, the application takes about six to eight months to process.
It is physically shipped thousands of miles -- thousands of miles! -- between no less than six processing centers.
Now, little story: about a decade ago, the government thought that if it brought this system online, it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service, which was a great idea.
So, the typical government process began.
Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later, no working product was delivered -- 1.2 billion with a "B." Now at this point, the agency responsible, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, could have kept pouring money into the failing program.
Sadly, that's what often happens.
That's the status quo today.
But they didn't.
The dedicated civil servants inside the agency decided to stand up and call for change.
We deployed a small team of just six people, and what many people don't know is that's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov -- just six people.
And that team jumped in, side-by-side, to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices, more modern development practices.
Now, in non-tech speak, what that basically means is taking big, multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks, so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks, instead of waiting in a black box for years.
So within less than three months of our team being on the ground, we were already able to push our first products to production.
The first one, this is the form I-90.
This is used to file for your replacement green card.
Now, for immigrant visa holders, a replacement green card is a big deal.
Your green card is your proof of identification, it's your work authorization, it's the proof that you can be here in this country.
So waiting six months while the government processes the replacement is not cool.
I'm excited to tell you that today, you can now, for the first time, file for a replacement green card entirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper.
It is faster, it is cheaper, and it's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike.
(Applause)
Another one, quickly. Last fall, we just released a brand-new practice civics test.
So as part of becoming a US citizen, you have to pass a civics test.
For anyone who has taken this test, it can be quite the stressful process.
So our team released a very easy, simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare, to help ease their nerves, to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their American dream.
Because all of this work, all of this work on immigration, is about taking complicated processes and making them more human.
The other day, one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground said something incredibly profound.
She said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic about a project in her entire time in government.
And she's been doing this for 30 years.
That is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create.
For my second example, I want to bring it back to veterans for a second, and what we are doing to build them a VA that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice.
I'm proud to say that just a few months ago, we released a brand-new beta of a new website, Vets.gov. Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place.
One website, not thousands.
The site is a work in progress, but it's significant progress, because it's designed with the users who matter most: the veterans themselves.
This might sound incredibly obvious, because it should be, but sadly, this isn't normal for government.
Far too often, product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user, but they're not necessarily the users themselves.
So our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data, we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small, with the two most important services that matter most to them: education benefits and disability benefits.
I'm proud to say that they are live on the site today, and as the team continues to streamline more services, they will be ported over here, and the old sites, shut down.
(Applause)
To me, this is what change looks like in 2016.
When you walk out of the Oval Office, the first time I was ever there, I noticed a quote the President had embroidered on the rug.
It's the classic JFK quote. It says, "No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings." It's true.
We have the tools to solve these problems.
We have the tools to come together as a society, as a country, and to fix this together.
Yes, it's hard.
It's particularly hard when we have to fight, when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change.
But in my experience, it's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing, because if we don't do them, who will?
This is on us, all of us, together, because government is not an abstract institution or a concept.
Our government is us.
(Applause)
Today, it is no longer a question of if change is possible.
The question is not, "Can we?" The question is, "Will we?"
Will you?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
When I was seven years old, some well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
Proudly, I said: "An artist." "No, you don't," he said, "You can't make a living being an artist!"
My little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed.
But I gathered myself, went off in search of a new dream, eventually settling on being a scientist, perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.
(Laughter)
I have always loved math and science, later, coding.
And so I decided to study computer programming in college.
In my junior year, my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films.
It was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen.
I watched these films in wonder, transfixed, fireworks going off in my head, thinking, "That is what I want to do with my life." The idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories I connected with, was pure magic for me.
Just two years later, I started working at the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios.
It was here I learned how we actually execute those films.
To create our movies, we create a three-dimensional world inside the computer.
We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters, or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest.
And because it's a three-dimensional world, we can move a camera around inside that world.
I was fascinated by all of it.
But then I got my first taste of lighting.
Lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world.
I actually have icons of lights I move around in there.
Here you can see I've added a light, I'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software, turn on shadows and placing the light.
As I place a light, I think about what it might look like in real life, but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story.
So it might look like this at first, but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work, in rough form it might look like this, and in final form, like this.
There's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it.
It's where we go from this to this.
It's the moment where all the pieces come together, and suddenly the world comes to life as if it's an actual place that exists.
This moment never gets old, especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.
As I learned to light, I learned about using light to help tell story, to set the time of day, to create the mood, to guide the audience's eye, how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set.
Did you see WALL-E?
(Laughter)
There he is.
As you can see, we can create any world that we want inside the computer.
We can make a world with monsters, with robots that fall in love, we can even make pigs fly.
(Laughter)
While this is an incredible thing, this untethered artistic freedom, it can create chaos.
It can create unbelievable worlds, unbelievable movement, things that are jarring to the audience.
So to combat this, we tether ourselves with science.
We use science and the world we know as a backbone, to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable. "Finding Nemo" is an excellent example of this.
A major portion of the movie takes place underwater.
But how do you make it look underwater?
In early research and development, we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer.
Then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look.
One of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water.
So we coded up a light that mimics this physics -- first, the visibility of the water, and then what happens with the color.
Objects close to the eye have their full, rich colors.
As light travels deeper into the water, we lose the red wavelengths, then the green wavelengths, leaving us with blue at the far depths.
In this clip you can see two other important elements.
The first is the surge and swell, or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water.
The second is the caustics.
These are the ribbons of light, like you might see on the bottom of a pool, that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface.
Here we have the fog beams.
These give us color depth cues, but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don't see the water surface.
The other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics, so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light, it appears and disappears, lending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.
You can see how we're using the science -- the physics of water, light and movement -- to tether that artistic freedom.
But we are not beholden to it.
We considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.
We realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with.
So here's a traditionally colored underwater scene.
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what's happening.
In this scene, it's really important we see deep into the underwater, so we understand what the East Australian Current is, that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride.
So we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life.
Because in the end, we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world, we're trying to create a believable world, one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.
We use science to create something wonderful.
We use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder.
This guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that.
He finds beauty in the simplest things.
But when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem.
We got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot, that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.
(Laughter)
His binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has.
He doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter.
So the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions.
We started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections.
He was starting to look glassy-eyed.
(Laughter)
Now, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love.
So we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars, trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem.
So we started with the lenses. Here's the flat-front lens, we have a concave lens and a convex lens.
And here you see all three together, showing us all these reflections.
We tried turning them down, we tried blocking them, nothing was working.
You can see here, sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes -- usually Eve.
So we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses.
So here we have Eve on the first lens, we put Eve on the second lens, it's not working.
We turn it down, it's still not working.
And then we have our eureka moment.
We add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes.
You can see it light up these gray aperture blades.
Suddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has.
Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.
As humans we have the white of our eye, the colored iris and the black pupil.
and the black pupil. Now WALL-E has the black of an eye, the gray aperture blades
Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul, like there's a character with emotion inside.
Later in the movie towards the end, WALL-E loses his personality, essentially going dead.
This is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look.
In the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life.
We bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back, and he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we've come to love.
(Video) WALL-E: Eva?
Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty in these unexpected moments -- when you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul, the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life.
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo" was one of those moments for me.
There are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together.
This was one of those scenes.
The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific.
As we went along, we were floundering.
The reviews with the director turned from the normal look-and-feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percentages.
Maybe because unlike normal, we were basing it on something in real life, or maybe just because we had lost our way.
But it had become about using our brain without our eyes, the science without the art. That scientific tether was strangling the scene.
But even through all the frustrations, I still believed it could be beautiful.
So when it came in to lighting, I dug in.
As I worked to balance the blues and the pinks, the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells, the undulating fog beams, something promising began to appear.
I came in one morning and checked the previous night's work. And I got excited. And then I showed it to the lighting director and she got excited.
Soon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.
In director review, you hope you might get some nice words, then you get some notes and fixes, generally.
And then, hopefully, you get a final, signaling to move on to the next stage.
I gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene.
And the director was silent for an uncomfort ably long amount of time.
Just long enough for me to think, "Oh no, this is doomed." And then he started clapping.
And then the production designer started clapping.
And then the whole room was clapping.
This is the moment that I live for in lighting.
The moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in.
We use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds.
We use storytelling and art to bring them to life.
It's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder, a place with soul, a place we can believe in, a place where the things you imagine can become real -- and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist, but also an artist.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cancer affects all of us -- especially the ones that come back over and over again, the highly invasive and drug-resistant ones, the ones that defy medical treatment, even when we throw our best drugs at them.
Engineering at the molecular level, working at the smallest of scales, can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer.
Cancer is a very clever disease.
There are some forms of cancer, which, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery.
But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches, and the tumor survives or comes back, even after an onslaught of drugs.
We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book.
They're clever, they're adaptable, and they're very good at staying alive.
And, like most supervillains these days, their superpowers come from a genetic mutation.
The genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival, allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments.
One example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell, even as the drug approaches the cell, to push the drug out, before the drug can have any effect.
Imagine -- the cell effectively spits out the drug.
This is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.
All due to mutant genes.
So, we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers.
And we need a new and powerful mode of attack.
Actually, we can turn off a gene.
The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA. siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene.
Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell.
For many years since its discovery, scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine.
But, there is a problem. siRNA works well inside the cell.
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our blood stream or our tissues, it degrades within seconds.
It has to be packaged, protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell.
So, here's our strategy. First, we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA, the gene blocker, and silence those survival genes, and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.
But how do we carry that out?
Using molecular engineering, we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream.
It has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream, it's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue, and it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell.
To do this job well, it has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair.
Let's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle.
First, let's start with the nanoparticle core.
It's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug.
This is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life.
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin, nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.
This is our gene blocker.
Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged, we can protect it with a nice, protective layer of positively charged polymer.
The two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction, and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream.
We're almost done.
(Laughter)
But there is one more big obstacle we have to think about.
In fact, it may be the biggest obstacle of all.
How do we deploy this superweapon?
I mean, every good weapon needs to be targeted, we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor.
But our bodies have a natural immune-defense system: cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don't belong, so that it can destroy or eliminate them. And guess what? Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object.
We have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system.
We have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it.
So we add one more negatively charged layer around this nanoparticle, which serves two purposes.
First, this outer layer is one of the naturally charged, highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body.
It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect.
This invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor, without getting eliminated by the body.
Second, this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell.
Once bound, the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle, and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy.
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!
The siRNA is deployed first.
It acts for hours, giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes.
We have now disabled those genetic superpowers.
What remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses.
Then, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently.
With sufficient gene blockers, we can address many different kinds of mutations, allowing the chance to sweep out tumors, without leaving behind any bad guys.
So, how does our strategy work?
We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer.
This triple-negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered.
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call it "dox" -- is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer.
So, we first treated our animals with a dox core, dox only.
The tumor slowed their rate of growth, but they still grew rapidly, doubling in size over a period of two weeks.
Then, we tried our combination superweapon.
A nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump, plus, we have the dox in the core.
And look -- we found that not only did the tumors stop growing, they actually decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. The tumors were actually regressing.
(Applause)
What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized.
We can add many different layers of siRNA to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms.
And we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core.
As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types, they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use.
Ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me.
It is a very aggressive cancer, in part because it's discovered at very late stages, when it's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations.
After the first round of chemotherapy, this cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients.
And it usually comes back in a drug-resistant form.
High-grade ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there.
And we're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat.
As a researcher, I usually don't get to work with patients.
But I recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.
I was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support.
At this event, we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer.
And Mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations, including her own daughter.
This really touched me.
It's not just about building really elegant science. It's about changing people's lives.
It's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules.
I know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers, they'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world -- including ovarian cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease -- just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me, and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale, that of molecules, to heal on the human scale.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.
Now, I want to tell you a story about that.
It involves data from a NASA mission, ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.
It began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission. Kepler's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system.
It did this by staring at a single field in the sky, this one, with all the tiny boxes.
And in this one field, it monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars continuously for four years, taking a data point every 30 minutes.
It was looking for what astronomers call a transit.
This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight, just so that the planet crosses in front of a star.
And when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight, which you can see as a dip in this curve.
And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the Kepler data.
At the same time of the first data release, astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing: What if computers missed something?
And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at the same data.
The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition, sometimes even better than a computer.
However, there was a lot of skepticism around this.
My colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project, said that people at the time were saying, "You're crazy.
There's no way that a computer will miss a signal. "And so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble.
And if we found one planet, we would be thrilled.
When I joined the team four years ago, we had already found a couple.
And today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts, we have found dozens, and we've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy.
So to understand this, let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like.
On this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light, and on the bottom is time.
The white line is light just from the star, what astronomers call a light curve.
Now, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light, and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself.
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.
Planets don't get much bigger than Jupiter.
Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness.
Earth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and the signal is barely visible in the data.
So back to our mystery. A few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits, and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852.
The observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted, and they started talking about this in the discussion forums.
They said and object like Jupiter would make a drop like this in the star's light, but they were also saying it was giant.
You see, transits normally only last for a few hours, and this one lasted for almost a week.
They were also saying that it looks asymmetric, meaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter, it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side.
This seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet.
There are few more dips that happened, but for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.
And then in March of 2011, we see this.
The star's light drops by a whole 15 percent, and this is huge compared to a planet, which would only make a one percent drop.
We described this feature as both smooth and clean.
It also is asymmetric, having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week, and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.
And again, after this, not much happens until February of 2013.
Things start to get really crazy.
There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear, and they last for like a hundred days, all the way up into the Kepler mission's end.
These dips have variable shapes.
Some are very sharp, and some are broad, and they also have variable durations.
Some last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week.
And there's also up and down trends within some of these dips, almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other.
And at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent.
This means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.
This is truly remarkable. And so the citizen scientists, when they saw this, they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up.
And so when the science team looked at it, we're like, "Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data." But we looked really, really, really hard, and the data were good.
And so what was happening had to be astrophysical, meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight.
And so at this point, we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on.
And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery, they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand.
First, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it.
And then somebody else said, well, what if the star had already formed planets, and two of these planets had collided, similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.
Well, both of these theories could explain part of the data, but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young, and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star's light, and you would expect this if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced.
And so somebody else said, well, how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit?
Well, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations. But I agree, it does feel a little contrived. You see, it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing.
And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets.
But of all the bad ideas we had, this one was the best.
And so we went ahead and published our findings.
Now, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote.
Scientists are meant to publish results, and this situation was far from that.
And so we decided to give it a catchy title, and we called it: "Where's The Flux?" I will let you work out the acronym.
(Laughter)
So this isn't the end of the story.
Around the same time I was writing this paper, I met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright, and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data.
And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision, it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars, but it didn't.
And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found, and he said to me, "Aw crap, Tabby. Now I have to rewrite my paper."
So yes, the natural explanations were weak, and we were curious now.
So we had to find a way to rule out aliens.
So together, we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue.
We wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.
A couple months later, news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles, over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.
And if you search Google Images, this is what you'll find.
Now, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well, how do aliens actually explain this light curve? OK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own.
In this hypothetical circumstance, this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet, so where could they get more energy?
Well, they have a host star just like we have a sun, and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star, then that would solve their energy needs.
So they would go and build huge structures.
These giant megastructures, like ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.
This image above are lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres.
It's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things, but you can think of it this way.
The Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles.
The simplest element on one of these structures is 100 times that size. They're enormous. And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star.
You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.
But it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics.
You see, anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat, and we don't observe this.
But it could be something as simple as they're just reradiating it away in another direction, just not at Earth.
Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet.
Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe.
But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?
(Laughter)
You can see how this quickly captures your imagination. Well, there you have it.
We're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand or an alien technology we don't understand.
Personally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation. But don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens.
Either way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.
So what happens next? We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what's happening.
But professional astronomers, like me, we have limited resources for this kind of thing, and Kepler is on to a different mission.
And I'm happy to say that once again, citizen scientists have come in and saved the day.
You see, this time, amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities, and I am so excited to see what they find.
What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren't looking for something like this.
And what's more exciting is that there's more data to come.
There are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky.
And just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this?
And what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?
Thank you.

People returning to work after a career break: I call them relaunchers.
These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care, for childcare reasons, pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue.
Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats.
Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers.
Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition, and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers, especially if they've been out for a long time.
This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.
Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. This is Sami Kafala. He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children.
The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks.
And speaking of long career breaks, this is Mimi Kahn. She's a social worker in Orange County, California, who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break.
That's the longest career break that I'm aware of.
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career.
And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break.
Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it.
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home, but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work, plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working.
Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search.
She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results.
I met Tracy in June of 2011, when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around.
The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house. I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.
I also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere.
Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it.
There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity."
I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit, but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce.
And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time.
What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break.
And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time, as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities.
So for example, you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this. This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan.
Or here I am in the kitchen.
But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this.
They only remember you as you were, and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.
There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break. And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news.
My background is in finance, and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children.
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore.
So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.
I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce, and here's why. Think about our life stage: for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves.
We did that already.
We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations. We're in a more settled time of life.
We have great work experience.
We have a more mature perspective.
We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense.
Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while.
On the flip side, I speak with employers, and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers.
The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete.
Now, I can tell you, having been technologically obsolete myself at one point, that it's a temporary condition.
I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.
I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far, but I had to relearn it on Excel.
It actually wasn't that hard.
A lot of the commands are the same.
I found PowerPoint much more challenging, but now I use PowerPoint all the time.
I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software.
And if they're not up to speed, then it's their responsibility to get there. And they do.
The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do.
I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break.
That's not the employer's job.
It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value.
Back in 2010 I started noticing something.
I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008, and in 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity, whether it was called an internship or not, but an internship-like experience, as a way for professionals to return to work.
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs.
I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate, apply for an entry-level internship program in the military, and then get a permanent job afterward.
I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs.
So I wrote a report about what I was seeing, and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called "The 40-Year-Old Intern." I have to thank the editors there for that title, and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns.
And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, they called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."
(Laughter)
So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals.
And at this point, hundreds of people have participated.
These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries.
And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.
Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?
Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over.
This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires.
Think about how far we have come.
Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all.
But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé.
This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too.
In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program.
And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program.
Different pool, same concept.
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro.
Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.
Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department.
But it was a temp job.
The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees.
This was in the fall of 2011.
Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house.
So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best.
Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle.
Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted.
They've paid for her to get her MBA at night.
She's even hired another relauncher to work for her.
Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.
Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers.
But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.
Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new.
To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation.
Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing.
Consider Facit. I'm actually old enough to remember them.
Facit was a fantastic company.
They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. Everybody used them. And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?
They continued doing exactly the same.
In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone. Gone.
To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators.
(Laughter)
Facit did too much exploitation.
But exploration can go wild, too.
A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.
Let's call them OncoSearch.
The company was brilliant.
They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer.
Every day was about creating something new.
They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect." The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete.
OncoSearch did too much exploration.
I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.
The founder of the idea is Jim March.
And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.
Exploration. Exploration is about coming up with what's new.
It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations.
It's about changing our frontiers.
Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc. I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.
We all know that exploration is risky.
We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high.
Exploitation is the opposite. Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better.
Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.
It's about making good products faster and cheaper.
Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term.
But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term.
And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic.
That's the risk of exploitation.
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.
If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.
Small children, they explore all day.
All day it's about exploration.
As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.
The same goes for companies.
Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent.
And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.
And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. For example, "How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?" Or, "How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?" So, doing one well is difficult.
Doing both well as the same time is art — pushing both exploration and exploitation.
So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel.
But when they do, the payoffs are huge.
So we have lots of great examples.
We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.
Why is balancing so difficult?
I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are.
So I'll talk about two, but there are many.
So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.
We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work.
So instead of staying with it, we create something new.
But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.
OncoSearch was a good example.
A famous example is, of course, Xerox.
But we don't only see this in companies.
We see this in the public sector as well.
We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
But still, we change much more often.
We really don't give them the chance.
Another trap is the success trap.
Facit fell into the success trap.
They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it.
They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change.
We are like that, too.
When we know something well, it's difficult to change.
Bill Gates has said: "Success is a lousy teacher.
It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail." That's the challenge with success.
So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us. And they apply to our companies.
The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.
And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.
Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle.
I see other companies that say, "I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."
Second one: think in multiple time scales.
I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one.
Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.
So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important.
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.
But companies can't choose.
They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.
Third: invite talent. I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.
I think it's a team sport.
I think we need to allow challenging.
I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.
I think that's also what good parenting is about.
Last one: be skeptical of success.
Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration.
Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, "Remember, you're only human."
So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff.
But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.
I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.
First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot?
And what can you do to challenge?
Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me?
Is that something I should do more of?
In my case, yes. So let me leave you with this.
Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have.
Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities.
And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.
But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite.
While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.
Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check.
So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days? Well, that's a lot of you.
That's a decent amount. How about a few months? That's pretty good too.
Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter.
Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days? That's quite a lot. How about a few weeks?
So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.
Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.
Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars.
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation?
Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?
Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet?
And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations.
The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.
From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological.
And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?
In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown.
So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.
Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine.
It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.
The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology.
It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body.
Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity.
Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space.
To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment.
The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material.
Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients?
The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant?
Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade. The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant?
Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate." Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.
By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.
They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.
Nature does stuff like this already, without our help.
We have simply found more precise ways to do it.
So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?
Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.
It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.
One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments.
In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term.
These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.
So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do?
Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.
That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there.
And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.
Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.
So let us appeal to nature for inspiration.
Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology.
And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.
It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation.
While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.
To do so is not particularly easy.
There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene.
But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either.
Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin.
Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.
As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve.
Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being.
Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations.
But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time.
In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets.
We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements.
But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.
Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.
Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries.
Will engineering ourselves make us less human?
But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious?
Where should human genius direct itself?
Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.
How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?
I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us.
We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage.
Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last.
Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.
Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going.
The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.
Thank you.
(Applause)
OK, so, confession: I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.
I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.
Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.
I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.
But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.
Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
He is definitely my hero.
But as much as (Applause) — yeah, deserves it —
But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.
They don't all make national headlines.
In fact, most of them don't.
They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal.
So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people.
Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives.
And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want.
And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is.
Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.
It's a proud tradition. Families. In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.
What do hunters want? Well, they want to hunt. They love their guns.
They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns.
But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.
In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people. It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill.
We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.
In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2.4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.
(Applause)
And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane — one with security and one with no security. And —
(Applause)
And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members.
This is not a controversial idea.
In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.
That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake.
(Laughter)
And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.
That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.
But what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across America?
Well first, it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe.
In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.
Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer.
Today, that number is 63 percent.
Why? I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising, which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth.
And that's exactly what's happened here.
The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence; blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home; blocking smart-gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives.
They're desperate to hide the truth, because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.
And every day, people are dying as a result.
And a lot of those people are children.
Every day in the US, nine kids are just shot unintentionally.
900 children and teens take their own lives every year.
And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.
Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home, including the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook.
I meet so many of these parents; it's the most heartbreaking part of my job.
These are not bad people.
They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision, made based on very bad information that was put into their minds by very bad people, who know good and well the misery that they're causing, but just don't care.
And the result is a nightmare -- not only for families like mine, but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.
But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence.
I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share, which is the dream of a better, safer, future.
For my organization, for the Brady Campaign, that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025.
And I hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach.
Because folks, for every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, "That's when things really started to change." And I'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here.
(Applause)
We are so clearly at a tipping point, because the American public has come together by the millions like never before, based on that common ground, to say, "Enough." Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and schools.
Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering proportions.
Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them.
And enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the people they have been elected to represent. Enough.
(Applause)
And the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying it anymore.
It's so much bigger than that.
And if you want proof, let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start — with Kim Kardashian.
(Laughter)
And here's the thing: it's not really a joke.
I mean, think about when issues change. It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture, voices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms, musicians, athletes.
The NBA has come forward.
Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward.
There's real cultural change -- I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year.
That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening.
And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks.
Let's look at the political elections that are heating up. This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats.
Couldn't run from it fast enough.
Now candidates are running on it.
Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably, until very recently.
For somebody like me, watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings -- it's almost surreal to watch.
We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby, and ultimately that needs to change.
But you know what?
We're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side.
And we're on offense.
You know, they say that the Internet democratizes information.
Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism.
It's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like.
Sometimes I think of it -- you know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions, kind of like white blood cells.
It's enabled us to start to really close -- and this is the bottom line -- close that disgraceful disconnect between what the American public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it.
Until recently, the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side, from that six percent, outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one. We're flipping that narrative on its head. After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino, we jammed Congressional switchboards.
We put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours.
And you know what?
We got a vote on a bill that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon.
We're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil, ugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade.
The stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken.
We've seen President Obama's historic executive actions.
They don't go all the way, but they are going to save lives, because they expand Brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously.
And we're marching across the country -- we're not just waiting for Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity.
We're marching across the country, state by state, marriage-equality style.
And you know what? We're winning. Congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize that it's on the wrong side of history.
And when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them.
And that's exactly what we're doing right now, as we're in this tipping point.
You know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech to a large group like this, although far less intimidating, and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching one of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men," a period TV show about advertising in the 1960s.
And as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks, I'd glance up at her screen every now and then, and it seemed that every time I did, I'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker.
And ultimately it dawned on me: what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence.
I mean, think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time, how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal -- some even glamorous or sexy -- have become stigmatized in just a generation or two, once they became conversations about our common ground.
That is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create around gun violence.
And that's my dream, that maybe someday, some period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence, and a future generation of children might only be able to imagine how terrible it must have been.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman.
And years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of, called "The Graduate." And there's two key scenes in that movie.
The first one is the seduction scene.
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.
(Laughter)
The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool, and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word, just one word.
And of course, all of you know what that word is.
It's "plastics."
(Laughter)
And the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.
(Laughter)
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.
The word should have been "silicon." And the reason it should have been silicon is because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made, had already been filed, and they were already building them.
So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967, when this movie was released.
And the year after the movie was released, Intel was founded.
So had the graduate heard the right one word, maybe he would have ended up onstage -- oh, I don't know -- maybe with these two.
(Laughter)
So as you're thinking of that, let's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.
(Laughter)
So in 2015, what word of advice would you give people, when you took a college graduate out by the pool and you said one word, just one word?
I think the answer would be "lifecode." So what is "lifecode?" Lifecode is the various ways we have of programming life.
So instead of programming computers, we're using things to program viruses or retroviruses or proteins or DNA or RNA or plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures.
And as you're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do, what it's programmed to do, what you end up doing is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years, which is breeding, changing, mixing, matching all kinds of life-forms, and we accelerate it.
And this is not something new.
This humble mustard weed has been modified so that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli. And if you change it in a second way, you get kale. And if you change it in a third way, you get cauliflower.
So when you go to these all-natural, organic markets, you're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time.
The difference today, to pick a completely politically neutral term --
[Intelligent design]
(Laughter)
We're beginning to practice intelligent design.
That means that instead of doing this at random and seeing what happens over generations, we're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins, and we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes.
And that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.
Let me just give you one example.
Some of you occasionally might think about sex.
And we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex.
So we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it.
What's happened with sex over time is -- normally, sex equals baby, eventually.
But in today's world, sex plus pill equals no baby.
(Laughter)
And again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural, but that has not been the case for most of human history.
And it's not the case for animals.
What it is does is it gives us control, so sex becomes separate from conception.
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that, then we've been playing with stuff that's a little bit more advanced, like art. Not in the sense of painting and sculpture, but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies.
So what are assisted reproductive technologies?
Assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization.
And when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it.
Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise.
But when you do that, what you ’ re doing is separating sex, conception, baby.
So you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby, you've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized.
So you've separated the baby from the body from the act.
And as you're thinking of other things we've been doing, think about twins.
So you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs, you can freeze fertilized eggs.
And what does that mean?
Well, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient.
You're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation, so you save these things.
You don't irradiate them.
But if you can save them and you can freeze them, and you can have a surrogate mother, it means that you've decoupled sex from time.
It means you can have twins born -- oh, in 50 years?
(Laughter)
In a hundred years? Two hundred years? And these are three really profound changes that are not, like, future stuff. This is stuff we take for granted today.
So this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower.
It turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses, of changing plants, of changing animals, perhaps even of evolving ourselves.
It's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.
Let's have some risks. Like every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile, like computers, this stuff potentially can be misused.
And that scares a lot of people.
And as you apply these technologies, you can even turn human beings into chimeras.
Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals?
Well, some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type. Or they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa, which sounds absolutely horrible until you realize, the reason you're doing that is you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments.
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow, you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself, but you're also saving your life.
And as you're thinking about this stuff, here's something that happened 20 years ago.
This is Emma Ott. She's a recent college admittee. She's studying accounting.
She played two varsity sports.
She graduated as a valedictorian.
And that's not particularly extraordinary, except that she's the first human being born to three parents. Why? Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease that she might have inherited.
So when you swap out a third person's DNA and you put it in there, you save the lives of people.
But you also are doing germline engineering, which means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved and won't go through this.
And [their] kids will be saved, and their grandchildren will be saved, and this passes on.
That makes people nervous. So 20 years ago, the various authorities said, why don't we study this for a while?
There are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff, because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology, and then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years.
So as we think about it, as we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies, maybe we should do this, maybe we should do that," there are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting.
Like curing deadly diseases -- which, by the way, is completely unnatural.
It is normal and natural for humans to be felled by massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis.
When we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk.
Because we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals, we can feed about seven billion people.
We can do things like create new life-forms.
And as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome, until you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table.
Those flowers you've got on your dining room table -- there's not a lot that's natural about them, because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color, to be this size, to last for a week.
You don't usually give your loved one wildflowers because they don't last a whole lot of time.
What all this does is it flips Darwin completely on his head.
See, for four billion years, what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles: on natural selection and random mutation.
And so what lived and died, what was structured, has now been flipped on its head.
And what we've done is created this completely parallel evolutionary system where we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.
So let me explain these things. This is natural selection.
This is unnatural selection.
So what happens with this stuff is, we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central Asia to turn them into dogs.
And then we started turning them into big dogs and into little dogs.
But if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue and you let it loose on the African plain, you can watch natural selection happen.
(Laughter)
Few things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield.
You will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest and see the same plant growing in orderly rows at the same time, nothing else living there.
When you do a cornfield, you're selecting what lives and what dies. And you're doing that through unnatural selection.
It's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field.
It's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb.
In fact, half the surface of Earth has been unnaturally engineered so that what lives and what dies there is what we want, which is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears walking through downtown Manhattan.
How about this random mutation stuff?
Well, this is random mutation. This is Antonio Alfonseca. He's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname.
He was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000.
And he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand, which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.
(Laughter)
How about non-random mutation? A non-random mutation is beer. It's wine. It's yogurt. How many times have you walked through the forest and found all-natural cheese? Or all-natural yogurt? So we've been engineering this stuff.
Now, the interesting thing is, we get to know the stuff better.
We found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments, CRISPR, inside yogurt.
And as we start engineering cells, we're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products, including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis, which is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.
So this lifecode stuff. It really is a superpower.
It really is a way of programming stuff, and there's nothing that's going to change us more than this lifecode.
So as you're thinking of lifecode, let's think of five principles as to how we start guiding, and I'd love you to give me more.
So, principle number one: we have to take responsibility for this stuff.
The reason we have to take responsibility is because we're in charge.
These aren't random mutations.
This is what we are doing, what we are choosing.
It's not, "Stuff happened." It didn't happen at random.
It didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else.
We engineer this stuff, and it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.
Principle number two: we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff.
There have been at least 33 versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth.
Most all of them went extinct except us.
But the normal and natural state of this Earth is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time, which is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us.
Some of us have some Denisova in us.
And some in Washington have a lot more of it.
(Laughter)
Principle number three: we have to respect other people's choices. Some people will choose to never alter.
Some people will choose to alter all. Some people will choose to alter plants but not animals. Some people will choose to alter themselves. Some people will choose to evolve themselves.
Diversity is not a bad thing, because even though we think of humans as very diverse, we came so close to extinction that all of us descend from a single African mother and the consequence of that is there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees than there are in seven billion humans.
Principle number four: we should take about a quarter of the Earth and only let Darwin run the show there.
It doesn't have to be contiguous, doesn't have to all be tied together.
It should be part in the oceans, part on land.
But we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet.
We want to have our evolutionary system running.
We want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running.
And it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution.
(Applause)
Last thing I'll say. This is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on.
This is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had.
It would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you're scared of it, because you're hiding from it.
You can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics.
You can participate in the business.
You can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going, where industry is going, where we're going to take the world.
It would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word, just one word, if you don't listen if that word is "lifecode."
Thank you very much.
Seven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company.
He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly.
We've all lined up backup jobs. "Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still not a functioning website." You guys realize, the entire company is a website.
That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest.
And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.
(Laughter) They sell glasses online.
They were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments.
Why was I so wrong?
To find out, I've been studying people that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them.
They are people who stand out and speak up.
Originals drive creativity and change in the world.
They're the people you want to bet on.
And they look nothing like I expected.
I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them.
So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground.
Now, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator.
Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite.
I'm a precrastinator.
Yes, that's an actual term.
You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet.
I just feel that a few months ahead of time.
(Laughter)
So this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously.
I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop until I had mastered them.
Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Laughter) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline.
And I was proud of that, until a few years ago.
I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute, where are the four papers you owe me?"
(Laughter)
No, she was one of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test.
So I challenged her to get some data.
She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate.
Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are.
And sure enough, the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately.
So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators.
She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey. "
(Laughter)
No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas.
And on the flip side, the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either.
There's a sweet spot where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
To find out, we designed some experiments.
We asked people to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are.
And some of them are asked to do the task right away.
Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes.
And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups.
Now, Minesweeper is awesome, but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost.
It's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate.
Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.
So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.
(Laughter)
And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal.
I started writing the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas.
As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators.
Take Leonardo da Vinci.
He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa.
He felt like a failure.
He wrote as much in his journal.
But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter.
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
The night before the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it.
He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines.
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script.
By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas.
And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise.
Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity.
What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish.
And this is what I missed with Warby Parker.
When they were dragging their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage.
But what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online.
And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth.
Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better.
What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent for the improvers.
Look at Facebook, waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster.
Look at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo.
It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than it is to create something new from scratch.
So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better.
But that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker.
They were also full of doubts.
They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals would look something like this.
(Laughter)
Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do.
They just manage it differently.
Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us.
(Laughter)
Now, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt.
There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze.
But idea doubt is energizing.
It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did.
And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there?
Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use.
We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use.
Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study --
(Laughter)
But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes.
(Applause)
They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage.
The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge.
It's about how you got the browser.
Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option that was handed to you.
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default and ask, is there a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser.
So people hear about this study and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?"
(Laughter)
No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option.
And if you do that well, you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu.
There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de.
(Laughter)
Vuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes.
It's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light for more than half a century.
In every past version, the main character has been an evil queen.
But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense.
She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever.
So there's a simple message from this story.
When you feel doubt, don't let it go.
(Laughter)
What about fear? Originals feel fear, too.
They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try.
They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all.
They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions.
The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science, are the chances not taken.
Elon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back, but it was too important not to try.
And for so many of us, when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try.
But I have some good news for you.
You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas.
A lot of people think they will.
If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up.
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact.
Take the guy who invented this.
Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.
(Laughter)
If you look across fields, the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most.
Take classical composers, the best of the best.
Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times?
One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate.
The more output you churn out, the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original.
Even the three icons of classical music -- Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces.
Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot?
I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.
But for most of us, if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas.
The Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker.
So if you put all this together, what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us.
They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate. They have bad ideas.
And sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed.
So when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did.
Don't write them off.
And when that's you, don't count yourself out either.
Know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.
Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way to improve the world around us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth.
Think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit.
The skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways, bridges and tunnels, air and seaports that enable our mobility across the continents.
The vascular system that powers the body are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids. that distribute energy.
And the nervous system of communications is the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks and data centers that allow us to share information.
This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix already consists of 64 million kilometers of roads, four million kilometers of railways, two million kilometers of pipelines and one million kilometers of Internet cables.
What about international borders?
We have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders.
Let's build a better map of the world.
And we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology.
There's a saying with which all students of history are familiar: "Geography is destiny." Sounds so grave, doesn't it?
It's such a fatalistic adage.
It tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor, that small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors, that vast distances are insurmountable.
But every journey I take around the world, I see an even greater force sweeping the planet: connectivity.
The global connectivity revolution, in all of its forms -- transportation, energy and communications -- has enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people, of goods, of resources, of knowledge, such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it.
In fact, I view the two forces as fusing together into what I call "connectography."
Connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people, resources and ideas, but it is an evolution, an evolution of the world from political geography, which is how we legally divide the world, to functional geography, which is how we actually use the world, from nations and borders, to infrastructure and supply chains.
Our global system is evolving from the vertically integrated empires of the 19th century, through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century, into a global network civilization in the 21st century.
Connectivity, not sovereignty, has become the organizing principle of the human species.
(Applause)
We are becoming this global network civilization because we are literally building it.
All of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together total just under two trillion dollars per year.
Meanwhile, our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade.
And, well, it should.
We have been living off an infrastructure stock meant for a world population of three billion, as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion and eventually nine billion and more.
As a rule of thumb, we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world.
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.
In 2015, China announced the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together with a network of other organizations aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads, stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.
And as all of this topographical engineering unfolds, we will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next 40 years, we will build more infrastructure in the next 40 years, than we have in the past 4,000 years.
Now let's stop and think about it for a minute.
Spending so much more on building the foundations of global society rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound consequences.
Connectivity is how we optimize the distribution of people and resources around the world.
It is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts.
I believe that is what is happening.
Connectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century: planetary urbanization.
Cities are the infrastructures that most define us.
By 2030, more than two thirds of the world's population will live in cities.
And these are not mere little dots on the map, but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers.
Here we are in Vancouver, at the head of the Cascadia Corridor that stretches south across the US border to Seattle.
The technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley begins north of San Francisco down to San Jose and across the bay to Oakland.
The sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego across the Mexican border to Tijuana.
San Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal where you can exit into either country.
Eventually, a high-speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine.
America's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York and Philadelphia to Washington.
It contains more than 50 million people and also has plans for a high-speed rail network.
But Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together.
This continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka contains more than 80 million people and most of Japan's economy.
It is the world's largest megacity. For now.
But in China, megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching 100 million people.
The Bohai Rim around Beijing, The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta, stretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou.
And in the middle, the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster, whose geographic footprint is almost the same size as the country of Austria.
And any number of these megacity clusters has a GDP approaching two trillion dollars -- that's almost the same as all of India today.
So imagine if our global diplomatic institutions, such as the G20, were to base their membership on economic size rather than national representation.
Some Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table, while entire countries, like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.
Moving to India, whose population will soon exceed that of China, it too has a number of megacity clusters, such as the Delhi Capital Region and Mumbai.
In the Middle East, Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population.
Most of Egypt's 80 million people live in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria.
And in the gulf, a necklace of city-states is forming, from Bahrain and Qatar, through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman.
And then there's Lagos, Africa's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub.
It has plans for a rail network that will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor, stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana, to Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast.
But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.
In a megacity world, countries can be suburbs of cities.
By 2030, we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.
So which map tells you more?
Our traditional map of 200 discrete nations that hang on most of our walls, or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?
And yet, even this is incomplete because you cannot understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others.
People move to cities to be connected, and connectivity is why these cities thrive.
Any number of them, such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow, has a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half of their entire national GDP.
But equally importantly, you cannot calculate any of their individual value without understanding the role of the flows of people, of finance, of technology that enable them to thrive.
Take the Gauteng province of South Africa, which contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.
It too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP.
But equally importantly, it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into South Africa and indeed, into the entire African continent.
Cities want to be part of global value chains.
They want to be part of this global division of labor.
That is how cities think.
I've never met a mayor who said to me, "I want my city to be cut off." They know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries.
Now, for many people, urbanization causes great dismay.
They think cities are wrecking the planet.
But right now, there are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving.
That is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have.
And all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose, mankind's number one priority in the 21st century: sustainable urbanization.
Is it working? Let's take climate change.
We know that summit after summit in New York and Paris is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But what we can see is that transferring technology and knowledge and policies between cities is how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies.
Cities are learning from each other.
How to install zero-emissions buildings, how to deploy electric car-sharing systems.
In major Chinese cities, they're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets.
In many Western cities, young people don't even want to drive anymore.
Cities have been part of the problem, now they are part of the solution.
Inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization.
When I travel through megacities from end to end -- it takes hours and days -- I experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography.
And yet, our global stock of financial assets has never been larger, approaching 300 trillion dollars.
That's almost four times the actual GDP of the world.
We have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis, but have we invested them in inclusive growth?
No, not yet.
Only when we build sufficient, affordable public housing, when we invest in robust transportation networks to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally, that's when our divided cities and societies will come to feel whole again.
(Applause)
And that is why infrastructure has just been included in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, because it enables all the others.
Our political and economic leaders are learning that connectivity is not charity, it's opportunity.
And that's why our financial community needs to understand that connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century.
Now, cities can make the world more sustainable, they can make the world more equitable, I also believe that connectivity between cities can make the world more peaceful.
If we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders, we see more trade, more investment and more stability.
We all know the story of Europe after World War II, where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today's peaceful European Union.
And you can see that Russia, by the way, is the least connected of major powers in the international system.
And that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today.
Countries that have less stake in the system also have less to lose in disturbing it.
In North America, the lines that matter most on the map are not the US-Canada border or the US-Mexico border, but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines and electricity grids and even water canals that are forming an integrated North American union.
North America does not need more walls, it needs more connections.
(Applause)
But the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world.
All of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary and where generations of leaders have had hostile relations with each other.
But now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet.
Let's take Southeast Asia, where high-speed rail networks are planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore and trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar.
Now this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources and its industrial output.
It is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana, a peace among Southeast Asian nations.
A similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa, where a half dozen countries are investing in railways and multimodal corridors so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market.
Now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies.
They, too, are evolving into a Pax Africana.
One region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the Middle East.
As Arab states tragically collapse, what is left behind but the ancient cities, such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?
In fact, the nearly 400 million people of the Arab world are almost entirely urbanized.
As societies, as cities, they are either water rich or water poor, energy rich or energy poor.
And the only way to correct these mismatches is not through more wars and more borders, but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals.
Sadly, this is not yet the map of the Middle East.
But it should be, a connected Pax Arabia, internally integrated and productively connected to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.
Now, it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now towards the world's most turbulent region.
But we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run.
Because we know that in region after region, connectivity is the new reality.
Cities and countries are learning to aggregate into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.
But the real test is going to be Asia.
Can connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry among the great powers of the Far East?
After all, this is where World War II I is supposed to break out.
Since the end of the Cold War, a quarter century ago, at least six major wars have been predicted for this region.
But none have broken out.
Take China and Taiwan. In the 1990s, this was everyone's leading World War III scenario.
But since that time, the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense that last November, leaders from both sides held a historic summit to discuss eventual peaceful reunification.
And even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan that's pro-independence earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic.
China and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in island disputes.
But in recent years, Japan has been making its largest foreign investments in China.
Japanese cars are selling in record numbers there.
And guess where the largest number of foreigners residing in Japan today comes from?
You guessed it: China.
China and India have fought a major war and have three outstanding border disputes, but today India is the second largest shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
They're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India through Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China.
Their trade volume has grown from 20 billion dollars a decade ago to 80 billion dollars today.
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars and continue to dispute Kashmir, but they're also negotiating a most-favored-nation trade agreement and want to complete a pipeline stretching from Iran through Pakistan to India.
And let's talk about Iran.
Wasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable?
Then why is every single major power rushing to do business there today?
Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out.
But we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet.
Even though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries, these same countries are also investing billions of dollars in each other's infrastructure and supply chains.
They are more interested in each other's functional geography than in their political geography.
And that is why their leaders think twice, step back from the brink, and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions.
So often it seems like the world is falling apart, but building more connectivity is how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again, much better than before.
And by wrapping the world in such seamless physical and digital connectivity, we evolve towards a world in which people can rise above their geographic constraints.
We are the cells and vessels pulsing through these global connectivity networks.
Everyday, hundreds of millions of people go online and work with people they've never met.
More than one billion people cross borders every year, and that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade.
We don't just build connectivity, we embody it.
We are the global network civilization, and this is our map.
A map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny.
Instead, the future has a new and more hopeful motto: connectivity is destiny.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Strap yourselves in, we're going to Mars.
Not just a few astronauts -- thousands of people are going to colonize Mars.
And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.
Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars, and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.
That probably sounds preposterous, so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.
But first I want to discuss the obvious question: Why the heck should we do this?
12 years ago, I gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.
We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.
A single, large asteroid could take us out forever.
To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.
Think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.
And there's another reason we should go: exploration is in our DNA.
Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.
This stuff is inside us.
And they prospered doing that.
Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored.
Yes, we could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.
But think for a moment, what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.
He excited an entire generation to dream.
Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at Earth, as we struggle to survive on Mars, and realize how precious the home planet is.
So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.
But first, a few fascinating facts about where we're going.
This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
Mars is not our sister planet.
It's far less than half the size of the Earth, and yet despite the fact that it's smaller, the surface area of Mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on, because the Earth is mostly covered by water.
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times thinner than on Earth -- and it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
It's really cold there.
The average temperature is minus 81 degrees, although there is quite a range of temperature.
A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth, plus about 39 minutes.
Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.
And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day, Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth, and it's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.
Now, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like, but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.
Here's the problem. Mars is a long way away, a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.
The Moon is 250,000 miles away and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.
Mars is 250 million miles away and it will take us eight months to get there -- 240 days.
And that's only if we launch on a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.
240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
And meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.
We and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians, have actually sent 44 rockets there, and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.
Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.
And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.
It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans, and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station, and we decided to do something called the shuttle instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.
The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ... how soon will the first humans actually land here?
Now, some pundits think if we got there by 2050, that'd be a pretty good achievement.
These days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040. Maybe they can. I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
But frankly, I don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, because we will already be there.
We're going to land on Mars in 2027.
And the reason is this man is determined to make that happen.
His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
Now, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025, but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am -- and that's going a ways -- so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.
Still... you've got to ask yourself, can this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.
Where was this 10 years ago?
That's the Tesla electric automobile.
In 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying, we would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.
And where was that? That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.
10 years ago, SpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.
So I think it's a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than 10 years and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years will get us to Mars by 2027.
Now, you need to know this: governments and robots no longer control this game.
Private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars.
And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there? Now, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040, or we may get there a long time before NASA, but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
Let's look at the problem this way.
Here's what you need to live on Earth: food, water, shelter and clothing.
And here's what you need to live on Mars: all of the above, plus oxygen.
So let's look at the most important thing on this list first.
Water is the basis of all life as we know it, and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live, so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
And if you look at Mars, it looks really dry, it looks like the entire planet is a desert.
But it turns out that it's not.
The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.
And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us -- and by the way, that's a real photograph -- that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.
It's not a bad place to start a colony.
Now, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008, showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice -- that white stuff is ice.
In the second picture, which is four days later than the first picture, you can see that some of it is evaporating.
Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars as well as glaciers.
In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted, most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.
So there's plenty of water there, but most of it's ice, most of it's underground, it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.
This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington back in 1998.
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.
So this device can extract all the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars.
Next we have to worry about what we will breathe.
Frankly, I was really shocked to find out that NASA has this problem worked out.
This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.
I love this thing.
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially, that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.
And you have to remember that CO2 -- carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere -- CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
Now, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020 is going to have one of these devices aboard, and it will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely.
But the secret to this -- and that's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go to be scalable by a factor of 100.
Next, what will we eat? Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food, but we're not going to be able to grow more than 15 to 20 percent of our food there, at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.
In the meantime, most of our food will arrive from Earth, and it will be dried.
And then we need some shelter.
At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves.
But this really only works during the daytime.
There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
So we really have to go underground.
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars, by and large, is perfect for making bricks.
And NASA has figured this one out, too.
They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks, shove them in a microwave oven, and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.
Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes, of which there are plenty.
And finally there's clothing.
On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us, which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times, and we're constantly pushing out against that.
On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.
So Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radiation and keep us warm.
So let's think about this for a minute. Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.
So that leads to the next big -- really big step -- in living the good life on Mars.
And that's terraforming the planet: making it more like Earth, reengineering an entire planet.
That sounds like a lot of hubris, but the truth is that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.
First we've got to warm it up.
Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.
The answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars, both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide -- dry ice.
If we heat it up, it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.
And as we know, CO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.
Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail and focus it -- it essentially serves as a mirror -- and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.
As the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it, and it will go into the atmosphere.
It actually won't take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising, probably less than 20 years.
Right now, on a perfect day at the equator, in the middle of summer on Mars, temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees, but then they go down to minus 100 at night.
(Laughter)
What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect: enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars -- especially the ice in the ground -- melt.
Then we get some real magic.
As the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.
We get more protection from radiation, more atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer, so we get running water and that makes crops possible.
Then more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
It will rain and it will snow on Mars.
And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure so that we can throw away those space suits.
We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive.
Eventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.
We'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable, and frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish.
But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.
There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do with our own bodies.
In biology right now, we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics, what the genes in our own bodies are doing, and certainly, eventually, our own evolution.
We could end up with a species of human being on Earth that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.
But what would you do there? How would you live? It's going to be the same as it is on Earth.
Somebody's going to start a restaurant, somebody's going to build an iron foundry.
Someone will make documentary movies of Mars and sell them on Earth.
Some idiot will start a reality TV show.
(Laughter)
There will be software companies, there will be hotels, there will be bars.
This much is certain: it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes, and I think it will be the most inspiring.
Ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars.
Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.
Remember when we landed humans on the Moon?
When that happened, people looked at each other and said, "If we can do this, we can do anything." What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?
Most importantly, it will make us a spacefaring species.
And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth.
We will never be the last of our kind.
Thank you.
I want to introduce you to an amazing woman.
Her name is Davinia.
Davinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18, and now lives just outside of Washington, DC.
She's not a high-powered political staffer, nor a lobbyist.
She'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable, but she's having the most remarkable impact.
What's incredible about Davinia is that she's willing to spend time every single week focused on people who are not her: people not her in her neighborhood, her state, nor even in her country -- people she'd likely never meet.
Davinia's impact started a few years ago when she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook, and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls' education.
She wasn't expecting a huge response, but 700,000 pennies later, she's now sent over 120 girls to school.
When we spoke last week, she told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank every time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies.
Now -- Davinia is not alone. Far from it. She's part of a growing movement.
And there's a name for people like Davinia: global citizens.
A global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state, a tribe or a nation, but as a member of the human race, and someone who is prepared to act on that belief, to tackle our world's greatest challenges.
Our work is focused on finding, supporting and activating global citizens.
They exist in every country and among every demographic.
I want to make the case to you today that the world's future depends on global citizens.
I'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world, then every single one of the major challenges we face — from poverty, climate change, gender inequality — these issues become solvable.
They are ultimately global issues, and they can ultimately only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.
Now, some people's immediate reaction to this idea is that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening.
So I'd like to share with you a little of my story today, how I ended up here, how it connects with Davinia and, hopefully, with you.
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia, I was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?" You might have been one yourself.
I used to ask my mum the most annoying questions.
I'd ask her questions like, "Mum, why I can't I dress up and play with puppets all day?" "Why do you want fries with that?" "What is a shrimp, and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie?"
(Laughter)
"And mum -- this haircut. Why?"
(Laughter)
The worst haircut, I think. Still terrible.
As a "why" kid, I thought I could change the world, and it was impossible to convince me otherwise.
And when I was 12 and in my first year of high school, I started raising money for communities in the developing world.
We were a really enthusiastic group of kids, and we raised more money than any other school in Australia.
And so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more. It was 1998. We were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila.
But don't let the romance of that name fool you, because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something, anything of value.
That night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever, because when it came time to go to sleep, we simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom with myself, Sonny Boy, and the rest of his family, seven of us in this long line, with the smell of rubbish all around us and cockroaches crawling all around.
And I didn't sleep a wink, but I lay awake thinking to myself, "Why should anyone have to live like this when I have so much?
Why should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he's born, or what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'" I just didn't get it, and I needed to understand why.
Now, I only later came to understand that the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines was the result of decisions made or not made, man-made, by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments who had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart.
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have.
And if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy, it wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived, because the core of the problem lay elsewhere.
And as I worked on community development projects over the coming years trying to help build schools, train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS, I came to see that community development should be driven by communities themselves, and that although charity is necessary, it's not sufficient.
We need to confront these challenges on a global scale and in a systemic way.
And the best thing I could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change.
That's why, a few years later, I joined with a group of college friends in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia.
We had this dream of staging this small concert around the time of the G20 with local Aussie artists, and it suddenly exploded one day when we got a phone call from Bono, the Edge and Pearl Jam, who all agreed to headline our concert.
I got a little bit excited that day, as you can see.
(Laughter)
But to our amazement, the Australian government heard our collective voices, and they agreed to double investment into global health and development -- an additional 6.2 billion dollars. It felt like --
(Applause)
It felt like this incredible validation.
By rallying citizens together, we helped persuade our government to do the unthinkable, and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders.
But here's the thing: it didn't last.
See, there was a change in government, and six years later, all that new money disappeared. What did we learn? We learned that one-off spikes are not enough.
We needed a sustainable movement, not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn.
And it needed to happen everywhere; otherwise, every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism that they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone.
And so this is what we embarked upon.
And as we embarked upon this challenge, we asked ourselves, how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army to win these fights for the long term?
We could only think of one way. We needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign into long-term passion.
It had to be part of their identity.
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal.
And there was only one name for it: Global Citizen. But this is not about any one organization.
This is about citizens taking action.
And research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues, only 18 percent have done anything about it.
It's not that people don't want to act. It's often that they don't know how to take action, or that they believe that their actions will have no effect.
So we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically.
And as we did so, we discovered something really thrilling, that when you make global citizenship your mission, you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies.
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global. So, too, is climate change, human rights, gender equality, even conflict.
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues.
But how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens?
Well, we used the universal language: music.
We launched the Global Citizen Festival in the heart of New York City in Central Park, and we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate.
We made sure that these festivals coincided with the UN General Assembly meeting, so that leaders who need to hear our voices couldn't possible ignore them.
But there was a twist: you couldn't buy a ticket.
You had to earn it.
You had to take action on behalf of a global cause, and only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify.
Activism is the currency.
I had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing.
For me, citizenship means you have to act, and that's what we required.
And amazingly, it worked.
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens in the New York area alone earned enough points to qualify.
Globally, we've now signed up citizens in over 150 countries around the world.
And last year, we signed up more than 100,000 new members each and every week of the whole year.
See, we don't need to create global citizens from nothing.
We're already everywhere. We just need to be organized and motivated to start acting.
And this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia, who started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012.
Here's what she did. It wasn't rocket science. She started writing letters, emailing politicians' offices.
She volunteered her time in her local community. That's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies -- a lot of pennies.
Now, maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you.
How will that achieve anything?
Well, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone.
Her actions, alongside 142,000 other global citizens', led the US government to double their investment into Global Partnership for Education.
And here's Dr. Raj Shah, the head of USAID, making that announcement.
See, when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other, it's amazing to see their collective power.
Global citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank to boost their investment into water and sanitation.
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage at Global Citizen, and Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019.
Global citizens encouraged by the late-night host Stephen Colbert launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.
Erna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, got the message, committing to double investment into girls' education.
Global citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian, UK, and Australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication.
They got together and committed 665 million dollars.
But despite all of this momentum, we face some huge challenges.
See, you might be thinking to yourself, how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues?
Indeed, the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said, "All politics is local." That's what always got politicians elected: to seek, gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests.
I experienced this for the first time when I was 21 years old.
I took a meeting with a then-Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless --
[Alexander Downer]
(Laughter)
And behind closed doors, I shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty.
I said, "Minister -- Australia has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
We can do this." And he paused, looked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes, and he said, "Hugh, no one gives a funk about foreign aid." Except he didn't use the word "funk." He went on.
He said we need to look after our own backyard first.
This is, I believe, outdated, even dangerous thinking.
Or as my late grandfather would say, complete BS.
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another.
It pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another.
The whole world is our backyard, and we ignore it at our peril.
See, look what happened when we ignored Rwanda, when we ignore Syria, when we ignore climate change.
Political leaders ought to give a "funk" because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty comes right to our shore.
Now, global citizens — they understand this.
We live in a time that favors the global citizen, in an age where every single voice can be heard.
See, do you remember when the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year 2000? The most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election.
There was no social media.
Today, billions of citizens have more tools, more access to information, more capacity to influence than ever before.
Both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us.
The world has changed, and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history.
So where are we? So we run this amazing festival, we've scored some big policy wins, and citizens are signing up all over the world.
But have we achieved our mission? No. We have such a long way to go.
But this is the opportunity that I see.
The concept of global citizenship, self-evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways, has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live.
We, as global citizens, now have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change around the world.
So in the months and years ahead, global citizens will hold world leaders accountable to ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development are tracked and implemented.
Global citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs to end diseases like polio and malaria.
Global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe, increasing the frequency, quality and impact of their actions.
These dreams are within reach.
Imagine an army of millions growing into tens of millions, connected, informed, engaged and unwilling to take no for an answer.
Over all these years, I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.
Sadly, I've been unable to.
We met long before social media, and his address has now been relocated by the authorities, as often happens with slums.
I'd love to sit down with him, wherever he is, and share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.
Thanks to him and so many others, I came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people — the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world, the global citizens.
Global citizens who stand together, who ask the question "Why?," who reject the naysayers, and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share.
I'm a global citizen.
Are you?
Thank you.
(Applause)
[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.] [The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people] [hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.] [What does this mean?] [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]
This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.
The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world.
We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "OK, we want an anonymous company, can you give us one?" So you actually get to see the emails, you get to see the exchanges of messages, you get to see the mechanics of how this works, how this operates.
Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.
The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.
We've also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies.
There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend, who happens to be a top cellist.
And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents.
Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should we care about this?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should, it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects all of us.
Now, for my organization Global Witness, this exposé has been phenomenal.
We have the world's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.
Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing, and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.
I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.
So you can have one company stacked inside another company, stacked inside another company, making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities, journalists, civil society to really understand what's going on.
I also think it's interesting that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.
And that's perhaps because some prominent US people just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.
Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore.
It's just because of the way in which offshore works, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada, you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.
In fact, in a number of US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card.
That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.
This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.
Now, at Global Witness, we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.
How does this actually work?
So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds.
These were all preliminary meetings, and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands, but it really shows the problem with the system.
It's also important to not just think about this as individual cases.
This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.
It's not just about a particular senior politician who's been caught up in a scandal.
This is about how a system works, that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And in order to tackle this, we need to change the game.
We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder.
This may seem like doom and gloom, like there's nothing we can do about it, like nothing has ever changed, like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.
But as a natural optimist, I do see that we are starting to get some change.
Over the last couple of years, we've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership.
This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.
And since then, the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.
One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.
There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate, but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.
So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks, this huge peek into the offshore world, be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say, "Secrecy like this is not good for business." We need political leaders to recognize the problem, and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.
Together, we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion, corruption, money laundering to flourish.
I'm a copy editor. I work at The New Yorker, and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team: every little movement gets picked over by the critics -- God forbid you should commit an error.
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine.
We work at the level of the sentence, maybe the paragraph, the words, the punctuation.
Our business is in the details.
We put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the "i" in "naïve." We impose house style.
Every publication has a house style.
The New Yorker's is particularly distinctive.
We sometimes get teased for our style.
Imagine -- we still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen, as if that word had just been coined.
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age" and that diaeresis over "coöperate," and you know you're reading The New Yorker.
Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.
There is a related role called query proofreading, or page-OK'ing.
Whereas copyediting is mechanical, query proofreading is interpretive.
We make suggestions to the author through the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or point out unintentional repetitions and supply compelling alternatives.
Our purpose is to make the author look good.
Note that we give our proofs not directly to the author, but to the editor. This often creates a good cop / bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor — I'll use that as an umbrella term — is invariably the bad cop.
If we do our job well, we're invisible, but as soon as we make a mistake, we copy editors become glaringly visible.
Here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.
[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment of populist no-nothingism in the Republican Party, endorsed Trump.]
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?" a reader wrote. "Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?"
Ouch. There's no excuse for this mistake.
But I like it: "no-nothingism." It might be American vernacular for "nihilism."
(Laughter)
Here, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:
[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing; only her unsteady gait belied her age.]
He added: "Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,' and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence. Come on! Get it together."
Belie: to give a false impression.
It should have been "betrayed."
E.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker: "They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."
(Laughter)
And it's true -- we get a lot of complaints about commas. "Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?" There may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr." One wag wrote:
["Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain, the comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"]
(Laughter)
Ah, well. In this case, those commas are well-placed, except that there should not be one between "maniac" and "on."
(Laughter)
Also, if we must have commas around "at least," we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase: "... -- or, at least, restrain --" Perfect.
(Applause)
Then there's this: "Love you, love your magazine, but can you please stop writing massive numbers as text?"
[two and a half million ...]
No.
(Laughter)
One last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:
["Those long stringy things are vocal cords, not chords."]
The outraged reader added, "I'm sure I'm not the first to write regarding this egregious proofreading error, but I'm equally sure I won't be the last. Fie!"
(Laughter)
I used to like getting mail.
There is a pact between writers and editors.
The editor never sells out the writer, never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long.
A great editor saves a writer from her excesses.
Copy editors, too, have a code; we don't advertise our oversights.
I feel disloyal divulging them here, so let's have look at what we do right.
Somehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness.
But I work with writers who know how to have their way with me.
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy," since the early 80s.
And he's one of my favorites, even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause.
Here is one from a story about Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy:
[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water, its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.]
(Laughter)
This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore.
But what could I do?
Technically, the "like" should be an "as," but it sounds ridiculous, as if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile -- "as when you open a box of linguine."
(Laughter)
I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy and let the sentence stand.
(Laughter)
Generally, if I think something is wrong, I query it three times.
I told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,
"Only three?"
So, he has learned to hold out.
Recently, he wrote a story for "Talk of the Town," that's the section at the front of the magazine with short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum to the introduction of doggie bags in France.
Sandy's story was about the return to the Bronx of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
There were three things in it that I had to challenge.
First, a grammar query.
The justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote,
[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]
Now, unlike with the hurricane, with this "like," the author didn't have the excuse of describing hurricane damage. "Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object, which is a noun.
This "like" had to be an "as." "As in an old, mostly dark painting."
Second, a spelling issue.
The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:
["It will be just a minute.
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]
Mic'ed? The music industry spells it "mic" because that's how it's spelled on the equipment.
I'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling, and I was distraught to think that "mic'ed" would get into the magazine on my watch.
(Laughter)
New Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."
Finally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number as its antecedent.
[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]
"Their" is plural and "everyone," its antecedent, is singular.
You would never say, "Everyone were there." Everyone was there. Everyone is here. But people say things like, "Everyone held their breath" all the time.
To give it legitimacy, copy editors call it "the singular 'their,'" as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.
(Laughter)
It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it.
I couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath," or "Everyone held his breath," or "Everyone held his or her breath." Whatever I suggested had to blend in.
I asked, through the editor, if the author would consider changing it to "All in the vicinity held their breath," because "all" is plural. Nope.
I tried again: "All those present held their breath?" I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.
But the editor pointed out that we could not have "present" and "presence" in the same sentence.
When the final proof came back, the author had accepted "as" for "like," and "miked" for "mic'ed." But on "Everyone held their breath," he stood his ground.
Two out of three isn't bad.
In the same issue, in that piece on doggie bags in France, there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman.
I wonder, when the mail comes in, which will have offended the readers more.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have one more reason for optimism: climate change.
Maybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact.
On December 12, 2015, in Paris, under the United Nations, 195 governments got together and unanimously -- if you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is -- unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us.
Now, that is a remarkable achievement.
(Applause)
But it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago. 2009, Copenhagen. Who remembers Copenhagen? Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement, the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably.
Why did it fail miserably? For many different reasons, but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global North and the global South.
So now, six months after this failure, I was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations.
You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job.
The global mood on climate change was in the trash can.
No one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible.
In fact, neither did I. If you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience, I'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history.
On my first press conference, a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres, do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?" And without engaging brain, I heard me utter, "Not in my lifetime." Well, you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman who was their new boss.
And I was horrified, too.
Now, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself.
I was actually horrified at the consequences of what I had just said, at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live.
It was frankly a horrible moment for me, and I thought, well, no, hang on, hang on.
Impossible is not a fact, it's an attitude. It's only an attitude.
And I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.
So I don't know — No, just this? Thanks. I don't know — what you would do if you were told your job is to save the planet.
Put that on the job description.
And you have full responsibility, but you have absolutely no authority, because governments are sovereign in every decision that they take.
Well, I would really love to know what you would do on the first Monday morning, but here's what I did: I panicked.
(Laughter)
And then I panicked again, because I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem.
And then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem, but I do know one thing: we have got to change the tone of this conversation.
Because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism.
And here, I use optimism as a very simple word, but let's understand it in its broader sense.
Let's understand it as courage, hope, trust, solidarity, the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind.
Well, you can imagine that I thought that without that, there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.
And for six years, I have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system, no matter what the questions from the press -- and I have gotten better at those -- and no matter what the evidence to the contrary.
And believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence.
But relentless optimism into the system.
And pretty soon, we began to see changes happening in many areas, precipitated by thousands of people, including many of you here today, and I thank you.
And this TED community will not be surprised if I tell you the first area in which we saw remarkable change was... technology.
We began to see that clean technologies, in particular renewable energy technologies, began to drop price and increase in capacity, to the point where today we are already building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities, to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent buildings.
And with this shift in technologies, we were able to begin to understand that there was a shift in the economic equation, because we were able to recognize that yes, there are huge costs to climate change, and yes, there are compounded risks.
But there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits, because the dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air, better health, better transportation, more livable cities, more energy security, more energy access to the developing world.
In sum, a better world than what we have now.
And with that understanding, you should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were, the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through, first through nonnational governments, the private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies, investors, city leaders, faith communities, because they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest.
This can actually improve their bottom line.
And it wasn't just the usual suspects.
I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say — privately, of course — he did not know how he was going to change his company, but he is going to change it, because he's interested in long-term viability.
Well, now we have a shift in the economic equation, and with that, with broader support from everyone, it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest.
And when we asked countries to begin to identify how they could contribute to global efforts but based on their national interest, 189 countries out of 195, 189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans, based on their national interest, concurrent with their priorities, consistent with their national sustainable development plans.
Well, once you protect the core interests of nations, then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path, onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades, but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy, into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy, And the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate, but they are only the first step, and they will improve over time.
And the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding.
is legally binding. And the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding, and the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy
And here's the more important part: What did we have before?
Now what do we have?
Now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors, but all of them contributing to a common goal and along a path with environmental integrity.
Well, once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding, then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement.
(Applause)
So, as I look back over the past six years, first I remember the day the Paris agreement was adopted.
I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room.
5,000 people jumping out of their seats, crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen, because so many people had worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality.
And it wasn't just those who had participated directly.
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.
And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy, the jeweler said to him, "You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now, because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change." "But," the jeweler said, "have you heard, the governments have just come to a decision, and Tahiti could have a chance." Well, what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, here is a possible chance.
I'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do.
We've only just started our work on climate change.
And in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years.
But I do believe that we have come over the past six years from the impossible to the now unstoppable. And how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration, that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global needs, and that if we understand that, we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously.
And as I look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century -- food security, water security, home security, forced migration -- I see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet.
But we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change and we can understand that we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality.
Because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers, and that your loss is my gain.
Well, now that we're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that we are not just so interconnected, but increasingly interdependent on each other, your loss is no longer my gain.
We're either all losers or we all can be winners.
But we are going to have to decide between zero and sum.
We're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us.
We've done it once. We can do it again.
Thanks.
(Applause)
I'm turning 44 next month, and I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year, a year of fulfillment, realization.
I have that sense, not because of anything particular in store for me, but because I read it would be a good year in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.
"He felt his own age, forty-four ..." wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night," "... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man, as if he had arrived."
Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me.
But I also know that he was; for all of us -- you, me, the subject of his book, age more or less in step, proceed from birth along the same great sequence: through the wonders and confinements of childhood; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; the empowerments and millstones of adulthood; the recognitions and resignations of old age.
There are patterns to life, and they are shared.
As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."
We don't simply live these patterns. We record them, too. We write them down in books, where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize.
Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will be, too.
So they have for millennia.
As James Salter wrote, "Life passes into pages if it passes into anything."
And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind: if life passed into pages, there were, somewhere, passages written about every age.
If I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative. I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass.
I was then 37 years old, "an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor.
I was prone to meditating on time and age.
An illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.
And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable, time seeing through what circumstance did not.
It was all a bit disheartening.
A list, though, would last.
To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting, would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future, whether we made it there or not.
And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed, searching pages and pages for ages and ages.
Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years. "Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations," "sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."
I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative.
For starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly.
Christopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf" to describe a man at 53, only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36.
(Laughter)
I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next, and that people may experience the same age differently.
But even so, as the list coalesced, so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror, did the life that I had been living: finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;" emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;" learning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms [I would] not be coming back to." There I was.
Of course, there we all are.
Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here, and who today is 85 -- all those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov -- noted to me that, like art and like color, literature helps us to remember what we've experienced.
And indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather, he nodded in recognition.
He was then 95 and soon to die, which, wrote Roberto Bolaño, "... is the same as never dying." And looking back, he said to me that, yes, Proust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die, just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right that at 90, we are sure we will.
It had happened to him, as to them.
Now the list is done: a hundred years.
And looking back over it, I know that I am not done.
I still have my life to live, still have many more pages to pass into.
And mindful of Mailer, I await 44.
Thank you.

Periods. Blood. Menstruation. Gross. Secret. Hidden. Why?
A natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month for about half of her life.
A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it.
Yet we consider it a taboo.
We feel awkward and shameful talking about it.
When I got my first periods, I was told to keep it a secret from others -- even from my father and brother.
Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks, our biology teacher skipped the subject.
(Laughter)
You know what I learned from it?
I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it.
I learned to be ashamed of my body.
I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent.
Research in various parts of India shows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods.
And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it.
You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to, who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon.
Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections.
But in India, only 12 percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods.
If you do the math, 88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods.
I was one of them. I grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand, where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful.
So when I started getting my periods, I began with using rags.
After every use I would wash and reuse them.
But to store them, I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating.
Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse, and I would often get rashes and infections using them.
I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town.
Another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods.
I think you all must be aware of it, but I'll still list it for the few who don't.
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed.
I had to wash my bed sheet after every period, even if it was not stained.
I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance.
You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women.
Ironically, most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family.
After all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms.
And in the absence of any intervention, it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation.
During my years of work in this field, I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately.
They're not allowed to take baths during periods, and in some households they are even secluded from other family members.
About 85 percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month.
Can you imagine what this does to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl?
The psychological trauma that this inflicts, affecting her personality, her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years?
I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years, until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin, changed my perception about menstruation forever.
In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design.
We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him.
Tuhin knew little about periods.
(Laughter)
He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month.
(Laughter)
Yeah. He was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society.
In order to help me with my cramps, he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation.
When he shared his findings with me, I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself.
And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths.
That's when we wondered: if we, being so well educated, were so ill-informed about menstruation, there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too.
To study -- to understand the problem better, I undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it.
While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon, during my research, I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well.
And it exists with the educated urban class, also.
While talking to many parents and teachers, I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle.
And -- but they lacked the proper means themselves.
And since it is a taboo, they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it.
Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven, but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine.
And since it is a taboo, teachers still skip the subject altogether.
So school does not teach girls about periods, parents don't talk about it.
Where do the girls go?
Two decades ago and now -- nothing has changed.
I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered: What if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own -- something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls?
During my research, I was collecting a lot of stories.
These were stories of experiences of girls during their periods.
These stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle.
That's what we wanted.
We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it.
We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods.
So we decided to create a comic book, where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way.
To represent girls in their different phases of puberty, we have three characters.
Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet, Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period.
There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.
Through her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management.
While making the book, we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive.
During our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book.
They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own.
Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.
(Laughter)
The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.
Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India.
And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.
We made the final version of the book, called "Menstrupedia Comic" and launched in September last year.
And so far, more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and --
(Applause)
Thank you.
And 10 different countries. We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries.
15 schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation.
(Applause)
I am amazed to see how volunteers, individuals, parents, teachers, school principals, have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities, have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo.
I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse, not a disease, but a welcoming change in a girl's life. And I would --
(Applause)
And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here.
Dear parents, if you would be ashamed of periods, your daughters would be, too.
So please be period positive.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
How do you find a dinosaur?
Sounds impossible, doesn't it? It's not. And the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use.
And I'm going to tell you the secret.
First, find rocks of the right age.
Second, those rocks must be sedimentary rocks.
And third, layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed. That's it. Find those three things and get yourself on the ground, chances are good that you will find fossils.
Now let me break down this formula. Organisms exist only during certain geological intervals.
So you have to find rocks of the right age, depending on what your interests are.
If you want to find trilobites, you have to find the really, really old rocks of the Paleozoic -- rocks between a half a billion and a quarter-billion years old.
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, don't look in the Paleozoic, you won't find them.
They hadn't evolved yet.
You have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic, and in the case of dinosaurs, between 235 and 66 million years ago.
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point, because the Earth is, to a coarse degree, geologically mapped.
This is hard-won information.
The annals of Earth history are written in rocks, one chapter upon the next, such that the oldest pages are on bottom and the youngest on top.
It's not. Now, were it quite that easy, geologists would rejoice. The library of Earth is an old one.
It has no librarian to impose order.
Operating over vast swaths of time, myriad geological processes offer every possible insult to the rocks of ages.
Most pages are destroyed soon after being written.
Some pages are overwritten, creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes.
Pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time are never truly safe.
Unlike the Moon -- our dead, rocky companion -- the Earth is alive, pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological metabolism.
Lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts all date back to about the age of the Solar System.
Moon rocks are forever.
Earth rocks, on the other hand, face the perils of a living lithosphere.
All will suffer ruination, through some combination of mutilation, compression, folding, tearing, scorching and baking.
Thus, the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled.
The library is vast and magnificent -- but decrepit.
And it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently.
Nature provided no card catalog for geologists -- this would have to be invented.
Five thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts on clay tablets, the Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans.
We were geologically illiterate, unaware of the antiquity of our own planet and ignorant of our connection to deep time.
It wasn't until the turn of the 19th century that our blinders were removed, first, with the publication of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth," in which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end; and then, with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain, the first country-scale geological map, giving us for the first time predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur.
After that, you could say things like, "If we go over there, we should be in the Jurassic," or, "If we go up over that hill, we should find the Cretaceous."
So now, if you want to find trilobites, get yourself a good geological map and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do, find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.
Now of course, you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock, a rock made by sand and mud.
You can't have a fossil in an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite, or in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed.
And you have to get yourself in a desert.
It's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts; they lived on every land mass and in every imaginable environment.
It's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today, a place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks, and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface.
So find those three things: rocks of the right age, that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert, and get yourself on the ground, and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock.
Here's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia.
Every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone.
So when you're in that right situation, it's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not; you're going to find fossils.
The question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant?
And to help with that, I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula, which is this: get as far away from other paleontologists as possible.
(Laughter)
It's not that I don't like other paleontologists.
When you go to a place that's relatively unexplored, you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of finding something that's new to science.
So that's my formula for finding dinosaurs, and I've applied it all around the world.
In the austral summer of 2004, I went to the bottom of South America, to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina, to prospect for dinosaurs: a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age, in a desert, a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists.
And we found this.
This is a femur, a thigh bone, of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.
That bone is 2.2 meters across.
That's over seven feet long.
Now, unfortunately, that bone was isolated.
We dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around.
But it made us hungry to go back the next year for more.
And on the first day of that next field season, I found this: another two-meter femur, only this time not isolated, this time associated with 145 other bones of a giant plant eater.
And after three more hard, really brutal field seasons, the quarry came to look like this.
And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me.
The giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur, we would eventually call "Dreadnoughtus schrani." Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail.
It stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder, and all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons.
People ask me sometimes, "Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?" That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.
Now, one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species, you get to name it.
And I've always thought it a shame that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive, lumbering platters of meat on the landscape.
(Laughter)
They're not. Big herbivores can be surly, and they can be territorial -- you do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo.
The bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears.
So can you imagine a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus in the breeding season, defending a territory?
That animal would have been incredibly dangerous, a menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear.
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus," or, "fears nothing."
Now, to grow so large, an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been a model of efficiency.
That long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment, passively controlling its temperature.
And that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.
Dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation, taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few.
And these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance, giving them immense stability, because when you're 65 tons, when you're literally as big as a house, the penalty for falling over is death.
Yeah, these animals are big and tough, but they won't take a blow like that.
Dreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break and pierce lungs. Organs burst. If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus, you don't get to fall down in life -- even once.
Now, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects, its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis, exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock.
As layer upon layer of sediment accumulated, pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace.
And then came the long ... nothing.
Epoch after epoch of sameness, nonevents without number.
All the while, the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium within its rocky grave.
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.
The dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse. The continents drifted. The mammals rose. The Ice Age came.
And then, in East Africa, an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.
These brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong.
But they excelled at covering ground, and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest, they dispersed across the planet, ravishing every ecosystem they encountered, along the way, inventing culture and metalworking and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes to the surface of the Moon.
With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet, it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia.
I was that ape.
And standing there, alone in the desert, it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small.
But the Earth is very, very old.
And over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable.
That's the magic of the geological record.
Thus, multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils, each one a small miracle, but collectively, inevitable.
Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs.
This easily might not have been.
But we only get one history, and it's the one that we have.
But this particular reality was not inevitable.
The tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin.
The pivotal, calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out, setting the stage for the modern world as we know it didn't have to be.
It could've just been another day -- a Thursday, perhaps -- among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.
But over geological time, improbable, nearly impossible events do occur.
Along the path from our wormy, Cambrian ancestors to primates dressed in suits, innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality.
The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years.
Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew-like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?
I once stood at the head of the Missouri River and bestraddled it.
There, it's nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture, high in the Bitterroot Mountains.
The stream next to it runs a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond.
Those two streams -- they look identical.
But one is an anonymous trickle of water, and the other is the Missouri River.
Now go down to the mouth of the Missouri, near St. Louis, and it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal.
But go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri, and human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special.
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.
You would never guess that they would amount to anything special, and they probably wouldn't have, were it not for that pesky asteroid.
Now, make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run. You will never get the same result.
No doubt, those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable, but they would not be our world and they would not have our history.
There are an infinite number of histories that we could've had.
We only get one, and wow, did we ever get a good one.
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car really existed.
Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective and humility.
The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own.
They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.
And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting.
Right now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe, it can rightly be called the sixth extinction.
Only unlike the dinosaurs, we can see it coming.
And unlike the dinosaurs, we can do something about it.
That choice is ours.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula:
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."
"Share a childhood story."
"Divulge a personal secret."
"End with an inspiring call to action."
No. That's not how to think of a TED Talk.
In fact, if you overuse those devices, you're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative.
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common, and I would like to share that thing with you,
because over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat, listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these.
I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time, and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk.
And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different, they actually do have one key common ingredient.
And it's this: Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift -- a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.
Let me show you what I mean. Here's Haley. She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly, she's terrified.
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!
Over the course of 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other before, are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain and with each other.
They're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns.
And I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions.
There's something even more startling happening.
Let's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment.
There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle.
But look here, right here -- a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea.
And incredibly, this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening.
That's right; in just a few minutes, a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds, just by people listening to a voice and watching a face.
But wait -- what is an idea anyway?
Well, you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world.
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic.
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage.
Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids' future.
(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy -- building from bamboo is beautiful.
(Video) Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us, it's strong, it's elegant, it's earthquake-resistant.
CA: Chimamanda Adichie -- people are more than a single identity.
(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas, and not just randomly.
They're carefully linked together.
Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview.
It's your brain's operating system.
It's how you navigate the world.
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.
So, for example, if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable, then when you see this, you'll react like this.
then when you see this, But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous, you'll react a little bit differently.
So, it's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial.
You need them to be as reliable as possible -- a guide, to the scary but wonderful real world out there.
Now, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different.
For example, how does your worldview react when you see this image:
(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me? "A woman of faith," "an expert," maybe even "a sister"? Or "oppressed," "brainwashed," "a terrorist"?
CA: Whatever your answer, there are millions of people out there who would react very differently.
So that's why ideas really matter.
If communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever, how someone thinks about the world, and shaping their actions both now and well into the future.
Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.
So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience, here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:
One, limit your talk to just one major idea.
Ideas are complex things; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you're most passionate about, and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly.
You have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.
So pick one idea, and make it the through-line running through your entire talk, so that everything you say links back to it in some way.
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience, you have to get their permission to welcome you in.
And the main tool to achieve that? Curiosity. Stir your audience's curiosity.
Use intriguing, provocative questions to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining.
If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview, they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap.
And once you've sparked that desire, it will be so much easier to start building your idea.
Three, build your idea, piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience already understands.
You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds -- but not your language, their language.
You start where they are.
The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences.
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together, because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern, based on an idea that the listener already understands.
For example, when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR, she said, "It's as if, for the first time, you had a word processor to edit DNA.
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily." Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds.
It's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends, and find out which parts they get confused by.
Four, here's the final tip: Make your idea worth sharing.
By that I mean, ask yourself the question: "Who does this idea benefit?" And I need you to be honest with the answer.
If the idea only serves you or your organization, then, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing.
The audience will see right through you.
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk, one that can be a gift to them and to all of us.
How much do you need to know about a person before you'd feel comfortable making a loan?
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you.
What would you need to know about that person before you'd feel comfortable?
My mom came to the US from India in her late thirties.
She's a doctor in Brooklyn, and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services, whether they can pay right away or not.
I remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store or on the sidewalk, and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot for previous appointments.
She would thank them, and ask them about their families and their health.
She gave them credit because she trusted them.
Most of us are like my mom.
We would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to.
But most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them.
Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions don't know us on a personal level, but they do have a way of trusting us, and that's through our credit scores.
Our credit scores have been created through an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data.
And because of them, we have pretty much easy access to all of the goods and services that we need, from getting electricity to buying a home, or taking a risk and starting a business.
But... there are 2.5 billion people around the world that don't have a credit score.
That's a third of the world's population.
They don't have a score because there are no formal public records on them -- no bank accounts, no credit histories and no social security numbers.
And because they don't have a score, they don't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives.
They are not trusted.
So we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion.
So we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them using mobile data.
There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets.
And people are using them the same way that we do. They're texting their friends, they're looking up directions, they're browsing the Internet and they're even making financial transactions.
Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones, and it provides a really rich picture of a person's life.
Our customers give us access to this data and we capture it through our mobile application.
It helps us understand the creditworthiness of people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district.
She has three sons who she put through vocational school, and she's also the leader of her local chama, or savings group.
Jenipher's food stall does well.
She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses.
But she's not financially secure.
Any emergency could force her into debt.
And she has no discretionary income to improve her family's way of living, for emergencies, or for investing into growing her business.
If Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited.
She could get a microloan, but she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility.
And even then, the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business, averaging around 150 dollars.
Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent, they're financially risky.
And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history, she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.
But one day, Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan.
Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.
And here's what we saw.
So, bad news first.
Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history.
These are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank.
But there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer picture of her potential.
So for one, we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda.
Well, it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts.
We could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day, she actually had pretty regular travel patterns, and she was either at home or at her food stall.
And the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time.
We could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network.
Our data shows that people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers.
In Jenipher's case, she communicated with 89 different individuals, which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.
These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.
And after analyzing all of these different data points, we took the first risk and gave Jenipher a loan.
This is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal financial record.
But it proves trust.
By looking beyond income, we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay.
Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya in just the past year.
And our repayment rates are above 90 percent -- which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.
With something as simple as a credit score, we're giving people the power to build their own futures.
Our customers have used their loans for family expenses, emergencies, travel and for investing back into growing their businesses.
They're now building better economies and communities where more people can succeed.
Over the past two years of using our product, Jenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.
She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant.
She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank, because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week, and she told me how excited she was to get started.
She said, "Only my son believed I could do this.
I didn't think this was for me. "She's lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.
Our job now is to open the world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I'm an artist, but a little bit of a peculiar one.
I don't paint.
I can't draw.
My shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace on my report card.
You probably don't really want to see my photographs.
But there is one thing I know how to do: I know how to program a computer. I can code.
And people will tell me that 100 years ago, folks like me didn't exist, that it was impossible, that art made with data is a new thing, it's a product of our age, it's something that's really important to think of as something that's very "now." And that's true.
But there is an art form that's been around for a very long time that's really about using information, abstract information, to make emotionally resonant pieces.
And it's called music.
We've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right?
And if you think about what music is -- notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies -- these things are algorithms. These things are systems that are designed to unfold over time, to make us feel.
I came to the arts through music.
I was trained as a composer, and about 15 years ago, I started making pieces that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image, to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that's usually pictorial.
So what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn by the musical structure of the musicians onstage, and there's no accident that it looks like a plant, because the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant is what informed the musical structure in the first place.
So once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media, you can do some pretty cool stuff.
This is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival.
Really simple idea: you take every Academy Award Best Picture, you speed it up to one minute each and string them all together.
And so in 75 minutes, I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema.
And what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema.
So on the left, we've got Casablanca; on the right, we've got Chicago.
And you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read.
That's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the 1940s was 26 seconds, and now it's around six seconds.
This is a project that was inspired by some work that was funded by the US Federal Government in the early 2000s, to look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video.
And so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner, which is Britney Spears.
I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi photos of Britney Spears and trained my computer to find her face and her face alone.
I can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame, and this sort of is a little double commentary about surveillance in our society.
We are very fraught with anxiety about being watched, but then we obsess over celebrity.
What you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did with an artist named Lián Amaris.
What she did is very simple to explain and describe, but very hard to do.
She took 72 minutes of activity, getting ready for a night out on the town, and stretched it over three days and performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City.
I was there, too, with a film crew.
We filmed the whole thing, and then we reversed the process, speeding it up to 72 minutes again, so it looks like she's moving normally and the whole world is flying by.
At a certain point, I figured out that what I was doing was making portraits.
When you think about portraiture, you tend to think about stuff like this.
The guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart.
He's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States.
And on the right is his portrait of George Washington from 1796.
This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.
And if you look at this painting, there's a lot of symbolism, right?
We've got a rainbow out the window.
We've got a sword.
We've got a quill on the desk.
All of these things are meant to evoke George Washington as the father of the nation.
This is my portrait of George Washington.
And this is an eye chart, only instead of letters, they're words.
And what the words are is the 66 words in George Washington's State of the Union addresses that he uses more than any other president. So "gentlemen" has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric.
And it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most.
This is the eye chart for George W. Bush, who was president when I made this piece.
And how you get there, from "gentlemen" to "terror" in 43 easy steps, tells us a lot about American history, and gives you a different insight than you would have looking at a series of paintings.
These pieces provide a history lesson of the United States through the political rhetoric of its leaders.
Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits.
Bill Clinton spent a lot of time talking about the century in which he would no longer be president, but maybe his wife would be.
Lyndon Johnson was the first President to give his State of the Union addresses on prime-time television; he began every paragraph with the word "tonight." And Richard Nixon, or more accurately, his speechwriter, a guy named William Safire, spent a lot of time thinking about language and making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.
This project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures. It's an outdoor series of light boxes.
And it's important to note that they're to scale, so if you stand 20 feet back and you can read between those two black lines, you have 20 / 20 vision.
(Laughter)
This is a portrait. And there's a lot of these.
There's a lot of ways to do this with data.
I started looking for a way to think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture, something that's more about my country and how it works.
Every 10 years, we make a census in the United States.
We literally count people, find out who lives where, what kind of jobs we've got, the language we speak at home.
And this is important stuff -- really important stuff.
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.
It doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations.
And so in 2010, I decided to make my own census.
And I started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans.
And it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that's just sitting there for the taking. It's called online dating.
So in 2010, I joined 21 different online dating services, as a gay man, a straight man, a gay woman and a straight woman, in every zip code in America and downloaded about 19 million people's dating profiles -- about 20 percent of the adult population of the United States.
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.
This is going to become really freaking obvious.
Just go with me.
(Laughter)
So what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code.
And I looked at word analysis.
These are some dating profiles from 2010 with the word "lonely" highlighted.
If you look at these things topographically, if you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word, you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place.
You can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny.
This is the kinky map, so what this is showing you is that the women in Alaska need to get together with the men in southern New Mexico, and have a good time.
And I have this at a pretty granular level, so I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island are way more interested in being spanked than men in the western half of Long Island.
This will be your one takeaway from this whole conference.
You're going to remember that fact for, like, 30 years.
(Laughter)
When you bring this down to a cartographic level, you can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts.
You can replace the name of every city in the United States with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else.
If you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.
You've got "pretty." You've got "heartbreak." You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette." They play in a band and they smoke.
And right above that you can see "email." That's Redmond, Washington, which is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation.
Some of these you can guess -- so, Los Angeles is "acting" and San Francisco is "gay." Some are a little bit more heartbreaking.
In Baton Rouge, they talk about being curvy; downstream in New Orleans, they still talk about the flood.
Folks in the American capital will say they're interesting. People in Baltimore, Maryland, will say they're afraid.
This is New Jersey.
I grew up somewhere between "annoying" and "cynical."
(Laughter) (Applause)
And New York City's number one word is "now," as in, "Now I'm working as a waiter, but actually I'm an actor."
(Laughter)
Or, "Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU, but actually I'm an artist." If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur." That's Syracuse.
The best place to eat in Syracuse, New York, is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue.
That's where you would take somebody on a date.
I live somewhere between "unconditional" and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.
And this is gentrified North Brooklyn, so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous" and "hipsters" and "urbane." So that's maybe a more democratic portrait.
And the idea was, what if we made red-state and blue-state maps based on what we want to do on a Friday night?
This is a self-portrait. This is based on my email, about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.
You can think of this as a quantified selfie.
So what I'm doing is running a physics equation based on my personal data.
You have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with.
It started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang.
And everybody has gravity to one another, gravity based on how much they've been emailing, who they've been emailing with.
And it also does sentimental analysis, so if I say "I love you," you're heavier to me.
And you attract to my email addresses in the middle, which act like mainline stars.
And all the names are handwritten.
Sometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city.
This is a Walther PPK 9mm semiautomatic handgun that was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans about two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking.
Those are my cigarettes.
This is the house where the shooting took place.
This project involved a little bit of engineering. I've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft, with a computer driving it.
That computer and the mechanism are buried in a box.
The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.
There's a wire going through to the trigger, and the computer in the box is online.
It's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department, so that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans,
(Gunshot sound)
the gun fires. Now, there's a blank, so there's no bullet.
There's big light, big noise and most importantly, there's a casing.
There's about five shootings a day in New Orleans, so over the four months this piece was installed, the case filled up with bullets.
You guys know what this is -- you call this "data visualization." When you do it right, it's illuminating.
When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.
It reduces people to numbers. So watch out.
One last piece for you.
I spent the last summer as the artist in residence for Times Square.
And Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world.
One of the things people don't notice about it is it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth.
About every five seconds, someone commits a selfie in Times Square.
That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.
(Laughter)
These are some of them with their eyes centered.
Every civilization, will use the maximum level of technology available to make art. And it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture.
So I leave you with this: we're more than numbers. We're people, and we have dreams and ideas.
And reducing us to statistics is something that's done at our peril.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
Hello. This is my first trip, first time in life I'm outside of the walls of Gaza.
I'm so happy to be here.
(Applause)
My ambition always was to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel free to fly the sky, to touch the sky.
But that didn't happen. Simply, I live in Gaza, there is no airport.
All borders are closed on every side.
We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world.
The only thing I can do is just to look up to the sky.
On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours.
When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes.
Sometimes we make food, too.
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland to tell the stories about what's going on in Gaza.
Many mornings, I had to go to the border area to collect a journalist.
If anything should happen to the journalist, or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government doesn't want us to cover, bad things could happen.
Navigating through my country helping journalists, filmmakers, news crews, is my working life.
I believe my success comes from building a relationship not only with journalists and the news crews, but also with the communities in the Gaza Strip.
These communities who don't want their stories to be told, I never looked to them as stories or numbers.
But like me, they are human beings.
I have built up many relationships over 10 years. And guess what? This gives me the chance to get access to people, to stories that others can't.
In some certain situations, I feel, as a woman, I have more power.
Many male journalists in my society, they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country. That problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built.
With the siege on Gaza, tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food, building material, other stuff we needed. But not anymore, because the Egyptian side flooded them up with water and they are not working anymore.
Drugs were being smuggled, and many young people got addicted, too.
In the tradition of the Palestinian society, it's forbidden for men to enter the household.
So, no male journalists get the story. But I did.
I have a wonderful husband, a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society.
He's at home now with my two kids, and I have another one that's growing in here.
(Applause)
When I'm working, I call him every two hours, and he knows if he doesn't hear from me, he should call my contact, the one who gives me access to the story, which is the one who I trust.
One of the times in Gaza, during the kidnapping of the British journalist Alan Johnston, I was asked by an American magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.
The journalist covering the story and I were asked to meet outside of his hotel.
They came, they picked us up in a black van with black windows, they were wearing masks on that day.
And they drove us away, far away in the middle of a field.
They took our cell phones and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field.
I was so scared that day, a day I will never forget.
So, why do I do what I do?
I do it because I believe if I didn't, a huge part of the story about Gaza will be missing.
There are some more stories I could tell you about my country.
And not all of them are bad.
I love my country, despite the terrible situation we live in -- siege, poverty, unemployment -- but there is life.
There are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy.
We have wonderful music, and a great music school.
We have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes.
And Gaza is the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood.
During the time of war, the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning, leaving my children.
I take a picture of them everyday because I never know if I will make it back to them.
Being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.
But when I hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing, I just head straight toward it, because I want to be there first, because these stories should be told.
When my children were small and we heard the sound of the war, I used to tell them that they were fireworks.
Now they are older, they understand.
I do have terrible nightmares because of all that I witnessed during war times, especially these lifeless bodies of young children.
I still remember a little girl, her name is Hala.
She's the only survivor from her family.
Her picture will be with me forever.
I will never forget her.
I'm proud that I can stand here and be here today with you.
I'm proud that I can tell you stories, sad and happy, stories about my small corner of the world, Gaza.
I'm proud that I am the first female fixer working in Gaza.
And the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.
(Laughter)
I hope one day, I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women, all other amazing women I know in my country.
I hope that one day I can help other women in my country to be fixers like me.
And of course sometimes, I feel I can't do this work anymore, it's just too much for me.
But I remember these words: "Don't limit your challenge, but challenge your limit.
Don't allow others to stand in front of your dreams."
Thank you.
Will we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change?
I come at this question not as a green campaigner, in fact, I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling.
I come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making and someone that wonders how history will judge us.
One day, this ring that belonged to my grandfather will pass to my son, Charlie.
And I wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make of the two lives this ring has worked.
My grandfather was a coal miner.
In his time, burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted.
We know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces.
But today, I fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate -- more harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.
I work, of course, in the banking industry, which will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 -- a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some really, really important promises, like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy.
That promise is already in jeopardy.
And that's a real problem, because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later.
Firstly, because greenhouse gases, once released, stay in the atmosphere for decades.
And secondly, if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today, it's going to be way more costly to change later on.
So for the climate, history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time.
The story need not be this gloomy, though.
Three years ago, I argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges.
And these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time.
Let's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.
When the financial crisis hit in 2008, the central banks of the US and UK began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as "quantitative easing." Depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature, this is money printing by another name.
And boy, did they print.
The US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency.
This was not done in isolation. In a remarkable act of cooperation, the 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, agreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency -- the Special Drawing Right -- to boost reserves around the world.
When the financial crisis moved to Europe, the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, promised "to do whatever it takes." And they did.
The Bank of Japan repeated those words -- that exact same commitment -- to do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy.
In both cases, "whatever it takes" meant trillions of dollars more in money-printing policies that continue today.
What this shows is that when faced with some global challenges, policy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency, and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.
So, let's go back to that original question: Can we print money for climate finance?
Three years ago, the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo.
Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource, governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes: education, health care, welfare -- even defense.
And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyperinflation.
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930; Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008, when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day.
But all of this is moving the public debate forward, so much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly in the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.
But it's important the debate doesn't stop here, with printing national currencies.
Because climate change is a shared global problem, there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that's issued by the IMF, to fund it.
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is the IMF's electronic unit of account that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other.
Think of it as a peer-to-peer payment network, like Bitcoin, but for governments.
And it's truly global. Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves.
These are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises.
And that global nature is why, at the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars — because it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.
But here — here's the intriguing part. More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 — 150 billion dollars' worth — went to developed market countries who, for the most part, have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves, because they have flexible exchange rates.
So those extra reserves that were printed in 2009, in the end, for developed market countries at least, weren't really needed.
And they remain unused today.
So here's an idea.
As a first step, why don't we start spending those unused, those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009, to combat climate change?
They could, for example, be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
This was a fund created in 2009, following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects.
It's been one of the most successful funds of its type, raising almost 10 billion dollars.
But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued, it helps governments get back on track, to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis.
It could also -- it could also serve as a test case.
If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign, it could be used to justify the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years, again, with the commitment that developed-market countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the Green Climate Fund.
Printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies.
The first is it's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone.
No one section of society benefits from the printing press over another.
That problem of competing claims is mitigated.
It's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs, it's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control.
What you end up with is a collective, global action aimed -- and it's controlled global action -- aimed at a global good.
And, as we've learned with the money-printing schemes, whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.
So, for example, the issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped, such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves.
That's important because it would allay well, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role in international finance.
And in fact, I think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname, the "greenback." Because even with that cap in place, the IMF could have followed up its issuance -- its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 -- with a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.
to the Green Climate Fund. So hypothetically, that would mean that developed countries could have contributed up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs
That's 30 times what it has today.
And you know, as spectacular as that sounds, it's only just beginning to look like "whatever it takes."
And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money, consider this: in 2009, Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation.
That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade.
That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads for three whole years.
So what could we do with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that, organized on a global scale?
We could take cars off the roads for a generation.
So, let's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change.
The real question is: Do we care enough about future generations to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system?
After all, we could do it, we did do it and we are doing it today.
We must, must, must do "whatever it takes."
Thank you.
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity: to understand the code of life.
So for me, everything started many, many years ago when I met the first 3D printer.
The concept was fascinating.
A 3D printer needs three elements: a bit of information, some raw material, some energy, and it can produce any object that was not there before.
I was doing physics, I was coming back home and I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer. And everyone does. It was my mom.
(Laughter)
My mom takes three elements: a bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case, raw elements and energy in the same media, that is food, and after several months, produces me. And I was not existent before.
So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer, I immediately got mesmerized by that piece, the first one, the information.
What amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human? Is it much? Is it little? How many thumb drives can you fill?
Well, I was studying physics at the beginning and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece.
So, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here.
So in the first approximation, if I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being, I can build it.
Now, you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an astonishing number.
So the number of atoms, the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives -- multiplied 2,000 times.
This is the miracle of life.
Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady, she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter.
Forget big data, forget anything you heard of.
This is the biggest amount of information that exists.
(Applause)
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist, and in four billion years, managed to pack this information in a small crystal we call DNA.
We met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin, an amazing scientist, a woman, took a picture of it.
But it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell, take out this crystal, unroll it, and read it for the first time.
The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet, four letters: A, T, C and G. And to build a human, you need three billion of them. Three billion. How many are three billion?
It doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?
So I was thinking how I could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is.
But there is -- I mean, I'm going to have some help, and the best person to help me introduce the code is actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.
(Applause)
Not the man in the flesh, but for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human, printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter: 262,000 pages of information, 450 kilograms, shipped from the United States to Canada thanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.
It was an amazing feat.
But this is the visual perception of what is the code of life.
And now, for the first time, I can do something fun.
I can actually poke inside it and read.
So let me take an interesting book ... like this one.
I have an annotation; it's a fairly big book.
So just to let you see what is the code of life.
Thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of letters.
And they apparently make sense.
Let's get to a specific part.
Let me read it to you:
To you it sounds like mute letters, but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig.
I'll show you another part of the book.
This is actually a little more complicated.
Chromosome 14, book 132:
(Laughter)
As you might expect.
(Laughter)
"ATT, CTT, GATT."
This human is lucky, because if you miss just two letters in this position -- two letters of our three billion -- he will be condemned to a terrible disease: cystic fibrosis.
We have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letters of difference from what we are.
A wonderful book, a mighty book, a mighty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable.
Every one of you -- what makes me, me and you, you -- is just about five million of these, half a book.
For the rest, we are all absolutely identical.
Five hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are.
The rest, we all share it.
So think about that again when we think that we are different.
This is the amount that we share.
So now that I have your attention, the next question is: How do I read it?
How do I make sense out of it?
(Laughter)
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters, Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself, decided to assemble a new company.
Human Longevity was born, with one mission: trying everything we can try and learning everything we can learn from these books, with one target -- making real the dream of personalized medicine, understanding what things should be done to have better health and what are the secrets in these books.
An amazing team, 40 data scientists and many, many more people, a pleasure to work with.
The concept is actually very simple.
We're going to use a technology called machine learning.
On one side, we have genomes -- thousands of them.
On the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings: phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR -- everything you can think of.
Inside there, on these two opposite sides, there is the secret of translation.
And in the middle, we build a machine.
We build a machine and we train a machine -- well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines -- to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype.
What are those letters, and what do they do?
It's an approach that can be used for everything, but using it in genomics is particularly complicated.
Little by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges.
We started from the beginning, from common traits.
Common traits are comfortable because they are common, everyone has them.
So we started to ask our questions: Can we predict height?
Can we read the books and predict your height?
Well, we actually can, with five centimeters of precision.
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle, but we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision.
Can we predict eye color?
Yeah, we can. Eighty percent accuracy. Can we predict skin color?
Can we predict age?
We can, because apparently, the code changes during your life.
It gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions.
We read the signals, and we make a model.
Now, an interesting challenge: Can we predict a human face?
It's a little complicated, because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters.
And a human face is not a very well-defined object.
So, we had to build an entire tier of it to learn and teach a machine what a face is, and embed and compress it.
And if you're comfortable with machine learning, you understand what the challenge is here.
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequence -- this October, we started to see some signals.
And it was a very emotional moment.
What you see here is a subject coming in our lab.
This is a face for us.
So we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity, because not everything is in your face -- lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life.
We symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm.
The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have from the blood.
(Applause)
Wait a second. In these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right, and your brain wants those pictures to be identical.
So I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest. Please search for the differences, which are many.
The biggest amount of signal comes from gender, then there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human.
And scaling up over that signal is much more complicated.
But what you see here, even in the differences, lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark, that we are getting closer. And it's already giving you some emotions.
This is another subject that comes in place, and this is a prediction.
A little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure, but still, it's in the ballpark.
This is a subject that comes in our lab, and this is the prediction.
So these people have never been seen in the training of the machine.
These are the so-called "held-out" set.
But these are people that you will probably never believe.
We're publishing everything in a scientific publication, you can read it.
But since we are onstage, Chris challenged me.
I probably exposed myself and tried to predict someone that you might recognize.
So, in this vial of blood -- and believe me, you have no idea what we had to do to have this blood now, here -- in this vial of blood is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full genome sequence.
We just need this amount.
We ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you.
And we start to layer up all the understanding we have.
In the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male.
And the subject is a male.
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm. The subject is a meter and 77 cm. So, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82.
We predict his age, 38.
The subject is 35.
We predict his eye color. Too dark. We predict his skin color.
We are almost there. That's his face.
Now, the reveal moment: the subject is this person.
And I did it intentionally.
I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity.
Southern European, Italians -- they never fit in models.
And it's particular -- that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model.
But there is another point.
So, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome.
It's our free will, it's how I look.
Not my haircut in this case, but my beard cut.
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it -- and this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling -- the beard on the subject.
And immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.
So, why do we do this? We certainly don't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood.
We do it because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning of this code, is helping us to understand how we work, how your body works, how your body ages, how disease generates in your body, how your cancer grows and develops, how drugs work and if they work on your body.
This is a huge challenge.
This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world.
It's called personalized medicine.
It's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you're a dot in the ocean, to a personalized approach, where we read all these books and we get an understanding of exactly how you are.
But it is a particularly complicated challenge, because of all these books, as of today, we just know probably two percent: four books of more than 175.
And this is not the topic of my talk, because we will learn more.
There are the best minds in the world on this topic.
The prediction will get better, the model will get more precise.
And the more we learn, the more we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life, about death, about parenting.
So, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works.
And it's a revolution that cannot be confined in the domain of science or technology.
This must be a global conversation.
We must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity.
We need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers, with politicians.
Everyone is involved, because it's the future of our species.
Without fear, but with the understanding that the decisions that we make in the next year will change the course of history forever.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am holding something remarkably old. It is older than any human artifact, older than life on Earth, older than the continents and the oceans between them.
This was formed over four billion years ago in the earliest days of the solar system while the planets were still forming.
This rusty lump of nickel and iron may not appear special, but when it is cut open ... you can see that it is different from earthly metals.
This pattern reveals metallic crystals that can only form out in space where molten metal can cool extremely slowly, a few degrees every million years.
This was once part of a much larger object, one of millions left over after the planets formed.
We call these objects asteroids.
Asteroids are our oldest and most numerous cosmic neighbors.
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids orbiting around the Sun, shown in yellow, and swinging close to the Earth's orbit, shown in blue.
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids have been greatly exaggerated so you can see them clearly.
Teams of scientists across the globe are searching for these objects, discovering new ones every day, steadily mapping near-Earth space.
Much of this work is funded by NASA.
I think of the search for these asteroids as a giant public works project, but instead of building a highway, we're charting outer space, building an archive that will last for generations.
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids discovered just last year.
And these are all of the known near-Earth asteroids, which at last count was 13,733.
Each one has been imaged, cataloged and had its path around the Sun determined.
Although it varies from asteroid to asteroid, the paths of most asteroids can be predicted for dozens of years. And the paths of some asteroids can be predicted with incredible precision.
For example, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory predicted where the asteroid Toutatis was going to be four years in advance to within 30 kilometers.
In those four years, Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.
That's a fractional precision of 0.000000004.
(Laughter)
Now, the reason I have this beautiful asteroid fragment is because, like all neighbors, asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.
(Laughter)
Three years ago today, a small asteroid exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.
That object was about 19 meters across, or about as big as a convenience store.
Objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so.
66 million years ago, a much larger object hit the Earth, causing a massive extinction.
75 percent of plant and animal species were lost, including, sadly, the dinosaurs.
That object was about 10 kilometers across, and 10 kilometers is roughly the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.
So the next time you're in an airplane, snag a window seat, look out and imagine a rock so enormous that resting on the ground, it just grazes your wingtip.
It's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it.
That's the size of the asteroid that hit the Earth.
It has only been within my lifetime that asteroids have been considered a credible threat to our planet.
And since then, there's been a focused effort underway to discover and catalog these objects.
I am lucky enough to be part of this effort.
I'm part of a team of scientists that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.
Now, NEOWISE was not designed to find asteroids.
It was designed to orbit the earth and look far beyond our solar system to seek out the coldest stars and the most luminous galaxies.
And it did that very well for its designed lifetime of seven months.
But today, six years later, it's still going.
We've repurposed it to discover and study asteroids.
And although it's a wonderful little space robot, these days it's kind of like a used car.
The cryogen that used to refrigerate its sensors is long gone, so we joke that its air-conditioning is broken.
It's got 920 million miles on the odometer, but it still runs great and reliably takes a photograph of the sky every 11 seconds.
It's taken 23 photos since I began speaking to you.
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable is that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared.
That means that instead of seeing the sunlight that asteroids reflect, NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.
This is a vital capability since some asteroids are as dark as coal and can be difficult or impossible to spot with other telescopes.
But all asteroids, light or dark, shine brightly for NEOWISE.
Astronomers are using every technique at their disposal to discover and study asteroids.
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.
The community, together, discovered over 90 percent of asteroids bigger than one kilometer across -- objects capable of massive destruction to Earth.
But the job's not done yet.
An object 140 meters or bigger could decimate a medium-sized country.
So far, we've only found 25 percent of those.
We must keep searching the sky for near-Earth asteroids.
We are the only species able to understand calculus or build telescopes.
We know how to find these objects.
This is our responsibility.
If we found a hazardous asteroid with significant early warning, we could nudge it out of the way.
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes or volcanic eruptions, an asteroid impact can be precisely predicted and prevented.
What we need to do now is map near-Earth space.
We must keep searching the sky.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was three months pregnant with twins when my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.
I was 35 years old at the time, and I knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect.
So, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects, and we felt reasonably prepared.
Well, nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.
The doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas, had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.
This means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing.
Babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes, hours or days of being born.
But the other twin, Callum, appeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell, and these twins were identical, genetically identical.
So after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened, a selective reduction was mentioned, and while this procedure was not impossible, it posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me, so we decided to carry the pregnancy to term.
So there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me, and I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress.
And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.
But I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long that I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
While there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life to have some kind of positive impact.
So I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.
She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, the Washington Regional Transplant Community.
WRTC explained to me that Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant, and I was shocked: I didn't even know you could be rejected for that.
But they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.
As opposed to just a victim of a disease, I started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.
On March 23, 2010, the twins were born, and they were both born alive.
And just like the doctor said, Thomas was missing the top part of his skull, but he could nurse, drink from a bottle, cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby, and he slept in our arms.
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms surrounded by our family.
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home and brought him to Children's National Medical Center.
A few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success, and Thomas's donations would be going to four different places.
His cord blood would go to Duke University.
His liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham.
His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute, which is part of Harvard Medical School, and his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.
A few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family, including baby Callum, and we basically closed this chapter in our lives.
But I did find myself wondering, what's happening now? What are the researchers learning?
And was it even worthwhile to donate?
WRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat, and we met about 15 other grieving families who had donated their loved one's organs for transplant.
Some of them had even received letters from the people who received their loved one's organs, saying thank you.
I learned that they could even meet each other if they'd both sign a waiver, almost like an open adoption.
And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter or I could get a letter and learn about what happened.
But I was disappointed to learn that this process only exists for people who donate for transplant.
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess. (Laughter)
But over the years that followed, I learned a lot more about donation, and I even got a job in the field. And I came up with an idea.
I wrote a letter that started out, "Dear Researcher." I explained who I was, and I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in March of 2010, and I asked if my family could visit their lab.
I emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation, the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, and asked if they could send it to the right person.
They said that they had never done this before, and they couldn't guarantee a response, but they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.
Two days later, I got a response from Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania.
She thanked me for the donation, and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma, which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five, and she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.
So next we talked on the phone, and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt, and that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice, and that she seemed to feel indebted to us.
So I said, "Nothing against your study, but we didn't actually pick it.
We donated to the system, and the system chose your study.
I said, "And second of all, bad things happen to children every day, and if you didn't want these retinas, they would probably be buried in the ground right now.
So to be able to participate in your study gives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning.
So, never feel guilty about using this tissue." Next, she explained to me how rare it was.
She had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the National Disease Research Interchange.
She got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria, and it was Thomas's.
Next, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab, and we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday.
After we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum, and a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.
A few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car and we went for a road trip.
We met Arupa and her staff, and Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief, and that she hadn't seen it from our perspective.
She also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.
The same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa, Thomas was called RES 360.
RES means research, and 360 means he was the 360th specimen over the course of about 10 years.
She also shared with us a unique document, and it was the shipping label that sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia.
This shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.
It's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.
Arupa also explained that she is using Thomas's retina and his RNA to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation, and she even showed us some results that were based on RES 360.
Then she took us to the freezer and she showed us the two samples that she still has that are still labeled RES 360.
There's two little ones left.
She said she saved it because she doesn't know when she might get more.
After this, we went to the conference room and we relaxed and we had lunch together, and the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift.
It was a child's lab kit.
(Laughter) And they also offered him an internship. So in closing, I have two simple messages today.
One is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research.
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.
But I did it.
It was a good experience, and I recommend it, and it brought my family a lot of peace.
And second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family, write them a letter.
Tell them you received it, tell them what you're working on, and invite them to visit your lab, because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them.
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.
If you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits, please tell me about it.
The other part of my family's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received Thomas's donations.
And we met amazing people doing inspiring work.
The way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard, Duke and Penn --
(Laughter) And he has a job at Cytonet, and he has colleagues and he has coworkers who are in the top of their fields.
And they need him in order to do their job.
And a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.
And I only hope that my life can be as relevant.
Thank you. (Applause)
Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon, which has meant different things at different times.
But all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common: they began with a dream.
And the bolder the dream, the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it.
And this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.
This has been the case throughout history, all the way back to the year 300 BC, when a 13-year-old became the king of a remote, very poor and very small Asian country.
He dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power through military conquest.
And his design skills -- improbable though it sounds -- would be essential in enabling him to do so.
At the time, all weapons were made by hand to different specifications.
So if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle, they wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows from their bow.
This of course meant that they would be less effective in combat and very vulnerable, too.
Ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically, so they were interchangeable.
And he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields and every other form of weaponry.
His formidably equipped army won batter after battle, and within 15 years, his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors, to found the mighty Chinese Empire.
Now, no one, of course, would have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time -- why would they?
And yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his ends.
And so did another equally improbable, accidental designer, who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted.
This was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.
This was the golden age of piracy, where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas.
Colonial trade was flourishing, and piracy was highly profitable.
And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils, they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on sight.
So in other words, they could take the ships without wasting ammunition, or incurring casualties.
So Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard by playing the part of a merciless brute.
He wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height.
He grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face.
He slung braces of pistols on either shoulder.
He even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight, so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack.
And like many pirates of that era, he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones, because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries, that their meaning was instantly recognizable, even in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas: surrender or you'll suffer.
So of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.
Put like that, it's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design, and why their deadly symbol --
(Laughter)
there's more -- why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones was a precursor of today's logos, rather like the big red letters standing behind me, but of course with a different message.
(Laughter)
Yet design was also used to nobler ends by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer, the 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale.
Her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone.
Nightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family, who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals during the Crimean War.
Once there, she swiftly realized that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there, in the filthy, fetid wards, than they were of battle wounds.
So she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics to be designed and built.
Back in Britain, she mounted another campaign, this time for civilian hospitals, and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them.
The Nightingale ward, as it is called, dominated hospital design for decades to come, and elements of it are still used today.
But by then, design was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age.
It was formalized and professionalized, but it was restricted to specific roles and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals rather than being used intuitively, as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.
By the 20th century, this commercial ethos was so powerful, that any designers who deviated from it risked being seen as cranks or subversives.
Now among them is one of my great design heroes, the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
He was the Hungarian artist and designer whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens.
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany, and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later.
Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever, but his approach to design was too experimental, as was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it, as an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.
And sadly, the same applied to another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller.
He was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist, who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward-thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the 1920s.
Now he, despite his efforts, was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment, and admittedly, some of his experiments failed, like the flying car that never got off the ground.
And yet, the geodesic dome, his design formula to build an emergency shelter from scraps of wood, metal, plastic, bits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting -- just about anything that's available at the time -- is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design, and has provided sorely needed refuge to many, many people in desperate circumstances ever since.
Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design.
I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent.
I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs, and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.
But I picked design, because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life.
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.
(Applause)
And greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers, which have been extraordinary and immense, I also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality, the lateral thinking and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades.
And we're living at a remarkable moment in design, because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together.
Because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently, in or out of a commercial context, to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives.
So in theory, basic platforms like crowdfunding, cloud computing, social media are giving greater freedom to professional designers and giving more resources for the improvisational ones, and hopefully, a more receptive response to their ideas.
Now, some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa, where a new generation of designers are developing incredible Internet of Things technologies to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than to clean, running water.
And among them is Arthur Zang.
He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer who has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad, a mobile heart-monitoring device.
It can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote, rural areas.
The data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis.
And if any problems are spotted by the specialists there, a suitable course of treatment is recommended.
And this of course saves many patients from making long, arduous, expensive and often pointless journeys to those hospitals, and makes it much, much likelier that their hearts will actually be checked.
Arthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago, in his final year at university.
But he failed to persuade any conventional sources to give him investment to get the project off the ground.
He posted the idea on Facebook, where a Cameroonian government official saw it and managed to secure a government grant for him.
He's now developing not only the Cardiopad, but other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions.
And he isn't alone, because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers who are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own.
And I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them.
One is Peek Vision.
This is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya, who've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own, as a portable eye examination kit.
Then there's Gabriel Maher, who is developing a new design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities, without recourse to traditional stereotypes.
All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams, by the making the most of their newfound freedom, with the discipline of professional designers and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades.
And we all stand to benefit.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So this is a talk about gene drives, but I'm going to start by telling you a brief story.
20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn't transmit malaria.
It was a great idea, and pretty much a complete failure.
For one thing, it turned out to be really hard to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.
James managed it, finally, just a few years ago, by adding some genes that make it impossible for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.
But that just created another problem.
Now that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito, how do you get it to replace all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?
There are a couple options, but plan A was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes.
The problem was that you'd have to release literally 10 times the number of native mosquitos to work.
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos, you release an extra 100,000.
As you might guess, this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers.
Then, last January, Anthony James got an email from a biologist named Ethan Bier.
Bier said that he and his grad student Valentino Gantz had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee that a particular genetic trait would be inherited, but that it would spread incredibly quickly.
If they were right, it would basically solve the problem that he and James had been working on for 20 years.
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti-malaria gene and also this new tool, a gene drive, which I'll explain in a minute.
Finally, they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti-malaria gene wouldn't have the usual white eyes, but would instead have red eyes.
That was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which.
So they took their two anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos and put them in a box with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones, and let them breed.
In two generations, those had produced 3,800 grandchildren.
That is not the surprising part.
This is the surprising part: given that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos and 30 white-eyed ones, you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.
Instead, when James opened the box, all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment, he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone.
That's because getting only red-eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology, Mendelian genetics.
I'll keep this quick, but Mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate, their baby inherits half of its DNA from each parent.
So if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is aB, where B is the anti-malarial gene, the babies should come out in four permutations: aa, aB, aa, Ba.
Instead, with the new gene drive, they all came out aB.
Biologically, that shouldn't even be possible.
So what happened? The first thing that happened was the arrival of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR in 2012.
Many of you have probably heard about CRISPR, so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly.
It does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria.
Basically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors and cuts the DNA, and there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors to any point on the genome you want.
The result is basically a word processor for genes.
You can take an entire gene out, put one in, or even edit just a single letter within a gene.
And you can do it in nearly any species.
OK, remember how I said that gene drives originally had two problems?
The first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito to be malaria-resistant.
That's basically gone now, thanks to CRISPR.
But the other problem was logistical.
How do you get your trait to spread?
This is where it gets clever.
A couple years ago, a biologist at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt wondered what would happen if you made it so that CRISPR inserted not only your new gene but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting.
In other words, what if CRISPR also copied and pasted itself.
You'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing.
And that's exactly what happened.
This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on, but if it's used in the germline cells, it will automatically copy and paste your new gene into both chromosomes of every single individual.
It's like a global search and replace, or in science terms, it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous.
So, what does this mean?
For one thing, it means we have a very powerful, but also somewhat alarming new tool.
Up until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well was actually kind of a relief.
Normally when we mess around with an organism's genes, we make that thing less evolutionarily fit.
So biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want without worrying about it.
If some escape, natural selection just takes care of them.
What's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives is that that will no longer be true.
Assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap, like a mosquito that can't fly, the CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population.
Now, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well, but James and Esvelt think that we can.
The good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things.
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes, the species that transmits malaria, researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year.
So in a year, you could virtually eliminate malaria.
In practice, we're still a few years out from being able to do that, but still, a 1,000 children a day die of malaria.
In a year, that number could be almost zero.
The same goes for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever.
And it gets better. Say you want to get rid of an invasive species, like get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. All you have to do is release a gene drive that makes the fish produce only male offspring.
In a few generations, there'll be no females left, no more carp.
In theory, this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink.
OK, that's the good news, this is the bad news.
Gene drives are so effective that even an accidental release could change an entire species, and often very quickly.
Anthony James took good precautions.
He bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab and he also used a species that's not native to the US so that even if some did escape, they'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with.
But it's also true that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive accidentally got carried from the Great Lakes back to Asia, they could potentially wipe out the native Asian carp population.
And that's not so unlikely, given how connected our world is.
In fact, it's why we have an invasive species problem.
And that's fish.
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies, there's literally no way to contain them.
They cross borders and oceans all the time.
OK, the other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species.
That's because of gene flow, which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed.
If that happens, it's possible a gene drive could cross over, like Asian carp could infect some other kind of carp.
That's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color.
In fact, there's a decent chance that we'll see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future.
But it could be a disaster if your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely.
The last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this, to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive, is something that basically any lab in the world can do.
An undergraduate can do it.
A talented high schooler with some equipment can do it.
Now, I'm guessing that this sounds terrifying.
(Laughter)
Interestingly though, nearly every scientist I talk to seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous.
Partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them.
(Laughter)
So far, that's been true.
But gene drives also have some actual limitations.
So for one thing, they work only in sexually reproducing species.
So thank goodness, they can't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria.
Also, the trait spreads only with each successive generation.
So changing or eliminating a population is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle, like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish.
In elephants or people, it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter.
Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait.
Say you wanted to make a fruit fly that feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit, with the aim of sabotaging American agriculture.
First, you'd have to figure out which genes control what the fly wants to eat, which is already a very long and complicated project.
Then you'd have to alter those genes to change the fly's behavior to whatever you'd want it to be, which is an even longer and more complicated project.
And it might not even work, because the genes that control behavior are complex.
So if you're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out, or just blowing stuff up? You'll probably choose the later.
This is especially true because at least in theory, it should be pretty easy to build what's called a reversal drive. That's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive.
So if you don't like the effects of a change, you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out, at least in theory.
OK, so where does this leave us?
We now have the ability to change entire species at will. Should we? Are we gods now?
I'm not sure I'd say that.
But I would say this: first, some very smart people are even now debating how to regulate gene drives.
At the same time, some other very smart people are working hard to create safeguards, like gene drives that self-regulate or peter out after a few generations. That's great. But this technology still requires a conversation.
And given the nature of gene drives, that conversation has to be global.
What if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania doesn't?
Who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly?
I don't have the answer to that question.
All we can do going forward, I think, is talk honestly about the risks and benefits and take responsibility for our choices.
By that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive, but also the choice not to use one.
Humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option is to preserve the status quo.
But that's not always the case.
Gene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed, but malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.
To combat it, we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species, including amphibians and birds.
So when you hear about gene drives in the coming months, and trust me, you will be hearing about them, remember that. It can be frightening to act, but sometimes, not acting is worse.
(Applause)
Imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and transmit them to your brain.
That would be a game-changing technology, right?
But in fact, we already possess this device, and it's called human communication system and effective storytelling.
To understand how this device works, we have to look into our brains. And we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner.
Now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains.
And we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate.
First, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave that I'm transmitting to your brain.
And second, we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate. So how do we know that? In my lab in Princeton, we bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories.
And to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using, let me play 20 seconds from a story that we used, told by a very talented storyteller, Jim O'Grady. (Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it better — (Laughter) by adding an element of embellishment.
(Laughter) Reporters call this "making shit up."
And I kinda liked it." Uri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain and see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories.
And let's start simple -- let's start with one listener and one brain area: the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear.
And as you can see, in this particular brain area, the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding.
Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area.
And we can ask: How similar are the responses across all listeners? So here you can see five listeners.
And we start to scan their brains before the story starts, when they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin.
As you can see, the brain area is going up and down in each one of them, but the responses are very different, and not in sync.
However, immediately as the story is starting, something amazing is happening. (Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it -- UH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story, and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners.
And in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking.
We call this effect "neural entrainment." And to explain to you what is neural entrainment, let me first explain what is physical entrainment.
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.
Think of these five metronomes as five brains.
And similar to the listeners before the story starts, these metronomes are going to click, but they're going to click out of phase. (Clicking)
This rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together.
And now listen to the click. (Synchronized clicking) This is what you call physical entrainment.
Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What's driving this neural entrainment?
Is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing?
Or maybe it's the words.
Or maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey.
So to test it, we did the following experiment.
First, we took the story and played it backwards.
And that preserved many of the original auditory features, but removed the meaning.
And it sounds something like that. (Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) And we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people.
And as you can see, this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds, but it didn't spread deeper into the brain.
Now we can take these sounds and build words out of it.
So if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words, we'll get a list of words. (Audio) JO:... an animal... assorted facts... and right on... pie man... potentially... my stories
UH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas, but not more than that. Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them. (Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line.
He says: "Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details. Didn't she only know about him through me?"
UH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners.
However, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into higher-order areas, which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex, and make all of them respond very similarly.
And we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound.
And if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here if I tell you the exact same ideas using two very different sets of words, your brain responses will still be similar.
And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab.
We took the English story and translated it to Russian.
Now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning.
And you play the English story to the English listeners and the Russian story to the Russian listeners, and we can compare their responses across the groups.
And when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language, because the language and sound are very different.
However, you can see that the responses in high-order areas were still similar across these two groups.
We believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way, as we confirmed, using a test after the story ended.
And we think that this alignment is necessary for communication.
For example, as you can tell, I am not a native English speaker.
I grew up with another language, and the same might be for many of you in the audience.
And still, we can communicate. How come? We think we can communicate because we have this common code that presents meaning.
So far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain, in your brain, when you're listening to talks.
But what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain, when I'm speaking to you?
To look in the speaker's brain, we asked the speaker to go into the scanner, we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story.
You have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes.
Here we're asking: How similar are they?
To our surprise, we saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain.
So production and comprehension rely on very similar processes.
And we also found the stronger the similarity between the listener's brain and the speaker's brain, the better the communication.
So I know that if you are completely confused now, and I do hope that this is not the case, your brain responses are very different than mine.
But I also know that if you really understand me now, then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine.
Now, let's take all this information together and ask: How can we use it to transmit a memory that I have from my brain to your brains?
So we did the following experiment. We let people watch, for the first time in their life, a TV episode from the BBC series "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.
And then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie. So let's be specific. Think about this exact scene, when Sherlock is entering the cab in London driven by the murderer he is looking for.
With me, as a viewer, there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it.
Now, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer.
And when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now, you have to reconstruct it in your mind.
In fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains.
And we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when I'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner.
This starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information.
Because, for example, now you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying. And I know that it's not easy. But I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me.
And I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months, you're going to meet someone at a party, and you're going to tell him about this lecture, and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us.
Now you can see how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people, which is wonderful, right?
But our ability to communicate relies on our ability to have common ground.
Because, for example, if I'm going to use the British synonym "hackney carriage" instead of "cab," I know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience.
This alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic concept; it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems.
Because we know that in many cases, people understand the exact same story in very different ways.
So to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment.
We took a story by J.D. Salinger, in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party, and he's calling his best friend, asking, "Did you see my wife?" For half of the subjects, we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend. For the other half, we said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous.
This one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group.
And if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you, think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life, when we are all listening to the exact same news item after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times, that give us very different perspectives on reality.
So let me summarize. If everything worked as planned tonight, I used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains.
And I used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains.
In this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate.
And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication.
But these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground.
And we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control the way we all think.
And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist.
But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communication, which is a dialogue, in which it's not only me speaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listening, and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas.
Because after all, the people we are coupled to define who we are.
And our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very early age.
So let me finish with an example from my own private life that I think is a good example of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are.
This my son Jonathan at a very early age.
See how he developed a vocal game together with my wife, only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being. (Both vocalizing) (Laughter) Now, think how the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become.
And think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life.
So keep being coupled to other people.
Keep spreading your ideas, because the sum of all of us together, coupled, is greater than our parts.
Thank you. (Applause)
As a conceptual artist, I'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations.
I do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance.
But regardless of the format, two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.
In 2007, I created "Lotus," a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter, 600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom.
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit.
But a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship. This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery.
In America, we don't like to talk about slavery, nor do we look at it as a global industry.
But by using this Buddhist symbol, I hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black America and encourage discussions about our shared past.
To create "Lotus," we carved over 6,000 figures.
And this later led to a commission by the City of New York to create a 28-foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, a school for black and latino students, the two groups most affected by this history.
The same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon, but let me digress.
I've been collecting wooden African figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the world.
The authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable, but people believe these to be imbued with power, or even magic.
Only recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work.
(Gun shots)
Since 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice and literally countless other unarmed black citizens at the hands of the police, who frequently walk away with no punishment at all.
In consideration of these victims and the several times that even I, a law-abiding, Ivy League professor, have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police. I created this body of work simply entitled "BAM."
It was important to erase the identity of each of these figures, to make them all look the same and easier to disregard.
To do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where I re-sculpted them using bullets.
And it was fun, playing with big guns and high-speed video cameras.
But my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger, somehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself.
Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots.
I then took the fragments of these and created molds, and cast them first in wax, and finally in bronze like the image you see here, which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars.
When I showed this work recently in Miami, a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul.
But she also felt that these artworks memorialized the victims of these killings as well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history.
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger than just US history.
While showing in Berlin last year, a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings.
I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard from the early 1900s and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years.
But it's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society.
I hope my artwork creates a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I think about dreams, like many of you, I think about this picture.
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong step off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon.
I had never seen anything like it before, and I've never seen anything like it since.
We got to the Moon for one simple reason: John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.
And in the absence of that deadline, we would still be dreaming about it.
Leonard Bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement: a plan and not quite enough time.
(Laughter)
Deadlines and commitments are the great and fading lessons of Apollo.
And they are what give the word "moonshot" its meaning.
And our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again.
When I think about dreams, I think about the drag queens of LA and Stonewall and millions of other people risking everything to come out when that was really dangerous, and of this picture of the White House lit up in rainbow colors, yes --
(Applause) —
celebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' right to marry.
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined when I was 18 and figuring out that I was gay and feeling estranged from my country and my dreams because of it.
I think about this picture of my family that I never dreamed I could ever have —
(Applause) —
and of our children holding this headline I never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.
We need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But I want to talk about the need for us to dream in more than one dimension, because there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8, and something about organizing that the rainbow colors over.
Of the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, only seven marriages survived.
Those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the Moon obscure the alcoholism and depression on Earth.
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, asked during the time of Apollo, "What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?" And what can we gain by the right to marry if we are not able to cross the acrimony and emotional distance that so often separates us from our love?
And not just in marriage.
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive, tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS and breast cancer and non-profit activism, all in the name of love.
Thomas Merton also wrote about wars among saints and that "there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs: activism and overwork.
The frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace.
It destroys our own inner capacity for peace." Too often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations on some future that destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now.
Our dreams of a better life for some future humanity or some other humanity in another country alienate us from the beautiful human beings sitting next to us at this very moment.
Well, that's just the price of progress, we say.
You can go to the Moon or you can have stability in your family life.
And we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time.
And we don't set the bar much higher than stability when it comes to our emotional life.
Which is why our technology for talking to one another has gone vertical, our ability to listen and understand one another has gone nowhere.
Our access to information is through the roof, our access to joy, grounded.
But this idea, that our present and our future are mutually exclusive, that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being, that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled, but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love is somehow limited is a false and suffocating choice.
Now, I'm not suggesting simply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance.
What good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home if my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it?
I'm not even talking about mindfulness. Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.
(Laughter)
Right?
I'm talking about dreaming as boldly in the dimension of our being as we do about industry and technology.
I'm talking about an audacious authenticity that allows us to cry with one another, a heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real.
It is our inability to be with one another, our fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many of the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place, from Congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity.
(Applause)
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B, a new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about and scientific about the development of our humanity as we are about the development of our technology.
We should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don't really understand it.
There was a time when we didn't understand space.
Or because we're more used to technology and activism.
That is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone.
We are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement.
In 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our imagination.
Now, we're all here to dream, but maybe if we're honest about it, each of us chasing our own dream.
You know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream, sometimes looking right through one another's humanity.
I can't be bothered with you right now.
I have an idea for saving the world. Right?
(Laughter)
Years ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company that created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement.
And we had this mantra: "Human. Kind. Be Both." And we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness.
Like, "Go help everybody set up their tents." And there were a lot of tents.
(Laughter)
"Go buy everybody Popsicles." "Go help people fix their flat tires even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer."
And people really took us up on this, so much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride, you had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you if you needed help.
For a few days, for tens of thousands of people, we created these worlds that everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be.
What if we experimented with creating that kind of world these next few days?
And instead of going up to someone and asking them, "What do you do?" ask them, "So what are your dreams?" or "What are your broken dreams?" You know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams.
(Applause)
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober" or "I want to build a tree house with my kid." You know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet, go up to the person who is all alone and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.
I think what we fear most is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential, that we are born to dream and we might die without ever having the chance.
Imagine living in a world where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another and love one another boldly because we know that to be human is to live with that fear.
It's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously, and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.
It's time we set foot into that dimension and came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too.
If the Moon could dream, I think that would be its dream for us.
It's an honor to be with you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
In the space that used to house one transistor, we can now fit one billion.
That made it so that a computer the size of an entire room now fits in your pocket.
You might say the future is small.
As an engineer, I'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers.
As a physician, I wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost due to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth: cancer.
Now when I say that, what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer. And we are. But it turns out that there's an incredible opportunity to save lives through the early detection and prevention of cancer.
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today.
Things like vaccination, timely screening and of course, stopping smoking.
But even with the best tools and technologies that we have today, some tumors can't be detected until 10 years after they've started growing, when they are 50 million cancer cells strong.
What if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner, when they could be removed, when they were just getting started?
Let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there.
This is a microscope in a typical lab that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen, like a biopsy or a pap smear.
This $7,000 microscope would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells.
This is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University, Rebecca Richards-Kortum.
What she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $10 part, and it fits on the end of an optical fiber.
Now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope, you can bring the microscope to the patient.
And then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images, you can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.
Now this is important, because what they found working in rural communities, is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis, that days later, women get a call with an abnormal test result and they're asked to come in.
Fully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip.
With the integrated microscope and computer analysis, Rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup.
And what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot, so no one is lost to follow up.
That's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives.
Now as engineers, we think of this as straight-up miniaturization.
You took a big thing and you made it little.
But what I told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere.
So what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine?
Well, what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body, find the tumor all by itself and send a signal to the outside world?
It sounds a little bit like science fiction.
But actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that.
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector from the width of a human hair, which is 100 microns, to a thousand times smaller, which is 100 nanometers.
And that has profound implications.
It turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale.
You take a common material like gold, and you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles, and it changes from looking gold to looking red.
If you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide -- forms a big, black crystal -- if you make nanocrystals out of this material and you put it in a liquid, and you shine light on it, they glow.
And they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red, depending only on their size. It's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world?
It would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton, but they are different colors depending only on their size.
(Laughter)
So as a physician, what's just as interesting to me is that it's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale; the way they travel in your body also changes.
And this is the kind of observation that we're going to use to make a better cancer detector.
So let me show you what I mean. This is a blood vessel in the body.
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.
We're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor.
Now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky, and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor.
Whether they leak out depends on their size.
So in this image, the smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out, and the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream.
So that means as an engineer, depending on how big or small I make a material, I can change where it goes in your body.
In my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors.
We designed it to listen for tumor invasion: the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread.
For a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in, it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues.
We designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes.
One enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour.
Now in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio a form of amplification, and it makes something ultrasensitive.
So we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.
OK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world, where I can act on it?
For this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology, and that has to do with the kidney.
The kidney is a filter.
Its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine.
It turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size.
So in this image, what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine, and everything else that's bigger is retained.
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector, I inject it in the bloodstream, it can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine, I have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.
OK, but there's one more problem.
This is a tiny little signal, so how do I detect it?
Well, the signal is just a molecule.
They're molecules that we designed as engineers.
They're completely synthetic, and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice.
If we want to use a really sensitive, fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer, then we make a molecule with a unique mass.
Or maybe we want make something that's more inexpensive and portable.
Then we make molecules that we can trap on paper, like a pregnancy test.
In fact, there's a whole world of paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics.
Alright, where are we going with this? What I'm going to tell you next, as a lifelong researcher, represents a dream of mine.
I can't say that's it's a promise; it's a dream.
But I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward, even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers.
I'm going to tell you what I hope will happen with my technology, that my team and I will put our hearts and souls into making a reality.
OK, here goes.
I dream that one day, instead of going into an expensive screening facility to get a colonoscopy, or a mammogram, or a pap smear, that you could get a shot, wait an hour, and do a urine test on a paper strip.
I imagine that this could even happen without the need for steady electricity, or a medical professional in the room.
Maybe they could be far away and connected only by the image on a smartphone.
Now I know this sounds like a dream, but in the lab we already have this working in mice, where it works better than existing methods for the detection of lung, colon and ovarian cancer.
And I hope that what this means is that one day we can detect tumors in patients sooner than 10 years after they've started growing, in all walks of life, all around the globe, and that this would lead to earlier treatments, and that we could save more lives than we can today, with early detection.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do I look real to you? Hope so. I have no idea if you're seeing this, but I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there.
I've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me so I don't walk past it and look like I'm floating in midair.
Right now I'm standing in the open air, on a beach under a palm tree, in the exact spot where your stage used to be.
I have 12 minutes with you.
I set a limit.
My wife Navid once said that infinite possibility is a creator's worst enemy.
For example, this dress: I'd asked her to design something that a priest might have worn in 23rd-century Cairo.
But we only had three days to make it, and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover that another resident left behind.
But she did it, and it's perfect.
And she looked at it and said, "Proof of concept -- creation needs constraint." So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery.
For my whole life, my obsession has been eternal life, as I know it is so many of yours.
You may be happy to know that your research will pay off.
I am 318 years old.
The average human lifespan is now 432 years, and my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely.
And I've never questioned that someday, we'll reach a point where we'll be content.
But the opposite keeps happening: the longer we live, the longer we want to live, the less we want to die.
Who can blame us? The universe is so big.
There won't ever not be more to see.
Just yesterday, I was reading about how you can take out a boat on Europa and sail from island to island all over the planet, and some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.
And then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.
And then there are others where there's no one and there never has been, and so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before.
You could spend 400 years doing just that.
Right now the Moon is rising in the Northeast.
I can see the cities on it with my naked eye.
They're connected like nerve clusters: Mariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator.
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.
That's where Navid and I met.
We were both artists downtown.
The day we met, we were passing each other in Azadi Square, and we bumped shoulders.
And I turned to apologize and she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything, said, "Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?" And first of all, I thought, "Who the hell are you?" But second, the question annoyed me, because the answer is so simple.
I said, "We didn't pass through each other because elementary particles have mass and because the space between elementary particles is filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of mass, and we've known that for 800 years." She must have been in one of those moods where she likes to mess with strangers.
Or maybe she was just flirting with me, because she looked at me and said, "I thought you'd say that.
Think deeper." And then she took off her belt, this belt that I'm wearing now, and she said, "Our universe is built so that particles have mass.
Without that basic constraint, we'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light and never even known."
And that's how our romance began.
Navid and I never ran out of things to talk about. Never. It was incredible. It was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together and we kept arriving at new vistas, and these new, perfect constellations of words would come out of us to describe them.
And we'd forget them as soon as we made them, and throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next thing, on and up.
Or one time, Navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread, and that we were always adding in a little more flour and a little more water, and folding it in and turning it over and never getting around to baking it.
If my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch.
She had a genius for it.
All of her work revolved around it.
My body was like a canvas for her, and she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly that I couldn't feel it moving.
And she was obsessed with the exact moment when I would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine.
Or she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine and say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?" I'd say, "I don't know!" And she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question, but the answer I remember today is, "It feels good because the universe chose its constraints, and we are its art."
It's always funny what you think the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be.
In your time, scientists thought humans could freeze themselves and wake up in the future.
And they did — but then they died.
In your time, scientists thought humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years.
And they did, but eventually, they died anyway.
In your time, Earth is the only place people live.
In my time, Earth is the place people come to die.
So when Navid started to show the signs, our friends assumed I would do what everyone does, which is say goodbye and send her to Earth, so that none of us would have to look at her or be around her or think about her and her ... failure to keep living.
More than anything, they didn't want to be around her actual physical body.
They kept referring to it as "declining," even though she herself was fascinated by it, the changes it was going through, following the rules of its nature day by day, independent of her will.
I did send Navid to Earth.
But I came with her.
I remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said, "I just think it's arrogant, like the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special." But I did.
So, even here on Earth, I kept working on how to extend life.
It didn't occur to me that there could be any other response.
I kept going back to that thing that Navid said to me that day in Azadi Square, that without that basic constraint -- a universe that granted mass to matter -- we would not exist.
That's one rule.
Another rule is that all mass is subject to entropy.
And there is no way to be in this universe without mass. I know. I tried everything. I tried creating a photon box where the Higgs field was altered.
I tried recording all subatomic movements in my body and replaying them on closed loop. Nothing worked.
But my final innovation was to create a coil dimension with the boundaries of a body in which time moved infinitely slower, but whose projection would appear to move in normal time.
That body would then appear in our universe as a hologram -- here but not here.
When I realized I'd done it, I ran to her room, so happy to tell her I'd done it, moving through space almost normally to all eyes, even to my own, and went to lie down next to her, and forgot, and fell right through her.
I'd found a way to eternal life, at the expense of the one thing Navid loved most, which was to touch and be touched.
And she threw me out.
I still got to watch, though.
Humans live 400 years now, and we still die.
And when death comes, the dying still pick at their bedsheets, and their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides, and their breaths get further and further apart, like they're falling asleep.
I've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure.
And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet.
But maybe a life has meaning only because it ends.
Maybe that's the paradox: constraints don't constrain, they allow perfect freedom.
(Sighs)
There was a thunderstorm here this morning.
There is another forecast for tonight, but for now the sky is clear.
I can't feel the wind here, but I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like, and she said it felt warm, like melted butter.
An answer worthy of my wife.
I have to find my way back to the flesh.
Until then, I take up no space but the space you give me.
Today, I am going to show you how this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that I'm wearing are going to completely revolutionize science education.
And I'm also going to show you how it can make any science teacher more than twice as effective.
But before I show you how all of this is possible, let's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important.
If you think about it, the world is growing incredibly fast.
And with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges, challenges such as dealing with global warming, solving starvation and water shortages and curing diseases, to name just a few.
And who, exactly, is going to help us solve all of these great challenges?
Well, to a very last degree, it is these young students.
This is the next generation of young, bright scientists.
And in many ways, we all rely on them for coming up with new, great innovations to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us.
And so a couple of years back, my cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these, only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here.
(Laughter)
And yes, this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world: students that are bored, disengaged and sometimes not even sure why they're learning about a topic in the first place.
So we started looking around for new, innovative teaching methods, but what we found was quite disappointing.
We saw that books were being turned into e-books, blackboards were being turned into YouTube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into MOOCs -- massive online open courses.
And if you think about it, all we're really doing here is taking the same content and the same format, and bringing it out to more students -- which is great, don't get me wrong, that is really great -- but the teaching method is still more or less the same, no real innovation there.
So we started looking elsewhere.
What we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real, in-flight training to train the pilots.
And so we thought to ourselves: Why not just apply that to science?
Why not build a virtual laboratory simulator?
Well, we did it.
We basically set out to create a fully simulated, one-to-one, virtual reality laboratory simulator, where the students could perform experiments with mathematical equations that would simulate what would happen in a real-world lab.
But not just simple simulations -- we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like MIT, to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students.
And suddenly, the universities could save millions of dollars by letting the students perform virtual experiments before they go into the real laboratory.
And not only that; now, they could also understand -- even on a molecular level inside the machine -- what is happening to the machines.
And then they could suddenly perform dangerous experiments in the labs as well.
For instance also here, learning about salmonella bacteria, which is an important topic that many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons.
And we, of course, quiz the students and then give the teachers a full dashboard, so they fully understand where the students are at.
But we didn't stop there, because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students' engagement in the class.
So we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories.
For instance, here in this case, where the students have to solve a mysterious CSI murder case using their core science skills.
And the feedback we got when we launched all of this was quite overwhelmingly positive.
Here we have 300 students, all passionately solving CSI murder cases while learning core science skills.
And what I love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards, all surprised and a little confused, and say, "I just spent two hours in this virtual lab, and ... and I didn't check Facebook."
(Laughter)
That's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students.
And so, to investigate whether this really worked, a learning psychologist did a study with 160 students — that was from Stanford University and Technical University of Denmark.
And what they did is split the students into two groups.
One group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations, the other group would only use traditional teaching methods, and they had the same amount of time.
Then, interestingly, they gave the students a test before and after the experiment, so they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students.
And what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods.
But even more interestingly, the second part of this study investigated what the teacher's impact was on the learning.
And what they found was that when you combined the virtual laboratories with teacher-led coaching and mentoring, then we saw a total 101 percent increase in the learning effectiveness, which effectively doubles the science teacher's impact with the same amount of time spent.
So a couple of months back, we started asking ourselves -- we have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists and teachers and scientists and game developers -- and we started asking ourselves: How can we keep ourselves to our promise of constantly reimagining education?
And today, I am really excited to be presenting what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create.
I will explain briefly what this is.
Basically, I take my mobile phone -- most students already have these, smartphones -- and I plug it into this virtual-reality headset, a low-cost headset.
And now what I can effectively do is, I can literally step into this virtual world.
We'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this, because it is really something that you have to try to fully feel how immersive it really is.
It literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab.
Do you see me up on the screen?
Audience: Yes.
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.
So basically, I have just turned my mobile phone into a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory with all this amazing equipment that I can interact with.
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette and do experiments with it.
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR and -- oh, look there, I have my next-generation sequencing machine, and there I even have my electron microscope.
I mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket?
And here I have my machine, I can do different experiments on the machine.
And over here I have the door, I can go into other experiments, I can perform in the laboratories.
And here, I have my learning tablet.
This is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory.
As you can see, I can interact with it.
I can watch videos and see content that is relevant to the experiment that I'm performing right now.
Then over here, I have Marie.
She is my teacher -- my lab assistant -- and what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory.
And very soon, the teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves into this virtual world that I'm in right now and help me, guide me, through this whole experiment.
And now before I finalize this, I want to show you an even cooler thing, I think -- something you cannot even do in real laboratories.
This is a PCR machine.
I'm now going to start this experiment.
And what I just did is literally shrunk myself a million times into the size of a molecule -- and it really feels like it, you have to try this.
So now it feels like I'm standing inside the machine and I'm seeing all the DNA, and I see the molecules.
I see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth.
And I can see how in this case, DNA is being replicated millions of times, just like it's happening inside your body right now.
And I can really feel and understand how all of this works.
Now, I hope that gives you a little bit of a sense of the possibilities in these new teaching methods.
And I want to also emphasize that everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops without the headsets.
I say that for a very important reason.
In order for us to really empower and inspire the next generation of scientists, we really need teachers to drive the adoption of new technologies in the classroom.
And so in many ways, I believe that the next big, quantum leap in science education lies no longer with the technology, but rather with the teachers' decision to push forward and adopt these technologies inside the classrooms.
And so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential.
And so, lastly, I'd like to leave you with a little story that really inspires me.
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.
Some of you might already know him.
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking low-cost test for pancreatic cancer at the age 15.
And when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough, he also explains that one thing almost prevented him from making this breakthrough.
And that was that he did not have access to real laboratories, because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in.
Now, imagine if we could bring Ivy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories out to all these students just like Jack, all over the world, and give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine that would quite literally make any scientist in here jump up and down out of pure excitement.
And then imagine how that would empower and inspire a whole new generation of young and bright scientists, ready to innovate and change the world.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi. Let me ask the audience a question: Did you ever lie as a child?
If you did, could you please raise your hand? Wow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met.
(Laughter)
So for the last 20 years, I've been studying how children learn to tell lies.
And today, I'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made.
But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina, who is my friend and an elementary school principal.
He got a phone call one day.
The caller says, "Mr. Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today because he's sick."
Mr. Messina asks, "Who am I speaking to, please?"
And the caller says, "I am my father."
(Laughter)
So this story --
(Laughter)
sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying.
One, children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school.
Two, children are poor liars.
We adults can easily detect their lies.
And three, if children lie at a very young age, there must be some character flaws with them, and they are going to become pathological liars for life.
Well, it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong.
We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world. Here is an example. So in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards.
And we tell them if they win the game, they are going to get a big prize.
But in the middle of the game, we make an excuse and leave the room.
And before we leave the room, we tell them not to peek at the cards.
Of course, we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move.
Because the desire to win the game is so strong, more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room.
(Laughter)
The crucial question is: When we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked, will the children who peeked confess or lie about their transgression?
We found that regardless of gender, country, religion, at two years of age, 30 percent lie, 70 percent tell the truth about their transgression.
At three years of age, 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth.
At four years of age, more than 80 percent lie.
And after four years of age, most children lie.
So as you can see, lying is really a typical part of development.
And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age.
So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children.
Why do some but not all young children lie?
In cooking, you need good ingredients to cook good food.
And good lying requires two key ingredients.
The first key ingredient is theory of mind, or the mind-reading ability.
Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know.
Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you don't know what I know.
Therefore, I can lie to you.
The second key ingredient for good lying is self-control.
It is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression and your body language, so that you can tell a convincing lie.
And we found that those young children who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars.
As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society.
In fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities are associated with serious developmental problems, such as ADHD and autism.
So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie, instead of being alarmed, you should celebrate --
(Laughter)
because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development.
Now, are children poor liars? Do you think you can easily detect their lies?
Would you like to give it a try? Yes? OK. So I'm going to show you two videos.
In the videos, the children are going to respond to a researcher's question, "Did you peek?" So try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth.
Here's child number one. Are you ready?
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
KL: OK, if you think child number one is lying, please raise your hand.
And if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand.
OK, so as a matter of fact, child number one is telling the truth, child number two is lying.
Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies.
(Laughter)
Now, we have played similar kinds of games with many, many adults from all walks of life.
And we show them many videos.
In half of the videos, the children lied.
In the other half of the videos, the children told the truth.
And let's find out how these adults performed.
Because there are as many liars as truth tellers, if you guess randomly, there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right.
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent, it means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.
So let's start with undergrads and law school students, who typically have limited experience with children.
No, they cannot detect children's lies.
Their performance is around chance.
Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers, who work with children on a daily basis?
Can they detect children's lies? No, they cannot.
(Laughter)
What about judges, customs officers and police officers, who deal with liars on a daily basis?
Can they detect children's lies?
No, they cannot.
What about parents? Can parents detect other children's lies?
No, they cannot. What about, can parents detect their own children's lies? No, they cannot.
(Laughter) (Applause)
So now you may ask why children's lies are so difficult to detect.
Let me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan.
This is his facial expression when he lies.
(Laughter)
So when children lie, their facial expression is typically neutral.
However, behind this neutral expression, the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions, such as fear, guilt, shame and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.
(Laughter)
Unfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden.
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.
So in the last five years, we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions.
Then we made a discovery.
We know that underneath our facial skin, there's a rich network of blood vessels.
When we experience different emotions, our facial blood flow changes subtly.
And these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control.
By looking at facial blood flow changes, we can reveal people's hidden emotions.
Unfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.
So to help us reveal people's facial emotions, we have developed a new imaging technology we call "transdermal optical imaging."
To do so, we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions.
And then, using our image processing technology, we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes.
By looking at transdermal video images, now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions.
And using this technology, we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying, and therefore detect people's lies.
We can do so noninvasively, remotely, inexpensively, with an accuracy at about 85 percent, which is far better than chance level.
And in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect.
No, not this Pinocchio effect.
(Laughter)
This is the real Pinocchio effect.
When people lie, the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases, and the facial blood flow on the nose increases.
Of course, lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions.
So then we asked ourselves, in addition to detecting lies, how can our technology be used?
One application is in education.
For example, using this technology, we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety about the topic he's teaching so that he can help him.
And also we can use this in health care.
For example, every day I Skype my parents, who live thousands of miles away.
And using this technology, I can not only find out what's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level, their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain.
And perhaps in the future, their risks for heart attack or hypertension.
And you may ask: Can we use this also to reveal politicians' emotions?
(Laughter)
For example, during a debate.
Well, the answer is yes.
Using TV footage, we could detect the politicians' heart rate, mood and stress, and perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us.
We can also use this in marketing research, for example, to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products.
We can even use it in dating.
So for example, if your date is smiling at you, this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you.
And in this case, she is just trying to be nice to you.
(Laughter)
So transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development.
Many new applications will come about that we don't know today.
However, one thing I know for sure is that lying will never be the same again.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I've got a confession.
I love looking through people's garbage.
Now, it's not some creepy thing.
I'm usually just looking for old electronics, stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
Each one's got three different motors, so now you can build things that move.
There's switches so you can turn things on and off.
There's even a freaking laser, so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.
Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage, and some of these things have even been kind of useful.
But here's the thing, for me, garbage is just a chance to play, to be creative and build things to amuse myself.
This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
I lead a university-based biological research lab, where we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
We aren't focused on any particular problem, and we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
This is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers.
And I realized a long time ago that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage I find, it's a great way to foster creativity.
And what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab.
And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas, it's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor.
So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart, and I had this sudden idea: Could I treat biology like hardware?
Could I dismantle a biological system, mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way?
My lab started working on this, and I want to show you the result.
Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?
Audience: Apple!
Andrew Pelling: That's right -- it's an apple.
Now, I actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples.
And that's because we grew human cells into it.
We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple, removed all the apple cells and DNA and then implanted human cells.
And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold.
This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
And these little holes that you can see, this is where all the apple cells used to be.
So then we come along, we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
What happens is, these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold.
As weird as this is, it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
And we found in our pre-clinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive.
This is the point when people started asking me, "Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?" And I'm like, "You've come to the right place."
(Laughter)
I actually brought this up with my wife.
She's a musical instrument maker, and she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
So I asked her, "Could you, like, literally carve some ears out of an apple for us?" And she did.
So I took her ears to the lab.
We then started preparing them.
Yeah, I know.
(Laughter)
It's a good lab, man.
(Laughter)
And then we grew cells on them.
And this is the result.
Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
People have actually been working on this for decades.
Here's the issue: commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic, because they're sourced from proprietary products, animals or cadavers.
We used an apple and it cost pennies.
What's also really cool here is it's not that hard to make these things.
The equipment you need can be built from garbage, and the key processing step only requires soap and water.
So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
And then we founded a mission-driven company, and we're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home.
What I'm really curious about is if one day, it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen.
Speaking of kitchens, here's some asparagus.
They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.
(Laughter)
Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus, what you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
And when we image them in the lab, you can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
This image reminds me of two things: our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.
So here's the question: Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
Because if we can, then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
Or maybe even a spinal cord.
Don't get me wrong -- this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do, and we are not the only ones working on this.
But we are the only ones using asparagus.
(Laughter)
Right now, we've got really promising pilot data.
And we're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what's actually possible.
So listen, all of the work I've shown you, the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
Play -- play is a key part of my scientific practice.
It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears.
So, the next time any of you are looking at some old, broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology, I want you to think of me.
Because I want it.
(Laughter)
Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me, and let's see what we can build.
Thank you.
(Applause)
By raising your hand, how many of you know at least one person on the screen?
Wow, it's almost a full house.
It's true, they are very famous in their fields.
And do you know what all of them have in common?
They all died of pancreatic cancer.
However, although it's very, very sad this news, it's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.
It's become the third cause of cancer deaths, and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years.
That's a very tiny number, especially if you compare it with breast cancer, where the survival rate is almost 90 percent.
So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence.
What's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years, this number hasn't changed a bit, while much more progress has been made with other types of tumors.
So how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective?
As a biomedical entrepreneur, I like to work on problems that seem impossible, understanding their limitations and trying to find new, innovative solutions that can change their outcome.
The first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally. It's depicted in orange on the screen.
But you can barely see it until I remove all the other organs in front.
It's also surrounded by many other vital organs, like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct.
And the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types.
The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it, as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example.
So all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option for the pancreatic cancer patient.
This brings us to the second piece of bad news.
Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels.
Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor?
Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works.
The drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site.
It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination.
But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway?
You will never get there.
And that's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
The drugs navigate throughout all of your body.
They will reach healthy organs, resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall, but very little will go to the tumor.
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.
To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ.
However, in the last 40 years, a lot of money, research and effort have gone towards finding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer, but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient.
So after two pieces of bad news, I'm going to give you good news, hopefully.
With a collaborator at MIT and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality.
We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination, avoiding your having to drive all around the highway.
We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one.
They are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter, so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery.
But they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor, they will act as a cage.
They will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs, controlling the metastasis.
The devices are also biodegradable.
That means that once in the body, they start dissolving, delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole-body treatment.
In pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.
So we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most, we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful, reducing the systemic toxic effect.
We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level. We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials.
Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer.
We are hoping that one day, we can reduce their pain, extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease.
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug, we don't only make it more powerful and less toxic, we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years before I realized that I really had a problem.
There was something really wrong with me.
This was about a year before 9 / 11, and America wasn't at war yet.
We weren't talking about PTSD.
We were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche.
I'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months with the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban.
And at that point the Taliban had an air force, they had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery, and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times.
We saw some very ugly things.
But I didn't really think it affected me.
I didn't think much about it.
I came home to New York, where I live.
Then one day I went down into the subway, and for the first time in my life, I knew real fear.
I had a massive panic attack.
I was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
Everything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me, but I couldn't explain why.
The trains were going too fast.
There were too many people.
The lights were too bright.
Everything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly.
I backed up against a support column and just waited for it.
When I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station and walked wherever I was going.
Later, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD: post-traumatic stress disorder.
We evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger, and if your life has been in danger, you want to react to unfamiliar noises.
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you.
You want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight, or depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit. Keeps you safe. It's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.
Most people recover from that pretty quickly.
It takes a few weeks, a few months.
I kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away.
I had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen.
I just thought I was going crazy, and then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.
About 20 percent of people, however, wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.
They are not adapted to temporary danger.
They are maladapted for everyday life, unless they get help.
We know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD are people who were abused as children, who suffered trauma as children, people who have low education levels, people who have psychiatric disorders in their family.
If you served in Vietnam and your brother is schizophrenic, you're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
So I started to study this as a journalist, and I realized that there was something really strange going on.
The numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction.
Every war that we have fought as a country, starting with the Civil War, the intensity of the combat has gone down.
As a result, the casualty rates have gone down.
But disability rates have gone up.
They should be going in the same direction, but they're going in different directions.
The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God, a casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam.
But they've also created -- they've also produced three times the disability rates.
Around 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat, 10 percent or under.
They're shooting at people, killing people, getting shot at, seeing their friends get killed.
It's incredibly traumatic.
But it's only about 10 percent of our military.
But about half of our military has filed for some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.
And suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way.
We've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average, in this country, killing themselves.
Most people don't realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War, that generation, and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related to the war they fought 50 years earlier.
In fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide.
If you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat, you're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't.
In fact, one study found that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan, you're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.
I studied anthropology in college.
I did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation.
I wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners.
And recently, while I was researching PTSD, I had this thought.
I thought back to the work I did when I was young, and I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche -- I mean, these are very warlike nations -- I bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do.
When their warriors came back from fighting the US military or fighting each other, I bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.
And maybe what determines the rate of long-term PTSD isn't what happened out there, but the kind of society you come back to.
And maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society, you can get over trauma pretty quickly.
And if you come back to an alienating, modern society, you might remain traumatized your entire life.
In other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets; maybe the problem is us.
Certainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche by every metric that we have.
As wealth goes up in a society, the suicide rate goes up instead of down.
If you live in modern society, you're up to eight times more likely to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor, agrarian society.
Modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history.
I saw one study that compared women in Nigeria, one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in Africa, to women in North America.
And the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America.
That was also the wealthiest group.
So let's go back to the US military. Ten percent are in combat.
Around 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation.
So about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas but have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated and depressed.
So what is happening with them?
What's going on with those people, the phantom 40 percent that are troubled but don't understand why?
Maybe it's this: maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness in their unit when they were overseas.
They were eating together, sleeping together, doing tasks and missions together.
They were trusting each other with their lives.
And then they come home and they have to give all that up and they're coming back to a society, a modern society, which is hard on people who weren't even in the military.
It's just hard on everybody.
And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.
But for a lot of these people, maybe it's not trauma.
I mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized and the ones who are have to be treated for that.
But a lot of them -- maybe what's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation.
I mean, maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it, and just changing our language, our understanding, would help a little bit. "Post-deployment alienation disorder." Maybe even just calling it that for some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen in order to explain a feeling that really is happening.
And in fact, it's an extremely dangerous feeling. That alienation and depression can lead to suicide.
These people are in danger.
It's very important to understand why.
The Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent.
The theory is that everyone in Israel is supposed to serve in the military.
When soldiers come back from the front line, they're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment.
They're coming back to a community where everyone understands about the military.
Everyone's been in it or is going to be in it.
Everyone understands the situation they're all in.
It's as if they're all in one big tribe.
We know that if you take a lab rat and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself, you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely.
And if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats, after a couple of weeks, it's pretty much OK.
After 9 / 11, the murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent.
The suicide rate went down.
The violent crime rate in New York went down after 9 / 11.
Even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD said that their symptoms went down after 9 / 11 happened.
The reason is that if you traumatize an entire society, we don't fall apart and turn on one another. We come together. We unify. Basically, we tribalize, and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us, that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues.
During the blitz in London, admissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings.
For a while, that was the kind of country that American soldiers came back to -- a unified country.
We were sticking together.
We were trying to understand the threat against us.
We were trying to help ourselves and the world.
But that's changed.
Now, American soldiers, American veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided that the two political parties are literally accusing each other of treason, of being an enemy of the state, of trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country.
The gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been. It's just getting worse. Race relations are terrible.
There are demonstrations and even riots in the streets because of racial injustice.
And veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way -- in fact, any platoon that treated itself that way -- would never survive.
We've gotten used to it.
Veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes.
And they see what's going on.
This is the country they fought for.
No wonder they're depressed.
No wonder they're scared.
Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets.
I think the real question is if we can save ourselves.
If we can, I think the vets are going to be fine.
It's time for this country to unite, if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I want to talk about sex for money.
I'm not like most of the people you'll have heard speaking about prostitution before.
I'm not a police officer or a social worker.
I'm not an academic, a journalist or a politician.
And as you'll probably have picked up from Maryam's blurb, I'm not a nun, either.
(Laughter)
Most of those people would tell you that selling sex is degrading; that no one would ever choose to do it; that it's dangerous; women get abused and killed.
In fact, most of those people would say, "There should be a law against it!" Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.
It sounded reasonable to me until the closing months of 2009, when I was working two dead-end, minimum-wage jobs.
Every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft.
I was exhausted and my life was going nowhere.
Like many others before me, I decided sex for money was a better option.
Now don't get me wrong -- I would have loved to have won the lottery instead.
But it wasn't going to happen anytime soon, and my rent needed paying.
So I signed up for my first shift in a brothel.
In the years that have passed, I've had a lot of time to think.
I've reconsidered the ideas I once had about prostitution.
I've given a lot of thought to consent and the nature of work under capitalism.
I've thought about gender inequality and the sexual and reproductive labor of women.
I've experienced exploitation and violence at work.
I've thought about what's needed to protect other sex workers from these things.
Maybe you've thought about them, too.
In this talk, I'll take you through the four main legal approaches applied to sex work throughout the world, and explain why they don't work; why prohibiting the sex industry actually exacerbates every harm that sex workers are vulnerable to.
Then I'm going tell you about what we, as sex workers, actually want.
The first approach is full criminalization.
Half the world, including Russia, South Africa and most of the US, regulates sex work by criminalizing everyone involved.
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.
Lawmakers in these countries apparently hope that the fear of getting arrested will deter people from selling sex.
But if you're forced to choose between obeying the law and feeding yourself or your family, you're going to do the work anyway, and take the risk.
Criminalization is a trap. It's hard to get a conventional job when you have a criminal record.
Potential employers won't hire you.
Assuming you still need money, you'll stay in the more flexible, informal economy.
The law forces you to keep selling sex, which is the exact opposite of its intended effect.
Being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself.
In many places you may be coerced into paying a bribe or even into having sex with a police officer to avoid arrest.
Police and prison guards in Cambodia, for example, have been documented subjecting sex workers to what can only be described as torture: threats at gunpoint, beatings, electric shocks, rape and denial of food.
Another worrying thing: if you're selling sex in places like Kenya, South Africa or New York, a police officer can arrest you if you're caught carrying condoms, because condoms can legally be used as evidence that you're selling sex.
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.
Imagine knowing if you're busted carrying condoms, it'll be used against you.
It's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home, right?
Sex workers working in these places are forced to make a tough choice between risking arrest or having risky sex. What would you choose? Would you pack condoms to go to work?
How about if you're worried the police officer would rape you when he got you in the van?
The second approach to regulating sex work seen in these countries is partial criminalization, where the buying and selling of sex are legal, but surrounding activities, like brothel-keeping or soliciting on the street, are banned.
Laws like these -- we have them in the UK and in France -- essentially say to us sex workers, "Hey, we don't mind you selling sex, just make sure it's done behind closed doors and all alone." And brothel-keeping, by the way, is defined as just two or more sex workers working together.
Making that illegal means that many of us work alone, which obviously makes us vulnerable to violent offenders.
But we're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together.
A couple of years ago, a friend of mine was nervous after she was attacked at work, so I said that she could see her clients from my place for a while.
During that time, we had another guy turn nasty.
I told the guy to leave or I'd call the police.
And he looked at the two of us and said, "You girls can't call the cops.
You're working together, this place is illegal." He was right.
He eventually left without getting physically violent, but the knowledge that we were breaking the law empowered that man to threaten us.
He felt confident he'd get away with it.
The prohibition of street prostitution also causes more harm than it prevents.
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested, street workers take risks to avoid detection, and that means working alone or in isolated locations like dark forests where they're vulnerable to attack.
If you're caught selling sex outdoors, you pay a fine.
How do you pay that fine without going back to the streets?
It was the need for money that saw you in the streets in the first place.
And so the fines stack up, and you're caught in a vicious cycle of selling sex to pay the fines you got for selling sex.
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa who worked in Redbridge, East London.
The street workers on her patch would normally wait for clients in groups for safety in numbers and to warn each other about how to avoid dangerous guys.
But during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients, she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested.
She was stabbed to death in the early hours of October 29, 2013.
She had been working later than usual to try to pay off a fine she had received for soliciting.
So if criminalizing sex workers hurts them, why not just criminalize the people who buy sex?
This is the aim of the third approach I want to talk about -- the Swedish or Nordic model of sex-work law.
The idea behind this law is that selling sex is intrinsically harmful and so you're, in fact, helping sex workers by removing the option.
Despite growing support for what's often described as the "end demand" approach, there's no evidence that it works.
There's just as much prostitution in Sweden as there was before. Why might that be? It's because people selling sex often don't have other options for income.
If you need that money, the only effect that a drop in business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more risky sexual services.
If you need to find more clients, you might seek the help of a manager.
So you see, rather than putting a stop to what's often descried as pimping, a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties.
To keep safe in my work, I try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number.
If it's a home or a hotel visit, I try to get a full name and details.
If I worked under the Swedish model, a client would be too scared to give me that information.
I might have no other choice but to accept a booking from a man who is untraceable if he later turns out to be violent.
If you need their money, you need to protect your clients from the police.
If you work outdoors, that means working alone or in isolated locations, just as if you were criminalized yourself.
It might mean getting into cars quicker, less negotiating time means snap decisions.
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?
Can you afford to take the risk?
Can you afford not to?
Something I'm often hearing is, "Prostitution would be fine if we made it legal and regulated it." We call that approach legalization, and it's used by countries like the Netherlands, Germany and Nevada in the US.
But it's not a great model for human rights.
And in state-controlled prostitution, commercial sex can only happen in certain legally-designated areas or venues, and sex workers are made to comply with special restrictions, like registration and forced health checks.
Regulation sounds great on paper, but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with.
It creates a two-tiered system: legal and illegal work.
We sometimes call it "backdoor criminalization." Rich, well-connected brothel owners can comply with the regulations, but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through.
And even if it's possible in principle, getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money.
It's not going to be an option for someone who's desperate and needs money tonight.
They might be a refugee or fleeing domestic abuse.
In this two-tiered system, the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally, so they're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization I mentioned earlier.
So. It's looking like all attempts to control or prevent sex work from happening makes things more dangerous for people selling sex.
Fear of law enforcement makes them work alone in isolated locations, and allows clients and even cops to get abusive in the knowledge they'll get away with it.
Fines and criminal records force people to keep selling sex, rather than enabling them to stop.
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers.
These laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers.
When France temporarily brought in the Swedish model two years ago, ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street.
In Sweden, opinion surveys show that significantly more people want sex workers to be arrested now than before the law was brought in.
If prohibition is this harmful, you might ask, why it so popular?
Firstly, sex work is and always has been a survival strategy for all kinds of unpopular minority groups: people of color, migrants, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, particularly trans women.
These are the groups most heavily profiled and punished through prohibitionist law.
I don't think this is an accident.
These laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters don't want to see or know about.
Why else might people support prohibition?
Well, lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking.
Folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down. So let's talk about trafficking. Forced labor does occur in many industries, especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable, and this needs to be addressed.
But it's best addressed with legislation targeting those specific abuses, not an entire industry.
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants drowned while picking cockles in Morecambe Bay in 2004, there were no calls to outlaw the entire seafood industry to save trafficking victims.
The solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections, allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest.
The way the term trafficking is thrown around implies that all undocumented migration into prostitution is forced.
In fact, many migrants have made a decision, out of economic need, to place themselves into the hands of people smugglers.
Many do this with the full knowledge that they'll be selling sex when they reach their destination.
And yes, it can often be the case that these people smugglers demand exorbitant fees, coerce migrants into work they don't want to do and abuse them when they're vulnerable.
That's true of prostitution, but it's also true of agricultural work, hospitality work and domestic work.
Ultimately, nobody wants to be forced to do any kind of work, but that's a risk many migrants are willing to take, because of what they're leaving behind.
If people were allowed to migrate legally they wouldn't have to place their lives into the hands of people smugglers.
The problems arise from the criminalization of migration, just as they do from the criminalization of sex work itself.
This is a lesson of history.
If you try to prohibit something that people want or need to do, whether that's drinking alcohol or crossing borders or getting an abortion or selling sex, you create more problems than you solve.
Prohibition barely makes a difference to the amount of people actually doing those things.
But it makes a huge difference as to whether or not they're safe when they do them.
Why else might people support prohibition?
As a feminist, I know that the sex industry is a site of deeply entrenched social inequality.
It's a fact that most buyers of sex are men with money, and most sellers are women without.
You can agree with all that -- I do -- and still think prohibition is a terrible policy.
In a better, more equal world, maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive, but you can't simply legislate a better world into existence.
If someone needs to sell sex because they're poor or because they're homeless or because they're undocumented and they can't find legal work, taking away that option doesn't make them any less poor or house them or change their immigration status.
People worry that selling sex is degrading.
Ask yourself: is it more degrading than going hungry or seeing your children go hungry?
There's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies or getting manicures, even though most of the people doing that labor are poor, migrant women.
It's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable.
And I can understand why the sex industry provokes strong feelings.
People have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex.
But we can't make policy on the basis of mere feelings, especially not over the heads of the people actually effected by those policies.
If we get fixated on the abolition of sex work, we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation of gender inequality, rather than about the underlying causes.
People get really hung up on the question, "Well, would you want your daughter doing it?" That's the wrong question.
Instead, imagine she is doing it.
How safe is she at work tonight?
Why isn't she safer?
So we've looked at full criminalization, partial criminalization, the Swedish or Nordic Model and legalization, and how they all cause harm.
Something I never hear asked is: "What do sex workers want?" After all, we're the ones most affected by these laws.
New Zealand decriminalized sex work in 2003.
It's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing.
Decriminalization means the removal of laws that punitively target the sex industry, instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work.
In New Zealand, people can work together for safety, and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state.
A sex worker can refuse to see a client at any time, for any reason, and 96 percent of street workers report that they feel the law protects their rights.
New Zealand hasn't actually seen an increase in the amount of people doing sex work, but decriminalizing it has made it a lot safer.
But the lesson from New Zealand isn't just that its particular legislation is good, but that crucially, it was written in collaboration with sex workers; namely, the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective.
When it came to making sex work safer, they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves.
Here in the UK, I'm part of sex worker-led groups like the Sex Worker Open University and the English Collective of Prostitutes.
And we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and self-determination.
The universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella.
We're supported in our demands by global bodies like UNAIDS, the World Health Organization and Amnesty International.
But we need more allies.
If you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health, then sex worker rights matter to you.
Make space for us in your movements.
That means not only listening to sex workers when we speak but amplifying our voices.
Resist those who silence us, those who say that a prostitute is either too victimized, too damaged to know what's best for herself, or else too privileged and too removed from real hardship, not representative of the millions of voiceless victims.
This distinction between victim and empowered is imaginary.
It exists purely to discredit sex workers and make it easy to ignore us.
No doubt many of you work for a living.
Well, sex work is work, too.
Just like you, some of us like our jobs, some of us hate them.
Ultimately, most of us have mixed feelings.
But how we feel about our work isn't the point.
And how others feel about our work certainly isn't.
What's important is that we have the right to work safely and on our own terms.
Sex workers are real people.
We've had complicated experiences and complicated responses to those experiences.
But our demands are not complicated.
You can ask expensive escorts in New York City, brothel workers in Cambodia, street workers in South Africa and every girl on the roster at my old job in Soho, and they will all tell you the same thing.
You can speak to millions of sex workers and countless sex work-led organizations.
We want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers.
I'm just one sex worker on the stage today, but I'm bringing a message from all over the world.
Thank you.
So this is James Risen. You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times.
Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name, Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.
But it's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact.
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, go read it.
It's an incredible story.
But you know who didn't like that chapter? The US government. For nearly a decade afterwards, Risen was the subject of a US government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources.
And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
You see, under the First Amendment, the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.
But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them.
So when the government came knocking, Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.
That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.
Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case, the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.
It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance, there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.
And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.
So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records.
They got his email records, his financial and banking information, his credit reports, even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.
And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.
Sadly, this is only one case of many.
President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers, and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined.
Now, you can see how this could be a problem, especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.
Since 9 / 11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.
So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.
But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before.
And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them, rather than on the witness stand after the fact.
Communications software now exists that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book, and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, and is now developed at the non-profit where I work, Freedom of the Press Foundation.
Instead of sending an email, you go to a news organization's website, like this one here on The Washington Post.
From there, you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form.
It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to.
So the government can no longer secretly demand the information, and much of the information they would demand wouldn't be available in the first place.
SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk.
And it's up to us going forward to make sure that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.
It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water, or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.
After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes, but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I know TED is about a lot of things that are big, but I want to talk to you about something very small.
So small, it's a single word.
The word is "misfit." It's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal.
I mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in.
Or a person who fits in badly. Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments." I'm a card-carrying misfit.
And I'm here for the other misfits in the room, because I'm never the only one.
I'm going to tell you a misfit story.
Somewhere in my early 30s, the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep.
Actually, it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize for a short story I had written.
The short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and about my crappy home life, and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane.
The prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents and other authors.
So kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right?
You know what I did the day the letter came to my house?
Because I'm me, I put the letter on my kitchen table, I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime, and I sat there in my underwear for an entire day, just staring at the letter.
I was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up.
Who the hell was I to go to New York City and pretend to be a writer? Who was I?
I'll tell you. I was a misfit.
Like legions of other children, I came from an abusive household that I narrowly escaped with my life.
I already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt.
I'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.
(Laughter)
And I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use.
And I'd had two lovely staycations in jail. So I'm on the right stage.
(Laughter)
But the real reason, I think, I was a misfit, is that my daughter died the day she was born, and I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet.
After my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless, living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way.
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.
You know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits, because they start out as us.
So you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there: daughter, wife, mother, scholar.
And the dream of being a writer was really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.
It was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane and flew to New York City, where the writers are.
Fellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing.
I can pick you out of a room.
At first, you would've loved it.
You got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet, and these guys went and found them for you.
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel, where you got to drink Scotch late in the night with cool, smart, swank people.
And you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank, too.
And you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very, very fancy lunches and dinners. Ask me how fancy.
Audience: How fancy?
Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: I stole three linen napkins --
(Laughter)
from three different restaurants. And I shoved a menu down my pants.
(Laughter)
I just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home, I could believe it had really happened to me. You know?
The three writers I wanted to meet were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan.
These were not famous, best-selling authors, but to me, they were women-writer titans.
Carole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible.
Lynne Tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world.
And Peggy Phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs.
They weren't mainstream women writers, but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories, I like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.
It nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers.
And the reason it nearly killed me with joy is that I'd never known a joy like that.
I'd never been in a room like that.
My mother never went to college.
And my creative career to that point was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.
So kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there.
I was just like, "Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful." Some of you in the room will understand what happened next.
First, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
Farrar, Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press.
I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there.
The main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time, trying to convince me I had a book in me about my life as a swimmer.
You know, like a memoir.
The whole time he was talking to me, I sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot, with my arms crossed over my chest, while nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat.
So in the end, he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might.
And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door.
Next, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton, where I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building just for wearing Doc Martens.
But that didn't happen. Being at the Norton offices felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across the cosmos.
I mean, that's how big a deal it was to me. You get it? Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith, leaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes and said, "Well, send me something then, immediately!" See, now most people, especially TED people, would have run to the mailbox, right?
It took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.
On the last night, I gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club.
And at the end of the reading, Katharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & amp; Picard Literary Agency, walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation, like, on the spot.
I stood there and I kind of went deaf.
Has this ever happened to you?
And I almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully, and all that came out of my mouth was: "I don't know.
I have to think about it. "And she said," OK, then, "and walked away.
All those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...
You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me. Misfit people -- we don't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing, even when it's right in front of us.
It's a shame we carry.
It's the shame of wanting something good. It's the shame of feeling something good.
It's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room with the people we admire.
If I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself.
I'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me.
I'd teach myself how to want things, how to stand up, how to ask for them.
I'd say, "You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too." The radiance falls on all of us, and we are nothing without each other.
Instead, I flew back to Oregon, and as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view, I just drank many tiny bottles of airplane "feel sorry for yourself." I thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer.
What I'm saying is, I flew back to Oregon without a book deal, without an agent, and with only a headful and heart-ful of memories of having sat so near the beautiful writers.
Memory was the only prize I allowed myself.
And yet, at home in the dark, back in my underwear, I could still hear their voices.
They said, "Don't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story." They said, "Give voice to the story only you know how to tell." They said, "Sometimes telling the story is the thing that saves your life."
Now I am, as you can see, the woman over 50. And I'm a writer. And I'm a mother.
And I became a teacher.
Guess who my favorite students are.
Although it didn't happen the day that dream letter came through my mailbox, I did write a memoir, called "The Chronology of Water." In it are the stories of how many times I've had to reinvent a self from the ruins of my choices, the stories of how my seeming failures were really just weird-ass portals to something beautiful.
All I had to do was give voice to the story.
There's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams.
It's called the hero's journey.
But I prefer a different myth, that's slightly to the side of that or underneath it.
It's called the misfit's myth.
And it goes like this: even at the moment of your failure, right then, you are beautiful.
You don't know it yet, but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly.
That's your beauty.
You can be a drunk, you can be a survivor of abuse, you can be an ex-con, you can be a homeless person, you can lose all your money or your job or your husband or your wife, or the worst thing of all, a child. You can even lose your marbles. You can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure and still, I'm only here to tell you, you are so beautiful.
Your story deserves to be heard, because you, you rare and phenomenal misfit, you new species, are the only one in the room who can tell the story the way only you would.
And I'd be listening.
Thank you.
We have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think?
One natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same.
Another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture may have also changed the structural columns of human thought.
We may all have different opinions about this.
Actually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate.
But is this question even amenable to science?
Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought.
And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today we would call schizophrenics.
And he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations.
And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices.
And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think about their own thoughts.
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development.
And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples.
So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.
And the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious.
It's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote, "Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness."
(Laughter)
And this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem.
We need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said.
The word introspection does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze.
So our way to solve this is to build the space of words.
This is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are.
So for instance, you want the words "dog" and "cat" to be very close together, but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm" to be very far away. And this has to be true for any two words within the space.
And there are different ways that we can construct the space of words.
One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries.
Another possibility is following the simple assumption that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected just by pure chance.
And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective.
And just to give you a flavor of how well this works, this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words.
And you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods.
So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.
The algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.
So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms.
And then there are very fine things.
For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms.
And we could go on and on with this.
Actually, if you stare at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry.
And this is because, in a way, walking in this space is like walking in the mind.
And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions, of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection.
So for instance, words such as "self," "guilt," "reason," "emotion," are very close to "introspection," but other words, such as "red," "football," "candle," "banana," are just very far away.
And so once we've built the space, the question of the history of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract and somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science.
All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time circling closely to the concept of introspection.
And with this, we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best available written record.
So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection, and we just average that.
And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on, these books get closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection.
And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition.
to the concept of introspection. So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer, and closer and closer
And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.
So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern.
Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament.
And then we get the peak of introspection in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," about four centuries after Christ.
And this was very important, because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection.
Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.
So our algorithm, which has the virtue of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation.
And this is in a way one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea can be translated and generalized to a whole lot of different domains.
So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness.
To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now.
And in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds.
And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task.
And we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.
And so what we did is, we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis.
But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure.
There was just not enough information in semantics to predict the future organization of the mind.
It was good enough to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future onset of psychosis.
But then we realized that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it.
More specifically, it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one.
And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category.
And it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not.
And this was something that could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other existing clinical measures.
And I remember vividly, while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires, and at the time he was living in New York.
And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition, that something was going wrong.
So I picked up the phone, and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well.
And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense, through words, his feelings, was a simple, but very effective way to help.
What I tell you today is that we're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm.
And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say.
I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work.
I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.
Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet.
My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit.
I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.
If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.
Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report.
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020.
And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end.
I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics may not.
My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change.
On-site, I take thousands of photographs.
Back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes over 10 feet wide.
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors.
I consider my work drawings but others call them painting.
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a "finger painter."
(Laughter)
But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper.
Drawing is a form of meditation for me. It quiets my mind. I don't perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water.
Instead, the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape.
Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting with foam.
On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10 seconds.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size.
But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.
My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had art supplies all over the house.
My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures.
We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.
In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.
My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.
She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor.
The cancer quickly took over her body and mind, and she passed away six months later.
During the months of her illness, though, her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final journey.
My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape.
The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling.
The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected.
I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced.
Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability.
From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.
We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges.
The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did.
And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival.
The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century.
Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal.
When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form.
Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the negative.
My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.
I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future.
(Applause) Thank you.
What do you see? Most of you see a barbershop, but I see an opportunity: an opportunity for health, an opportunity for health equity.
For black men, the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed.
No, it's much more than that.
Historically, the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men.
It's a place where we go for friendship, solidarity and solace.
It's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work and sometimes home life.
It's a place where we don't have to worry about how we're being perceived by the outside world.
It's a place where we don't feel threatened, or threatening.
It's a place of loyalty and trust.
For that reason, it's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves and just ... talk.
The talk, the shop talk, the conversation, that is the essence of the black barbershop.
I can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid.
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop every other Saturday.
And like clockwork, the same group of men would be there every time we went, either waiting on their favorite barber or just soaking up the atmosphere.
every time we went, I can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.
He's a local pastor, and they treated him like a celebrity.
"Hey young fella, how you doing?" they would say to me, making me feel just as special.
I remember the range of the conversations was immense.
The men would talk about politics and sports and music and world news, national news, neighborhood news.
There was some talk about women and what it was like to be a black man in America.
But many times they also talked about health.
The conversations about health were lengthy and deep.
The men often recounted their doctor's recommendations to cut salt in their diet or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking or to reduce stress.
They talked about the different ways you could reduce stress, like simplifying one's love life --
(Laughter)
all ways to treat high blood pressure.
There's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop.
That's because almost 40 percent of black men have it.
That means that almost every single black man either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it.
Sometimes, those conversations in the barbershop would be about what happens when high blood pressure is not adequately addressed.
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy?
He had a stroke. "
"Did you hear about Eddie?
He died last week. Massive heart attack. He was 50. "
More black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else, even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated that death from high blood pressure can be prevented with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
So why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men?
Because too often, high blood pressure is either untreated or under-treated in black men, in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system.
Black men, in particular those with high blood pressure, are less likely to have a primary care doctor than other groups.
But why? Some of our earliest research on black men's health revealed that for many, the doctor's office is associated with fear, mistrust, disrespect, and unnecessary unpleasantness.
The doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well.
And when you do go, you might wait for hours only to get the run-around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has 10 minutes to give you and who doesn't value the talk.
So it's no wonder that some men don't want to be bothered and skip going to the doctor altogether, especially if they feel fine.
But herein lies the problem.
You can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs.
This is Denny Moe, owner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.
I've been lucky enough to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years.
He said to me once, "Hey Doc, you know, lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors."
This was stunning to me, at first, but not so much when you think about it.
Black men have been with their current barbers on average as long as I've been with Denny, about eight years.
And black men see their barbers about every two weeks.
Not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style, but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life.
Denny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist, a businessman and confidant.
He's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community.
The very first time I walked into Denny Moe's shop, he wasn't just cutting hair.
He was also orchestrating a voter registration drive to give a voice to his customers and his community.
With this kind of activism, and community investment that typifies the black barbershop, of course the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community.
First, the barbershop is not a medical setting, and so it doesn't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that.
When you're in a barbershop, you're in your territory, and you're among friends who share your history, your struggle and your health risks.
Second, because the barbershop is a place of connection, loyalty and trust, it's a place where you're more open to have a conversation about health and especially about high blood pressure.
After all, conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk: stress and high blood pressure, food and high blood pressure, relationships and high blood pressure, and yes, what it's like to be a black man in America and high blood pressure.
But you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop.
You can concretely take action.
Here we have an opportunity to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world and empower communities to address the health inequities that uniquely affect it.
When high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals to communities in the 1960s and '70s, black physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans were at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs in urban black neighborhoods.
These pioneers paved the way for my professional journey with barbershops and health, which began in Chicago in medical school.
The very first research project that I worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black men.
We conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men, and we learned that for them, being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy, and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good.
This work led to the development of Project Brotherhood, a community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker that provided tailored healthcare to black men.
Part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut, to let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked as well as how they felt, and that what was important to them was also important to us.
But while there's only one Project Brotherhood, there are thousands of black barbershops where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated.
The next stop on my journey was Dallas, Texas, where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community.
We teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to counsel their customers and refer them to doctors to help manage high blood pressure.
The barbers were not only willing to do it but they were damn good at it.
Over a three-year period, the barbers measured thousands of blood pressures resulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors for medical care of their high blood pressure.
These barber-doctor partnerships resulted in a 20 percent increase in the number of men who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels and a three-point drop, on average, in the blood pressure of each participant.
If we were to extrapolate that three point drop to every single black man with high blood pressure in America, we would prevent 800 heart attacks, 500 strokes and 900 deaths from high blood pressure in just one year.
And our experience with barbershops has been no different in New York City, where my journey has currently led me.
With an incredible team of diverse research assistants, community health workers and volunteers, we've been able to partner with over 200 barbershops and other trusted community venues to reach over 7,000 older black men.
And we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling to each and every one of them.
Thanks to Denny Moe and the myriad other barbers and community leaders who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment to make a difference in their communities, we've been able to not only lower blood pressure in our participants, but we've also been able to impact other health indicators.
So what do you see? What is your barbershop?
Where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution?
When you find that place, see the opportunity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was a Marine with 1 / 1 Weapons Company, 81's platoon, out in Camp Pendleton, California. Oorah!
(Laughter)
I joined a few months after September 11, feeling like I think most people in the country did at the time, filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something -- that, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything.
I was 17, just graduated from high school that past summer, living in the back room of my parents' house paying rent, in the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana, called Mishawaka.
I can spell that later for people who are interested --
(Laughter)
Mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not, so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays I did in high school and Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace.
(Laughter)
I was serious enough about acting that I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school, didn't get in, determined college wasn't for me and applied nowhere else, which was a genius move.
I also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey that I always heard stories about, of actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars and finding work and successful careers.
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down.
I spent all my money repairing it, finally made it to Santa Monica -- not even LA -- stayed for 48 hours wandering the beach, basically, got in my car, drove home, thus ending my acting career, so --
(Laughter)
Seventeen, Mishawaka ... parents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums ... telemarketing, cutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds.
This was my world going into September, 2001.
So after the 11th, and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, and just being pissed off in general — at myself, my parents, the government; not having confidence, not having a respectable job, my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back — I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.
It's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life.
Firing weapons was cool, driving and detonating expensive things was great.
But I found I loved the Marine Corps the most for the thing I was looking for the least when I joined, which was the people: these weird dudes -- a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the United States -- that on the surface I had nothing in common with.
And over time, all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved, and for me, the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends.
And then, a few years into my service and months away from deploying to Iraq, I dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident, and had to be medically separated.
Those never in the military may find this hard to understand, but being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan was very devastating for me.
I have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK.
And then, suddenly, I was a civilian again.
I knew I wanted to give acting another shot, because -- again, this is me -- I thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military.
I mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know? "It's hot.
Someone should turn on the air conditioner." "This coffee line is too long." I was a Marine, I knew how to survive.
I'd go to New York and become an actor.
If things didn't work out, I'd live in Central Park and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.
(Laughter)
I re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky, I got in.
But I was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian.
And I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury.
But regardless, it was difficult.
In part, because I was in acting school -- I couldn't justify going to voice and speech class, throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room, doing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself --
(Laughter)
while my friends were serving without me overseas.
But also, because I didn't know how to apply the things I learned in the military to a civilian context. I mean that both practically and emotionally.
Practically, I had to get a job.
And I was an Infantry Marine, where you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars.
There's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world.
(Laughter)
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.
In the military, everything has meaning.
Everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose.
You can't smoke in the field because you don't want to give away your position.
You don't touch your face -- you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene.
You face this way when "Colors" plays, out of respect for people who went before you.
Walk this way, talk this way because of this.
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.
How diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes about the kind of Marine you were.
Your rank said something about your history and the respect you had earned.
In the civilian world there's no rank.
Here you're just another body, and I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again.
And the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform didn't exist when I was out of it.
There didn't seem to be a ... a sense of community, whereas in the military, I felt this sense of community.
How often in the civilian world are you put in a life-or-death situation with your closest friends and they constantly demonstrate that they're not going to abandon you?
And meanwhile, at acting school ...
(Laughter)
I was really, for the first time, discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military, but were somehow describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable.
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was.
And when I was reflecting on my time in the military, I wasn't first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it; but rather, the small, intimate human moments, moments of great feeling: friends going AWOL because they missed their families, friends getting divorced, grieving together, celebrating together, all within the backdrop of the military.
I saw my friends battling these circumstances, and I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me, not being able to express our feelings about it.
The military and theater communities are actually very similar. You have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves; it's not about you.
You have a role, you have to know your role within that team.
Every team has a leader or director; sometimes they're smart, sometimes they're not.
You're forced to be intimate with complete strangers in a short amount of time; the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.
I thought, how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities, that brought entertainment to a group of people that, considering their occupation, could handle something a bit more thought-provoking than the typical mandatory-fun events that I remember being "volun-told" to go to in the military --
(Laughter)
all well-intended but slightly offensive events, like "Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader," where you answer a question about pop culture, and if you get it right you win a date, which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this already married, pregnant cheerleader --
(Laughter)
Nothing against cheerleaders, I love cheerleaders.
The point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending.
So we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces, where we tried to do that, tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities.
We pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is, grab a group of incredible theater-trained actors, arm them with incredible material, keep production value as minimal as possible -- no sets, no costumes, no lights, just reading it -- to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting.
It's a powerful thing, getting in a room with complete strangers and reminding ourselves of our humanity, and that self-expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder.
And for an organization like the military, that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms, you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience.
And I can think of no better community to arm with a new means of self-expression than those protecting our country.
We've gone all over the United States and the world, from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, to Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, to USAG Bavaria, on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.
And for the performing artists we bring, it's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to.
And for the military, it's the exact same.
And in doing this for the past six years, I'm always reminded that acting is many things.
It's a craft, it's a political act, it's a business, it's -- whatever adjective is most applicable to you.
But it's also a service.
I didn't get to finish mine, so whenever I get to be of service to this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again -- there's not many things better than that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez, called "I am not Batman." An incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez, is going to be reading, and Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago.
They're doing it together for the first time, so we'll see how it goes.
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.
(Applause)
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red.
And if you squint, you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city, like a mosquito net that won't let the angels in.
(Drum beat)
And if you look up high enough, you can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building.
And up there, a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years, up there is me.
(Beat)
And I'm frickin' Batman.
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.
And all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape, and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.
And my navy blue polo shirt, the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's but it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in and it's, like, all good.
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!
And I get like, like ... transformational.
(Beat)
And nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin' back.
(Beat)
Or for not talkin' back.
And nobody calls Batman simple or stupid or skinny.
And nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company 'cause they was making cutbacks, neither. 'Cause they got nothing but respect.
And not like afraid-respect, just, like, respect-respect.
(Laughter)
'Cause nobody's afraid of you. 'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.
(Beat)
Ever. (Double beat)
'Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuela's bills one day and die happy.
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.
(Laughter)
Oh -- and kill the Joker.
(Drum roll)
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin' like a eagle or like a -- no, yeah, like a eagle.
(Laughter)
And my cape is flapping in the wind cause it's frickin' long and my pointy ears are on, and that mask that covers like half my face is on, too, and I got, like, bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me.
And nobody -- nobody! -- is gonna come between Batman ... and justice.
(Drums) (Laughter)
From where I am, I can hear everything.
(Silence)
Somewhere in the city, there's a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and she's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth.
And somewhere there's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day.
And somewhere there's a man, a man in a janitor's uniform, stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer, and the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark.
And half a block away from janitor man, there's a group of good-for-nothings who don't know no better, waiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains and imitation Louisville Sluggers, and if they don't find a cent on him, which they won't, they'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning, till there's no more teeth to crack out.
But they don't count on me.
They don't count on no Dark Knight, with a stomach full of grocery-store brand macaroni and cheese and cut-up Vienna sausages.
(Laughter)
'Cause they'd rather believe I don't exist.
And from 87 stories up, I can hear one of the good-for-nothings say, "Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that, just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!" And I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale, and from 87 stories up, I can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies.
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!" And I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb.
(Cymbal)
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!
Who just turned out the lights?"
"What's that over there?" "What?"
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"
"Did anybody hear that?" "Hear what? There ain't nothing. No, really -- there ain't no bat!"
But then ... one out of the three good-for-nothings gets it to the head -- pow!
And number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him, but before his fist hits anything, I grab a trash can lid and -- right in the gut!
And number one comes back with the jump kick, but I know judo karate, too, so I'm like --
(Drums)
Twice!
(Drums)
(Laughter)
But before I can do any more damage, suddenly we all hear a "click-click." And suddenly everything gets quiet.
And the one good-for-nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up, like he's holding Jesus hostage, like he's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon.
And the good-for-nothing who got it to the head, who tried to jump-kick me, and the other good-for-nothing who got it in the gut, is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before 'em.
And the drunk man, the janitor man, is huddled in a corner, praying to Saint Anthony 'cause that's the only one he could remember.
(Double beat) And there's me: eyes glowing white, cape blowing softly in the wind.
(Beat) Bulletproof chest heaving, my heart beating right through it in a Morse code for: "Fuck with me just once come on just try."
And the one good-for-nothing left standing the one with the handgun -- yeah, he laughs.
And he lowers his arm.
And he points it at me and gives the moon a break.
And he aims it right between my pointy ears, like goal posts and he's special teams.
And janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony, but he ain't pickin' up.
And for a second, it seems like ... maybe I'm gonna lose.
Nah!
(Drums)
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!
"Don't kill me, man!"
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!
Skin meets acid: "Ahhhhhhh!"
And he's on the floor and I'm standing over him and I got the gun in my hands now and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em 'cause I'm Batman.
And, asterisk: Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago.
But for just a second, my eyes glow white, and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good-for-nothing in a language he maybe understands. Click-click!
(Beat)
And the good-for-nothings become good-for-disappearing into whatever toxic waste, chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of.
And it's just me and janitor man.
And I pick him up, and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead.
And he begs me not to hurt him and I grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar, and I pull him to my face and he's taller than me but the cape helps, so he listens when I look him straight in the eyes.
And I say two words to him: "Go home."
And he does, checking behind his shoulder every 10 feet.
And I swoosh from building to building on his way there 'cause I know where he lives.
And I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building.
And I'm back in bed before he even walks in through the front door.
And I hear him turn on the faucet and pour himself a glass of warm tap water.
And he puts the glass back in the sink.
And I hear his footsteps.
And they get slower as they get to my room.
And he creaks my door open, like, mad-slow.
And he takes a step in, which he never does.
(Beat) And he's staring off into nowhere, his face, the color of sidewalks in summer.
And I act like I'm just waking up and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?" And janitor man says nothing to me.
But I see in the dark, I see his arms go limp and his head turns back, like, towards me.
And he lifts it for I can see his face, for I could see his eyes.
And his cheeks is drippin', but not with sweat.
And he just stands there breathing, like he remembers my eyes glowing white, like he remembers my bulletproof chest, like he remembers he's my pop.
And for a long time I don't say nothin'.
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.
And he ain't looking my way, but I hear him mumble two words to me: "I'm sorry."
And I lean over, and I open my window just a crack.
If you look up high enough, you could see me.
And from where I am --
I could hear everything.
(Applause)
Thank you. (Applause)
OK, first, some introductions.
My mom, Jennie, took this picture.
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.
And on his left, my sisters: Mary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie.
John Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right.
And in the pale-blue windbreaker, Susan Diane. Me. I loved growing up in a big family.
And one of my favorite things was picking names.
But by the time child number seven came along, we had nearly run out of middle names.
It was a long deliberation before we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget.
Every parent in this audience knows the joy and excitement of picking a new baby's name.
And I was excited and thrilled to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.
But it's not like that everywhere.
I travel a lot and I see a lot.
But it took me by surprise to learn in an area of Ethiopia, parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more. Why delay? Why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time?
Well, they delay because they're afraid.
They're afraid their baby will die.
And this loss might be a little more bearable without a name.
A face without a name might help them feel just a little less attached.
So here we are in one part of the world -- a time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child -- while in another world, parents are filled with dread, not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks. How can that be? How can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they're even one month old? 2.6 million. That's the population of Vancouver.
And the shocking thing is: Why?
In too many cases, we simply don't know.
Now, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart.
And the pie chart was labeled, "Causes of death in children under five worldwide." And there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent -- 40 percent was labeled "neonatal." Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.
Neonatal is simply an adjective, an adjective that means that the child is less than one month old.
For me, "neonatal" said: "We have no idea."
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor. I want to fix things.
But you can't fix what you can't define.
So our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question: Why are babies dying?
So today, I want to talk about a new approach, an approach that I feel will not only help us know why babies are dying, but is beginning to completely transform the whole field of global health.
It's called "Precision Public Health."
For me, precision medicine comes from a very special place.
I trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist.
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better.
But too often my treatments made them feel worse.
I still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms -- adults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers.
They were so weak from the treatment I had given them.
But at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer, we had few tools.
And the tools we did have couldn't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve.
And so the side effects that you're all very familiar with -- hair loss, being sick to your stomach, having a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat -- were always surrounding us.
And then I moved to the biotechnology industry.
And I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells.
It's a drug called Herceptin.
And what Herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer, at the time, the scariest form of breast cancer.
And that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells, while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells. A huge breakthrough. It felt like a miracle, so much so that today, we're harnessing all those tools -- big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more -- to tackle a broad variety of diseases.
That's allowing us to target individuals with the right remedies at the right time.
Precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy. Everything changed. And I want everything to change again.
So I've been asking myself: Why should we limit this smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases to the rich world? Now, don't misunderstand me -- I'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin to the developing world, although I'd actually kind of like that.
What I am talking about is moving from this precise targeting for individuals to tackle public health problems in populations.
Now, OK, I know probably you're thinking, "She's crazy.
You can't do that.
That's too ambitious. "But here's the thing: we're already doing this in a limited way, and it's already starting to make a big difference.
So here's what's happening.
Now, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor.
But like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s, I also trained as an AIDS doctor.
It was a terrible time.
AIDS was a death sentence.
All my patients died.
Now, things are better, but HIV / AIDS remains a terrible global challenge.
Worldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV.
We know that when these women become pregnant, they can transfer the virus to their baby.
We also know in the absence of therapy, half those babies will not survive until the age of two.
But we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby.
So what do we do?
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach, kind of like that blast of chemo, would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world.
That would do the job.
But it's just not practical.
So instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest.
We know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest.
This precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half HIV transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years.
(Applause)
Screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world is a powerful example of how precision public health can change things on a big scale.
So... How do we do that?
We can do that because we know.
We know who to target, what to target, where to target and how to target.
And that, for me, are the important elements of precision public health: who, what, where and how.
But let's go back to the 2.6 million babies who die before they're one month old.
Here's the problem: we just don't know.
It may seem unbelievable, but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality in those countries with the highest infant mortality is a conversation with mom.
A health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child, "Was the baby vomiting?
Did they have a fever? "And that conversation may take place as long as three months after the baby has died.
Now, put yourself in the shoes of that mom.
It's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation.
And even worse -- it's not that helpful, because we might know there was a fever or vomiting, but we don't know why.
So in the absence of knowing that knowledge, we cannot prevent that mom, that family, or other families in that community from suffering the same tragedy.
But what if we applied a precision public health approach?
Let's say, for example, we find out in certain areas of Africa that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby, known as Group B streptococcus. In the absence of treatment, mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die.
Once we define the problem, we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin.
We can do that because then we'll know.
And that's the point: once we know, we can bring the right interventions to the right population in the right places to save lives.
With this approach, and with these interventions and others like them, I have no doubt that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our 15-year goal.
And that would translate into a million babies' lives saved every single year.
One million babies every single year.
And why would we stop there?
A much more powerful approach to public health -- imagine what might be possible.
Why couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition?
Why wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women?
And why not eradicate malaria?
(Applause)
Yes, clap for that!
(Applause)
So, you know, I live in two different worlds, one world populated by scientists, and another world populated by public health professionals.
The promise of precision public health is to bring these two worlds together.
But you know, we all live in two worlds: the rich world and the poor world.
And what I'm most excited about about precision public health is bridging these two worlds.
Every day in the rich world, we're bringing incredible talent and tools -- everything at our disposal -- to precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined would be possible.
Surely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools to stop babies dying in the poor world.
If we did, then every parent would have the confidence to name their child the moment that child is born, daring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades, not days.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much. Good evening.
Some of you may have noticed that my last name is Nutt.
And if you did, you are forgiven for wondering how a Nutt managed to end up in a war zone.
I actually was offered, right out of medical school, and accepted a volunteer contract to work with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia, that was worth one dollar.
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar in the event that the UN needed to issue an evacuation order, so that I would be covered.
I was, after all, heading into one of the world's most dangerous places.
And by now, some of you may be asking yourselves, and I just want to reassure you, that I did get half the money up front. (Laughter)
But you see, this is how, with 50 cents in my pocket, I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.
Journalists called it the "city of death." And they called it the city of death because 300,000 people had lost their lives there -- 300,000 people, mostly as a result of war-related famine and disease.
I was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.
It was right on the heels of the Rwandan genocide, and aid money to the region was drying up.
Many aid organizations, unfortunately, had been forced to close their doors.
And so the question that I was asked to specifically help answer, which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over, is: What the hell do we do now? You know, the security environment in Somalia at that moment in time — and nothing has really changed too much — can best be described as "Mad Max" by way of "A Clockwork Orange."
And I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival, I went up to a feeding clinic.
There were dozens of women who were standing in line, and they were clutching their infants very close.
About 20 minutes into this conversation I was having with this one young woman, I leaned forward and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby's hand.
And when I did this, I discovered that her baby was already in rigor.
She was stiff, and her little, lifeless hand was curled into itself.
She had died hours before of malnutrition and dehydration.
I later learned that as her baby was dying, this young woman had been held for two days by some teenage boys who were armed with Kalashnikov rifles, and they were trying to shake her down for more money, money she very clearly did not have.
And this is a scene that I have confronted in war zones the world over; places where kids, some as young as eight -- they are this big -- and those kids, they have never been to school. But they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles.
Is this just the way the world is?
Some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human.
After all, it is as old as existence itself.
We say never again, and yet it happens again and again and again.
But I will tell you that I have seen the absolute worst of what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another, and yet I still believe a different outcome is possible. Do you want to know why?
Because over 20 years of doing this work, going in and out of war zones around the world, I have come to understand that there are aspects of this problem that we, all of us, as people occupying this shared space, that we can change -- not through force or coercion or invasion, but by simply looking at all of the options available to us and choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war, instead of war at the expense of peace.
How so? Well, I want you to consider this: there are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today.
The vast majority of civilians, like that young baby, who are dying in war zones around the world, are dying at the hands of various armed groups who rely on a near-infinite supply of cheap, easy and efficient weapons to rape, threaten, intimidate and brutalize those civilians at every turn. How cheap? Well, in some parts of the world, you can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars.
In many places in which I have worked, it is easier to get access to an automatic rifle than it is to get access to clean drinking water.
And so now the important part: Can anything be done about this?
To answer that question, let's take a look at this map of the world.
And now, let's add in all of the countries that are currently at war, and the number of people who have either died or have been displaced as a result of that violence.
It is a staggering number -- more than 40 million people.
But you will also notice something else about this map.
You will notice that most of those countries are in the Global South.
Now, let's look at the countries that are the world's top 20 exporters of small arms in the world. And what do we notice? Well, you see them in green.
You will notice that those are mostly countries in the Global North, primarily Western countries.
What does this tell us?
This tells us that most of the people who are dying in war are living in poor countries, and yet most of the people who are profiting from war are living in rich countries -- people like you and me.
And then what if we go beyond small arms for a second.
What if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world?
Who does the biggest business?
Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons come from none other than the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany.
It's shocking, isn't it?
(Laughter) Now, some of you might be saying at this moment in time, "Oh yeah, but OK, hang on a second there ... Nutt."
Grade school was spectacular for me. It was, really, a wonderful experience.
(Laughter)
But you might be saying to yourselves, You know, all of these weapons in war zones -- they're not a cause, but an effect of the violence that plagues them each and every single day.
You know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order, promote peace and security, to combat terror groups -- surely this is a good thing.
Let's take a look at that assumption for just one moment, because you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade since the start of the War on Terror.
In fact, it is a business that has grown threefold over the past 15 years.
And now let's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the world in that same period. What do you notice? Well, you notice that, in fact, that also goes up roughly three- to fourfold.
They basically go up and end at the same point.
Now, we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms, or the other way around.
But here's what we should really take away from this.
What we should take away from this is that this is a relationship worth scrutinizing, especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to Iraq for use by the Iraqi Army, or to Syria for so-called moderate opposition fighters, that those arms, many of them, are now in the hands of ISIS; or when you consider that arms that were shipped to Libya are now actively drifting across the Sahel, and ending up with groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda and other militant groups.
And therein lies the problem.
Because, you see, small arms anywhere are a menace everywhere, because their first stop is rarely their last.
Spending on war per person per year now amounts to about 249 dollars -- 249 dollars per person, which is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid, money that is used to educate and vaccinate children and combat malnutrition in the Global South.
But we can shift that balance. How do we do this?
Well, it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand, so we can tackle it from both sides.
On the supply side, we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the Arms Trade Treaty, which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for.
Here in the United States, the largest arms-exporting country in the world by far, President Obama has rightly signed the Arms Trade Treaty, but none of it takes effect, it isn't binding, until it is approved and ratified by the Senate.
This is where we need to make our voices heard.
You know, the curbing of small arms -- it's not going to solve the problem of war.
Increased control mechanisms won't solve that problem.
But it's an important step in the right direction.
And it's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here.
What about on the demand side?
You know, there are generations around the world who are being lost to war.
It is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence with investments in education, in strengthening the rule of law and in economic development, especially for women.
I have personally seen just how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be around the world.
But here's the thing: they take time, which means for you as individuals, if you want to give, please, by all means do it.
But know that how you give is just as important as how much you give.
Regular contributions like monthly contributions are a far more effective way of giving, because they allow humanitarian organizations to properly plan and be invested over the long term, and to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war, wars that many of us, frankly, all too quickly forget.
When I first got on that plane for Somalia as a young doctor, I had no idea what it meant to live with war.
But I can tell you that I know what it means now.
And I know what it means to lie in bed in the pitch-black night and listen to that haunting "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!" of automatic gunfire, and wonder with absolute dread how many minutes I have left until it will be right on top of me.
I can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear, one that millions of people around the world are forced to confront each and every single day, especially children.
Over the years of doing this work, unfortunately, war has killed far too many people close to me.
And on at least a couple of occasions, war has very nearly killed me as well.
But I firmly believe, which is why I get up and do what I do every single day, that we can make different choices here.
Because you see, war is ours, as human beings.
We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.
We are therefore not powerless to solve it.
On the contrary, we are the only ones who can.
Thank you very much, and I want to wish you the greatest success. (Applause)
Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman doesn't need much of an introduction, but TED's audience is global, it's diverse, so I've been tasked with starting with his bio, which could easily take up the entire 18 minutes.
So instead we're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less.
(Laughter)
You were born in New Hampshire.
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.
EH: New Haven, Connecticut.
NL: There goes seven more seconds.
EH: Nailed it.
(Laughter)
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.
Your father was a con man -- I got that right.
He was taken away to prison when you were nine years old.
You flew 52 missions as a fighter pilot in World War II. You came back to --
NL: Radio operator.
EH: You came to LA to break into Hollywood, first in publicity, then in TV.
You had no training as a writer, formally, but you hustled your way in.
Your breakthrough, your debut, was a little show called "All in the Family." You followed that up with a string of hits that to this day is unmatched in Hollywood: "Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times," "The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time," "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," to name literally a fraction of them.
Not only are they all commercially --
(Applause) Not only are they all commercially successful, but many of them push our culture forward by giving the underrepresented members of society their first prime-time voice.
You have seven shows in the top 10 at one time.
At one point, you aggregate an audience of 120 million people per week watching your content.
That's more than the audience for Super Bowl 50, which happens once a year.
NL: Holy shit.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
EH: And we're not even to the holy shit part.
(Laughter) You land yourself on Richard Nixon's enemies list -- he had one.
That's an applause line, too.
(Applause)
You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame on the first day that it exists.
(Applause) Then came the movies. "Fried Green Tomatoes," "The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me," "This Is Spinal Tap."
(Applause) Then you wipe the slate clean, start a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the First Amendment and the separation of church and state.
You start People For The American Way. You buy the Declaration of Independence and give it back to the people.
You stay active in both entertainment and politics until the ripe old of age of 93, when you write a book and make a documentary about your life story.
And after all that, they finally think you're ready for a TED Talk.
NL: I love being here.
And I love you for agreeing to do this.
EH: Thank you for asking.
It's my honor.
(Laughter) So here's my first question. Was your mother proud of you? NL: My mother ... what a place to start.
Let me put it this way — when I came back from the war, she showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas, and they were absolute love letters. (Laughter) This really sums up my mother.
They were love letters, as if I had written them to -- they were love letters.
A year later I asked my mother if I could have them, because I'd like to keep them all the years of my life ... She had thrown them away.
(Laughter)
That's my mother.
(Laughter)
The best way I can sum it up in more recent times is -- this is also more recent times -- a number of years ago, when they started the Hall of Fame to which you referred.
It was a Sunday morning, when I got a call from the fellow who ran the TV Academy of Arts & amp; Sciences.
He was calling me to tell me they had met all day yesterday and he was confidentially telling me they were going to start a hall of fame and these were the inductees.
I started to say "Richard Nixon," because Richard Nixon —
EH: I don't think he was on their list.
NL: William Paley, who started CBS, David Sarnoff, who started NBC, Edward R. Murrow, the greatest of the foreign correspondents, Paddy Chayefsky -- I think the best writer that ever came out of television -- Milton Berle, Lucille Ball and me.
EH: Not bad.
NL: I call my mother immediately in Hartford, Connecticut. "Mom, this is what's happened, they're starting a hall of fame." I tell her the list of names and me, and she says, "Listen, if that's what they want to do, who am I to say?"
That's my Ma. I think it earns that kind of a laugh because everybody has a piece of that mother.
(Laughter)
EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother is born, right there.
So your father also played a large role in your life, mostly by his absence.
NL: Yeah.
EH: Tell us what happened when you were nine years old.
NL: He was flying to Oklahoma with three guys that my mother said, "I don't want you to have anything to do with them, I don't trust those men." That's when I heard, maybe not for the first time, "Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going." And he went.
It turns out he was picking up some fake bonds, which he was flying across the country to sell.
But the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane, and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat, just like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore.
You know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.
I mean, it was exotic that my father was going there.
But when he came back, they arrested him as he got off the plane.
That night newspapers were all over the house, my father was with his hat in front of his face, manacled to a detective.
And my mother was selling the furniture, because we were leaving -- she didn't want to stay in that state of shame, in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
And selling the furniture -- the house was loaded with people.
And in the middle of all of that, some strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said, "Well, you're the man of the house now." I'm crying, and this asshole says, "You're the man of the house now." And I think that was the moment I began to understand the foolishness of the human condition.
So... it took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a benefit. But —
EH: It's interesting you call it a benefit.
NL: Benefit in that it gave me that springboard.
I mean that I could think how foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy, "You're the man of the house now." And then I was crying, and then he said, "And men of the house don't cry." And I ...
(Laughter)
So... I look back, and I think that's when I learned the foolishness of the human condition, and it's been that gift that I've used.
EH: So you have a father who's absent, you have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough. Do you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard started you down a journey that ended with you being an adult with a weekly audience of 120 million people?
NL: I love the way you put that question, because I guess I've spent my life wanting -- if anything, wanting to be heard.
I think -- It's a simple answer, yes, that was what sparked -- well, there were other things, too.
When my father was away, I was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together, and I caught a signal that turned out to be Father Coughlin.
(Laughter)
Yeah, somebody laughed.
(Laughter)
But not funny, this was a horse's -- another horse's ass -- who was very vocal about hating the New Deal and Roosevelt and Jews.
The first time I ran into an understanding that there were people in this world that hated me because I was born to Jewish parents.
And that had an enormous effect on my life.
EH: So you had a childhood with little in the way of strong male role models, except for your grandfather. Tell us about him.
NL: Oh, my grandfather.
Well here's the way I always talked about that grandfather.
There were parades, lots of parades when I was a kid. There were parades on Veteran's Day -- there wasn't a President's Day.
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday, George Washington's birthday and Flag Day ... And lots of little parades.
My grandfather used to take me and we'd stand on the street corner, he'd hold my hand, and I'd look up and I'd see a tear running down his eye.
And he meant a great deal to me.
And he used to write presidents of the United States.
Every letter started, "My dearest, darling Mr. President," and he'd tell him something wonderful about what he did.
But when he disagreed with the President, he also wrote, "My dearest, darling Mr. President, Didn't I tell you last week...?"
(Laughter) And I would run down the stairs every now and then and pick up the mail.
We were three flights up, 74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.
And I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, "Shya C. called at this address." And that's the story I have told about my grandfather —
EH: They wrote him back on the envelopes --
NL: They wrote back.
But I have shown them myself, going way back to Phil Donahue and others before him, literally dozens of interviews in which I told that story.
This will be the second time I have said the whole story was a lie.
The truth was my grandfather took me to parades, we had lots of those.
The truth is a tear came down his eye.
The truth is he would write an occasional letter, and I did pick up those little envelopes.
But "My dearest darling Mr. President," all the rest of it, is a story I borrowed from a good friend whose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters.
And, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather and made him my own. Always.
When I started to write my memoir -- "Even this --" How about that? "Even This I Get to Experience." When I started to write the memoir and I started to think about it, and then I -- I -- I did a reasonable amount of crying, and I realized how much I needed the father.
So much so that I appropriated Arthur Marshall's grandfather.
So much so, the word "father" — I have six kids by the way.
My favorite role in life.
It and husband to my wife Lyn.
But I stole the man's identity because I needed the father.
Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit and come out on the other side, and I forgive my father -- the best thing I -- the worst thing I -- The word I'd like to use about him and think about him is -- he was a rascal.
The fact that he lied and stole and cheated and went to prison ... I submerge that in the word "rascal."
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal.
NL: I'm a pro.
EH: You're a pro.
(Laughter)
And that quote is widely attributed to John Lennon, but it turns out he stole it from T.S. Eliot.
So you're in good company.
(Laughter)
EH: I want to talk about your work.
Obviously the impact of your work has been written about and I'm sure you've heard about it all your life: what it meant to people, what it meant to our culture, you heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows, you raised half the people in the room through your work.
But have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you?
NL: Oh, god -- surprised me and delighted me from head to toe.
There was "An Evening with Norman Lear" within the last year that a group of hip-hop impresarios, performers and the Academy put together.
The subtext of "An Evening with ..." was: What do a 92-year-old Jew -- then 92 -- and the world of hip-hop have in common?
Russell Simmons was among seven on the stage.
And when he talked about the shows, he wasn't talking about the Hollywood, George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons," or the show that was a number five show.
He was talking about a simple thing that made a big --
EH: Impact on him?
NL: An impact on him -- I was hesitating over the word, "change." It's hard for me to imagine, you know, changing somebody's life, but that's the way he put it.
He saw George Jefferson write a check on "The Jeffersons," and he never knew that a black man could write a check.
And he says it just impacted his life so -- it changed his life.
And when I hear things like that -- little things -- because I know that there isn't anybody in this audience that wasn't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody, whether it's as little as a smile or an unexpected "Hello," that's how little this thing was.
It could have been the dresser of the set who put the checkbook on the thing, and George had nothing to do while he was speaking, so he wrote it, I don't know. But —
EH: So in addition to the long list I shared in the beginning, I should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop.
NL: Well ...
EH: I want to talk about —
NL: Well, then do it.
(Laughter)
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment, but you've also built a life of meaning.
And all of us strive to do both of those things -- not all of us manage to.
But even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those, very rarely do we figure out how to do them together.
You managed to push culture forward through your art while also achieving world-beating commercial success.
How did you do both?
NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished.
This planet is one of a billion, they tell us, in a universe of which there are billions -- billions of universes, billions of planets ... which we're trying to save and it requires saving.
But... anything I may have accomplished is — my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in Newington, Connecticut.
And I said, "Write your alderman or your mayor or something." She said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear." And that was the first time I said what I'm saying, I said, "Claire. With everything you think about what I may have done and everything you've done," — she never left Newington — "can you get your fingers close enough when you consider the size of the planet and so forth, to measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?" So... I am convinced we're all responsible for doing as much as I may have accomplished.
And I understand what you're saying —
EH: It's an articulate deflection --
NL: But you have to really buy into the size and scope of the creator's enterprise, here.
EH: But here on this planet you have really mattered.
NL: I'm a son of a gun.
(Laughter)
EH: So I have one more question for you.
How old do you feel?
NL: I am the peer of whoever I'm talking to.
EH: Well, I feel 93.
NL: We out of here?
EH: Well, I feel 93 years old, but I hope to one day feel as young as the person I'm sitting across from.
Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Norman Lear.
NL: Thank you.
I'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories.
Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time.
Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes.
But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
What if a photograph could actually collapse time, compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image?
I've created a concept called "Day to Night" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.
I know it has for me.
My process begins by photographing iconic locations, places that are part of what I call our collective memory.
I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.
Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night.
Using time as a guide, I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time.
I can take you to Paris for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
And I can show you the early morning rowers along the River Seine.
And simultaneously, I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.
I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air, and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day.
Day to Night is a global project, and my work has always been about history.
I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice and actually seeing it during a specific event.
And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata, an event that's actually been taking place since 1498.
The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is: this is not a timelapse, this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
I am a relentless collector of magical moments.
And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.
The entire concept came about in 1996.
LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
I got to the set and realized: it's a square.
So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images.
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.
And as I pan my camera to the right, I noticed there was a mirror on the wall and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
And for that one moment, that one image I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?" And then I came back to my studio in New York, and I hand-glued these 250 images together and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
I'm changing time in a photograph." And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.
This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
And I'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures.
To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this, most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane.
So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop capturing the entire day unfold.
One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
And trust me when I tell you, this is the greatest seat in the house to have.
But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
So once I decide on my view and the location, I have to decide where day begins and night ends.
And that's what I call the time vector.
Einstein described time as a fabric.
Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity.
I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.
One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph.
Now when I do these pictures, it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
I build a photograph based on time, and this is what I call the master plate.
This can take us several months to complete.
The fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs.
So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control. It's at the end of the process, if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same, that I then decide who's in and who's out, and it's all based on time.
I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.
I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.
Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt, the great Hudson River School painter.
He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic.
I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
I was literally on the side of a cliff, capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions, the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night.
And on a personal note, I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
And when that sun started to rise in the valley, I started to literally shake with excitement because I looked at the painting and I go, "Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier."
Day to Night is about all the things, it's like a compilation of all the things I love about the medium of photography.
It's about landscape, it's about street photography, it's about color, it's about architecture, perspective, scale -- and, especially, history.
This is one of the most historical moments I've been able to photograph, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.
And if you look closely in this picture, you can actually see time changing in those large television sets.
You can see Michelle waiting with the children, the president now greets the crowd, he takes his oath, and now he's speaking to the people.
There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.
For this particular photograph, I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air and it was not very stable.
So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight, our horizon line shifted.
So for every picture you see, and there were about 1,800 in this picture, we both had to tape our feet into position every time I clicked the shutter. I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work. (Applause)
I think the two most important are patience and the power of observation.
When you photograph a city like New York from above, I discovered that those people in cars that I sort of live with everyday, they don't look like people in cars anymore.
They feel like a giant school of fish, it was a form of emergent behavior.
And when people describe the energy of New York, I think this photograph begins to really capture that.
When you look closer in my work, you can see there's stories going on.
You realize that Times Square is a canyon, it's shadow and it's sunlight.
So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.
So wherever the shadows are, it's night and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.
Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around.
But in a very unique and special way, I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.
They embody a new metaphysical visual reality.
When you spend 15 hours looking at a place, you're going to see things a little differently than if you or I walked up with our camera, took a picture, and then walked away.
This was a perfect example.
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie." I watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
They were more interested in using it as a backdrop.
They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away.
And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example, a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into.
(Applause) The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself.
And finally, my most recent image, which has such a special meaning for me personally: this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera, this is not a reserve.
I went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.
Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a drought going on during the peak migration, a five-week drought. So all the animals were drawn to the water.
I found this one watering hole, and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving, I had a real opportunity to capture something unique.
We spent three days studying it, and nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed during our shoot day.
I photographed for 26 hours in a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.
What I witnessed was unimaginable.
Frankly, it was Biblical.
We saw, for 26 hours, all these competitive species share a single resource called water.
The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years.
The animals never even grunted at each other.
They seem to understand something that we humans don't. That this precious resource called water is something we all have to share.
When I created this picture, I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.
As technology evolves along with photography, photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory, but they will compose a new narrative of untold stories, creating a timeless window into our world. Thank you.
(Applause)
What is it that French people do better than all the others?
If you would take polls, the top three answers might be: love, wine and whining.
(Laughter)
Maybe. But let me suggest a fourth one: mathematics.
Did you know that Paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world?
And more streets with mathematicians' names, too.
And if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics, and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40, you will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant than any other country.
What is it that we find so sexy in math?
After all, it seems to be dull and abstract, just numbers and computations and rules to apply.
Mathematics may be abstract, but it's not dull and it's not about computing.
It is about reasoning and proving our core activity.
It is about imagination, the talent which we most praise.
It is about finding the truth.
There's nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking, you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem.
The great mathematician André Weil likened this -- no kidding -- to sexual pleasure.
But noted that this feeling can last for hours, or even days.
The reward may be big.
Hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world.
They are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses.
Close your eyes for moment and think of what is occurring right now around you.
Invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second, all in complete chaos.
And still, their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics.
And open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles.
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve, or the Law of Errors -- of deviations with respect to the mean behavior.
This curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals.
It's one of the most important curves ever.
It keeps on occurring again and again, from many theories and many experiments, as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians.
Of this curve, the famous scientist Francis Galton said, "It would have been deified by the Greeks if they had known it. It is the supreme law of unreason." And there's no better way to materialize that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.
Inside this board are narrow tunnels through which tiny balls will fall down randomly, going right or left, or left, etc. All in complete randomness and chaos.
Let's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together.
(Board shaking)
This is a bit of a sport, because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there. Aha. We think that randomness is going to play me a trick on stage.
There it is. Our supreme goddess of unreason. the Gauss Curve, trapped here inside this transparent box as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.
For you I have shown it, but to my students I explain why it could not be any other curve.
And this is touching the mystery of that goddess, replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation.
All of science is like this.
And beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure.
They also change our vision of the world.
For instance, Einstein, Perrin, Smoluchowski, they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the Gauss Curve to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.
It was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world.
More than 2,000 years ago, at the time of the ancient Greeks, it already occurred.
In those days, only a small fraction of the world had been explored, and the Earth might have seemed infinite.
But clever Eratosthenes, using mathematics, was able to measure the Earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent.
Here's another example. In 1673, Jean Richer noticed that a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris.
From this observation alone, and clever mathematics, Newton rightly deduced that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles, like 0.3 percent -- so tiny that you wouldn't even notice it on the real view of the Earth.
These stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the Earth which seems infinite, see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape.
And if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk, it is this: mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp.
Here's a modern example you will all relate to: searching the Internet.
The World Wide Web, more than one billion web pages -- do you want to go through them all?
Computing power helps, but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data.
Let's work out a baby problem. Imagine that you're a detective working on a crime case, and there are many people who have their version of the facts.
Who do you want to interview first?
Sensible answer: prime witnesses.
You see, suppose that there is person number seven, tells you a story, but when you ask where he got if from, he points to person number three as a source.
And maybe person number three, in turn, points at person number one as the primary source.
Now number one is a prime witness, so I definitely want to interview him -- priority.
And from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness.
And maybe I even want to interview him first, because there are more people who refer to him.
OK, that was easy, but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify?
And this graph, I may think of it as all people who testify in a complicated crime case, but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other, referring to each other for contents.
Which ones are the most authoritative? Not so clear.
Enter PageRank, one of the early cornerstones of Google.
This algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages, in the same way as we used randomness in the Galton Board experiment.
So let's send into this graph a bunch of tiny, digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph.
Each time they arrive at some site, they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one. And again, and again, and again.
And with small, growing piles, we'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles.
Here we go. Randomness, randomness. And from time to time, also let's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun.
And look at this: from the chaos will emerge the solution.
The highest piles correspond to those sites which somehow are better connected than the others, more pointed at than the others.
And here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try.
Once again, the solution emerges from the randomness.
Of course, since that time, Google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms, but already this was beautiful.
And still, just one problem in a million.
With the advent of digital area, more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis, making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one, to the extent that a few years ago, it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study about the best and worst jobs published by the Wall Street Journal in 2009.
Mathematician -- best job in the world.
That's because of the applications: communication theory, information theory, game theory, compressed sensing, machine learning, graph analysis, harmonic analysis.
And why not stochastic processes, linear programming, or fluid simulation?
Each of these fields have monster industrial applications.
And through them, there is big money in mathematics.
And let me concede that when it comes to making money from the math, the Americans are by a long shot the world champions, with clever, emblematic billionaires and amazing, giant companies, all resting, ultimately, on good algorithm.
Now with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth, mathematics does look more sexy.
But don't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one.
It is filled with perplexity, frustration, a desperate fight for understanding.
Let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician's life.
Or should I say, one of the most striking nights.
At that time, I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton -- for many years, the home of Albert Einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world.
And that night I was working and working on an elusive proof, which was incomplete.
It was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas, which are a crowd of electrons.
In the perfect world of plasma, there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to.
But still, if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium, you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes, or damps out, as if by some mysterious friction force.
This paradoxical effect, called the Landau damping, is one of the most important in plasma physics, and it was discovered through mathematical ideas.
But still, a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing.
And together with my former student and main collaborator Clément Mouhot, in Paris at the time, we had been working for months and months on such a proof.
Actually, I had already announced by mistake that we could solve it.
But the truth is, the proof was just not working.
In spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments, and a bunch discoveries, and huge calculation, it was not working.
And that night in Princeton, a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy.
I was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks, and still nothing was working. 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., not working.
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.
Then a few hours later, waking up and go, "Ah, it's time to get the kids to school --" What is this?
There was this voice in my head, I swear. "Take the second term to the other side, Fourier transform and invert in L2."
Damn it, that was the start of the solution!
You see, I thought I had taken some rest, but really my brain had continued to work on it.
In those moments, you don't think of your career or your colleagues, it's just a complete battle between the problem and you.
That being said, it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work.
And after we completed our huge analysis of the Landau damping, I was lucky enough to get the most coveted Fields Medal from the hands of the President of India, in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 -- an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream, a day that I will remember until I live.
What do you think, on such an occasion? Pride, yes? And gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible.
And because it was a collective adventure, you need to share it, not just with your collaborators.
I believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research, and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it.
And I've been working with my staff at Institut Henri Poincaré, together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide, so that we can found our own, very special museum of mathematics there.
So in a few years, when you come to Paris, after tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon, please come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincaré, and share the mathematical dream with us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage.
And when we get access to them, we are blown away, we fall in love. But most of the time, the world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.
What might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage, the beautiful locations and the art in this world?
Before we get started in this presentation, I just want to take care of a few housekeeping points.
First, I am no expert in art or culture.
I fell into this by mistake, but I'm loving it.
Secondly, all of what I'm going to show you belongs to the amazing museums, archives and foundations that we partner with.
None of this belongs to Google.
And finally, what you see behind me is available right now on your mobile phones, on your laptops.
This is our current platform, where you can explore thousands of museums and objects at your fingertips, in extremely high-definition detail.
The diversity of the content is what's amazing.
If we just had European paintings, if we just had modern art, I think it gets a bit boring.
For example, this month, we launched the "Black History" channel with 82 curated exhibitions, which talk about arts and culture in that community.
We also have some amazing objects from Japan, centered around craftsmanship, called "Made in Japan." And one of my favorite exhibitions, which actually is the idea of my talk, is -- I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls.
But I am, thanks to this exhibition, that has really taught me about the craftsmanship behind the soul of a Japanese doll.
Trust me, it's very exciting.
Take my word for it.
So, moving on swiftly. One quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform, which you can share with your kids and your friends right now, is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well.
One of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York, where you can get a taste of what it might feel like to actually be there.
You can go to the ground floor and obviously, most of you, I assume, have been there.
And you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is.
But imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay who's studying architecture, who hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet.
You can obviously look at objects in the Guggenheim Museum, you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth.
There's a lot of information here.
But this is not the purpose of my talk today.
This exists right now.
What we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future, when it comes to arts and culture and accessibility to arts and culture.
So I am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne, who is the professor of interactive design at ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland.
What Cyril and our team of engineers have been doing is trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these.
So I'm going to go quite quick now.
This object you see behind me -- oh, just clarification: Always, seeing the real thing is better.
In case people think I'm trying to replicate the real thing. So, moving on. This object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.
It's one of the oldest objects in the world, found in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago, and currently residing at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
It is also one of the oldest objects on our platform.
So let's zoom. We start from this one object.
What if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang?
What might that look like?
This is what we deal with on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute -- over six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions, to actually make these connections.
You can travel through time, you can understand more about our society through these.
You can look at it from the perspective of our planet, and try to see how it might look without borders, if we just organized art and culture.
We can also then plot it by time, which obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.
You can spend hours looking at every decade and the contributions in that decade and in those years for art, history and cultures.
We would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade, but we don't have the time right now.
So you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself.
(Applause)
But if you don't mind and can hold your applause till later, I don't want to run out of time, because I want to show you a lot of cool stuff.
So, just very quickly: you can move on from here to another very interesting idea.
Beyond the pretty picture, beyond the nice visualization, what is the purpose, how is this useful?
This next idea comes from discussions with curators that we've been having at museums, who, by the way, I've fallen in love with, because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories.
One of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator's table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?" You can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects and understanding where they come from.
It's a crazy Matrix experience.
(Laughter)
Just moving on, let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh, who is very well-represented on this platform.
Thanks to the diversity of the institutions we have, we have over 211 high-definition, amazing artworks by this artist, now organized in one beautiful view.
And as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper, you can see all the self-portraits, you can see still life.
But I just wanted to highlight one very quick example, which is very timely: "The Bedroom." This is an artwork where three copies exist -- one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, one at the Orsay in Paris and one at the Art Institute of Chicago, which, actually, currently is hosting a reunion of all three artworks physically, I think only for the second time ever.
But, it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at in a very different way, and you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd.
So let's take you and let's travel through "The Bedroom" very quickly, so you can experience what we are doing for every single object.
We want the image to speak as much as it can on a digital platform.
And all you need is an internet connection and a computer
(Applause)
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.
I'm sorry, this is all live, so you have to give Cyril a little bit of -- and this is available for every object: modern art, contemporary art, Renaissance -- you name it, even sculpture.
Sometimes, you don't know what can attract you to an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery.
So for me, personally, it was quite a challenge because when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google, my mother was not very supportive.
I love my mother, but she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff.
And for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation and you tick-mark and it's over, right?
And it took around four and a half years for me to convince my lovely Indian mother that actually, this is worthwhile.
And the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold.
So I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them.
And the first thing my mom asks me is, "How can we buy these?"
(Laughter)
And obviously, my salary is not that high, so I was like, "We can't actually do that, mom. But you can explore them virtually." And so now my mom — every time I meet her, she asks me, "Any more gold, any more silver in your project?
Can you show me? "And that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate.
It does not matter how you get in, as long as you get in.
Once you get in, you're hooked.
Moving on from here very quickly, there is kind of a playful idea, actually, to illustrate the point of access, and I'm going to go quite quickly on this one.
We all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing.
But we also know that most of us can't do it, and the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated.
So -- Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it?
We don't have a good name for this.
But essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions, 68 countries. But let's start with Rembrandt. We might have time for only one example.
But thanks to the diversity, we've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks from 46 institutions and 17 countries.
Let's say that on your next vacation, you want to go see every single one of them.
That is your itinerary, you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers, visit around, I think, 46 institutions, and just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.
(Laughter)
But remember, it's art, so you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.
Moving on swiftly from here, is something a little bit more technical and more interesting.
All that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections.
But obviously we have something cool nowadays that everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning.
So what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata, let's look at what machine learning can do based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection.
What we ended up with is this very interesting map, these clusters that have no reference point information, but has just used visuals to cluster things together.
Each cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery.
But one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portraits that we found from museums around the world.
If you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril.
Just to show you, you can just travel through portraits.
And essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses and clusters galore.
When we saw all these portraits, we were like, "Hey, can we do something fun for kids, or can we do something playful to get people interested in portraits?" Because I haven't really seen young kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery.
I wanted to try to figure something out.
So we created something called the portrait matcher.
It's quite self-explanatory, so I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face.
And essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head, we are matching different portraits around the world from museums.
(Applause)
And I don't know about you, but I've shown it to my nephew and sister, and the reaction is just phenomenal.
All they ask me is, "When can we go see this?" And by the way, if we're nice, maybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one? Oh, perfect. By the way, this is not rehearsed. Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow. OK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.
So, art and culture can be fun also, right?
For our last quick experiment -- we call all of these "experiments" -- our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning.
We show you clusters, visual clusters, but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters?
What if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata?
So what we have is this kind of explorer, where we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels.
And we haven't really done anything special here, just fed the collection.
And we found interesting categories.
We can start with horses, a very straightforward category.
You would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses, right?
And it has, but you also notice, right over there, that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses.
We also have an amazing head in terms of a horse.
And each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.
So let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting, because I don't understand how this category came up.
It's called "Lady in Waiting." If, Cyril, you do it very quickly, you will see that we have these amazing images of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.
I don't really understand it.
But I've been trying to ask my museum contacts, you know, "What is this?
What's going on here? "And it's fascinating.
Coming back to gold very quickly, I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tagged all the gold.
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.
We are living in popular times.
It tags it as "bling-bling."
(Laughter)
I'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast.
Essentially, here you have all the bling-bling of the world's museums organized for you.
And finally, to end this talk and these experiments, what I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion.
And what would we see when we see happiness?
If we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under "happiness," you would expect happiness, I guess.
But there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting, which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland, our friend and artist in residence as well, called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain." I don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain and it's been tagged here, but it's a very interesting thought.
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain, but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.
So take out your phones, take out your computers, go visit museums.
And just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists, historians, curators, who are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture. And the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, "What is your zodiac sign?" Don't think they are making small talk.
If you say, "I'm a Monkey," they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.
(Laughter) Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age.
By revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated.
Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year.
If you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life.
Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac.
As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that.
So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?
Most Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac, the signs divided into 12 months.
The Chinese zodiac is different.
It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals, starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, and has no association with constellations.
For example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit.
Can you see your zodiac sign there?
Our Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals.
Over thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other.
And some of the implications are quite amazing.
The Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others.
So parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families.
We even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations.
I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.
Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies.
As a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake.
Raise your hand if you are a Snake. Let's have a chat later.
(Laughter) We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon.
Unlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth.
It's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby.
Jack Ma's parents must have been very proud.
And they are not the only ones.
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent.
That means another one million more babies.
With a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100.
When those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets.
According to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. Why? That was the last month for the Year of the Horse.
It's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies.
(Laughter)
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.
Those are Goat babies.
They don't look like losers to me.
(Laughter)
Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament.
Many Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years.
Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition.
Maybe they are the lucky ones.
I went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon.
So maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition.
One last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index.
Although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades.
Our ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war.
And finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted.
The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods.
As China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world.
Are there any Monkeys here?
2016 is the Year of the Monkey.
Monkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous. Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female, like all of you.
And I'm also a social justice comedian, something that I insist is an actual job.
To explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here.
I've performed all over the country.
And let me tell you, America is majestic, right?
It's got breathtaking nature, waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see.
It is really something.
Now, the American population can be broken up into three main categories: there's mostly wonderful people, haters and Florida.
(Laughter)
Besides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters.
They are a minority, but they overcompensate by being extra loud.
They have the Napoleon complex of demographics, and yes, some of the men do wear heels.
As a social justice comedian, it's my goal to convert these haters, because they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes, like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.
This is not an exhaustive list; I'm probably missing 3-7 items.
But the point is, we have to reckon with the haters.
But there's variance within this group and it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?
So what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
I basically took all of the haters, I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist, and this is what I found.
(Laughter)
First off, we have the trolls.
These are your garden-variety digital haters.
They're the people who quit their jobs so they can post on YouTube videos all day long.
There's also the drive-by haters.
Now, these people will be at a stoplight, they'll wait for the light to turn green and when it does, they yell, "Go back to your own country!" Now back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars and hated you to your face.
But they just don't make them like they used to -- which is another sign of the decline in America.
(Laughter)
The next category is the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation- gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.
These guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization, like a church or a nonprofit, and they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice.
But the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.
The swing hater is sister to the swing voter -- they just can't decide!
They're like ideological sluts who move from hating to not hating.
And they do it because they don't have enough information.
This is the group I like to target with social justice comedy. Why comedy? Because on a scale of comedy to brochure, the average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph.
(Laughter)
Comedy is very popular. And by the way, this is a mathematically accurate graph, generated from fake numbers.
(Laughter)
Now, the question is: Why does social justice comedy work?
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.
And when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.
And in that moment of openness, a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information, and if they're really skilled, a rectal exam.
(Laughter)
Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy: first off, it's not partisan.
This isn't political comedy, this is about justice, and no one is against justice.
Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
Three, it's funny but sneaky, like you could be hearing an interesting treatise on income inequality, that's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.
(Laughter)
Here's how I see social justice comedy working.
A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians -- in a non-violent way --
(Laughter)
And we went around the country to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia -- places where they love the Muzzies -- and we did stand-up shows.
We called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"
(Laughter)
We turned this into a movie, and then after the movie came out, a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars on an anti-Muslim poster campaign with the MTA -- that's the New York City subway system.
Now, the posters were truly offensive, not to mentioned poorly designed -- I mean, if you're going to be bigoted, you might as well use a better font.
(Laughter)
But we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign that says nice things about Muslims, while promoting the movie.
So myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah decided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign.
We raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months, got the posters approved, and two days after they were supposed to go up, the MTA decided to ban the posters, citing political content.
Let's take a look at a couple of those posters. Here's one. Facts about Muslims: Muslims invented the concept of a hospital. OK. Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims.
(Laughter)
Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.
(Laughter)
Let's take a look at another one. The ugly truth about Muslims: they have great frittata recipes.
Now clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.
Either that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political -- but it isn't.
It's about justice.
So we decided to change our fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.
(Laughter)
So basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians took on a major New York City agency and the comedians won.
(Applause and cheers)
Thank you. Victory was a very weird feeling.
I was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time? 'Cause this is amazing!"
(Laughter)
Here's another example. I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?" We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.
They generally appear as single-panel cartoons, "I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!" The point of the website is that it denounces terrorism while recognizing that it's ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism.
But if bigotry isn't your thing, social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.
For example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp went to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.
Now, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens.
Not to brag, but at the end of every month, I have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income.
So we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents.
(Laughter)
The bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
Security would come out, brandish their weapons, and then we would squeal with fear and run away, because -- and this is the last rule of social justice comedy -- sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.
Most of my work is meant to be fun.
It's meant to generate a connection and laughter.
But yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security.
Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.
Sometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes, they'll kill me and they'll kill my family.
And those death threats are definitely not funny.
But despite the occasional danger, I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons.
I mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing.
But still, a lot of things are still kind of awful.
So I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years, and I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.
I believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
Hungry, extreme poverty: these often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems, too big to solve.
But as a field practitioner, I believe these are actually very solvable problems if we just take the right strategies.
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker, and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers, we can move the world.
In the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on.
This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes.
What is extreme poverty? When I first moved to rural East Africa, I stayed overnight with a farm family.
They were wonderful people.
They invited me into their home.
We sang songs together and ate a simple dinner.
They gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.
In the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.
And then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
For that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt when they handed one of those cups to me, and I knew I had to accept their hospitality.
Children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.
Every day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.
Amongst the extreme poor, one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.
When that's combined with poor access to health care, one in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.
And only one quarter of children complete high school because they lack school fees.
Hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.
We see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race, but until we solve these problems for all of our members, we fail that standard, because every person on this planet matters. This child matters. These children matter. This girl matters.
You know, we see things like this, and we're upset by them, but they seem like such big problems.
We don't know how to take effective action.
But remember our friend Archimedes.
Global poverty has powerful levers.
It's a problem like any other.
I live and work in the field, and as a practitioner, I believe these are very solvable problems.
So for the next 10 minutes, let's not be sad about the state of the world. Let's engage our brains. Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving and figure out what those levers are.
Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.
Think about how extraordinary this is.
If this picture represents the world's poor, then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
This gets me really excited.
All of these people, one profession.
Think how powerful this is.
When farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor earn more money and climb out of poverty.
And it gets better.
The product of farming is, of course, food.
So when farmers become more productive, they earn more food, and they don't just help themselves, but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.
And when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.
We only have two ways we can feed the world: we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive, or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland, which would be environmentally disastrous.
Farmers are basically a really important leverage point.
When farmers become more productive, they earn more income, they climb out of poverty, they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.
Farmers stand at the center of the world.
And not a farmer like this one, but rather this lady.
Most of the farmers I know are actually women.
Look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.
She is physically strong, mentally tough, and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.
If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands, then I'm really glad it's her.
(Applause)
There's just one problem: many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
Currently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year, they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age, and it's why many farmers are still very poor.
But good news, again.
Lever number two: humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.
Let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.
First, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.
If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety together with a drought-resistant variety, you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.
Next, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly, is environmentally sustainable.
If you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that's taller than I am, you unlock enormous yield gain.
These are known as farm inputs.
Farm inputs need to be combined with good practice.
When you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost, farmers multiply their harvests.
These proven tools and practices have more than tripled agricultural productivity in every major region of the world, moving mass numbers of people out of poverty.
We just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
So overall, this is amazing news.
Humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago, in theory.
We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.
In this century, the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in remote places.
They lack access to these things.
Therefore, ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people.
We don't need more genius types right now.
The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.
So these are the three levers, and the most powerful lever is simply delivery.
Wherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits set up delivery networks for life-improving goods, we eliminate poverty.
OK, so that sounds really nice in theory, but what about in practice?
What do these delivery networks look like?
I want to share the concrete example that I know best, my organization, One Acre Fund.
We only serve the farmer, and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.
We start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.
Now, this may appear initially very challenging, but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.
We buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network, and store it in 20 warehouses like this.
Then, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.
They then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.
It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.
Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.
Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.
And then we surround all that with training.
Our rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training to farmers in the field every two weeks.
Wherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty.
This is a farmer in our program, Consolata.
Look at the pride on her face.
She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet.
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.
(Applause)
The key to doing this is scalable delivery.
In any given area, we hire a rural field officer who delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average, with more than 1,000 people living in those families.
Today, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers growing very quickly.
This is our delivery army, and we're just one organization.
There are many companies, governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies just like this.
And I believe we stand at a moment in time where collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.
Let me show you how possible this is.
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a map of the United States for scale.
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory. It's very challenging.
But we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent, and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.
That's a remarkably small area overall.
If you were to lay these boxes next to each other within a map of the United States, they would only cover the Eastern United States.
You can order pizza anywhere in this territory and it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.
If America can deliver pizza to an area of this size, then Africa's companies, governments and non-profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers. This is possible.
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.
In every field of human development, humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.
We just need to deliver them.
So again, in every area of human development, super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive, highly effective tools.
Humanity is armed to the teeth with simple, effective solutions to poverty.
We just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.
Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
Urban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.
Again, using a map of the United States for scale, this is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.
In fact, for the first time in human history, we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.
The world's companies, governments and non-profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this relatively small area.
We just lack the will.
If we are willing, every one of us has a role to play.
We first need more people to pursue careers in human development, especially if you live in a developing nation.
We need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers, sales agents for life-improving goods.
These are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others.
But we also need a lot of support roles.
These are roles available at just my organization alone, and we're just one out of many.
This may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty, there is a role for you in this fight.
And no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty, we need a lot more resources.
This is our number one constraint.
For private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital, private equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.
But there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.
Private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor, so philanthropy still has a major role to play.
Anybody can give, but we need more leadership.
We need more visionary philanthropists and global leaders who will take problems in human development and lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet.
If you're interested in these ideas, check out this website.
We need more leaders. Humanity has put people on the moon.
We've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet.
We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace. We are an exceptional people. But we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
Until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential, we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.
Logistically speaking, it's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty.
We just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody.
If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.
Let's deploy our time, our careers, our collective wealth.
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy.
Too poor to pay their way through college, they now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars.
They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person.
In America, even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance.
But it is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged their student loan debts.
Once upon a time in America, going to college did not mean graduating with debt.
My friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University on the GI Bill.
For his generation, higher education was free or almost free, because it was thought of as a public good. Not anymore. When Paul also graduated from Colorado State University, he paid for his English degree by working part-time.
Not anymore. 30 years ago, higher education tuition was affordable, reasonable, and what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date. Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps, but with one difference: when she graduated five years ago, it was with a whopping debt.
Students like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most American families. But so what? Getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it.
But that's where the rubber meets the road.
Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013.
So... tuition costs up, public funding down, family incomes diminished, personal incomes weak.
Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan payments?
The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore.
I want to speak of three of them today.
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy.
All of us talk about education just as the economists do now, as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work.
As an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily.
The U.S. News & amp; World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines.
The language is peppered with barbarisms.
Teachers are called "service providers," students are called "consumers." Sociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science, all of these are "content."
Student debt is profitable. Only not on you.
Your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry.
The two 800-pound gorillas of which -- Sallie Mae and Navient -- posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars.
And just like home mortgages, student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced, and sold on Wall Street.
And colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice.
Once from your tuition, and then again from the interest on debt.
With all that money to be made, are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising, in bait and switch ... in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate?
Third: diplomas are a brand.
Many years ago my teacher wrote, "When students are treated as consumers, they're made prisoners of addiction and envy." Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone, so also people can be sold more and more education.
College is the new high school, we already say that.
But why stop there?
People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications, master's degrees, doctoral degrees.
Higher education is also marketed as a status object.
Buy a degree, much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag, to distinguish yourself from others.
So you can be the object of envy of others.
Diplomas are a brand.
But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
There is not a day that goes by without some policy guy on television telling us, "A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life." And the usual evidence offered is the college premium: a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.
Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers.
Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, for a number of reasons, including financial.
Of the 55 that do graduate, two will remain unemployed, and another 18 are underemployed.
So, college grads earn more than high school grads, but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college?
Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it.
But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone, for decades now.
For decades, workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced.
And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been a bad investment for many. College premium? I think it's a high school discount.
Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job.
And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising -- in fact, it's downright bleak.
And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt.
And it is they, curiously and sadly, who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing.
That's not just cynical marketing, that's cruel.
So what do we do? What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product?
Everybody else seems to.
Then, like any other consumer product, you would demand to know what you're paying for.
When you buy medicines, you get a list of side effects.
When you buy a higher educational product, you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose, make informed choices.
When you buy a car, it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect.
Who knows what to expect from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.
There is such a thing, by the way.
What if there was an app for that?
One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income.
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.
One of you make this.
(Laughter)
Discover your reality.
(Laughter)
There are three advantages, three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.
Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major.
Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy, to the sales pitch.
But also to choose wisely.
Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn?
There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition.
By tying the cost to the income, college administrators would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so.
For instance, all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major.
That is manifestly unfair, and should change.
An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student.
But the philosophy student, as a consequence, is subsidizing the engineering student.
Who then, by the way, goes on and earns more money.
Why should two people buy the same product, pay the same, but one person receive half or a third of the service.
In fact, college grads, some majors, pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt, while others pay five percent.
That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly.
Now of course, all this data -- and one of you is going to do this, right?
All this data has to be well designed, maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies.
We know about statistics, right?
But be that as it may, the third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition, is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product.
Perhaps, in time, young and old Americans may rediscover, as the gentleman said earlier, their curiosity, their love of learning -- begin to study what they love, love what they study, follow their passion ... getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry that they really want to.
After all, it was Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who prompted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of indebted students in America.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)
War has been a part of my life since I can remember.
I was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Soviets invaded, and even though I was too young to understand what was happening, I had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.
Those early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict.
I learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake, for most of them, giving in is not an option.
For these types conflicts -- when people's rights are violated, when their countries are occupied, when they're oppressed and humiliated -- they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back.
Which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is, if people see it as their only choice, they will use it.
Most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world.
But we're not going to end war by telling people that violence is morally wrong.
Instead, we must offer them a tool that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.
This is the work I do. For the past 13 years, I've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict.
Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
But people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years.
In fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country -- as women, as minorities, as workers, as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment -- these rights weren't handed to us.
They were won by people who fought for them and who sacrificed for them.
But because we haven't learned from this history, nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood.
I met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists, and they told me something that I hear a lot.
They said they'd already tried nonviolent action, and it hadn't worked.
Years ago they held a protest.
The government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that.
The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem.
Because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change, on their own, they don't actually create change -- at least change that is fundamental.
(Laughter)
Powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ... or even not so nicely.
(Laughter)
Nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent, not physically, but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive, and then denying them those sources of power.
Nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect.
They can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts.
And they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media.
There are a variety of methods that can be used to do this.
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp, has identified 198 methods of nonviolent action.
And protest is only one.
Let me give you a recent example.
Until a few months ago, Guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials with ties to organized crime.
People were generally aware of this, but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens, just 12 regular people, put out a call on Facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza, holding signs with a message: "Renuncia YA" — resign already.
To their surprise, 30,000 people showed up.
They stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country.
At one point, the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a message: "If you don't have the huevos" -- the balls -- "to stop corrupt candidates from running for office, you can borrow ours."
(Laughter)
President Molina responded by vowing that he would never step down.
And the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign.
They needed to leave him no choice.
So they organized a general strike, in which people throughout the country refused to work.
In Guatemala City alone, over 400 businesses and schools shut their doors.
Meanwhile, farmers throughout the country blocked major roads.
Within five days, the president, along with dozens of other government officials, resigned already.
(Applause)
I've been greatly inspired by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world.
For example, recently a group of activists in Uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets.
You can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.
(Laughter)
The pigs were painted the color of the ruling party.
One pig was even wearing a hat, a hat that people recognized.
(Laughter)
Activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines, but these isolated actions do very little if they're not part of a larger strategy.
A general wouldn't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war.
Yet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate.
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare, if not more.
Its participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives, and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives.
The technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works.
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied, and even though the number is growing, there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it.
This is dangerous, because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing.
The US government recently admitted that it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS.
But what most people don't know is that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action.
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014, they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum, based on their own extremist ideology.
But on the first day of school, not a single child showed up.
Parents simply refused to send them.
They told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed.
This is an example of just one act of defiance in just one city.
But what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against ISIS?
What if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy to identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function; the skilled labor needed to produce food; the engineers needed to extract and refine oil; the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems, and the local businesses that ISIS relies on?
It may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS with action that is nonviolent.
But it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it.
Here's an idea worth spreading: let's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful, just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs.
It may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war.
Violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were, because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective.
With human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest and latest technologies of war.
The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What does it mean to spend our time well?
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time.
Probably too much -- I probably obsess over it.
My friends think I do.
But I feel like I kind of have to, because these days, it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me, and when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.
Specifically, it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this, like technology -- I check things.
I'll give you an example. If this email shows up -- how many of you have gotten an email like this, right?
I've been tagged in a photo.
When this appears, I can't help but click on it right now. Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?
So I have to click it right now.
But I'm not just going to click "See photo," what I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.
(Laughter)
But the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen, and even knowing that's what's going to happen doesn't stop me from doing it again the next time.
Or I find myself in a situation like this, where I check my email and I pull down to refresh, But the thing is that 60 seconds later, I'll pull down to refresh again.
Why am I doing this? This doesn't make any sense.
But I'll give you a hint why this is happening.
What do you think makes more money in the United States than movies, game parks and baseball combined? Slot machines. How can slot machines make all this money when we play with such small amounts of money?
We play with coins.
How is this possible?
Well, the thing is ... my phone is a slot machine.
Every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see, what am I going to get? What am I going to get?
Every time I check my email, I'm playing the slot machine, saying, "What am I going to get?" Every time I scroll a news feed, I'm playing the slot machine to see, what am I going to get next?
And the thing is that, again, knowing exactly how this works -- and I'm a designer, I know exactly how the psychology of this works, I know exactly what's going on -- but it doesn't leave me with any choice, I still just get sucked into it.
So what are we going to do? Because it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship with technology, right?
You're either on, and you're connected and distracted all the time, or you're off, but then you're wondering, am I missing something important?
In other words, you're either distracted or you have fear of missing out. Right?
So we need to restore choice.
We want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it, and we're going to need help from designers, because knowing this stuff doesn't help.
We're going to need design help.
So what would that look like?
So let's take an example that we all face: chat -- text messaging.
So let's say there's two people.
Nancy's on the left and she's working on a document, and John's on the right.
And John suddenly remembers, "I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget." So when he sends her that message, it blows away her attention.
That's what we're doing all the time, bulldozing each other's attention, left and right.
And there's serious cost to this, because every time we interrupt each other, it takes us about 23 minutes, on average, to refocus our attention.
We actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing.
This is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research, that showed this.
And her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits.
The more interruptions we get externally, it's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves.
We actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes.
This is crazy. So how do we fix this? Because Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship.
Nancy might want to disconnect, but then she'd be worried: What if I'm missing something important?
Design can fix this problem.
Let's say you have Nancy again on the left, John on the right.
And John remembers, "I need to send Nancy that document." Except this time, Nancy can mark that she's focused.
Let's say she drags a slider and says, "I want to be focused for 30 minutes," so -- bam -- she's focused.
Now when John wants to message her, he can get the thought off of his mind -- because he has a need, he has this thought, and he needs to dump it out before he forgets.
Except this time, it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus, but John can get the thought off of his mind.
But this only works if one last thing is true, which is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important, John can still interrupt.
But instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions, we're now only creating conscious interruptions,
So we're doing two things here.
We're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John, But there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too. And it's that we're changing the question we're answering.
Instead of the goal of chat being: "Let's design it so it's easy to send a message" -- that's the goal of chat, it should be really easy to send a message to someone -- we change the goal to something deeper and a human value, which is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship between two people.
So we upgraded the goal. Now, do designers actually care about this?
Do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are?
Well, I'll tell you one story.
A little over a year ago, I got to help organize a meeting between some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.
And it was the most amazing meeting.
You have to imagine -- picture a room -- on one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech geeks; on the other side of the room, you have a bunch of long brown robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks.
And the questions were about the deepest human values, like what does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human values?
And our conversation centered on listening more deeply to what those values might be.
He joked in our conversation that what if, instead of a spell check, you had a compassion check, meaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive -- perceived as abrasive by someone else.
So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world, not just in these design meetings?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
So, great service -- what would their design goal be?
What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?
Right? Well, you would think it's to match guests with hosts. That's a pretty good goal.
But that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before, where we're just trying to deliver a message.
So what's the deeper, human goal?
Well, they set their goal as the need to create lasting, positive experiences and relationships between people who've never met before.
And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007, they introduced a way to measure this, which is incredible. I'll tell you how it works. For every design goal you have, you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you're doing -- a way of measuring success.
So what they do is, let's say you take two people who meet up, and they take the number of days those two people spent together, and then they estimate how many hours were in those days -- how many hours did those two people spend together?
And then after they spend that time together, they ask both of them: How positive was your experience?
Did you have a good experience with this person that you met?
And they subtract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website, because that's a cost to people's lives.
Why should we value that as success?
And what you were left with is something they refer to as "net orchestrated conviviality," or, really, just a net "Good Times" created.
The net hours that would have never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure your success in the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives that are positive, that would have never existed if you didn't do what you were about to do at work today?
Can you imagine a whole world that worked this way?
Can you imagine a social network that -- let's say you care about cooking, and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read, and subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like?
Imagine a professional social network that, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent, instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get.
And subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website.
Or imagine dating services, like maybe Tinder or something, where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did, which is how they measure success today, instead measured the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created.
Whatever that was for them, by the way.
But can you imagine a whole world that worked this way, that was helping you spend your time well?
Now to do this you also need a new system, because you're probably thinking, today's Internet economy -- today's economy in general -- is measured in time spent.
The more users you have, the more usage you have, the more time people spend, that's how we measure success.
But we've solved this problem before.
We solved it with organic, when we said we need to value things a different way.
We said this is a different kind of food.
So we can't compare it just based on price; this is a different category of food.
We solved it with Leed Certification, where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability.
What if we had something like that for technology?
What if we had something whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life?
And what if we could value it a different way, so it would actually work?
Imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores. Imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products.
Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?
We can create this world today.
Company leaders, all you have to do -- only you can prioritize a new metric, which is your metric for net positive contribution to human life. And have an honest conversation about that. Maybe you're not doing so well to start with, but let's start that conversation.
Designers, you can redefine success; you can redefine design.
Arguably, you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that all of us live by.
Maybe like in medicine, where we have a Hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and this higher value that we have to treat patients. What if designers had something like that, in terms of this new kind of design?
And users, for all of us -- we can demand technology that works this way.
Now it may seem hard, but McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there.
Walmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there.
We have to demand this new kind of technology.
And we can do that.
And doing that would amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run entirely on time spent, to world that's driven by time well spent.
I want to live in this world, and I want this conversation to happen.
Let's start that conversation now.
Thank you.
So we all have our own biases.
For example, some of us tend to think that it's very difficult to transform failing government systems.
When we think of government systems, we tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways, and perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things.
Well, today, I want to challenge that theory.
I want to tell you a story of a very large government system that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years.
This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like.
There are 1 million such schools in India.
And even for me, who's lived in India all her life, walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking.
By the time kids are 11, 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover.
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition, they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence.
These are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old to be able to do.
By the time kids are 13 or 14, they tend to drop out of schools.
In India, public schools not only offer free education -- they offer free textbooks, free workbooks, free meals, sometimes even cash scholarships.
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools.
As a comparison, in a far richer country, the US, that number is only 10 percent.
That's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.
So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013 from an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan.
She was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Education in a state called Haryana in India.
So she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department for the last two years.
I've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work. Can you possibly help?"
Let me describe Haryana a little bit to you.
Haryana is a state which has 30 million people.
It has 15,000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools.
So basically, with that phone call, I promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself.
As I started this project, I was very painfully aware of two things.
One, that I had never done anything like this before.
And two, many others had, perhaps without too much success.
As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world, we couldn't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana.
We knew that we had to craft our own journey.
But anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in, all sorts of ideas started flying at us.
People said, "Let's change the way we recruit teachers, let's hire new principals and train them and send them on international learning tours, let's put technology inside classrooms." By the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table, all amazing, all sounded right.
There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.
So I said, "Hang on, stop.
Let's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve." So with a lot of push and pull and debate, Haryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020, we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge.
Now the specifics of the goal don't matter here, but what matters is how specific the goal is.
Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement.
Does this idea support this goal?
If yes, let's keep it.
But if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it aside.
As simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey.
And looking back over the last two and a half years, that has been a huge positive for us.
So we had the goal, and now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken.
Before we went into schools, a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are lazy, they don't come into schools, or they're incapable, they actually don't know how to teach.
Well, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different.
On most days, most teachers were actually inside schools.
And when you spoke with them, you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes.
But they were not teaching.
I went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet supervised.
I went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts.
At lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students.
So we asked the teachers, "What's going on, why are you not teaching?" And they said, "This is what's expected of us.
When a supervisor comes to visit us, these are exactly the things that he checks.
Has the toilet been made, has the meal been served.
When my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters, these are exactly the things which are discussed."
You see, what had happened was, over the last two decades, India had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools, and enrollment, bringing children into the schools.
So the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges, and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs.
Not explicitly, but implicitly.
And now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach.
They needed to be monitored and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things.
So as we went through the education system, as we delved into it deeper, we found a few such core root causes which were determining, which were shaping how people behaved in the system.
And we realized that unless we change those specific things, we could do a number of other things. We could train, we could put technology into schools, but the system wouldn't change.
And addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program.
So, we had the goal and we had the issues, and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were.
We obviously did not want to recreate the wheel, so we said, "Let's look around and see what we can find." And we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world.
Small things being done by NGOs, being done by foundations.
But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled.
All of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
And here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.
So we looked into why, if these things actually work, why don't they actually scale?
What happens is that when a typical NGO comes in, they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources.
So they might bring in money, they might bring in people, they might bring in technology.
And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in, those additional resources actually create a difference.
But now imagine that the head of this NGO goes to the head of the School Education Department and says, "Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 schools." Where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to 15,000 schools?
He doesn't have the additional money, he doesn't have the resources.
And hence, innovations don't scale.
So right at the beginning of the project, what we said was, "Whatever we have to do has to be scalable, it has to work in all 15,000 schools." And hence, it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has.
Much easier said than done. (Laughter) I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me.
We spent a lot of long hours in office, in cafés, sometimes even in bars, scratching out heads and saying, "Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"
In the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues.
I'll give you an example.
In the context of effective learning, one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning. Children shouldn't memorize things from books, they should do activities, and that's a more effective way to learn.
Which basically means giving students things like beads, learning rods, abacuses.
But we did not have the budgets to give that to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.
We needed another solution.
We couldn't think of anything.
One day, one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students.
That was a huge eureka moment for us.
So what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana is that after every concept, we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say, "To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do.
And by the way, in order to actually do this activity, here are things that you can use from your immediate environment, whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside, which can be used as learning aids for kids." And we see teachers all over Haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students.
So in this way, whatever we designed, we were actually able to implement it across all 15,000 schools from day one.
Now, this brings me to my last point.
How do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers?
The department used to have a process which is very interesting.
I like to call it "The Chain of Hope." They would write a letter from the headquarters and send it to the next level, which was the district offices.
They would hope that in each of these district offices, an officer would get the letter, would open it, read it and then forward it to the next level, which was the block offices.
And then you would hope that at the block office, somebody else got the letter, opened it, read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals.
And then one would hope that the principals got the letter, received it, understood it and started implementing it.
It was a little bit ridiculous.
Now, we knew technology was the answer, but we also knew that most of these schools don't have a computer or email.
However, what the teachers do have are smartphones.
They're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp.
So what now happens in Haryana is, all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated, it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups.
It spreads like wildfire.
You can immediately check who has received it, who has read it.
Teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously.
And what's interesting is, it's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions.
Another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question.
Everybody's acting as everybody's peer group, and things are getting implemented.
So today, when you go to a school in Haryana, things look different.
The teachers are back inside classrooms, they're teaching.
Often with innovative techniques.
When a supervisor comes to visit the classroom, he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching.
Once a quarter, all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded.
And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations.
Of course, they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future.
In the context of education, it's very difficult to see results quickly.
When people talk about systemic, large-scale change, they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years.
But not in Haryana.
In the last one year, there have been three independent studies, all measuring student learning outcomes, which indicate that something fundamental, something unique is happening in Haryana.
Learning levels of children have stopped declining, and they have started going up.
Haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement, and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement.
These are still early signs, there's a long way to go, but this gives us a lot of hope for the future.
I recently went to a school, and as I was leaving, I ran into a lady, her name was Parvati, she was the mother of a child, and she was smiling.
And I said, "Why are you smiling, what's going on?" And she said, "I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is that my children are learning, they're having fun, and for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school to send them to."
So I go back to where I started: Can government systems transform?
I certainly believe so.
I think if you give them the right levers, they can move mountains.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was a kid, I experienced something so powerful, I spent the rest of my life searching for it, and in all the wrong places.
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality. It was music. And this is where the story begins.
That's me, listening to the Beatles' "White Album." And the look on my face is the feeling that I've been searching for ever since.
Music goes straight to the emotional vein, into your bloodstream and right into your heart.
It deepens every experience. Fellas?
(Music)
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert and Joshua Roman. Music --
(Applause)
Yeah.
Music makes everything have more emotional resonance.
Let's see how it does for this talk.
The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level.
When I hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl, I'm instantly transported back there again. Hey, Stacey.
Here's a part of the story, though, where I got a little greedy.
I thought if I added more layers on top of the music, I could make the feelings even more powerful.
So I got into directing music videos.
This is what they looked like.
That's my brother, Jeff. Sorry about this, Jeff.
(Laughter)
Here's me, just so we're even. Incredible moves. Should've been a dancer.
(Laughter)
These experiments grew, and in time, started to look more like this.
In both, I'm searching for the same thing, though, to capture that lightning in a bottle.
Except, I'm not.
Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes, but never quite equated the power that just raw music had for me on its own.
This is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life and professional career to becoming a music video director.
I kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path?
So I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more, I might be able to make you feel something more as well.
So Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work, like your childhood home in "The Wilderness Downtown," your hand-drawn portraits, in "The Johnny Cash Project," and your interactive dreams in "3 Dreams of Black." We were pushing beyond the screen, trying to connect more deeply to people's hearts and imaginations.
But it wasn't quite enough.
It still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me.
So I started chasing a new technology that I only had read about in science fiction.
And after years of searching, I found a prototype.
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
I could taste the lightning.
It was called virtual reality.
This was it five years ago when I ran into it.
This is what it looks like now.
I quickly started building things in this new medium, and through that process we realized something: that VR is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums.
In fact, it's going to be the last one.
I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author's expression of an experience, to our experiencing it firsthand. You look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry.
(Laughter)
If we go back to the origins of mediums, by all best guesses, it starts around a fire, with a good story.
Our clan leader is telling us about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day.
We hear his words and translate them into our own internal truths.
The same thing happens when we look at the cave painting version of the story, the book about the mammoth hunt, the play, the radio broadcast, the television show or the movie.
All of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief," because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality.
I'm using the word "consciousness" as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us.
Virtual reality bridges that gap.
Now, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader.
Or you are the clan leader. Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.
(Laughter)
So here's what special about VR.
In all other mediums, your consciousness interprets the medium.
In VR, your consciousness is the medium.
So the potential for VR is enormous.
But where are we now?
What is the current state of the art?
Well, we are here.
We are the equivalent of year one of cinema.
This is the Lumière Brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them.
Similar to this early stage of this medium, in VR, we also have to move past the spectacle and into the storytelling.
It took this medium decades to figure out its preferred language of storytelling, in the form of a feature film.
In VR today, we're more learning grammar than writing language.
We've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse, and we've learned a few things.
We found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses, your emotions, even your body.
So let me show you some things.
For the purpose of this demo, we're going to take every direction that you could possibly look, and stretch it into this giant rectangle. OK, here we go.
So, first: camera movement is tricky in VR.
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.
We found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line, you can actually get away with it, though.
The first day in film school, they told me you have to learn every single rule before you can break one.
We have not learned every single rule.
We've barely learned any at all, but we're already trying to break them to see what kind of creative things we can accomplish.
In this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceleration.
I did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground.
In VR, I can give that to you.
(Music)
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well.
It guides us how to feel.
In this project we made with the New York Times, Zach Richter and our friend, JR, we take you up in a helicopter, and even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan, you don't feel afraid.
You feel triumphant for JR's character.
The music guides you there.
(Music)
Contrary to popular belief, there is composition in virtual reality, but it's completely different than in film, where you have a rectangular frame.
Composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you.
In this film, "Waves of Grace," which was a collaboration between Vrse, the United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail, we also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality. A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone.
It brings that character inside of your personal space, a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love.
And you feel an emotional closeness to the character because of what you feel to be a physical closeness.
Directing VR is not like directing for the rectangle.
It's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention.
One tool we can use to guide your attention is called "spatialized sound." I can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right, even behind you, and when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly.
So I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see.
Next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder, it might be Bono.
(Laughter)
VR makes us feel like we are part of something.
For most of human history, we lived in small family units. We started in caves, then moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns, and now we're all global citizens.
But I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most about the things that are local to us.
And VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local.
That's why it works as an empathy machine.
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp, and instead of watching a story about people over there, it's now a story about us here.
But where do we go from here?
The tricky thing is that with all previous mediums, the format is fixed at its birth.
Film has been a sequence of rectangles, from Muybridge and his horses to now.
The format has never changed.
But VR as a format, as a medium, isn't complete yet.
It's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals.
It actually employs what we use to make sense of the world.
We're using your senses as the paints on the canvas, but only two right now.
Eventually, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed, and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose.
And we call it virtual reality right now, but what happens when we move past simulated realities? What do we call it then? What if instead of verbally telling you about a dream, I could let you live inside that dream?
What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth, you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole, or create galaxies from scratch, or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts?
That's not a virtual reality anymore.
And honestly I don't know what that's called.
But I hope you see where we're going.
But here I am, intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential. So let's experience it.
Tap on the power button to unlock the phone. For the people watching at home, we're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself, and even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with.
We played in cardboard boxes as kids, and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again.
You're about to participate in the largest collective VR viewing in history.
And in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear, we're all going to watch something at the exact same time, together.
Let's hope it works.
What's the countdown look like?
I can't see.
(Video) JR: Let me tell you how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine, "Walking New York." I just got strapped on outside the helicopter, and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it.
And when I was perfectly above -- you know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times -- then I kept shooting.
(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord, protect us from evil, for you are the Lord, the light.
You who gave us life took it away.
Let your will be done.
Please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones. Help us to live again.
Child's voice: There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now.
Sometimes I think we are the ones in charge.
Chris Milk: How was it?
(Applause)
That was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation.
I just made you all stand.
I knew you'd applaud at the end.
(Applause)
I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienced.
That way we can collectively start to shape this, not as a tech platform but as a humanity platform.
And to that end, in November of last year, the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced." It launched with one million Google Cardboards sent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper.
But a funny thing happened that Sunday morning.
A lot of people got them that were not the intended recipients on the mailing label.
And we started seeing this all over Instagram. Look familiar?
Music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable for a very long time.
Now, millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that I had in mine.
Only I think this one surpasses it.
Let's see where this leads them.
Thank you.
As a little Hawaiian, my mom and auntie always told me stories about Kalaupapa -- the Hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world -- and Father Damien, the Belgian missionary who gave his life for the Hawaiian community.
As a young nurse, my aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers almost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy.
I remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule, while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to Kalaupapa.
You see, as a youngster, I was always curious about a few things.
First was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation in Kalaupapa, knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people he sought to help.
And secondly, where did the leprosy bacteria come from?
And why were Kānaka Maoli, the indigenous people of Hawaii, so susceptible to developing leprosy, or "mai Pake?"
This got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawaiians -- namely, our genetic makeup.
But it wasn't until high school, through the Human Genome Project, that I realized I wasn't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our potential health, wellness and illness.
You see, the 2.7 billion-dollar project promised an era of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic makeup.
So to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream, we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet.
That's why 10 years later, it continues to shock me, knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclusively on individuals of European ancestry.
Now you don't need a PhD to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity.
And in my own searching, I've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities, like myself.
So that begs the question: Who is the Human Genome Project actually for?
Just like we have different colored eyes and hair, we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes.
So how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of European ancestry?
This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust.
For example, in 1989, researchers from Arizona State University obtained blood samples from Arizona's Havasupai tribe, promising to alleviate the burden of type 2 diabetes that was plaguing their community, only to turn around and use those exact same samples -- without the Havasupai's consent -- to study rates of schizophrenia, inbreeding, and challenge the Havasupai's origin story.
When the Havasupai found out, they sued successfully for $700,000, and they banned ASU from conducting research on their reservation.
This culminated in a sort of domino effect with local tribes in the Southwest -- including the Navajo Nation, one of the largest tribes in the country -- putting a moratorium on genetic research.
Now despite this history of distrust, I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research.
And if we don't do something soon, the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen.
Hawaii, for example, has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the US, yet native Hawaiians like myself die a full decade before our non-native counterparts, because we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the number one and number two killers in the US: cardiovascular disease and cancer.
So how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit?
My vision is to make genetic research more native, to indigenize genome sequencing technology.
Traditionally, genomes are sequenced in laboratories.
Here's an image of your classic genome sequencer. It's huge. It's the size of a refrigerator. There's this obvious physical limitation.
But what if you could sequence genomes on the fly?
What if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket?
This nanopore-based sequencer is one 10,000th the size of your traditional genome sequencer.
It doesn't have the same physical limitations, in that it's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords, large vats of chemicals or computer monitors.
It allows us to de-black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that's immersive and collaborative, activating and empowering indigenous communities ... as citizen scientists.
100 years later in Kalaupapa, we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time, using mobile genome sequencers, remote access to the Internet and cloud computation.
But only if that's what Hawaiian people want.
In our space, on our terms.
IndiGenomics is about science for the people by the people.
We'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource, focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information.
Eventually we'd like to have our own IndiGenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists.
In the end, indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research.
And for those on the outside, just as Father Damien did, the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying.
Mahalo.
(Applause)
I'll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends.
I'll never forget the sound of my mother's voice right before I fell asleep.
And I'll never forget the comforting sound of water trickling down a stream.
Imagine my fear, pure fear, when, at the age of 10, I was told I was going to lose my hearing.
And over the next five years, it progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf.
But I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I've ever received.
You see, I get to experience the world in a unique way.
And I believe that these unique experiences that people with disabilities have is what's going to help us make and design a better world for everyone -- both for people with and without disabilities.
I used to be a disability rights lawyer, and I spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law, ensuring that accommodations were made.
And then I had to quickly learn international policy, because I was asked to work on the UN Convention that protects people with disabilities.
As the leader of the NGO there, I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities.
But somewhere along the way, and after many career transitions that my parents weren't so happy about --
(Laughter)
I stumbled upon a solution that I believe may be an even more powerful tool to solve some of the world's greatest problems, disability or not.
And that tool is called design thinking.
Design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving.
There are five steps.
The first is defining the problem and understanding its constraints.
The second is observing people in real-life situations and empathizing with them.
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas -- the more the better, the wilder the better.
Fourth, prototyping: gathering whatever you can, whatever you can find, to mimic your solution, to test it and to refine it.
And finally, implementation: ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable.
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways, to reframe, to refine, to experiment and, probably most importantly, ask those stupid questions.
Design thinkers believe that everyone is creative.
They believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together, because they want to share multiple perspectives and bring them together and ultimately merge them to form something new.
Design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry.
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced, so I decided to go back to school and get my master's in social design.
This looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world.
While I was there, I fell in love with woodworking.
But what I quickly realized was that I was missing out on something.
As you're working with a tool, right before it's about to kick back at you -- which means the piece or the tool jumps back at you -- it makes a sound.
And I couldn't hear this sound.
So I decided, why not try and solve it?
My solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually alert the user to pitch changes in the tool, before the human ear could pick it up.
Why hadn't tool designers thought of this before?
(Laughter)
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.
I wasn't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom.
The second is: I was Deaf.
My unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.
disability or not. And as I went on, I kept running into more and more solutions that were originally made for people with disabilities, and that ended up being picked up, embraced and loved by the mainstream,
This is an OXO potato peeler.
It was originally designed for people with arthritis, but it was so comfortable, everybody loved it.
Text messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf.
And as you know, everybody loves that, too.
(Laughter)
I started thinking: What if we changed our mindset?
What if we started designing for disability first -- not the norm?
As you see, when we design for disability first, we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive, but also are often better than when we design for the norm.
And this excites me, because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged, molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation.
This moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the deficiency mindset of tolerance, to becoming an alchemist, the type of magician that this world so desperately needs to solve some of its greatest problems.
Now, I also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design-thinking process.
Without knowing it, from a very early age, I've been a design thinker, fine-tuning my skills.
Design thinkers are, by nature, problem solvers.
So imagine listening to a conversation and only understanding 50 percent of what is said.
You can't ask them to repeat every single word.
They would just get frustrated with you.
So without even realizing it, my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard, that was the beat, and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read.
Years later, someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it.
Well, this is because I experience conversations as rhythms.
I also became really, really good at failing.
(Laughter)
Quite literally. My first semester in Spanish, I got a D. But what I learned was that when I picked myself up and changed a few things around, eventually, I succeeded.
Similarly, design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often, because eventually, you will succeed.
Very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succeeding on the first try.
I also experienced this lesson in sports.
I'll never forget my coach saying to my mom, "If she just didn't have her hearing loss, she would be on the national team." But what my coach, and what I didn't even know at the time, was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports.
You see, when you lose your hearing, not only do you adapt your behavior, but you also adapt your physical senses.
One example of this is that my visual attention span increased.
Imagine a soccer player, coming down the left flank.
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was, and the ball is coming down the left flank.
A person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this.
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.
So I picked up the players over here, that were moving about and coming down the field.
And I picked them up quicker, so that if the ball was passed, I could reposition myself and be ready for that shot.
So as you can see, I've been a design thinker for nearly all my life.
My observation skills have been honed so that I pick up on things that others would never pick up on.
My constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator and problem solver.
And I've often had to do this within limitations and constraints.
This is something that designers also have to deal with frequently.
My work most recently took me to Haiti.
Design thinkers often seek out extreme situations, because that often informs some of their best designs.
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.
I lived and worked with 300 Deaf individuals that were relocated after the 2010 earthquake.
But five and a half years later, there still was no electricity; there still was no safe drinking water; there were still no job opportunities; there was still rampant crime, and it went unpunished.
International aid organizations came one by one.
But they came with pre-determined solutions.
They didn't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the community's needs.
One organization gave them goats and chickens.
But they didn't realize that there was so much hunger in that community, that when the Deaf went to sleep at night and couldn't hear, people broke into their yards and their homes and stole these chickens and goats, and eventually they were all gone.
Now, if that organization had taken the time to observe Deaf people, to observe the community, they would have realized their problem and perhaps they would have come up with a solution, something like a solar light, lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night to ensure their safety.
You don't have to be a design thinker to insert the ideas I've shared with you today. You are creative. You are a designer -- everyone is.
Let people like me help you.
Let people with disabilities help you look sideways, and in the process, solve some of the greatest problems.
That's it. Thank you.
(Applause)
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist.
(Laughter)
I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other.
And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.
(Laughter)
And I thought you might like to know who you are.
(Laughter)
But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.
I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives.
And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person.
Now, already you may be saying of yourself, "I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere." Or you may say of yourself, "I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."
(Laughter)
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.
So let me explain why this is so.
One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people.
They spell out the acronym OCEAN.
So, "O" stands for "open to experience," versus those who are more closed. "C" stands for "conscientiousness," in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. "E" -- "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people. "A" -- "agreeable individuals," in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable.
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals," in contrast to those who are more stable.
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes.
And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd.
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion.
Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people.
Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing.
With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow.
(Laughter)
Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow.
But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them.
(Laughter)
Those are the extroverts.
Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures.
First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology.
Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.
And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your "idiogenic" nature.
Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.
And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.
They all gather together.
And I've seen you.
The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial.
It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.
Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.
Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.
When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, "I really need a cup of coffee," they're not kidding -- they really do.
Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.
But it's a misconstrual.
So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point.
I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time.
And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK.
(Laughter)
There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert.
So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --
(Laughter)
How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much.
Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well.
(Laughter)
We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts.
Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness.
They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.
They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze.
We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody.
So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes "Charlie," and then "Chuck," and then "Chuckles Baby."
(Laughter)
Whereas for introverts, it remains "Charles," until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language.
Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently.
We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences --
(Laughter)
More or less?
(Laughter)
As it were.
(Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that.
When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other.
I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be.
First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't.
(Laughter)
Secondly, he's six foot five.
I have a tendency not to be.
(Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find.
I am seriously introverted.
I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening.
We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael.
And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt.
So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, "What do you make of Michael?" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese." And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate.
I said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."
(Laughter)
Tom rolled his eyes and he said, "Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"
(Laughter)
Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.
(Laughter)
But the extrovert says, "If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one." And we go past each other.
Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this.
Is that all we are?
Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person.
How about that idiosyncratic you?
As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism.
But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits?
That make us love you?
Not just because you're a certain type of person.
I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.
I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.
So what is it that makes us different?
It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects.
You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here.
It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong.
Or it could be your mom.
And you'd been acting out of character.
These are free traits.
You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child.
What are these free traits?
They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives.
And they are what matters.
Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, "What are your core projects in your life?" And we enact those free traits.
I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess.
I'm a professor.
And I adore my students, and I adore my field.
And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about.
And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study.
But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character.
Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.
I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own.
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts.
(Laughter)
I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation.
And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after.
(Laughter)
And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, "Hey, is that Dr. Little?"
(Laughter)
If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john.
(Laughter)
That's where I'm going now.
Don't follow me.
(Applause) Thank you.
When we're designing new products, services or businesses, the only time you'll know if they're any good, if the designs are good, is to see how they're used in the real world, in context.
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London. It's absolutely beautiful. There's a big open green space.
There's Georgian buildings around the side.
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle.
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge. Instead, they want to take the shortcut, and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.
Now, this shortcut is called a desire path, and it's often the path of least resistance.
I find them fascinating, because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.
Now at this point, I should apologize, because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.
But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services.
The first is in the capital city of Brazil -- Brasilia.
And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction. Now, Brasilia is fascinating. It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.
It was the golden age of flying, so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.
Slightly worryingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.
But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia, just where the point is there, you see it's littered with desire paths.
They're absolutely everywhere.
Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design.
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere -- we'd be able to drive -- so there was little need for walkways or pavements.
But as you can see, there's a real need.
These are very dangerous desire paths.
If we just pick one, in the middle, you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic.
It won't surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city. People are resourceful. They'll always find the low-friction route to save money, save time.
Not all these desire paths are dangerous, I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow.
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free.
It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left, and just cut through to the right, cut through the desire path.
The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here? Do they think we're stupid? Do they think we're lazy? Or do they accept that this is the only truth?
This is their product.
We're effectively co-designing their product.
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction, because if you don't, the customer will, anyway.
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California.
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it.
Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths.
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
So they're dashing to lectures.
They'll always find the shortcut.
And the designers here knew that.
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form.
They then paved them. (Laughter) Incredibly smart approach.
In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want.
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant. But where should it be? What should the menu be? He launched a service, in this case a food truck, and he changed the location each day.
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted.
He now has a chain of restaurants.
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths.
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH.
It reminds me that the world's in flux, and we have to respond to those changes.
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department.
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right.
This was a patient-centered organization, so they laid on cars for their patients.
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.
They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels.
This desire path that you see diagonally, formed.
The patients even called it "The Chemo Trail." Now, when the hospital saw this originally, they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it.
But after a while, they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients, so they paved it.
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths.
If we look back at the one in North London again, that desire path hasn't always been there.
The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days, from the Underground station you see on the bottom right.
So you see the desire path.
If we just wind the clock back a few years, when the stadium was being constructed, there is no desire path.
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging, and, where appropriate, pave them, as someone did here.
Someone installed a barrier, people started walking across and round the bottom as you see, and they paved it.
(Laughter)
But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well, that, actually, the world is in flux. It's constantly changing, because if you look at the top of this image, there's another desire path forming.
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs.
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success.
Design for real needs and design them in low friction, because if you don't offer them in low friction, someone else will, often the customer.
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service.
The answer is rarely inside the building.
Get out there and see what people really want.
And finally, in part because of technology, the world is incredibly flux at the moment. It's changing constantly. These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever.
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Every weekend for as long as I can remember, my father would get up on a Saturday, put on a worn sweatshirt and he'd scrape away at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in.
I wouldn't even call it restoration; it was a ritual, catharsis.
He would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun and a spackle knife, and then he would repaint where he scraped, only to begin again the following year.
Scraping and re-scraping, painting and repainting: the work of an old house is never meant to be done.
The day my father turned 52, I got a phone call.
My mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach -- terminal cancer, she told me, and he had been given only three weeks to live.
I immediately moved home to Poughkeepsie, New York, to sit with my father on death watch, not knowing what the next days would bring us.
To keep myself distracted, I rolled up my sleeves, and I went about finishing what he could now no longer complete -- the restoration of our old home.
When that looming three-week deadline came and then went, he was still alive.
And at three months, he joined me.
We gutted and repainted the interior.
At six months, the old windows were refinished, and at 18 months, the rotted porch was finally replaced.
And there was my father, standing with me outside, admiring a day's work, hair on his head, fully in remission, when he turned to me and he said, "You know, Michael, this house saved my life."
So the following year, I decided to go to architecture school.
(Laughter)
But there, I learned something different about buildings.
Recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms, like ribbons, or ... pickles?
(Laughter)
And I think this is supposed to be a snail.
Something about this bothered me. Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture -- all beautiful and visionary and innovative -- is also so rare, and seems to serve so very few?
And more to the point: With all of this creative talent, what more could we do?
Just as I was about to start my final exams, I decided to take a break from an all-nighter and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer, a leading health activist for the global poor.
I was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture.
Buildings are making people sicker, he said, and for the poorest in the world, this is causing epidemic-level problems.
In this hospital in South Africa, patients that came in with, say, a broken leg, to wait in this unventilated hallway, walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis.
Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about, and people had died because of it.
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.
If hospitals are making people sicker, where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal?
That following summer, I was in the back of a Land Rover with a few classmates, bumping over the mountainous hillside of Rwanda.
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro in this old guesthouse, which was a jail after the genocide.
I was there to design and build a new type of hospital with Dr. Farmer and his team.
If hallways are making patients sicker, what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside, and makes people walk in the exterior?
If mechanical systems rarely work, what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation, and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?
And what about the patients' experience?
Evidence shows that a simple view of nature can radically improve health outcomes, So why couldn't we design a hospital where every patient had a window with a view?
Simple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals.
Designing it is one thing; getting it built, we learned, is quite another.
We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school.
When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe," which means "community works for the community." Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer.
Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand.
And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women.
Bruce was using the process of building to heal, not just for those who were sick, but for the entire community as a whole.
We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or "lo-fab," and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve.
Think of it like the local food movement, but for architecture.
And we're convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world, and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture.
Using the lo-fab way of building, even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people's lives.
In Butaro, we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area, but often considered a nuisance by farmers, and piled on the side of the road.
We worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them into the walls of the hospital.
And when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital, they were so good at putting these stones together, they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it.
And you see what is possible. It's beautiful. And the beauty, to me, comes from the fact that I know that hands cut these stones, and they formed them into this thick wall, made only in this place with rocks from this soil.
When you go outside today and you look at your built world, ask not only: "What is the environmental footprint?" -- an important question -- but what if we also asked, "What is the human handprint of those who made it?"
We started a new practice based around these questions, and we tested it around the world.
Like in Haiti, where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera.
In this 100-bed hospital, we designed a simple strategy to clean contaminated medical waste before it enters the water table, and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO are already saving lives because of it.
Or Malawi: we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce maternal and infant mortality.
Malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death in the world.
Using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally, we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants to come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births.
Or in the Congo, where we asked if an educational center could also be used to protect endangered wildlife.
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat is leading to global epidemic, disease transfer and war.
In one of the hardest-to-reach places in the world, we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us to construct a center that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity.
Even here in the US, we were asked to rethink the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world.
The deaf community, through sign language, shows us the power of visual communication.
We designed a campus that would awaken the ways in which we as humans all communicate, both verbally and nonverbally.
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown, we thought about old industrial infrastructure.
We wondered: Could we use arts and culture and design to revitalize this city and other Rust Belt cities across our nation, and turn them into centers for innovation and growth?
In each of these projects, we asked a simple question: What more can architecture do?
And by asking that question, we were forced to consider how we could create jobs, how we could source regionally and how we could invest in the dignity of the communities in which we serve.
I have learned that architecture can be a transformative engine for change.
About a year ago, I read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader named Bryan Stevenson.
(Applause)
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.
He and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of African-Americans that have happened in the American South.
And they had a plan to mark every county where these lynchings occurred, and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in Montgomery, Alabama.
Countries like Germany and South Africa and, of course, Rwanda, have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past, in order to heal their national psyche.
We have yet to do this in the United States.
So I sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org: "Dear Bryan," it said, "I think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in America and could change the way we think about racial injustice.
By any chance, do you know who will design it?"
(Laughter)
Surprisingly, shockingly, Bryan got right back to me, and invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them.
Needless to say, I canceled all my meetings and I jumped on a plane to Montgomery, Alabama.
When I got there, Bryan and his team picked me up, and we walked around the city.
And they took the time to point out the many markers that have been placed all over the city to the history of the Confederacy, and the very few that mark the history of slavery.
And then he walked me to a hill.
It overlooked the whole city.
He pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic slave-trading port in America had once prospered.
And then to the Capitol rotunda, where George Wallace had stood on its steps and proclaimed, "Segregation forever." And then to the very hill below us.
He said, "Here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity of this city and of this nation."
Our two teams have worked together over the last year to design this memorial.
The memorial will take us on a journey through a classical, almost familiar building type, like the Parthenon or the colonnade at the Vatican.
But as we enter, the ground drops below us and our perception shifts, where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings, which happened in the public square.
And as we continue, we begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest.
Their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us.
And just outside will be a field of identical columns.
But these are temporary columns, waiting in purgatory, to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred.
Over the next few years, this site will bear witness, as each of these markers is claimed and visibly placed in those counties.
Our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence.
When we think about how it should be built, we were reminded of Ubudehe, the building process we learned about in Rwanda.
We wondered if we could fill those very columns with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred.
Brian and his team have begun collecting that soil and preserving it in individual jars with family members, community leaders and descendants.
The act of collecting soil itself has lead to a type of spiritual healing.
It's an act of restorative justice.
As one EJI team member noted in the collection of the soil from where Will McBride was lynched, "If Will McBride left one drop of sweat, one drop of blood, one hair follicle -- I pray that I dug it up, and that his whole body would be at peace."
We plan to break ground on this memorial later this year, and it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation.
(Applause)
When my father told me that day that this house -- our house -- had saved his life, what I didn't know was that he was referring to a much deeper relationship between architecture and ourselves.
Buildings are not simply expressive sculptures.
They make visible our personal and our collective aspirations as a society.
Great architecture can give us hope.
Great architecture can heal.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So, I lead a team at Google that works on machine intelligence; in other words, the engineering discipline of making computers and devices able to do some of the things that brains do.
And this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well, and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers.
Historically, one of those areas has been perception, the process by which things out there in the world -- sounds and images -- can turn into concepts in the mind.
This is essential for our own brains, and it's also pretty useful on a computer.
The machine perception algorithms, for example, that our team makes, are what enable your pictures on Google Photos to become searchable, based on what's in them.
The flip side of perception is creativity: turning a concept into something out there into the world.
So over the past year, our work on machine perception has also unexpectedly connected with the world of machine creativity and machine art.
I think Michelangelo had a penetrating insight into to this dual relationship between perception and creativity.
This is a famous quote of his: "Every block of stone has a statue inside of it, and the job of the sculptor is to discover it." So I think that what Michelangelo was getting at is that we create by perceiving, and that perception itself is an act of imagination and is the stuff of creativity.
The organ that does all the thinking and perceiving and imagining, of course, is the brain.
And I'd like to begin with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains.
Because unlike, say, the heart or the intestines, you really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it, at least with the naked eye.
The early anatomists who looked at brains gave the superficial structures of this thing all kinds of fanciful names, like hippocampus, meaning "little shrimp." But of course that sort of thing doesn't tell us very much about what's actually going on inside.
The first person who, I think, really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great Spanish neuroanatomist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, in the 19th century, who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain, in order to start to understand their morphologies.
in the 19th century, And these are the kinds of drawings that he made of neurons
This is from a bird brain.
And you see this incredible variety of different sorts of cells, even the cellular theory itself was quite new at this point.
And these structures, these cells that have these arborizations, these branches that can go very, very long distances -- this was very novel at the time.
They're reminiscent, of course, of wires.
That might have been obvious to some people in the 19th century; the revolutions of wiring and electricity were just getting underway.
But in many ways, these microanatomical drawings of Ramón y Cajal's, like this one, they're still in some ways unsurpassed.
We're still more than a century later, trying to finish the job that Ramón y Cajal started.
These are raw data from our collaborators at the Max Planck Institute of Neuroscience.
And what our collaborators have done is to image little pieces of brain tissue.
The entire sample here is about one cubic millimeter in size, and I'm showing you a very, very small piece of it here.
That bar on the left is about one micron.
The structures you see are mitochondria that are the size of bacteria.
And these are consecutive slices through this very, very tiny block of tissue.
Just for comparison's sake, the diameter of an average strand of hair is about 100 microns.
So we're looking at something much, much smaller than a single strand of hair.
And from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices, one can start to make reconstructions in 3D of neurons that look like these.
So these are sort of in the same style as Ramón y Cajal.
Only a few neurons lit up, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to see anything here. It would be so crowded, so full of structure, of wiring all connecting one neuron to another.
So Ramón y Cajal was a little bit ahead of his time, and progress on understanding the brain proceeded slowly over the next few decades.
But we knew that neurons used electricity, and by World War II, our technology was advanced enough to start doing real electrical experiments on live neurons to better understand how they worked.
This was the very same time when computers were being invented, very much based on the idea of modeling the brain -- of "intelligent machinery," as Alan Turing called it, one of the fathers of computer science.
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts looked at Ramón y Cajal's drawing of visual cortex, which I'm showing here.
This is the cortex that processes imagery that comes from the eye.
And for them, this looked like a circuit diagram.
So there are a lot of details in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram that are not quite right.
But this basic idea that visual cortex works like a series of computational elements that pass information one to the next in a cascade, is essentially correct.
Let's talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do.
The basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say, "That's a bird," which is a very simple thing for us to do with our brains.
But you should all understand that for a computer, this was pretty much impossible just a few years ago.
The classical computing paradigm is not one in which this task is easy to do.
So what's going on between the pixels, between the image of the bird and the word "bird," is essentially a set of neurons connected to each other in a neural network, as I'm diagramming here.
This neural network could be biological, inside our visual cortices, or, nowadays, we start to have the capability to model such neural networks on the computer.
And I'll show you what that actually looks like.
So the pixels you can think about as a first layer of neurons, and that's, in fact, how it works in the eye -- that's the neurons in the retina.
And those feed forward into one layer after another layer, after another layer of neurons, all connected by synapses of different weights.
The behavior of this network is characterized by the strengths of all of those synapses.
Those characterize the computational properties of this network.
And at the end of the day, you have a neuron or a small group of neurons that light up, saying, "bird."
Now I'm going to represent those three things -- the input pixels and the synapses in the neural network, and bird, the output -- by three variables: x, w and y. There are maybe a million or so x's -- a million pixels in that image.
There are billions or trillions of w's, which represent the weights of all these synapses in the neural network.
And there's a very small number of y's, of outputs that that network has. "Bird" is only four letters, right?
So let's pretend that this is just a simple formula, x "x" w = y. I'm putting the times in scare quotes because what's really going on there, of course, is a very complicated series of mathematical operations.
That's one equation. There are three variables.
And we all know that if you have one equation, you can solve one variable by knowing the other two things.
So the problem of inference, that is, figuring out that the picture of a bird is a bird, is this one: it's where y is the unknown and w and x are known.
You know the neural network, you know the pixels.
As you can see, that's actually a relatively straightforward problem.
You multiply two times three and you're done.
I'll show you an artificial neural network that we've built recently, doing exactly that.
This is running in real time on a mobile phone, and that's, of course, amazing in its own right, that mobile phones can do so many billions and trillions of operations per second.
What you're looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird, and actually not only saying, "Yes, it's a bird," but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort.
So in that picture, the x and the w are known, and the y is the unknown.
I'm glossing over the very difficult part, of course, which is how on earth do we figure out the w, the brain that can do such a thing?
How would we ever learn such a model?
So this process of learning, of solving for w, if we were doing this with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers, we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w, well, we divide by two and we're done.
The problem is with this operator.
So, division -- we've used division because it's the inverse to multiplication, but as I've just said, the multiplication is a bit of a lie here.
This is a very, very complicated, very non-linear operation; it has no inverse.
So we have to figure out a way to solve the equation without a division operator.
And the way to do that is fairly straightforward. You just say, let's play a little algebra trick, and move the six over to the right-hand side of the equation.
Now, we're still using multiplication.
And that zero -- let's think about it as an error.
In other words, if we've solved for w the right way, then the error will be zero.
And if we haven't gotten it quite right, the error will be greater than zero.
So now we can just take guesses to minimize the error, and that's the sort of thing computers are very good at.
So you've taken an initial guess: what if w = 0?
Well, then the error is 6.
What if w = 1?
The error is 4.
And then the computer can sort of play Marco Polo, and drive down the error close to zero.
As it does that, it's getting successive approximations to w. Typically, it never quite gets there, but after about a dozen steps, we're up to w = 2.999, which is close enough.
And this is the learning process.
So remember that what's been going on here is that we've been taking a lot of known x's and known y's and solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process.
It's exactly the same way that we do our own learning.
We have many, many images as babies and we get told, "This is a bird; this is not a bird." And over time, through iteration, we solve for w, we solve for those neural connections.
So now, we've held x and w fixed to solve for y; that's everyday, fast perception.
We figure out how we can solve for w, that's learning, which is a lot harder, because we need to do error minimization, using a lot of training examples.
And about a year ago, Alex Mordvintsev, on our team, decided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for x, given a known w and a known y.
In other words, you know that it's a bird, and you already have your neural network that you've trained on birds, but what is the picture of a bird?
It turns out that by using exactly the same error-minimization procedure, one can do that with the network trained to recognize birds, and the result turns out to be ... a picture of birds.
So this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds, just by solving for x rather than solving for y, and doing that iteratively.
Here's another fun example.
This was a work made by Mike Tyka in our group, which he calls "Animal Parade." It reminds me a little bit of William Kentridge's artworks, in which he makes sketches, rubs them out, makes sketches, rubs them out, and creates a movie this way.
In this case, what Mike is doing is varying y over the space of different animals, in a network designed to recognize and distinguish different animals from each other.
And you get this strange, Escher-like morph from one animal to another.
Here he and Alex together have tried reducing the y's to a space of only two dimensions, thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network.
Doing this kind of synthesis or generation of imagery over that entire surface, varying y over the surface, you make a kind of map -- a visual map of all the things the network knows how to recognize.
The animals are all here; "armadillo" is right in that spot.
You can do this with other kinds of networks as well.
This is a network designed to recognize faces, to distinguish one face from another.
And here, we're putting in a y that says, "me," my own face parameters.
And when this thing solves for x, it generates this rather crazy, kind of cubist, surreal, psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once.
The reason it looks like multiple points of view at once is because that network is designed to get rid of the ambiguity of a face being in one pose or another pose, being looked at with one kind of lighting, another kind of lighting.
So when you do this sort of reconstruction, if you don't use some sort of guide image or guide statistics, then you'll get a sort of confusion of different points of view, because it's ambiguous.
This is what happens if Alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to reconstruct my own face.
So you can see it's not perfect.
There's still quite a lot of work to do on how we optimize that optimization process.
But you start to get something more like a coherent face, rendered using my own face as a guide.
You don't have to start with a blank canvas or with white noise.
When you're solving for x, you can begin with an x, that is itself already some other image.
That's what this little demonstration is.
This is a network that is designed to categorize all sorts of different objects -- man-made structures, animals ... Here we're starting with just a picture of clouds, and as we optimize, basically, this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds.
And the more time you spend looking at this, the more things you also will see in the clouds.
You could also use the face network to hallucinate into this, and you get some pretty crazy stuff. (Laughter) Or, Mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image, hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates, zooms hallucinates, zooms.
And in this way, you can get a sort of fugue state of the network, I suppose, or a sort of free association, in which the network is eating its own tail. So every image is now the basis for, "What do I think I see next?
What do I think I see next? "I showed this for the first time in public to a group at a lecture in Seattle called" Higher Education "— this was right after marijuana was legalized. (Laughter) So I'd like to finish up quickly by just noting that this technology is not constrained.
I've shown you purely visual examples because they're really fun to look at.
It's not a purely visual technology.
Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin, has done experiments involving a camera that takes a picture, and then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks, based on the contents of the image.
And that poetry neural network has been trained on a large corpus of 20th-century poetry.
(Laughter) And the poetry is, you know, I think, kind of not bad, actually. In closing, I think that per Michelangelo, I think he was right; perception and creativity are very intimately connected.
What we've just seen are neural networks that are entirely trained to discriminate, or to recognize different things in the world, able to be run in reverse, to generate.
One of the things that suggests to me is not only that Michelangelo really did see the sculpture in the blocks of stone, but that any creature, any being, any alien that is able to do perceptual acts of that sort is also able to create because it's exactly the same machinery that's used in both cases.
Also, I think that perception and creativity are by no means uniquely human.
We start to have computer models that can do exactly these sorts of things.
And that ought to be unsurprising; the brain is computational.
And finally, computing began as an exercise in designing intelligent machinery.
It was very much modeled after the idea of how could we make machines intelligent.
And we finally are starting to fulfill now some of the promises of those early pioneers, of Turing and von Neumann and McCulloch and Pitts.
And I think that computing is not just about accounting or playing Candy Crush or something.
From the beginning, we modeled them after our minds.
And they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better and to extend them.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
Once there was a star.
Like everything else, she was born; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time.
Exactly how long, people cannot really tell.
Just like everything in life, she reached the end of her regular star days when her heart, the core of her life, exhausted its fuel.
But that was no end.
She transformed into a supernova, and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy, outshining the rest of the galaxy and emitting, in one second, the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days.
And she evolved into another role in our galaxy.
Supernova explosions are very extreme.
But the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme.
In the process of becoming a supernova, the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster, like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body.
In that way, it starts rotating very fast and it increases, powerfully, its magnetic field.
The matter around the star is dragged around, and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further.
In that way, our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission.
My star, the one in my story, became what is known as a magnetar.
And just for your information, the magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times the magnetic field of Earth.
The most energetic events ever measured by astronomers carry the name gamma-ray bursts because we observe them as bursts most or explosions, most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.
Our star, like the one in our story that became a magnetar, is detected as a gamma-ray burst during the most energetic portion of the explosion.
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events ever measured by astronomers, we cannot see them with our naked eye.
We depend, we rely on other methods in order to study this gamma-ray light.
We cannot see them with our naked eye.
We can only see an itty bitty, tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light.
And beyond that, we rely on other methods.
Yet as astronomers, we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that.
On the screen, it may look like this.
You're seeing a plot.
That is a light curve.
It's a plot of intensity of light over time.
It is a gamma-ray light curve.
Sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time.
On the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst, and on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst.
Early during my career, I could also see this kind of plot.
But then, I lost my sight.
I completely lost my sight because of extended illness, and with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics.
It was a very strong transition for me in many ways.
And professionally, it left me without a way to do my science.
I longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light and figure out the astrophysical cause.
I wanted to experience the spacious wonder, the excitement, the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event.
I thought long and hard about it, when I suddenly realized that all a light curve is, is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot.
So along with my collaborators, we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound.
I achieved access to the data, and today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer, using sound.
And what people have been able to do, mainly visually, for hundreds of years, now I do it using sound.
(Applause) Listening to this gamma-ray burst that you're seeing on the -- (Applause continues)
Listening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen brought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst.
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.
It's not music, it's sound.
(Digital beeping sounds)
This is scientific data converted into sound, and it's mapped in pitch.
The process is called sonification.
So listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst.
When I examine the very strong low-frequency regions, or bass line -- I'm zooming into the bass line now.
We noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses like the solar wind.
And I want you to hear what I heard.
You will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume.
And because you're sighted, I'm giving you a red line indicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.
The (Whistles) is frogs at home, don't pay attention to that.
I think you heard it, right?
So what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances, which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited, that depend on the volume.
You may remember that I said that the matter around the star is dragged around?
It transmits power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions.
You may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar.
If this is the case, then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma-ray burst.
What does that mean? That star formation may be a very important part of these supernova explosions.
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data.
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes, and my experiments demonstrated that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display, astronomers can find more information in this now more accessible data set.
This ability to transform data into sound gives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation.
And the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens is a spirit-lifter.
When I lost my sight, I noticed that I didn't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sighted astronomer had.
It was not until we innovated with the sonification process that I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field that I had worked so hard to be part of.
Yet, information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is important.
The situation is systemic and scientific fields are not keeping up.
The body is something changeable -- anyone may develop a disability at any point.
Let's think about, for example, scientists that are already at the top of their careers.
What happens to them if they develop a disability? Will they feel excommunicated as I did?
Information access empowers us to flourish.
It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives, based on interest and not based on potential barriers.
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits, that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life.
And I think that the use of sound in astronomy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.
While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field, South Africa said, "We want people with disabilities to contribute to the field." Right now, I'm working at the South African Astronomical Observatory, at the Office of Astronomy for Development.
There, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind.
These students will be learning radio astronomy, and they will be learning the sonification methods in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections.
What we learn with these students -- these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated -- what we learn with these students will directly impact the way things are being done at the professional level.
I humbly call this development.
And this is happening right now.
I think that science is for everyone.
It belongs to the people, and it has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explorers.
I think that if we limit people with disabilities from participating in science, we'll sever our links with history and with society.
I dream of a level scientific playing field, where people encourage respect and respect each other, where people exchange strategies and discover together.
If people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field, an explosion, a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place, I am sure.
(Digital beeping sounds)
That is the titanic burst.
Thank you. Thank you.
I could never have imagined that a 19-year-old suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson. But he did. He taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don't know.
On a Thursday morning in July 2005, the bomber and I, unknowingly, boarded the same train carriage at the same time, standing, apparently, just feet apart.
I didn't see him.
Actually, I didn't see anyone.
You know not to look at anyone on the Tube, but I guess he saw me.
I guess he looked at all of us, as his hand hovered over the detonation switch.
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?
Especially in those final seconds.
I know it wasn't personal.
He didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks.
I mean -- he didn't know me. No. Instead, he gave me an unwarranted and an unwanted label.
I had become the enemy.
To him, I was the "other," the "them," as opposed to "us." The label "enemy" allowed him to dehumanize us.
It allowed him to push that button.
And he wasn't selective.
Twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone, and I was almost one of them.
In the time it takes to draw a breath, we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible; what I imagine wading through tar might be like.
We didn't know we were the enemy.
We were just a bunch of commuters who, minutes earlier, had followed the Tube etiquette: no direct eye contact, no talking and absolutely no conversation.
But in the lifting of the darkness, we were reaching out. We were helping each other. We were calling out our names, a little bit like a roll call, waiting for responses.
"I'm Gill. I'm here. I'm alive. OK."
OK." "I'm Gill. Here. Alive.
I didn't know Alison.
But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
But it mattered to me that he survived.
All I shared with them was my first name.
They didn't know that I was a head of a department at the Design Council.
And here is my beloved briefcase, also rescued from that morning.
They didn't know that I published architecture and design journals, that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, that I wore black — still do — that I smoked cigarillos.
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks, of course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing, balancing on prosthetic legs, giving a talk.
I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London.
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.
I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs, and I just shut everything and everyone out, to focus, to listen to myself, to be guided by instinct alone.
I lowered my breathing rate.
I elevated my thighs.
I held myself upright and I fought the urge to close my eyes.
I held on for almost an hour, an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point.
Perhaps I should have done more.
Perhaps I could have lived more, seen more.
Maybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga.
But my priority and my focus was always my work.
I lived to work.
Who I was on my business card mattered to me.
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
By the time I felt that first touch from one of my rescuers, I was unable to speak, unable to say even a small word, like "Gill." I surrendered my body to them.
I had done all I possibly could, and now I was in their hands.
I understood just who and what humanity really is, when I first saw the ID tag that was given to me when I was admitted to hospital.
And it read: "One unknown estimated female." One unknown estimated female.
Those four words were my gift.
What they told me very clearly was that my life was saved, purely because I was a human being.
Difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life, to save as many unknowns as they could, and putting their own lives at risk.
To them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor, the color of my skin, whether I was male or female, my sexual orientation, who I voted for, whether I was educated, if I had a faith or no faith at all.
Nothing mattered other than I was a precious human life.
I see myself as a living fact.
I am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save, but it can transform lives.
Here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I taken just last year.
Ten years after the event, and here we are, arm in arm.
Throughout all the chaos, my hand was held tightly. My face was stroked gently.
What did I feel? I felt loved. What's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution, what's given me the courage to say: this ends with me is love. I was loved.
I believe the potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because I know what we're capable of.
I know the brilliance of humanity.
So this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider: Is what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?
Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species, as human beings?
And when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all who are only a label until we know them?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Ichthyology, the study of fishes.
It looks like a big, boring word, but it's actually quite exciting, because ichthyology is the only "ology" with "YOLO" in it.
(Laughter)
Now, to the cool kids in the audience, you already know, YOLO stands for "you only live once," and because I only have one life, I'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing: seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species.
And that's what I get to do.
Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.
And it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there. You just have to know where to look, and to maybe be a little thin.
(Laughter)
Now, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology.
They can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes, and they can tell me about the evolution of sight, by being blind.
Now, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours.
All vertebrates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark, cold, cave environment, over many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here.
Now, each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way, and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us, and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.
So this is a new species we described, from southern Indiana.
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, the Hoosier cavefish.
(Laughter)
Its closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky, in the Mammoth Cave system.
And they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them a few million years ago.
And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness.
There's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight.
We have it, and these species have it too, except one species has lost all function in that gene, and the other one maintains it.
So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision, and at the very roots of how we can see.
But the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time, maybe no more so than in this species here.
This is a new species we described from Madagascar that we named Typhleotris mararybe.
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy, for how sick we got trying to collect this species.
Now, believe it or not, swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life, but YOLO.
(Laughter)
Now, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us, and that's because this species in Madagascar, its closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away, cavefishes in Australia.
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish can swim across the Indian Ocean, so what we found when we compared the DNA of these species is that they've been separated for more than 100 million years, or about the time that the southern continents were last together.
So in fact, these species didn't move at all. It's the continents that moved them.
And so they give us, through their DNA, this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events.
Now, this species here is so new I'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet, but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico, and it's probably already extinct.
It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.
Unfortunately for cavefishes, their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water.
Now, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet.
It doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico, so maybe it's something in Cuba, or Florida, or India.
But whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology of the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness.
But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.
And I'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet and the biology of how we see.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle.
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.
Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant.
Your adrenaline is elevated, and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy.
So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout.
The scout's job is not to attack or defend.
The scout's job is to understand.
The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river.
But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible.
And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential.
But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset -- a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives.
What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset you're in.
To illustrate these mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France, where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history.
It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff.
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, but when they pieced it back together, they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany.
So they launched a big investigation, and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus.
He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell.
But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match, even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity, but never mind that.
They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, looking for any signs of espionage.
They went through his files, and they didn't find anything. This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it.
Next, they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details.
They talked to his teachers, they found that he had studied foreign languages in school, which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life.
His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory, which was highly suspicious, right?
You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things.
So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty.
Afterwards, they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two.
This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus.
And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island, which is this barren rock off the coast of South America.
So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence.
But for the most part, France considered the matter closed.
One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty.
I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him.
But historians don't think that's what happened.
As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong.
Which makes you wonder: What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man?
Well, this is a case of what scientists call "motivated reasoning." It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears, shape the way we interpret information.
Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies.
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.
And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down.
So this is why I call motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."
Probably most of you have never persecuted a French-Jewish officer for high treason, I assume, but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example, you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong.
But if he judges that the other team committed a foul -- awesome!
That's a good call, let's not examine it too closely.
Or, maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy, like capital punishment.
And, as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed.
But if it shows that capital punishment works, it's a good study.
And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing.
Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously, by which side we want to win.
And this is ubiquitous.
This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical.
What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset, is how unconscious it is.
We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man.
However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over.
This is Colonel Picquart.
He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army, and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.
Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic.
But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect: "What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?" What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued, even after Dreyfus was in prison.
And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo, much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.
So he brought these discoveries to his superiors, but to his dismay, they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings, like, "Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting, and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left.
But Dreyfus is still guilty." Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated.
But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army.
A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with.
But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable, because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers, but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that.
So to me, Picquart is a poster child for what I call "scout mindset." It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose, but just to see what's really there as honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant.
This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about. And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset.
And the answer is emotional. So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is, too.
It's just rooted in different emotions.
For example, scouts are curious.
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle.
They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations. Scouts also have different values.
They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak.
And above all, scouts are grounded, which means their self-worth as a person isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic.
So they can believe that capital punishment works.
If studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say, "Huh.
Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid. "
This cluster of traits is what researchers have found -- and I've also found anecdotally -- predicts good judgment.
And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know.
In fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all.
They're about how you feel.
There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
He's the author of "The Little Prince." He said, "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable.
But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something.
We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for?
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?
Thank you. (Applause)
At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour.
We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons.
We've gone to immigration detention centers.
We've met a lot of people.
And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time.
Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline.
What would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value -- with love and compassion as core values?
We would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in.
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months.
Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done.
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.
He committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again.
Now James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together.
I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word.
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.
TED, welcome to San Quentin.
The talent is abundant behind prison walls.
Future software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists.
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time.
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."
I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go.
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.
I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong. Imagine that.
Better yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong.
Maybe then we would all be singin' "Redemption Song."
I live in a world that has been called "hell on Earth" by those trapped inside.
But I've come to the stark realization that prison -- it really is what you make it.
You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining.
I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time.
And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom.
And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom.
Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons.
We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom!
Don't you get it? We're all serving time; we're just in different places.
As for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created.
The key: forgiveness.
Action's my witness.
If we want freedom, then we gotta think different.
Because freedom ... it isn't a place.
It's a mind setting.
Thank you.

I used to have this recurring dream where I'd walk into a roomful of people, and I'd try not to make eye contact with anyone.
Until someone notices me, and I just panic.
And the person walks up to me, and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.
And what is your name?" And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.
After some awkward silence, he goes, "Have you forgotten your name?" And I'm still quiet.
And then, slowly, all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me and ask, almost in unison,
(Voice-over, several voices) "Have you forgotten your name?" As the chant gets louder, I want to respond, but I don't.
I'm a visual artist. Some of my work is humorous, and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.
And one thing that I really enjoy doing is making these little animations where I get to do the voice-over for all kinds of characters.
I've been a bear.
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.
(Laughter)
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.
(Laughter)
SS: I've been a greeting card.
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.
SS: And my personal favorite is Frankenstein's monster.
(Video) Frankenstein's monster (SS's voice): (Grunts)
(Laughter)
SS: I just had to grunt a lot for that one.
A few years ago, I made this educational video about the history of video games.
And for that one, I got to do the voice of Space Invader.
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.
SS: A dream come true, really,
(Laughter) And when that video was posted online, I just sat there on the computer, hitting "refresh," excited to see the response.
The first comment comes in.
(Video) Comment: Great job. SS: Yes! I hit "refresh."
(Video) Comment: Excellent video.
I look forward to the next one.
SS: This was just the first of a two-part video.
I hit "refresh." I was going to work on the second one next.
(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO? WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P
(Laughter)
SS: People other than my mom were saying nice things about me, on the Internet!
I hit "refresh." It felt like I had finally arrived.
(Video) Comment: His voice is annoying. No offense.
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.
(Video) Comment: Could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth?
SS: OK, at least the feedback is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."
(Video) Comment: Please don't use this narrator again u can barely understand him.
SS: Refresh.
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow because of the Indian accent.
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent, I have a Pakistani accent, OK?
And number two, I clearly have a Pakistani accent.
(Laughter)
But comments like that kept coming in, so I figured I should just ignore them and start working on the second part of the video.
I recorded my audio, but every time I sat down to edit, I just could not do it.
Every single time, it would take me back to my childhood, when I had a much harder time speaking.
I've stuttered for as long as I can remember.
I was the kid in class who would never raise his hand when he had a question -- or knew the answer.
Every time the phone rang, I would run to the bathroom so I would not have to answer it.
If it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.
And I hated introducing myself, especially in groups.
"Have you forgotten your name?" I'd always stutter on my name, and there was usually someone who'd go, And then everybody would laugh.
That joke never got old.
(Laughter)
I spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke, it would become obvious that there was something wrong with me, that I was not normal.
So I mostly stayed quiet.
And so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work was a huge step for me.
Every time I record audio, I fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times, and then I go back in and pick the ones where I think I suck the least.
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
I can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.
And if I stutter along the way, and if I stutter along the way, I just go back in and fix it. It's magic.
SS: Using my highly edited voice in my work was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself.
But after the comments on the video, it no longer made me feel normal.
And so I stopped using my voice in my work.
Since then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.
And I've come to understand that "normal" has a lot to do with expectations.
Let me give you an example.
I came across this story about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.
Now, Homer mentions very few colors in his writing.
And even when he does, he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.
For example, the sea is described as wine red, people's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.
But it's not just Homer.
If you look at all of the ancient literature -- Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian and even the original Hebrew Bible -- they all mention very few colors.
And the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color.
So basically, if you can make a color, only then can you see it.
A color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make -- they began to see that color fairly early on.
But a color like blue, which was much harder to make -- many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color until much later.
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
So until then, even though a color might be all around them, they simply did not have the ability to see it. It was invisIble. It was not a part of their normal.
And that story has helped put my own experience into context.
So when I first read the comments on the video, my initial reaction was to take it all very personally.
But the people commenting did not know how self-conscious I am about my voice.
They were mostly reacting to my accent, that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent.
But what is normal, anyway?
We know that reviewers will find more spelling errors in your writing if they think you're black. We know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students. And we know that resumes with white-sounding names get more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names. Why is that? Because of our expectations of what is normal.
We think it is normal when a black student has spelling errors.
We think it is normal when a female or minority student does not succeed.
And we think it is normal that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee.
But studies also show that discrimination of this kind, in most cases, is simply favoritism, and it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to than the desire to harm people that you can't relate to.
And not relating to people starts at a very early age.
Let me give you an example.
One library that keeps track of characters in the children's book collection every year, found that in 2014, only about 11 percent of the books had a character of color.
And just the year before, that number was about eight percent, even though half of American children today come from a minority background. Half.
So there are two big issues here. Number one, children are told that they can be anything, they can do anything, and yet, most stories that children of color consume are about people who are not like them.
Number two is that majority groups don't get to realize the great extent to which they are similar to minorities -- our everyday experiences, our hopes, our dreams, our fears and our mutual love for hummus. It's delicious!
(Laughter)
Just like the color blue for Ancient Greeks, minorities are not a part of what we consider normal, because normal is simply a construction of what we've been exposed to, and how visible it is around us.
And this is where things get a bit difficult.
I can accept the preexisting notion of normal -- that normal is good, and anything outside of that very narrow definition of normal is bad.
Or I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal with my work and with my voice and with my accent and by standing here onstage, even though I'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly starting to use my voice in my work again.
And it feels good.
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown the next time a couple dozen people say that I talk (Mumbling) like I have peanut butter in my mouth.
(Laughter)
SS: It just means I now have a much better understanding of what's at stake, and how giving up is not an option.
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize that the sky was blue.
It took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring for so long.
And so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal, because doing so is going to allow us as a society to finally see the sky for what it is.
(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)
Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to Mars or some distant planet.
The travel time could take a year or even longer.
The space on board and the resources would be limited.
So you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with minimal inputs.
What if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds, and grow crops in a matter of hours?
And what if those crops would then make more seeds, enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip?
Well, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this.
What they came up with was actually quite interesting.
It involved microorganisms, which are single-celled organisms.
And they also used hydrogen from water.
The types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs, and with these hydrogenotrophs, you can create a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft.
Astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide, that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop.
The astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide, which would then be captured by the microbes, to create a nutritious crop, which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts.
So in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created.
So why is this important? We need carbon to survive as humans, and we get our carbon from food.
On a long space journey, you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way, so you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board.
This is a clever solution, right?
But the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere.
We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet.
And this was actually done in the '60s and '70s.
So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I, were interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth.
We wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change.
And we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the '60s -- 1967 and later -- articles about this work.
And we thought it was a really good idea.
So we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship.
We have limited space and limited resources, and on Earth, we really do need to figure out how to recycle our carbon better.
So we had the idea, can we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on Earth?
Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth?
We started a company to do it.
And in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs -- which I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers -- we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied, and that they could make some really valuable products.
So we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab.
We found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes.
And we even made a protein-rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins.
We began cultivating them even further, and we found that we can make oil.
Oils are used to manufacture many products.
We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil, which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances, but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel.
And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil.
Palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods.
We began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology, and we're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market.
We believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products -- something that's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business.
That's what we're doing today.
But tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something even greater if we take it to the next level.
We believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable, that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow.
And why might we need a sustainable agriculture?
Well, actually, it is estimated that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050, and we're projecting that we will need to increase food production by 70 percent.
In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods.
So how will we scale to meet that demand?
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand.
There are a number of reasons why.
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.
In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars, our trucks, our planes and our trains combined.
Another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land.
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock.
What does that look like?
Well, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined.
Let me give you a specific example.
In Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately Ireland, between 2000 and 2012.
Just think of all of the species, the diversity, that was removed in the process, whether plant life, insects or animal life.
And a natural carbon sink was also removed.
So let me make this real for you. This clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations.
And as I mentioned before, palm oil is used to manufacture many products.
In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products are manufactured using palm oil.
And that includes things like ice cream, cookies ... It includes cooking oils.
It also includes detergents, lotions, soaps.
You and I both probably have numerous items in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil.
So you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests.
Modern ag has some problems, and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably.
I believe that microbes can be a part of the answer -- specifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers.
These supercharged carbon recyclers, like plants, serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive.
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth, like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.
In those ecosystems, they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems. And they're rich in nutrients, such as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates.
And actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives.
If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night, after a long, hard work week, then you are enjoying a product of microbes.
If you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery -- a product of microbes.
Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.
These are all products of microbes.
But the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months.
That means we can make crops much faster than we're making them today.
They grow in the dark, so they can grow in any season and in any geography and any location.
They can grow in containers that require minimal space.
And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture.
Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land, we can scale vertically, and as a result produce much more product per area.
If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers, then we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume.
Because, at a large scale, you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area than you could -- for instance, if you used soybeans -- if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year.
Ten thousand times over a period of a year.
So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture.
And this is what I mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion.
And what would be the products of this new type of agriculture?
Well, we've already made a protein meal, so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal, or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.
We've already made oils, so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil.
So this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread, cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.
Furthermore, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods, industrial products and consumer products, you can imagine being able to make detergents, soaps, lotions, etc., using these types of crops.
Not only are we running out of space, but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture, we run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
We can imagine a future of abundance.
Let us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaceship, not only from not crashing, but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves and the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050.
Thank you very much.

Hi. My name is Marwa, and I'm an architect.
I was born and raised in Homs, a city in the central western part of Syria, and I've always lived here.
After six years of war, Homs is now a half-destroyed city.
My family and I were lucky; our place is still standing.
Although for two years, we were like prisoners at home.
Outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers.
My husband and I used to run an architecture studio in the old town main square.
It's gone, as is most of the old town itself.
Half of the city's other neighborhoods are now rubble.
Since the ceasefire in late 2015, large parts of Homs have been more or less quiet.
The economy is completely broken, and people are still fighting.
The merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets.
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter, sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house, workshops, among many more. I have started teaching part-time, and with my husband, who juggles several jobs, we've opened a small bookshop.
Other people do all sorts of jobs to get by.
When I look at my destroyed city, of course, I ask myself: What has led to this senseless war?
Syria was largely a place of tolerance, historically accustomed to variety, accommodating a wide range of beliefs, origins, customs, goods, food.
How did my country -- a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences -- how did it degenerate into civil war, violence, displacement and unprecedented sectarian hatred?
There were many reasons that had led to the war -- social, political and economic.
They all have played their role.
But I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked and which is important to analyze, because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again.
And that reason is architecture.
Architecture in my country has played an important role in creating, directing and amplifying conflict between warring factions, and this is probably true for other countries as well.
There is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place and the character of the community that has settled there.
Architecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together.
Syrian society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds.
Syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade and sustainable communities.
They have enjoyed the true meaning of belonging to a place, and that was reflected in their built environment, in the mosques and churches built back-to-back, in the interwoven souks and public venues, and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony.
This architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains.
The old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past, integrating with it and embracing its spirit.
So did its communities.
People lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home.
They shared a remarkably unified existence.
But over the last century, gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with; first, by the urban planners of the colonial period, when the French went enthusiastically about, transforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities.
They blew up city streets and relocated monuments.
They called them improvements, and they were the beginning of a long, slow unraveling.
The traditional urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by separation, but by intertwining.
But over time, the ancient became worthless, and the new, coveted.
The harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by elements of modernity — brutal, unfinished concrete blocks, neglect, aesthetic devastation, divisive urbanism that zoned communities by class, creed or affluence.
And the same was happening to the community.
As the shape of the built environment changed, so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing.
From a register of togetherness, of belonging, architecture became a way of differentiation, and communities started drifting apart from the very fabric that used to unite them, and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence.
While many reasons had led to the Syrian war, we shouldn't underestimate the way in which, by contributing to the loss of identity and self-respect, urban zoning and misguided, inhumane architecture have nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred.
Over time, the united city has morphed into a city center with ghettos along its circumference.
And in turn, the coherent communities became distinct social groups, alienated from each other and alienated from the place.
From my point of view, losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy.
The clear example can be seen in the informal housing system, which used to host, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.
Yes, prior to the war, almost half of the Syrian population lived in slums, peripheral areas without proper infrastructure, made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people, people who mostly belonged to the same group, whether based on religion, class, origin or all of the above.
This ghettoized urbanism proved to be a tangible precursor of war.
Conflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas -- where the "others" live.
The ties that used to bind the city together -- whether they were social, through coherent building, or economic, through trade in the souk, or religious, through the coexistent presence -- were all lost in the misguided and visionless modernization of the built environment.
Allow me an aside. When I read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world, involving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities or around Paris or Brussels, I recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in Syria.
We have severely destroyed cities, such as Homs, Aleppo, Daraa and many others, and almost half of the population of the country is now displaced.
Hopefully, the war will end, and the question that, as an architect, I have to ask, is: How do we rebuild?
What are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes?
From my point of view, the main focus should be on creating places that make their people feel they belong.
Architecture and planning need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that, creating the conditions for coexistence and peace, values of beauty that don't exhibit ostentation, but rather, approachability and ease, moral values that promote generosity and acceptance, architecture that is for everyone to enjoy, not just for the elite, just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old Islamic city, mixed designs that encourage a sense of community.
There is a neighborhood here in Homs that's called Baba Amr that has been fully destroyed.
Almost two years ago, I introduced this design into a UN-Habitat competition for rebuilding it.
The idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree, capable of growing and spreading organically, echoing the traditional bridge hanging over the old alleys, and incorporating apartments, private courtyards, shops, workshops, places for parking and playing and leisure, trees and shaded areas.
It's far from perfect, obviously.
I drew it during the few hours of electricity we get.
And there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture.
But compare it with the freestanding, disconnected blocks proposed by the official project for rebuilding Baba Amr.
Architecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates, but it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity.
In that sense, settlement, identity and social integration are all the producer and product of effective urbanism.
The coherent urbanism of the old Islamic city and of many old European towns, for instance, promote integration, while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks, even when they are luxurious, tend to promote isolation and "otherness." Even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place, and whether they consider it a generous place that gives, a place that's worth keeping, contributing to, or whether they see it as an alienating place, full of seeds of anger.
In order for a place to give, its architecture should be giving, too.
Our built environment matters. The fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls.
And whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns or forests of skyscrapers, the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the Middle East have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities.
We can learn from this.
We can learn how to rebuild in another way, how to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only to the practical and economic aspects of people's lives, but also to their social, spiritual and psychological needs.
Those needs were totally overlooked in the Syrian cities before the war.
We need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them.
If we do so, people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around, because they will all feel at home.
Thank you for listening.
Tonight, I'm going to share with you my passion for science.
I'm not talking about science that takes baby steps.
I'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps.
I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein, I'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head.
In a moment, I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this.
I say "might" because, with revolutionary ideas, most are flat wrong, and even those that are right seldom have the impact that we want them to have.
To explain why I picked two ideas in particular, I'm going to start with a mystery.
1847, Vienna, Austria.
Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber, compulsively thorough doctor who ran two maternity clinics.
They were identical except for one thing.
Women were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth three times more often at one of the clinics than at the other.
Trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this, Semmelweis looked at everything he could. Sanitation? No. Medical procedures? No. Air flow? No.
The puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor who died of an infected scalpel cut.
The doctor's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying. How was that possible? How could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers?
Semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick, and he discovered that he'd been autopsying a corpse.
Had something gotten in his wound that killed him?
With growing excitement, Semmelweis looked for any connection he could between dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room, and he found it.
It turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate, but not the others, doctors delivered babies immediately after autopsying corpses in the morgue. Aha! Corpses were contaminating the doctors' hands and killing his mothers.
So he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands, and the deaths stopped.
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis had discovered infectious disease.
But the doctors of the day thought he was crazy, because they knew, and had for hundreds of years, that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease, not these hypothetical particles that you couldn't see.
It took 20 years for Frenchman Louis Pasteur to prove that Semmelweis was right.
Pasteur was an agricultural chemist who tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often.
He found that bacteria were the culprits.
He also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way that Semmelweis's patients were dying.
We now look at what I want to talk about tonight, in two ideas.
We saw it with Semmelweis, that he was a revolutionary.
He did it for two reasons.
One, he opened our eyes to a completely new world.
We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.
We just didn't know that bacteria killed people.
And he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart.
Miasmas didn't kill people. Bacteria killed people.
So this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about tonight.
One has opened our eyes to a completely new universe, and the other attacks long-held beliefs.
Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world by violating the laws of physics.
Betzig is a true rebel.
He quit a job at prestigious Bell Laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions and doing lousy work with them.
So he became a househusband, but he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen.
This is crucial if we're ever going to understand how cells work, and how cancer works, and how something 150th the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things, like make proteins and move charges around and all of those things.
There's just one problem.
There's this thing called the law of physics, and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit.
The diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor's office, you can only see so far down, no matter how good glasses you have.
This was a so-called impossible problem.
But one of Betzig's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresce. "Aha!" Betzig said. "I think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all."
So he lashed together a microscope in his friend's living room.
He had no laboratory.
This revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors, and with a computer, he was able to turn very, very fuzzy blurs into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity.
For this work, last year, Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize. Why? Because now we can see with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before, and now doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer.
But do you think Betzig was satisfied there? No. He wanted movies. The problem was that even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow.
So what did he do? He came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns.
So the way that works is if you take two very, very fine patterns and you move them across each other, you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see that otherwise you would not be able to see.
So he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell and moving lots of structured light patterns across it until this cell became crystal clear.
And here is the result: a mysterious new world, full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don't know what they're doing.
But when we figure it out, we'll have a better handle on life itself.
For example, those green globs that you see?
Those things are called clathrins.
They're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell.
Unfortunately, viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells.
Also, you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around?
Those are actin molecules.
Unfortunately, viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick.
Now that we can look at movies of what's actually going on deep inside a cell, we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases like AIDS.
So when you look at a movie like this, it's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes to a completely new world.
But he hasn't shattered any cherished beliefs.
That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey at Cambridge.
De Grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea: we can be immortal. We can beat aging.
Now, most scientists think he's a crackpot.
Any Biology 101 student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living.
For example, when we eat, we take in food and we metabolize it, and that throws off what we call free radicals.
You might have heard of those.
Also known as oxygen ions, those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate, and cause us to get old and lose our hair.
(Laughter)
It's just like, no, it's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust.
So you age because you rust out.
(Laughter)
Oh, and scientists also know there is something called immortality: in cancer cells.
So if you stop aging, all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors.
These are cherished beliefs, but could de Grey be on to something?
I think he deserves a closer look.
First of all, I have a really hard time seeing him as a crackpot.
Yeah, he started off life as a computer scientist, not a biologist, but he earned a PhD in biology from Cambridge, and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial DNA and a bunch of other stuff.
Secondly, he started an antiaging foundation that has identified seven different causes of aging, to me, that seem very plausible, and he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them.
For example, one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates, and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy.
He believes, and he's made a convincing case, that using viruses we can do gene therapy, fix that DNA and rejuvenate our cells.
One more thing. We have an existent proof that extreme longevity is possible.
Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years, and some lobsters don't age at all.
Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans.
I mean, after all, we're not trees, and most of us are not lobsters.
(Laughter)
But I've got to believe that there are Darwins and Einsteins out there, and I'll tell you why.
Consider this: there are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin's time.
There are four times as many people alive today as Einstein.
When you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed, there are now seven million scientists.
I've got to believe, and I do believe, that there's one of them out there who is working right now in obscurity to rock our lives, and I don't know about you, but I can't wait to be rocked.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am British.
(Laughter)
Never before has the phrase "I am British" elicited so much pity.
(Laughter)
I come from an island where many of us like to believe there's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years.
We tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves.
So it came as an immense shock to me when I woke up on the morning of June 24 to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union, my Prime Minister had resigned, and Scotland was considering a referendum that could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom.
So that was an immense shock for me, and it was an immense shock for many people, but it was also something that, over the following several days, created a complete political meltdown in my country.
There were calls for a second referendum, almost as if, following a sports match, we could ask the opposition for a replay.
Everybody was blaming everybody else.
People blamed the Prime Minister for calling the referendum in the first place.
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough.
The young accused the old.
The educated blamed the less well-educated.
That complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it: levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime.
People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England, or, as one of my colleagues put it, whether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the Atlantic Ocean.
(Laughter)
But my question is really, should we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since?
Was it something that took place overnight?
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions.
First, what does Brexit represent, not just for my country, but for all of us around the world?
And second, what can we do about it? How should we all respond?
So first, what does Brexit represent?
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world.
It highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are.
The vote split along lines of age, education, class and geography.
Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers, but those that did wanted to remain.
Older people really wanted to leave the European Union.
Geographically, it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the European Union, while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence.
Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously.
But more profoundly, the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today.
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left.
It's no longer just about tax and spend.
It's about globalization.
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globalization.
(Applause)
If we look at why those who wanted to leave -- we call them "Leavers," as opposed to "Remainers" -- we see two factors in the opinion polls that really mattered.
The first was immigration, and the second sovereignty, and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians.
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation.
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject.
What I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that, that liberal internationalists, like myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture, need to write ourselves back into the picture in order to understand how we've got to where we are today.
When we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom, we can visibly see the divisions.
The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave.
When I looked at this, what personally struck me was the very little time in my life I've actually spent in many of the red areas.
I suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the UK that have the strongest Leave vote, I've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas.
In some of those places, I didn't even know the names of the voting districts.
It was a real shock to me, and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant, perhaps don't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe.
(Applause)
And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people, to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university, who haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet, that don't get opportunities to travel, they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles.
(Applause)
It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand.
In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred, creating lies and mistrust around, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe, when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the European Union.
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment.
This was a protest vote for many, a sense that nobody represented them, that they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them, and so they rejected that political establishment.
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world.
We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States, with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France.
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies.
So the question I think we need to ask is my second question, which is how should we collectively respond?
For all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies, we urgently need a new vision, a vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization, one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind.
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization.
The consensus amongst economists is that free trade, the movement of capital, the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate.
The consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence, which brings cooperation and peace.
But globalization also has redistributive effects.
It creates winners and losers.
To take the example of migration, we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances.
But we also have to be very aware that there are redistributive consequences, that importantly, low-skilled immigration can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure on house prices.
That doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive, but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them.
In 2002, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, gave a speech at Yale University, and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization.
That was the speech in which he coined that term.
And he said, and I paraphrase, "The glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain secure.
Bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization."
That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008 in a conference on progressive governance involving many of the leaders of European countries.
But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008, the concept disappeared almost without a trace.
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda.
It's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all.
And it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis than it is today.
So the question is, how can we achieve that goal?
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?
That is the question for all of us.
And I think, as a social scientist, that social science offers some places to start.
Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change, and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point.
The first relates to the idea of civic education.
What stands out from Brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality.
It's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society, where evidence and truth no longer matter, and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence. So how can we --
(Applause)
How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies?
It has to begin with education, but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps.
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI published a survey on attitudes to immigration, and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase, so public concern with immigration also increases, although it obviously didn't unpack causality, because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it.
But the same survey also revealed huge public misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration.
For example, in these attitudes in the United Kingdom, the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were, but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are.
So we have to address this misinformation, the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization.
And that can't just be something that's left to our schools, although that's important to begin at an early age.
It has to be about lifelong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies.
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities.
(Applause)
One of the things that stands out for me very strikingly, looking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom, is that ironically, the regions of my country that are the most tolerant of immigrants have the highest numbers of immigrants.
So for instance, London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants, and they are also by far the most tolerant areas.
It's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants.
So we need to encourage exchange programs.
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel get access to the Internet.
We need to encourage, even on a local and national level, more movement, more participation, more interaction with people who we don't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with.
The third thing that I think is crucial, though, and this is really fundamental, is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globalization.
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking.
It shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the European Union.
But the problem is that those people in those areas didn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries.
They didn't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world.
I work on questions predominantly to do with refugees, and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching, mainly to developing countries around the world, is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees, we can't just benefit the refugee populations, we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas.
But in looking at that, one of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide disproportionately better education facilities, health facilities, access to social services in those regions of high immigration to address the concerns of those local populations.
But while we encourage that around the developing world, we don't take those lessons home and incorporate them in our own societies.
Furthermore, if we're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits, our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them.
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics.
There's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization.
But from the surveys that do exist, what we can see is there's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and tolerance of questions like migration and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other.
But one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization.
It's the societies like Sweden in the past, like Canada today, where there is a centrist politics, where right and left work together, that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization.
And what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization, a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics, and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding.
We might not achieve that today, but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another.
(Applause)
These ideas are very tentative, and that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project.
I am still British. I am still European.
I am still a global citizen.
For those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive, we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn't leave people behind.
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Two hundred years of modern science.
We have to admit that our performance is not great.
The machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures.
The houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes.
But we shouldn't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason: they didn't have much time.
Two hundred years is not a lot of time, while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials, that we wish we had in our possession.
Remember, these materials carry a quality assurance of three billion years.
Take, for example, sequoia trees.
They carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years in cold weather, in warm climates, UV light.
Yet, if you look at the structure by high-resolution electron microscopy, and you ask yourself, what is it made of, surprisingly, it's made of sugar.
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.
It's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose.
And this nanocrystalline cellulose is so strong, on a weight basis, it's about 10 times stronger than steel.
Yet it's made of sugar.
So scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry.
But here's the problem: say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane.
Well, you can Google, you can eBay, you can even Alibaba.
You won't find it. Of course, you're going to find thousands of scientific papers -- great papers, where scientists are going to say this is a great material, there are lots of things we can do with it. But no commercial source.
So we at the Hebrew University, together with our partners in Sweden, decided to focus on the development of an industrial-scale process to produce this nanocellulose.
And, of course, we didn't want to cut trees.
So we were looking for another source of raw material, and we found one -- in fact, the sludge of the paper industry.
The reason: there is a lot of it.
Europe alone produces 11 million tons of that material annually.
It's the equivalent of a mountain three kilometers high, sitting on a soccer field.
And we produce this mountain every year.
So for everybody, it's an environmental problem, and for us, it's a gold mine.
So now, we are actually producing, on an industrial scale in Israel, nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.
We can do a lot of things with the material.
For example, we have shown that by adding only a small percent of nanocellulose into cotton fibers, the same as my shirt is made of, it increases its strength dramatically.
So this can be used for making amazing things, like super-fabrics for industrial and medical applications.
But this is not the only thing.
For example, self-standing, self-supporting structures, like the shelters that you can see now, actually are now showcasing in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders in the plant kingdom. Think about insects. Cat fleas, for example, have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height. That's amazing. It's the equivalent of a person standing in the middle of Liberty Island in New York, and in a single jump, going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.
So the question is: How do cat fleas do it?
It turns out, they make this wonderful material, which is called resilin.
In simple words, resilin, which is a protein, is the most elastic rubber on Earth.
You can stretch it, you can squish it, and it doesn't lose almost any energy to the environment.
When you release it -- snap!
It brings back all the energy.
So I'm sure everybody would like to have that material.
But here's the problem: to catch cat fleas is difficult.
(Laughter)
Why? Because they are jumpy.
(Laughter)
But now, it's actually enough to catch one.
Now we can extract its DNA and read how cat fleas make the resilin, and clone it into a less-jumpy organism like a plant.
So that's exactly what we did.
Now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin.
Well, my team decided to do something really cool at the university.
They decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom -- nanocellulose with resilin.
And the result is amazing.
This material, in fact, is tough, elastic and transparent. So there are lots of things that can be done with this material. For example, next-generation sport shoes, so we can jump higher, run faster. And even touch screens for computers and smartphones, that won't break.
Well, the problem is, we continue to implant synthetic implants in our body, which we glue and screw into our body.
And I'm going to say that this is not a good idea. Why? Because they fail. This synthetic material fails, just like this plastic fork, that is not strong enough for its performance.
But sometimes they are too strong, and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues.
But in fact, the reason is much more fundamental.
The reason is that in nature, there is no one there that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck, or takes my skin and glues it onto my body.
In nature, everything is self-assembled.
So every living cell, whether coming from a plant, insect or human being, has a DNA that encodes for nanobio building blocks.
Many times they are proteins.
Other times, they are enzymes that make other materials, like polysaccharides, fatty acids.
And the common feature about all these materials is that they need no one.
They recognize each other and self-assemble into structures -- scaffolds on which cells are proliferating to give tissues.
They develop into organs, and together bring life.
So we at the Hebrew University, about 10 years ago, decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial for humans, which is collagen. Why collagen? Because collagen accounts for about 25 percent of our dry weight.
We have nothing more than collagen, other than water, in our body.
So I always like to say, anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings would like to have collagen.
Admittedly, before we started our project, there were already more than 1,000 medical implants made of collagen.
You know, simple things like dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles, augment lips, and other, more sophisticated medical implants, like heart valves.
So where is the problem?
Well, the problem is the source.
The source of all that collagen is actually coming from dead bodies: dead pigs, dead cows and even human cadavers.
So safety is a big issue. But it's not the only one.
Also, the quality.
Now here, I have a personal interest.
This is my father, Zvi, in our winery in Israel.
A heart valve, very similar to the one that I showed you before, seven years ago, was implanted in his body.
Now, the scientific literature says that these heart valves start to fail 10 years after the operation.
No wonder: they are made from old, used tissues, just like this wall made of bricks that is falling apart.
Yeah, of course, I can take those bricks and build a new wall. But it's not going to be the same.
So the US Food and Drug Administration made a notice already in 2007, asking the companies to start to look for better alternatives.
So that's exactly what we did.
We decided to clone all the five human genes responsible for making type I collagen in humans into a transgenic tobacco plant.
So now, the plant has the ability to make human collagen brand new, untouched. This is amazing. Actually, it's happening now.
Today in Israel, we grow it in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses all over the country.
The farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco. It looks exactly like regular tobacco, except that they have five human genes. They're responsible for making type I collagen.
We grow them for about 50 to 70 days, we harvest the leaves, and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory.
There, the process of extracting the collagen starts.
Now, if you ever made a pesto -- essentially, the same thing.
(Laughter)
You crush the leaves, you get the juice that contains the collagen.
We concentrate the protein, transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification, and the end result is a collagen identical to what we have in our body -- untouched, brand new and from which we make different medical implants: bone void fillers, for example, for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.
And more recently, even, we've been able to launch into the market here in Europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers, that is now approved for use in the clinic.
This is not science fiction.
This is happening now.
We are using plants to make medical implants for replacement parts for human beings.
That's amazing. In fact, more recently, we've been able to make collagen fibers which are six times stronger than the Achilles tendon.
Together with our partners from Ireland, we thought about the next thing: adding resilin to those fibers.
By doing that, we've been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher, and 300 percent more elastic.
So oddly enough, in the future, when a patient is transplanted with artificial tendons or ligaments made from these fibers, we'll have better performance after the surgery than we had before the injury.
So what's for the future?
In the future, we believe we'll be able to make many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us -- collagen, nanocellulose, resilin and many more.
And that will enable us to make better machines perform better, even the heart.
Now, this heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor.
It will be better.
It actually will perform better and will last longer.
My friend Zion Suliman once told me a smart sentence.
He said, "If you want a new idea, you should open an old book." And I'm going to say that the book was written.
It was written over three billion years of evolution. And the text is the DNA of life.
All we have to do is read this text, embrace nature's gift to us and start our progress from here.
Thank you.
I'm really glad to be here. I'm glad you're here, because that would be a little weird.
I'm glad we're all here.
And by "here," I don't mean here. Or here. But here. I mean Earth. And by "we," I don't mean those of us in this auditorium, but life, all life on Earth --
(Laughter)
from complex to single-celled, from mold to mushrooms to flying bears.
(Laughter)
The interesting thing is, Earth is the only place we know of that has life -- 8.7 million species.
We've looked other places, maybe not as hard as we should or we could, but we've looked and haven't found any; Earth is the only place we know of with life. Is Earth special? This is a question I've wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child, and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer.
To understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life, the first step is to understand what life here requires.
It turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species, life only needs three things. On one side, all life on Earth needs energy.
Complex life like us derives our energy from the sun, but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions.
There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets.
On the other side, all life needs food or nourishment.
And this seems like a tall order, especially if you want a succulent tomato.
(Laughter)
However, all life on Earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements, and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system.
So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole, the thing that's hardest to achieve.
Not moose, but water.
(Laughter)
Although moose would be pretty cool.
(Laughter)
And not frozen water, and not water in a gaseous state, but liquid water.
This is what life needs to survive, all life.
And many solar system bodies don't have liquid water, and so we don't look there.
Other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water, even more than Earth, but it's trapped beneath an icy shell, and so it's hard to access, it's hard to get to, it's hard to even find out if there's any life there.
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about. So let's make the problem simpler for ourselves. Let's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet.
There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system, with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet, and in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid.
You have to be very careful with that atmosphere. You can't have too much atmosphere, too thick or too warm an atmosphere, because then you end up too hot like Venus, and you can't have liquid water.
But if you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold, you end up like Mars, too cold.
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, and Earth is just right.
You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system.
It's a Goldilocks-type problem, and it's so simple that a child could understand it.
However, I'd like to remind you of two things from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really relevant here.
Number one: if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room, does that mean it's always been too cold?
Or could it have been just right at some other time?
When Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer that we get in the story.
And the same is true with planets. They're not static things. They change. They vary. They evolve. And atmospheres do the same.
So let me give you an example.
Here's one of my favorite pictures of Mars.
It's not the highest resolution image, it's not the sexiest image, it's not the most recent image, but it's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet; riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water; riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form.
This can't happen on Mars today.
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid.
This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed, and it changed in big ways.
And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable, because the three requirements for life were present long ago.
Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface?
Well, one idea is it escaped away to space.
Atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the planet, escaping away to space, never to return.
And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres.
Comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape.
But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time, and Mars and Earth as well.
It's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale.
So we'd like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition.
How do atmospheres get their energy for escape?
How do particles get enough energy to escape?
There are two ways, if we're going to reduce things a little bit.
Number one, sunlight.
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles.
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --
(Laughter)
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.
(Laughter)
They get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming.
A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind.
These are particles, mass, material, spit out from the surface of the sun, and they go screaming through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second, sometimes faster during solar storms, and they go hurtling through interplanetary space towards planets and their atmospheres, and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as well.
This is something that I'm interested in, because it relates to habitability.
I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about, and the second one is a little bit more subtle.
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot, and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold, shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder if we're following the trend?
This thing that you've accepted your entire life, when you think about it a little bit more, may not be so simple.
And of course, distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature.
This has to play into habitability.
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about.
Maybe it's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story, what is just right.
I could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets that may influence habitability, but for selfish reasons related to my own research and the fact that I'm standing up here holding the clicker and you're not --
(Laughter)
I would like to talk for just a minute or two about magnetic fields.
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.
Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
If you have a compass, you know which way north is.
Venus and Mars don't have that.
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars, congratulations, you're lost.
(Laughter)
Does this influence habitability? Well, how might it?
Many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet serves as a shield for the atmosphere, deflecting solar wind particles around the planet in a bit of a force field-type effect having to do with electric charge of those particles.
I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.
(Laughter)
And yes, my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus.
(Laughter)
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth may have been protected for billions of years, because we've had a magnetic field.
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.
Mars, on the other hand, has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field, and over billions of years, maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today.
Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship, enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself.
The sails may gather energy from the solar wind.
The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen.
It's an idea that has to be tested, but the effect and how it works seems apparent.
That's because we know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on Earth.
That energy is conducted along magnetic field lines down into the polar regions, resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.
If you've ever experienced them, it's magnificent.
We know the energy is getting in. We're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way.
So I've posed a problem for you here, but I don't have a solution yet.
We don't have a solution.
But we're working on it. How are we working on it? Well, we've sent spacecraft to all three planets.
Some of them are orbiting now, including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars, which I'm involved with and which is led here, out of the University of Colorado.
It's designed to measure atmospheric escape.
We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth.
Once we have all our measurements, we can combine all these together, and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment, with the surroundings.
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability or not.
Once we have that answer, why should you care?
I mean, I care deeply ... And financially as well, but deeply.
(Laughter)
First of all, an answer to this question will teach us more about these three planets, Venus, Earth and Mars, not only about how they interact with their environment today, but how they were billions of years ago, whether they were habitable long ago or not.
It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close.
But moreover, what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere, including planets that we're now observing around other stars.
For example, the Kepler spacecraft, which is built and controlled here in Boulder, has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky for a couple years now, and it's found thousands of planets -- in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky that we don't think is any different from any other part of the sky.
We've gone, in 20 years, from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system, to now having so many, that we don't know which ones to investigate first.
Any lever will help.
In fact, based on observations that Kepler's taken and other similar observations, we now believe that, of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone, on average, every star has at least one planet.
In addition to that, estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy.
We have the observations of those planets, but we just don't know which ones are habitable yet.
It's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot --
(Laughter)
on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them, wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you.
You can't do that. You can't go there, not yet.
And so you have to use the tools that you've developed around you for Venus, Earth and Mars, and you have to apply them to these other situations, and hope that you're making reasonable inferences from the data, and that you're going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets, and those that are not.
In the end, and for now, at least, this is our red spot, right here.
This is the only planet that we know of that's habitable, although very soon we may come to know of more.
But for now, this is the only habitable planet, and this is our red spot.
I'm really glad we're here.
Thanks.
(Applause)
This is a man-made forest.
It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space -- as small as your house garden.
Age of this forest is just two years old.
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house.
It attracts a lot of biodiversity.
(Bird call) I wake up to this every morning, like a Disney princess.
(Laughter) I am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of these forests professionally.
We have helped factories, farms, schools, homes, resorts, apartment buildings, public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests.
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
It doesn't matter how big or small they are.
Most of the world we live in today was forest.
This was before human intervention.
Then we built up our cities on those forests, like São Paulo, forgetting that we belong to nature as well, as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.
Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat.
But not anymore for some of us.
A few others and I today make these forests professionally -- anywhere and everywhere.
I'm an industrial engineer.
I specialize in making cars.
In my previous job at Toyota, I learned how to convert natural resources into products.
To give you an example, we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree, convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it -- the product.
But these products can never become a natural resource again.
We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state.
That's industrial production.
Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
The natural system produces by bringing elements together, atom by atom.
All the natural products become a natural resource again.
This is something which I learned when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.
And this was the first time I worked with nature, rather than against it.
Since then, we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
Every time we work at a new place, we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us.
All we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over.
To make a forest we start with soil.
We touch, feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks.
If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact -- so compact, that water cannot seep in.
We mix some local biomass available around, which can help soil become more porous.
Water can now seep in.
If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water, we will mix some more biomass -- some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse, so soil can hold this water and it stays moist.
To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.
What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
That would be the industrial way.
It goes against nature.
We instead add microorganisms to the soil.
They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.
They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil, so all they have to do is eat and multiply.
And as their number grows, the soil starts breathing again. It becomes alive. We survey the native tree species of the place.
How do we decide what's native or not?
Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native.
That's the simple rule.
We survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest.
We survey the sacred groves, or sacred forests around old temples.
And if we don't find anything at all, we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
We research old paintings, poems and literature from the place, to identify the tree species belonging there.
Once we know our trees, we divide them in four different layers: shrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.
We fix the ratios of each layer, and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.
If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
It could be a flowering forest, a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees, or it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest.
We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.
We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other, or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.
We plant the saplings close to each other.
On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch, so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.
When it's cold, frost formation happens only on the mulch, so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.
The soil is very soft -- so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily, rapidly.
Initially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing, but it's growing under the surface.
In the first three months, roots reach a depth of one meter.
These roots form a mesh, tightly holding the soil.
Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.
So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree, these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
Whenever it rains, magically, mushrooms appear overnight.
And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network.
Once these roots are established, forest starts growing on the surface.
As the forest grows we keep watering it — for the next two to three years, we water the forest.
We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees, so we remove the weeds growing on the ground.
As this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.
At this stage, every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.
This dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture.
We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.
And even without watering, the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.
Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor, it immediately starts decaying.
This decayed biomass forms humus, which is food for the forest.
As the forest grows, more leaves fall on the surface -- it means more humus is produced, it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
And this forest keeps growing exponentially.
Once established, these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again -- probably forever.
In a natural forest like this, no management is the best management.
It's a tiny jungle party.
(Laughter)
This forest grows as a collective. If the same trees -- same species -- would have been planted independently, it wouldn't grow so fast.
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
"Mom, who are these people?" It was an innocent question from my young daughter Alia around the time when she was three.
We were walking along with my husband in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.
Alia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall.
It featured the three rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
As she tucked in my side, I bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the UAE who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity.
She asked, "Mom, why is it that here where we live, and back in Lebanon, where grandma and grandpa live, we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls?
Is it because women are not important?"
This is probably the hardest question I've had to answer in my years as a parent and in my 16-plus years of professional life, for that matter.
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon, the younger of two daughters to a very hard-working pilot and director of operations for the Lebanese Airlines and a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma.
My father had encouraged my sister and I to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated.
I was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at 18 to study abroad.
My father didn't have a son, and so I, in a sense, became his.
Fast-forward a couple of decades, and I hope I didn't do too badly in making my father proud of his would-be son.
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD in electrical engineering, did R & amp; D in the UK, then consulting in the Middle East, I have always been in male-dominated environments.
Truth be told, I have never found a role model I could truly identify with.
My mother's generation wasn't into professional leadership.
There were some encouraging men along the way, but none knew the demands and pressures I was facing, pressures that got particularly acute when I had my own two beautiful children.
And although Western women love to give us poor, oppressed Arab women advice, they live different lives with different constraints.
So Arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models.
We have had to juggle more than Arab men, and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than Western women.
As a result, I would like to think that we poor, oppressed women actually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share, lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world.
Here are three of mine.
["Convert their sh * t into your fuel."]
There is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success: resilience.
Well, what exactly is resilience, and how do you develop it?
I believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel.
In my previous job, well before my current firm, I was working with a man we will call John.
I had teamed up with John and was working hard, hoping he would notice how great I was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm.
I was, in addition to delivering on my consulting projects, writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment.
One day, I got to present my research to a roomful of MBA students.
John was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study.
As I proceeded with my presentation, I could see John in the corner of my eye.
He had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame.
I finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car.
There he exploded. "What you did up there was unacceptable!
You are a consultant, not an activist!" I said, "John, I don't understand.
I presented a couple of gender parity indices, and some conclusions about the Arab world.
Yes, we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index, but what is it that I said or presented that was not factual?"
To which he replied, "The whole premise of your study is wrong.
What you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society." He paused, then added, "When women have children, their place is in the home."
Time stood still for a long while, and all I could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was: "You can forget about that partnership, Leila.
It's just never going to happen." It took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications, but once I did, I reached three conclusions.
One, that these were his issues, his complexes.
There may be many like him in our society, but I would never let their issues become mine.
Two, that I needed another sponsor, and fast.
(Laughter)
I got one, by the way, and boy, was he great.
And three, that I would get to show John what women with children can do.
I apply this lesson equally well to my personal life.
As I have progressed in my career, I have received many words of encouragement, but I have also often been met by women, men and couples who have clearly had an issue with my husband and I having chosen the path of a dual-career couple.
So you get this well-meaning couple who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering, that, come on, you must know you're not a great mom, given how much you're investing in your career, right?
I would lie if I said these words didn't hurt.
My children are the most precious thing to me, and the thought that I could be failing them in any way is intolerable.
But just like I did with John, I quickly reminded myself that these were their issues, their complexes.
So instead of replying, I gave back one of my largest smiles as I saw, in flashing light, the following sign in my mind's eye.
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]
You see, as a young woman in these situations, you have two options. You can either decide to internalize these negative messages that are being thrown at you, to let them make you feel like a failure, like success is way too hard to ever achieve, or you can choose to see that others' negativity is their own issue, and instead transform it into your own personal fuel.
I have learned to always go for option two, and I have found that it has taken me from strength to strength.
And it's true what they say: success is the best revenge.
Some women in the Middle East are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career.
Correction: I should say "smart enough," because who you marry is your own choice, and you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career.
Still today, the Arab man is not an equal contributor in the home.
It's simply not expected by our society, and even frowned upon as not very manly.
As for the Arab woman, our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband.
She mostly exists for her family.
Things are changing, but it will take time.
For now, it means that the professional Arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home, make sure that her children's every need is being taken care of and manage her demanding career.
To achieve this, I have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life.
You need to work your life.
Here is how I do this in my personal life.
One thing to know about the Middle East is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help.
The challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively.
Just like I would in my business life, I have based the selection of who would support me with my children while I'm at work on a strong referral.
Cristina had worked for four years with my sister and the quality of her work was well-established.
She is now an integral member of our family, having been with us since Alia was six months old.
She makes sure that the house is running smoothly while I'm at work, and I make sure to empower her in the most optimal conditions for her and my children, just like I would my best talent at work.
This lesson applies whatever your childcare situation, whether an au pair, nursery, part-time nanny that you share with someone else.
Choose very carefully, and empower.
If you look at my calendar, you will see every working day one and a half hours from 7pm to 8: 30pm UAE time blocked and called "family time." This is sacred time.
I have done this ever since Alia was a baby.
I do everything in my power to protect this time so that I can be home by then to spend quality time with my children, asking them about their day, checking up on homework, reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots of kisses and cuddles.
If I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone, I use Skype to connect with my children even if I am miles away.
Our son Burhan is five years old, and he's learning to read and do basic maths.
Here's another confession: I have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than I am.
(Laughter)
It started as a game, but Alia loves playing teacher to her little brother, and I have found that these sessions actually improve Burhan's literacy, increase Alia's sense of responsibility, and strengthen the bonding between them, a win-win all around.
The successful Arab women I know have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion's share of responsibility in the home.
But this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother.
This is also about being in the present.
When I am with my children, I try to leave work out of our lives.
Instead of worrying about how many minutes I can spend with them every day, I focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments, moments where I'm seeing my kids, hearing them, connecting with them.
["Join forces, don't compete."]
Arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they grew up.
This explains, I think, to some extent, why you find so few women in politics in the Arab world.
The upside of this, however, is that we have spent a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes, in coffee shops, in living rooms, on the phone, a social skill that is very important to success: networking.
I would say the average Arab woman has a large network of friends and acquaintances. The majority of those are also women.
In the West, it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room.
This leads to the much-spoken-about competitive behavior between professional women.
If there's only room for one woman at the top, then you can't make room for others, much less lift them up.
Arab women, generally speaking, have not fallen for this psychological trap.
Faced with a patriarchal society, they have found that by helping each other out, all benefit.
In my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East, so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn't bring many benefits and that I should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers.
Yet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women.
It was the head of marketing who initially suggested I be considered as a young global leader to the World Economic Forum.
She was familiar with my media engagements and my publications, and when she was asked to voice her opinion, she highlighted my name.
It was a young consultant, a Saudi lady and friend, who helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia, a market I was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman.
She introduced me to a client, and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in Saudi.
Today, I have two senior women on my team, and I see making them successful as key to my own success.
Women continue to advance in the world, not fast enough, but we're moving.
The Arab world, too, is making progress, despite many recent setbacks.
Just this year, the UAE appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet, for a total of eight female ministers.
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet, and more than many developed countries can claim.
This is today my daughter Alia's favorite picture.
This is the result, no doubt, of great leadership, but it is also the result of strong Arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries.
It is the result of Arab women deciding every day like me to convert shit into fuel, to work their life to keep work out of their life, and to join forces and not compete.
As I look to the future, my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some 20, 30 years from now are that she be as proud to call herself her mother's daughter as her father's daughter.
My hopes for my son are that by then, the expression "her mother's son" or "mama's boy" would have taken on a completely different meaning.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So this is my niece. Her name is Yahli.
She is nine months old.
Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer.
By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different.
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work.
They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines.
Machine learning is the technology that's responsible for most of this disruption.
It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence.
It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do.
My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning.
We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia.
This gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do, what they can't do and what jobs they might automate or threaten.
Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s.
It started with relatively simple tasks. It started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes.
Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs.
Machine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks.
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.
The winning algorithms were able to match the grades given by human teachers.
Last year, we issued an even more difficult challenge.
Can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy?
Again, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists.
Now, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this.
A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career.
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.
A machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes.
We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks.
But there are things we can do that machines can't do.
Where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations.
They can't handle things they haven't seen many times before.
The fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data.
Now, humans don't.
We have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we've never seen before.
Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar.
He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses? -- the microwave oven.
Now, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity.
But this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day.
Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations, and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate.
So what does this mean for the future of work?
The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question: To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?
On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.
Today they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases.
Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts.
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.
They're going to be needed for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation.
But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by.
Now, as mentioned, machines are not making progress on novel situations.
The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention.
It has to stand out from the crowd.
Business strategy means finding gaps in the market, things that nobody else is doing.
It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy.
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do, let every day bring you a new challenge.
If it does, then you will stay ahead of the machines.
Thank you.

Imagine that you are a product designer.
And you've designed a product, a new type of product, called the human immune system.
You're pitching this product to a skeptical, strictly no-nonsense manager. Let's call him Bob. I think we all know at least one Bob, right?
How would that go?
Bob, I've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product.
It's called the human immune system.
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this. Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.
I don't want to take you through the gory details, I just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component -- leukocytes, white blood cells -- before they're actually needed, to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.
And it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, antibodies.
The components don't really matter.
The point is that together, this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up.
And the design is completely modular.
You have the surface barrier of the human skin, you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over, creating a virtually foolproof system.
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me, because here is the really killer feature.
The product is completely adaptive.
It's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it's never even met before.
It actually also does this with incredible prudence, detecting and reacting to every tiny threat, and furthermore, remembering every previous threat, in case they are ever encountered again.
What I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.
The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body, and it works in complete harmony with that system, to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
And Bob may say something like, I sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation, blah blah blah --
(Laughter)
But honestly, it's total nonsense.
You seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex.
Didn't they teach you 80-20?
And furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed. It overreacts, makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't think this one is a winner.
If we went with Bob's philosophy, I think we'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system.
And efficiency is always important in the short term.
Less complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.
Who could say no to that?
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem, and that is that the user of this product, you or I, would probably die within one week of the next winter, when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
I first became interested in biology and business, and longevity and resilience, when I was asked a very unusual question by the CEO of a global tech company.
And the question was: What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years? A seemingly innocent question, but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think, considering that the average US public company now can expect a life span of only 30 years.
That is less than half of the life span that its employees can expect to enjoy.
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company, badgered by investors and buffeted by change, we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens 30 years out.
But here's something that should keep you awake at night: the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time, on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years.
Let's come back to our tech CEO's question.
Where better to turn for advice than nature, that's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company?
As a lapsed biologist, I decided to immediately call a real biologist, my friend Simon Levin, Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems, ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries.
And we asked ourselves the question: What makes these systems resilient and enduring?
And what we found was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.
In fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems, we also found them being very characteristic of long-lived social systems, like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church, believe it or not.
We also went on to look at business, and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long-lived, and we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived.
Let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses.
This beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex in Osaka, Japan.
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
It was built by a Korean artisan, because at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.
And this Korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company.
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.
In fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world.
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
Not too well, I'm afraid.
It borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the Japanese economy, to invest in real estate.
And when the bubble burst, it couldn't refinance its loans.
The company failed, and it was taken over by a major construction company.
Tragically, after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the Kongō family, Kongō Gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence.
Speaking of company failures: we're all familiar with the failure of Kodak, the company that declared bankruptcy in January 2012.
Much more interesting, however, is the question: Why did Fujifilm — same product, same pressures from digital technology, same time — why was Fujifilm able to survive and flourish?
Fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas, ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals, to medical systems to biomaterials.
Some of these diversification attempts failed.
But in aggregate, it was able to adapt its portfolio sufficiently to survive and flourish.
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it, the strategy succeeded because it had "more pockets and drawers" than the rivals.
He meant, of course, that they were able to create more options than the rivals.
Fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence, diversity and adaptation.
A catastrophic factory fire, like the one we see here, completely wiped out, in one evening, the only plant which supplied Toyota with valves for car-braking systems.
The ultimate test of resilience.
Car production ground to a screeching halt.
How was it, then, that Toyota was able to recover car production?
Can you imagine how long it took? Just five days. From having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days.
How was this possible?
Toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again.
Toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.
Now fortunately, few companies succumb to catastrophic fires.
But we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing to the disruption of technology.
How is it, then, that the consumer optics giant Essilor is able to avoid technology disruption, and even profit from it?
And yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics.
Essilor carefully scans the competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies.
It acquires those technologies very early, before they've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them, and it then develops those technologies itself, even at the risk of failure or the risk of self-disruption.
Essilor stays ahead of its game, and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years, by using the principles of prudence and adaptation.
OK, if these principles are so powerful, you might be thinking, why are they not commonplace in business?
Why do we not use these words every day?
Well, change has to first start in the mind.
If we think back to our pitch to Bob, in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system, we first need to think differently about business.
Now typically, when we think about business, we use what I call "mechanical thinking." We set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiency and short-term performance.
Now, don't get me wrong -- this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.
It's the way that Bob -- and probably many of us, myself included -- process most business problems we're faced with every day.
In fact, it was a pretty good mental model for business -- overall -- until about the mid-1980s, when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable.
But what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face?
I think in addition to the mechanical thinking, we now need to master the art of biological thinking, as embodied by our six principles.
In other words, we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape, rather than control, unpredictable and complex situations.
It's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird.
The ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.
So what do you think?
Sounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps? Not at all. Every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically. Why? Because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force.
It lacks the scale to buffer change, and it's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start-up to survive.
Now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.
But along the way somewhere, many have lost this ability to think and act biologically.
They need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today's environment.
So let's not just think about short-term performance.
Every company I know spends plenty of time thinking about the central question of strategy: How good is our competitive game?
In addition, let's also consider the second, more biological and equally important question: How long will that game last?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Is there life beyond Earth in our solar system?
Wow, what a powerful question.
You know, as a scientist -- planetary scientist -- we really didn't take that very seriously until recently.
Carl Sagan always said, "It takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims." And the claims of having life beyond Earth need to be definitive, they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it.
So how do we make this journey?
What we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life.
The ingredients of life are: liquid water -- we have to have a solvent, can't be ice, has to be liquid.
We also have to have energy.
We also have to have organic material -- things that make us up, but also things that we need to consume.
So we have to have these elements in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life, in that moment when it starts, can spark and then grow and evolve.
Well, I have to tell you that early in my career, when we looked at those three elements, I didn't believe that they were beyond Earth in any length of time and for any real quantity.
Why? We look at the inner planets.
Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.
Mars -- dry and arid. It's got no water.
And beyond Mars, the water in the solar system is all frozen.
But recent observations have changed all that.
It's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look and really start to answer our life question.
So when we look out into the solar system, where are the possibilities?
We're concentrating our attention on four locations.
The planet Mars and then three moons of the outer planets: Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.
So what about Mars? Let's go through the evidence. Well, Mars we thought was initially moon-like: full of craters, arid and a dead world.
And so about 15 years ago, we started a series of missions to go to Mars and see if water existed on Mars in its past that changed its geology.
We ought to be able to notice that.
And indeed we started to be surprised right away.
Our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past.
And in fact, Curiosity -- which has been roving on the surface now for about three years -- has really shown us that it's sitting in an ancient river bed, where water flowed rapidly.
And not for a little while, perhaps hundreds of millions of years.
And if everything was there, including organics, perhaps life had started.
Curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material.
And we were really excited when we saw that.
Because it wasn't red Mars, it was gray material, it's gray Mars.
We brought it into the rover, we tasted it, and guess what?
We tasted organics -- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur -- they were all there.
So Mars in its past, with a lot of water, perhaps plenty of time, could have had life, could have had that spark, could have grown.
And is that life still there?
We don't know that.
But a few years ago we started to look at a number of craters.
During the summer, dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters.
The more we looked, the more craters we saw, the more of these features.
We now know more than a dozen of them.
A few months ago the fairy tale came true.
We announced to the world that we know what these streaks are.
It's liquid water.
These craters are weeping during the summer.
Liquid water is flowing down these craters.
So what are we going to do now -- now that we see the water?
Well, it tells us that Mars has all the ingredients necessary for life.
In its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere -- there was an ocean.
It has weeping water right now.
Liquid water on its surface. It has organics. It has all the right conditions.
So what are we going to do next?
We're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on Mars.
And now it's more appealing than ever before.
As we move out into the solar system, here's the tiny moon Enceladus.
This is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone, this area around the sun.
This is much further out.
This object should be ice over a silicate core.
But what did we find? Cassini was there since 2006, and after a couple years looked back after it flew by Enceladus and surprised us all.
Enceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon. What a fabulous environment. Cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume, and it measured silicate particles.
Where does the silica come from?
It must come from the ocean floor.
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn, pulling and squeezing this moon -- is melting that ice, creating an ocean.
But it's also doing that to the core.
Now, the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an analogy ... are hydrothermal vents.
Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977.
Oceanographers were completely surprised.
And now there are thousands of these below the ocean.
What do we find? The oceanographers, when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents, they're teeming with life, regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline -- doesn't matter.
So hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.
So what about Enceladus? Well, we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time, and we believe it has hydrothermal vents with perhaps the right organic material, it is a place where life could exist.
And not just microbial -- maybe more complex because it's had time to evolve.
Another moon, very similar, is Europa.
Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996 and made fabulous observations of Europa.
Europa, we also know, has an under-the-ice crust ocean.
Galileo mission told us that, but we never saw any plumes.
But we didn't look for them.
Hubble, just a couple years ago, observing Europa, saw plumes of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere, just exactly like Enceladus.
These moons, which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone, that are out in the solar system, have liquid water.
And if there are organics there, there may be life.
This is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that for billions of years.
Life started here on Earth, we believe, after about the first 500 million, and look where we are.
These moons are fabulous moons.
Another moon that we're looking at is Titan.
Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.
It perhaps is much larger than the planet Mercury.
It has an extensive atmosphere.
It's so extensive -- and it's mostly nitrogen with a little methane and ethane -- that you have to peer through it with radar.
And on the surface, Cassini has found liquid.
We see lakes ... actually almost the size of our Black Sea in some places.
And this area is not liquid water; it's methane.
If there's any place in the solar system where life is not like us, where the substitute of water is another solvent -- and it could be methane -- it could be Titan.
Well, is there life beyond Earth in the solar system?
We don't know yet, but we're hot on the pursuit.
The data that we're receiving is really exciting and telling us -- forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways.
I believe we're on the right track.
That in the next 10 years, we will answer that question.
And if we answer it, and it's positive, then life is everywhere in the solar system. Just think about that. We may not be alone.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We are stealing nature from our children.
Now, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve, although that is unfortunately also the case.
What I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way that's so purist and so strict that under the definition we're creating for ourselves, there won't be any nature left for our children when they're adults.
But there's a fix for this. So let me explain.
Right now, humans use half of the world to live, to grow their crops and their timber, to pasture their animals.
If you added up all the human beings, we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together.
We cut roads through the forest.
We have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches.
We've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers.
And of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air.
So when you take your next breath, you'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in 1750.
So all of these changes, and many others, have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene." And this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch, given how pervasive human influence has been over it.
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch, but I think it's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.
So where does this put nature?
What counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans?
So 25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McKibben said that because nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man, then nature was over.
In fact, he called his book "The End of Nature."
I disagree with this. I just disagree with this.
I disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundamentally, we are animals. Right? Like, we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet, and all the other plants, and all the other microbes.
And so I think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity, man or woman.
I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives, anywhere where there are multiple species together, anywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing.
And under that definition, things look a little bit different.
Now, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way.
Places like Yellowstone, or the Mongolian steppe, or the Great Barrier Reef or the Serengeti.
Places that we think of as kind of Edenic representations of a nature before we screwed everything up.
And in a way, they are less impacted by our day to day activities.
Many of these places have no roads or few roads, so on, like such.
But ultimately, even these Edens are deeply influenced by humans.
Now, let's just take North America, for example, since that's where we're meeting.
So between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here, they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals, from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth, saber-toothed cats, all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us.
And when those animals went extinct, you know, the ecosystems didn't stand still.
Massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests, changed the composition of forest from one tree to another.
So even in these Edens, even in these perfect-looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans, we're essentially looking at a humanized landscape.
Not just these prehistoric humans, but historical humans, indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up.
And the case is the same for the other continents as well.
Humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time.
Now, just recently, someone told me,
"Oh, but there are still wild places."
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."
And he said, "The Amazon."
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon.
I was just there. It's awesome. National Geographic sent me to Manú National Park, which is in the Peruvian Amazon, but it's a big chunk of rainforest, uncleared, no roads, protected as a national park, one of the most, in fact, biodiverse parks in the world.
And when I got in there with my canoe, what did I find, but people. People have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years.
People live there, and they don't just float over the jungle.
They have a meaningful relationship with the landscape. They hunt. They grow crops. They domesticate crops. They use the natural resources to build their houses, to thatch their houses.
They even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals.
These people are there and they're interacting with the environment in a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment.
Now, I was with an anthropologist on this trip, and he told me, as we were floating down the river, he said, "There are no demographic voids in the Amazon." This statement has really stuck with me, because what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this.
There's people everywhere.
And many other tropical forests are the same, and not just tropical forests.
People have influenced ecosystems in the past, and they continue to influence them in the present, even in places where they're harder to notice.
So, if all of the definitions of nature that we might want to use that involve it being untouched by humanity or not having people in it, if all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature, then maybe they're the wrong definitions.
Maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species, by the presence of a thriving life.
Now, if we do it that way, what do we get?
Well, it's this kind of miracle.
All of a sudden, there's nature all around us.
All of a sudden, we see this Monarch caterpillar munching on this plant, and we realize that there it is, and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
And look at this empty lot.
I mean, there's, like, probably, a dozen, minimum, plant species growing there, supporting all kinds of insect life, and this is a completely unmanaged space, a completely wild space.
This is a kind of wild nature right under our nose, that we don't even notice.
And there's an interesting little paradox, too.
So this nature, this kind of wild, untended part of our urban, peri-urban, suburban agricultural existence that flies under the radar, it's arguably more wild than a national park, because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century.
Crater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest national park, is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past.
But they're managing it carefully.
One of the issues they have now is white bark pine die-off.
White bark pine is a beautiful, charismatic -- I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora that grows up at high altitude -- and it's got all these problems right now with disease.
There's a blister rust that was introduced, bark beetle.
So to deal with this, the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park, even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness.
And they're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas as I saw last time I went hiking there.
And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think.
National parks are heavily managed. The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure. Fires are suppressed. Fires are started. Non-native species are removed.
Native species are reintroduced.
And in fact, I took a look, and Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed: suppressing fire, having fire, radio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison.
It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And in a further irony, these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard, sometimes.
A lot of us like to go there, and because we're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet, they often are becoming more fragile over time.
Which means that they're the absolute worst places to take your children on vacation, because you can't do anything there.
You can't climb the trees. You can't fish the fish. You can't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere. You can't take home the pinecones.
There are so many rules and restrictions that from a child's point of view, this is, like, the worst nature ever.
Because children don't want to hike through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view.
That's maybe what we want to do as adults, but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot and just tinker with it, just work with it, just pick it up, build a house, build a fort, do something like that.
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places are often distant from where people live. And they're expensive to get to.
They're hard to visit.
So this means that they're only available to the elites, and that's a real problem.
The Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people, and they asked them, how often do you spend time outdoors? And only two out of five spent time outdoors at least once a week.
The other three out of five were just staying inside.
And when they asked them why, what are the barriers to going outside, the response of 61 percent was, "There are no natural areas near my home."
And this is crazy. This is just patently false. I mean, 71 percent of people in the US live within a 10-minute walk of a city park.
And I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries.
And that doesn't even count your back garden, the urban creek, the empty lot.
Everybody lives near nature.
Every kid lives near nature.
We've just somehow forgotten how to see it.
We've spent too much time watching David Attenborough documentaries where the nature is really sexy --
(Laughter)
and we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door, the nature of the street tree.
So here's an example: Philadelphia. There's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground, that's been abandoned.
Now, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan, and it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet, although they're working on it.
So for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of Philadelphia, and if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence, you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of Philadelphia.
Every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there.
This is completely autonomous, self-willed nature.
And it's right in the middle of the city.
And they've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys, and there are over 50 plant species up there.
And it's not just plants.
This is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem.
It's creating soil. It's sequestering carbon.
There's pollination going on.
I mean, this is really an ecosystem.
So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems," because they're often dominated by non-native species, and because they're just super weird.
They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before.
For so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash.
We're talking about regrown agricultural fields, timber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis, second-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast, where after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up.
And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii, where novel ecosystems are the norm, where exotic species totally dominate.
This forest here has Queensland maple, it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.
You can make your own novel ecosystem, too.
It's really simple. You just stop mowing your lawn.
Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland, and he did this experiment himself.
He just stopped mowing his lawn, and after a few years, he had some grad students come, and they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard, and they found 375 plant species, including two endangered species.
So when you're up there on that future High Line of Philadelphia, surrounded by this wildness, surrounded by this diversity, this abundance, this vibrance, you can look over the side and you can see a local playground for a local school, and that's what it looks like.
These children have, that -- You know, under my definition, there's a lot of the planet that counts as nature, but this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature.
There's nothing there except humans, no other plants, no other animals.
And what I really wanted to do was just, like, throw a ladder over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow.
In a way, I feel like this is the choice that faces us.
If we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good, we might as well just pave them over.
And in a world where everything is changing, we need to be very careful about how we define nature.
In order not to steal it from our children, we have to do two things.
First, we cannot define nature as that which is untouched.
This never made any sense anyway.
Nature has not been untouched for thousands of years.
And it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with, including only nature that children cannot touch.
Which brings me to the second thing that we have to do, which is that we have to let children touch nature, because that which is untouched is unloved.
(Applause)
We face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet.
Climate change is among them.
There's others too: habitat loss is my favorite thing to freak out about in the middle of the night.
But in order to solve them, we need people -- smart, dedicated people -- who care about nature.
who care about nature. And the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people is by letting them touch nature.
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology, Fort Theory of Conservation.
Every ecologist I know, every conservation biologist I know, every conservation professional I know, built forts when they were kids.
If we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a fort, we'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature.
And I don't want to be the one to tell this kid, who is on a special program that takes Philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks, I don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding is a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash.
I think I would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from, it is beautiful, and it deserves to be touched and appreciated.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once, that one of the things that's contributed to homo sapiens' success as a species is our lack of body hair -- that our hairlessness, our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing, gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose.
And now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing.
And it's more than just utility, now it's a communication.
Everything that we choose to put on is a narrative, a story about where we've been, what we're doing, who we want to be.
I was a lonely kid.
I didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with, and I ended up making a lot of my own play.
I made a lot of my own toys.
It began with ice cream.
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown, and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs.
And someone told me -- I was eight years old -- someone told me that when they were done with those tubs, they washed them out and kept them in the back, and if you asked they would give you one.
It took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage, but I did, and they did.
They gave me one -- I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub. I was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material -- metal ring, top and bottom.
I started turning it over in my head, and I realized, "Wait a minute -- my head actually fits inside this thing."
(Laughter)
Yeah, I cut a hole out, I put some acetate in there and I made myself a space helmet.
(Laughter)
I needed a place to wear the space helmet, so I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home.
I pushed it home, and in my parents' guest room closet, I turned it into a spaceship.
I started with a control panel out of cardboard. I cut a hole for a radar screen and put a flashlight underneath it to light it.
I put a view screen up, which I offset off the back wall -- and this is where I thought I was being really clever -- without permission, I painted the back wall of the closet black and put a star field, which I lit up with some Christmas lights I found in the attic, and I went on some space missions.
A couple years later, the movie "Jaws" came out.
I was way too young to see it, but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever, like everyone else in America at the time.
There was a store in my town that had a "Jaws" costume in their window, and my mom must have overheard me talking to someone about how awesome I thought this costume was, because a couple days before Halloween, she blew my freaking mind by giving me this "Jaws" costume.
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope for people of a certain age to complain that kids these days have no idea how good they have it, but let me just show you a random sampling of entry-level kids' costumes you can buy online right now ... ... and this is the "Jaws" costume my mom bought for me.
(Laughter)
This is a paper-thin shark face and a vinyl bib with the poster of "Jaws" on it.
(Laughter)
And I loved it.
A couple years later, my dad took me to a film called "Excalibur." I actually got him to take me to it twice, which is no small thing, because it is a hard, R-rated film.
But it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs that made me want to go see it again. They helped --
(Laughter)
It was the armor. The armor in "Excalibur" was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.
These were literally knights in shining, mirror-polished armor.
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur" wear their armor everywhere.
All the time -- they wear it at dinner, they wear it to bed.
(Laughter)
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?
I want to wear armor all the time!"
(Laughter)
So I went back to my favorite material, the gateway drug for making, corrugated cardboard, and I made myself a suit of armor, replete with the neck shields and a white horse.
Now that I've oversold it, here's a picture of the armor that I made.
(Laughter)
Now, this is only the first suit of armor I made inspired by "Excalibur." A couple of years later, I convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor.
Over about a month, he graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing and still, one of my all-time favorite attachment materials, POP rivets.
We carefully, over that month, constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves.
We drilled holes in the helmet so that I could breathe, and I finished just in time for Halloween and wore it to school.
Now, this is the one thing in this talk that I don't have a slide to show you, because no photo exists of this armor.
I did wear it to school, there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls, but he never found me, for reasons that are about to become clear.
There were things I didn't anticipate about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school.
In third period math, I was standing in the back of class, and I'm standing in the back of class because the armor did not allow me to sit down.
(Laughter)
This is the first thing I didn't anticipate.
And then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says, "Are you feeling OK?" I'm thinking, "Are you kidding?
Am I feeling OK? I'm wearing a suit of armor! I am having the time of my — "And I'm just about to tell her how great I feel, when the classroom starts to list to the left and disappear down this long tunnel, and then I woke up in the nurse's office.
I had passed out from heat exhaustion, wearing the armor.
And when I woke up, I wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class, I was wondering, "Who took my armor?
Where's my armor? "
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years, some colleagues and I get hired to make a show for Discovery Channel, called "MythBusters." And over 14 years, I learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies and how to tell stories about them for television.
I also learn early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling.
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color and narrative clarity to the stories we're telling.
And then we do an episode called "Dumpster Diving," and I learn a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.
In the episode "Dumpster Diving," the question we were trying to answer is: Is jumping into a dumpster as safe as the movies would lead you to believe?
(Laughter)
The episode was going to have two distinct parts to it.
One was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman into an air bag.
And the second was the graduation to the experiment: we'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it.
I wanted to visually separate these two elements, and I thought, "Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits — Oh!
Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits.
That's for the training." But for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking -- "I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"
(Laughter)
So I went to Haight Street. I bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots.
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear.
The day of the experiment shoot comes up, and I step out of my car in this costume, and my crew takes a look at me ... and start suppressing their church giggles.
They're like, "(Laugh sound)." And I feel two distinct things at this moment.
I feel total embarrassment over the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew that I'm completely into wearing this costume.
(Laughter)
But the producer in my mind reminds myself that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo, that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me.
(Laughter)
Five years into the "MythBusters" run, we got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con.
I'd known about Comic-Con for years and never had time to go.
This was the big leagues -- this was costuming mecca.
People fly in from all over the world to show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego.
And I wanted to participate.
I decided that I would put together an elaborate costume that covered me completely, and I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.
The costume I chose? Hellboy. That's not my costume, that's actually Hellboy.
(Laughter)
But I spent months assembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could, from the boots to the belt to the pants to the right hand of doom.
I found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest and I put them on.
I even had contact lenses made in my prescription.
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con and I can't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume.
(Laughter)
Sweating! I should've remembered this.
I'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes, and none of it matters because I'm totally in love.
(Laughter)
Not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor, but also with the community of other costumers.
It's not called costuming at Cons, it's called "cosplay." Now ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime, but it is so much more than that.
These aren't just people who find a costume and put it on -- they mash them up.
They bend them to their will.
They change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions.
They're super clever and genius.
They let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful.
(Laughter)
But more than that, they rehearse their costumes.
At Comic-Con or any other Con, you don't just take pictures of people walking around.
You go up and say, "Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?" And then you give them time to get into their pose.
They've worked hard on their pose to make their costume look great for your camera.
And it's so beautiful to watch. And I take this to heart.
At subsequent Cons, I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from "The Dark Knight." I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith from "Lord of the Rings," and I actually frighten some children.
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" -- that head laugh that Chewbacca does.
And then I dressed up as No-Face from "Spirited Away." If you don't know about "Spirited Away" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki, first of all, you're welcome.
(Laughter)
This is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films.
It's about a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in the spirit world in an abandoned Japanese theme park.
And she finds her way back out again with the help of a couple of friends she makes -- a captured dragon named Haku and a lonely demon named No-Face.
No-Face is lonely and he wants to make friends, and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him and producing gold in his hand.
But this doesn't go very well, and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until Chihiro saves him, rescues him.
So I put together a No-Face costume, and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.
And I very carefully practiced No-Face's gestures.
I resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.
When people asked to take my picture, I would nod and I would shyly stand next to them.
They would take the picture and then I would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin.
And at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them. Ah, ah ah! -- like that.
And people were freaking out. "Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! Oh my god, this is so cool!" And I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic.
And about 15 minutes in something happens.
Somebody grabs my hand, and they put a coin back into it.
And I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift, but no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away.
I don't know why.
And I keep on going, I take some more pictures.
And then it happens again.
Understand, I can't see anything inside this costume.
I can see through the mouth -- I can see people's shoes.
I can hear what they're saying and I can see their feet.
But the third time someone gives me back a coin, I want to know what's going on.
So I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view, and what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.
And then it hits me: it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.
In the film "Spirited Away," bad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face.
This isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay.
We are, all of us on that floor, injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us.
And we're making it our own.
We're connecting with something important inside of us.
And the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11.5 million documents, verify it and make sense of it?
That was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year.
An anonymous person calling himself John Doe had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
This is one of many firms around the world that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets.
John Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm, every client file, every email, from 1977 to the present day.
It represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen.
But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism.
Think about it: 11.5 million documents, containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries.
Where do you start with such a vast resource?
Where do you even begin to tell a story that can trail off into every corner of the globe, and that can affect almost any person in any language, sometimes in ways they don't even know yet.
John Doe had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He said he was motivated by -- and I quote -- "The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal." But one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information.
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out to my organization in Washington, DC, The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
We decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists: share.
(Laughter)
By nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves.
We fiercely guard our secrets, at times even from our editors, because we know that the moment we tell them what we have, they'll want that story right away.
And to be frank, when you get a good story, you like to keep the glory to yourself.
But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world, and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this.
The issues we report on are more and more transnational.
Giant corporations operate on a global level.
Environmental and health crises are global.
So, too, are financial flows and financial crises.
So it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way.
And it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings, rather than being frightened of it.
The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news.
The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken.
And this has plunged journalism into crisis, forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function.
But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity.
The first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers was to make the documents searchable and readable.
There were nearly five million emails, two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed, and millions more files and other kinds of documents.
They all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud.
We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents.
In all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries -- from the BBC in Britain to Le Monde newspaper in France to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan. "Native eyes on native names," we called it, the idea being, who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria than a Nigerian journalist?
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?
There were only two rules for everyone who was invited: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else, and we all agreed to publish together on the same day.
We chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations and also from leads that jumped out from the documents.
Over the next few months, my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups.
The biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history: 376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do, working shoulder to shoulder, sharing information, but telling no one.
For it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of noise, we first needed the biggest kind of silence.
To manage the project over the many months it would take, we built a secure virtual newsroom. We used encrypted communication systems, and we built a specially designed search engine.
Inside the virtual newsroom, the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents.
Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance, could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities.
Those interested in sport could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies, thereby likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade.
But perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents — figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine, close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked through his late father, Ian Cameron.
Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities, such as Wintris Inc., a company in the British Virgin Islands that had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson, the Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project, as the loneliest man in the world.
For nine months, he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife.
He pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter.
And he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences, as he worked red-eyed, night after night, month after month.
In all that time, he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country.
Now, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery, such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company, that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks -- the very issue he's been elected on -- well, your instinct is to scream out very loud.
Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to, Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor. "Wintris is coming," he used to say.
(Laughter)
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."
When reporters like Johannes wanted to scream, they did so inside the virtual newsroom, and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records, official company registers, and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name.
Panama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else.
As we were researching the story, unconnected to us, a major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil.
A new leader was elected in Argentina.
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA, the organization that controls the world of professional soccer.
The Panama Papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events.
So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do.
Any of one of these journalists, they could have broken the pact.
But they didn't.
And on April 3 this year, at exactly 8pm German time, we published simultaneously in 76 countries.
(Applause)
The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year.
This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published.
It was the first of many protests.
The Icelandic prime minister had to resign.
It was a first of many resignations.
We spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi, the most famous soccer player in the world.
And there were some unintended consequences.
These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout.
They'd been using the address to register their offshore company.
(Laughter)
There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do.
The technology -- the Internet -- that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself.
And this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact.
We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques to vast amounts of leaked information.
We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe.
And by sharing resources, we were able to dig deep -- much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days, because of financial concerns.
Now, it was a big risk, and it wouldn't work for every story, but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere, and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work.
Try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries.
Try stopping the inevitable.
Shortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes: "Wintris has arrived."
(Laughter)
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.
I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you, right?
Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask.
The first one is, you'd been working in secrecy for over a year with 350-something colleagues from all over the world -- was there ever a moment when you thought that the leak may be leaked, that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story?
Or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know?
Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away.
We had to calm them down.
Probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication.
We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin, but instead of responding, the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us, and denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
At that point, Putin thought it was just about him.
And, of course, a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this.
They thought the story was going to get out.
You can imagine the amount of time they'd spent, the amount of resources, money spent on this.
So I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down, a bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back: "Calm, remain calm." And then eventually, of course, they all did.
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword, essentially.
GR: We very much believe that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public.
Now, we didn't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we're working with.
But the basic information such as the name of a person, what their offshore company was and the name of that company, is now all available online.
In fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.
I want to tell you about the future of money.
Let's start with a story about this culture that lived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, called the Yap.
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money is really interesting.
They use these limestone discs called Rai stones.
Now, the Yap don't actually move these Rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because Rai stones can get to be pretty massive.
The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across.
So the Yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone.
There's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in.
The sailors got back to the main island and they told everyone what had happened.
And everyone decided that, actually, yes, the sailors had the stone and -- why not? -- it still counted.
Even though it was at the bottom of the ocean, it was still part of the Yap economy.
You might think that this was just a small culture a hundred years ago.
But things like this happen in the Western world as well, and the Yap actually still use a form of these stones.
In 1932, the Bank of France asked the United States to convert their holdings from dollars into gold.
But it was too inconvenient to think about actually shipping all of that gold over to Europe.
So instead, someone went to where that gold was being stored and they just labeled it as belonging to France now.
And everyone agreed that France owned the gold.
It's just like those Rai stones.
The point I want to make with these two examples is that there's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin.
The only reason these things have any value is because we've all decided they should.
And because we've decided that, they do.
Money is about the exchanges and the transactions that we have with each other.
Money isn't anything objective.
It's about a collective story that we tell each other about value. A collective fiction. And that's a really powerful concept.
In the past two decades, we've begun to use digital money.
So I get paid via direct deposit, I pay my rent via bank transfer, I pay my taxes online.
And every month, a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck and invested in mutual funds in my retirement account.
All of these interactions are literally just changing 1's and 0's on computers.
There's not even anything physical, like a stone or a coin.
Digital money makes it so that I can pay someone around the world in seconds.
Now when this works, it's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer.
And when it doesn't, it's often the fault of those large institutions.
Or at least, it's up to them to fix the problem.
And a lot of times, they don't.
There's a lot of friction in the system.
How long did it take the US credit card companies to implement chip and pin?
Half my credit cards still don't work in Europe. That's friction. Transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive: friction.
friction. An entrepreneur in India can set up an online business in minutes, but it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid:
Our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers.
And there's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down.
That's because digital money isn't really mine, it's entries in databases that belong to my bank, my credit card company or my investment firm.
And these companies have the right to say "no." If I'm a PayPal merchant and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud, that's it.
My account gets frozen, and I can't get paid.
These institutions are standing in the way of innovation.
How many of you use Facebook photos, Google Photos, Instagram?
My photos are everywhere.
They are on my phone, they're on my laptop, they're on my old phone, they're in Dropbox.
They're on all these different websites and services.
And most of these services don't work together.
They don't inter-operate.
And as a result, my photo library is a mess.
The same thing happens when institutions control the money supply.
A lot of these services don't inter-operate, and as a result, this blocks what we can do with payment.
And it makes transaction costs go up.
So far, we've been through two phases of money.
In an analog world, we had to deal with these physical objects, and money moved at a certain speed -- the speed of humans.
In a digital world, money can reach much farther and is much faster, but we're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions.
Money only moves at the speed of banks.
We're about to enter a new phase of money.
The future of money is programmable.
When we combine software and currency, money becomes more than just a static unit of value, and we don't have to rely on institutions for security.
In a programmable world, we remove humans and institutions from the loop.
And when this happens, we won't even feel like we're transacting anymore.
Money will be directed by software, and it will just safely and securely flow.
Cryptocurrencies are the first step of this evolution.
Cryptocurrencies are digital money that isn't run by any government or bank.
It's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries.
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency, but there are hundreds of them.
There's Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, Dogecoin, and those are just a few of the more popular ones.
And these things are real money.
The sushi restaurant down my street takes Bitcoin.
I have an app on my phone that I can use to buy sashimi.
But it's not just for small transactions.
In March, there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.
That's the equivalent of 40 million US dollars.
Cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography.
Cryptography is the study of how to secure communication, and it's about two really important things: masking information so it can be hidden in plain sight, and verifying a piece of information's source.
Cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us.
And it's so powerful that at times the US government has actually classified it as a weapon.
During World War II, breaking cryptosystems like Enigma was critical to decoding enemy transmissions and turning the tide of the war.
Today, anyone with a modern web browser is running a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.
It's what we use to secure our interactions on the Internet.
It's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in and to send financial information to websites.
So what the banks used to give us -- trustworthy digital money transfer -- we can now get with a clever application of cryptography.
And this means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions.
We can do it ourselves.
Bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the Yap used, this collective global knowledge of transfers.
In Bitcoin, I spend by transferring Bitcoin, and I get paid when someone transfers Bitcoin to me.
Imagine that we had this magic paper.
So the way that this paper works is I can give you a sheet of it and if you write something on it, it will magically appear on my piece as well.
Let's say we just give everyone this paper and everyone writes down the transfers that they're doing in the Bitcoin system.
All of these transfers get copied around to everyone else's pieces of paper.
And I can look at mine and I'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening in the entire Bitcoin economy.
This is actually what's happening with the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a list of all of the transactions in Bitcoin.
Except, it's not done through paper.
It's done through computer code, running on thousands of net worked computers around the world.
All of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what Bitcoin.
So the Bitcoin blockchain is core to how Bitcoin works.
But where do bitcoins actually come from?
Well, the code is designed to create new Bitcoin according to a schedule.
And the way that it works is that to get those Bitcoin, I have to solve a puzzle -- a random cryptographic puzzle.
Imagine that we had 15 dice, and we were throwing these dice over and over again.
Whenever the dice come up all sixes, we say that we win.
This is very close to what these computers are all actually doing.
They're trying over and over again to land on the right number.
And when they do, we say that they've solved the puzzle.
The computer that solves the puzzle publishes its solution to the rest of the network and collects its reward: new bitcoins.
And in the act of solving this puzzle, these computers are actually helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain and add to the list of transactions.
There are actually people all over the world running this software, and we call them Bitcoin miners.
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.
You can go download the software right now and run it in your computer and try to collect some bitcoins.
I can't say that I would recommend it, because right now, the puzzle is so hard and the network is so powerful, that if I tried to mine Bitcoin on my laptop, I probably wouldn't see any for about two million years.
The miners, professional miners, use this special hardware that's designed to solve the puzzle really fast.
Now, the Bitcoin network and all of this special hardware, there are estimates that the amount of energy it uses is equivalent to that of a small country.
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome.
But the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster.
Cryptocurrencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money.
And in a world with programmable money, I can pay anyone else securely without having to sign up or ask permission, or do a conversion or worry about my money getting stuck.
And I can send money around the world.
This is a really amazing thing.
It's the idea of permission-less innovation.
The Internet caused an explosion of innovation, because it was built upon an open architecture.
And just like the Internet changed the way we communicate, programmable money is going to change the way we pay, allocate and decide on value.
So what kind of world does programmable money create?
Imagine a world where I can rent out my healthcare data to a pharmaceutical company.
They can run large-scale data analysis and provide me with a cryptographic proof that shows they're only using my data in a way that we agreed.
And they can pay me for what they find out.
Instead of signing up for streaming services and getting a cable bill, what if my television analyzed my watching habits and recommended well-priced content that fit within my budget that I would enjoy?
Imagine an Internet without ads, because instead of paying with our attention when we view content, we just pay.
Interestingly, things like micro-payments are actually going to change the way security works in our world, because once we're better able to allocate value, people will use their money and their energies for more constructive things.
If it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email, would we still have spam?
We're not at this world yet, but it's coming.
Right now, it's like we're in a world that is seeing the first automobile.
The first cryptocurrency, like the first car, is slow and hard to understand and hard to use.
Digital money, like the horse and carriage, works pretty well, and the whole world economy is built on it.
If you were the first person on your block to get a car with an internal combustion engine, your neighbors would probably think you were crazy: "Why would you want this large, clunky machine that breaks down all the time, that lights on fire, and is still slower than a horse?" But we all know how that story turns out.
We're entering a new era of programmable money.
And it's very exciting, but it's also a little bit scary.
Cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions, just like cash is used for crime in the world today.
When all of our transactions are online, what does that mean for surveillance -- who can see what we do?
Who's advantaged in this new world and who isn't?
Will I have to start to pay for things that I didn't have to pay for before?
Will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions?
All new technology comes with trade-offs.
The Internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time.
But it also greatly increased productivity.
Mobile phones are annoying because they make me feel like I have to stay connected to work all the time.
But they also help me stay connected to friends and family.
The new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs.
But it's also going to create new, flexible forms of employment.
With programmable money, we decouple the need for large, trusted institutions from the architecture of the network.
And this pushes innovation in money out to the edges, where it belongs.
Programmable money democratizes money.
And because of this, things are going to change and unfold in ways that we can't even predict. Thank you.
The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques, if we are able to dream.
As a child, I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality.
I learned this from my grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer, a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes.
That is how I grew up: encouraged to see beyond any limitation.
So part of my education included helping her in remote, indigenous communities.
I cherish those memories, because they helped me to understand life outside the city, a life with a lot of possibilities, without barriers, as language or culture.
During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem: "Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the Mountains.
Something lost behind the mountains.
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"
In the coming years, I became a medical student.
One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease.
There's a part of this problem I think I can solve -- the part of this problem I have spent my life working on.
The problem starts during pregnancy.
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother.
Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood.
At the moment of birth, this communication needs to stop.
If it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart.
It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions.
But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes.
As you can see in the chart, the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude.
Video: (Baby crying)
When you look at patients with this condition, they seem desperate to breathe.
To close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution.
One night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region.
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch.
Then came a moment of inspiration.
So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention.
The holes in children's hearts can be closed with it.
A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself.
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now, but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem.
In this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart.
The coil then closes the hole.
After that moment of inspiration, there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype.
In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab.
The coil, if it works, can save lives.
I returned from Germany to Bolivia, thinking that wherever we go, we have the opportunity to make a difference.
With my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath, we started to see patients.
After successfully treating patients with our coil, we felt really enthusiastic.
But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high.
And, the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition.
The hole in altitude patients is different, because the orifice between the arteries is larger.
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time, and they die.
The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia.
The search started again.
We went back to the drawing board.
After many trials, and with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains, we obtained a new device.
For centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms, and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device.
We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape.
It seems this time, the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn't rust because it's made of only one piece.
It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop.
As you can see, the device enters the body through the natural channels.
Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole.
Our device expands, places itself and closes the hole.
We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself.
No open surgery was necessary.
(Applause)
As doctors, we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal -- if they do.
This is the child from before, after the procedure.
As you can see --
(Applause)
As you can see, once the device is in place, the patient is 100 percent healed.
From start to finish, the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.
That's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view.
We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team -- a team, thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us.
Together, we have only one idea: the best solutions need to be simple.
We lost the fear of creating something new.
The path, it's not easy.
Many obstacles arise all the time.
But we receive strength from our patients.
Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity.
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind, not because of cost or access.
So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model.
We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated.
We are in many countries now, but we need to be everywhere.
This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it, really: No child is left behind.
Muchas gracias.
(Applause)
So when I decided to create an art piece in Manshiyat Naser, the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt, I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that I would ever live.
As an artist, I had this humanist intention of beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood by bringing art to it and hopefully shining light on this isolated community.
The first time I heard about this Christian Coptic community was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Hosni Mubarak decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of H1N1 virus.
Originally, they are pig breeders.
Their pigs and other animals are fed with the organic waste that they collect on a daily basis.
This event killed their livelihood.
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser, it felt like a maze.
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.
So you go right, then straight, then right again, then left to reach all the way to the top.
But to reach there, you must dodge between the trucks overpacked with garbage and slalom between the tuk-tuks, the fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood.
The smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense, and the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing.
Add to it the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way.
From outside it looks chaotic, but everything is perfectly organized.
The Zaraeeb, that ’ s how they call themselves, which means the pig breeders, have been collecting the garbage of Cairo and sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades.
They have developed one of the most efficient and highly profitable systems on a global level.
Still, the place is perceived as dirty, marginalized and segregated because of their association with the trash.
So my initial idea was to create an anamorphic piece, a piece that you can only see from one vantage point.
I wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings and having it only fully visible from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.
The Muqattam Mountain is the pride of the community.
This is where they built the St. Simon Monastery, a 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself.
So, the first time I stood on top of the mountain and I looked at the neighborhood, I asked myself, how on earth will I convince all those owners to let me paint on their buildings?
And then Magd came.
Magd is a guide from the Church.
He told me the only person I needed to convince was Father Samaan, who is the leader of the community.
But to convince Father Samaan, I needed to convince Mario, who is a Polish artist who moved to Cairo 20 years ago and who created all the artwork of the Cave Church. I am really grateful to Mario.
He was the key of the project.
He managed to get me a meeting with Father Samaan, and surprisingly, he loved the idea.
He asked me about where I painted before and how I will make it happen.
And he was mainly concerned by what I was going to write.
In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of Arabic calligraphy.
I make sure those messages are relevant to the place where I am painting but have this universal dimension, so anybody around the world can relate to it.
So for Manshiyat Naser, I decided to write in Arabic the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria, a Coptic bishop from the third century, who said: (Arabic), which means in English, "Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first."
It was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words.
And for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project.
So Father Samaan blessed the project, and his approval brought all the residents on board.
Hundreds of liters of paint, a dozen blue manual lifts, several trips back and forth to Cairo, a strong and solid team from France, North Africa, Middle East and the US, and after a year of planning and logistics, there we are, my team and some members from the local community creating a piece that will spread over 50 buildings, some filling up the space of the calligraphy that I trace with colors.
Here some blue, there some yellow, there some orange.
Some others carrying some sand bags and putting them on the top of the buildings to hold those manual lifts, and some others assembling and disassembling those same lifts and moving them around the different buildings.
At the beginning of the project, I numbered all those buildings on my sketch, and there was no real interaction with the community.
People didn ’ t get the point of all this.
But fast enough, those building numbers became family names.
The first building was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.
Uncle Ibrahim is such an enthusiastic person. He was always singing and making jokes, and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor.
(Laughter)
Actually, the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony.
(Laughter)
Yeah.
Uncle Ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony and talking to me while I was painting.
I remember him saying that he didn ’ t go to the mountain for 10 years, and that he never takes a day off.
He said that if he stopped working, who will stop the garbage?
But surprisingly, at the end of the project, he came all the way to the mountain to look at the piece.
He was really proud to see his house painted, and he said that this project was a project of peace and -- sorry --
He said that it was a project of peace and unity and that it brought people together.
So his perception towards the project changed, and my perception towards the community changed also, and towards what they do.
All the garbage that everybody is disgusted by is not theirs.
They just work out of it.
Actually, they don ’ t live in the garbage. They live from the garbage.
So I started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project?
It was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it. It was about switching perception and opening a dialogue on the connection that we have with communities that we don ’ t know.
So day after day, the calligraphy circle was taking shape, and we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece.
And standing exactly at this point every day made my realize the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece.
If you want to see the real image of somebody, maybe you should change your angle.
There was doubts and difficulties, like fears and stress.
It wasn't simple to work in such environments, sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift.
But we all got over the fear of the heights, the swinging lifts, the strength of the smell and also the stress of not finishing on time.
But the kindness of all those people made us forget everything.
The building number 3 was the house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.
In Egyptian, they have this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas," which means "the best people." They were the best people. We used to take our break in front of their houses, and all the kids of the neighborhood used to join us.
I was impressed and amazed by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.
For the first few days, they were always refusing anything we were offering them, even a snack or a drink.
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?" And she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything from somebody that they don't know because maybe this person needs it more than they do.
So at this exact point I realized actually the Zaraeeb community was the ideal context to raise the topic of perception.
We need to question our level of misconception and judgment we can have as a society upon communities based on their differences.
I remember how we got delayed on Uncle Ibrahim's house when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts.
(Laughter)
The house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda was this kind of meeting point.
Everybody used to gather there.
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant when he said that was a project of peace and unity, because I really felt that people were coming together.
Everyone was greeting us with a smile, offering us a drink or inviting us into their own house for lunch.
Sometime, you are at the first level of a building, and somebody opens his window and offers you some tea.
And then the same thing happens on the second floor.
And you keep going all the way to the top.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt.
(Laughter)
And to be honest with you, we could have finished earlier, but I think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks.
(Laughter)
In Egypt, they have another expression, which is "Nawartouna," which means, "You brought light to us." In Manshiyat Naser they were always telling us this.
The calligraphy, actually -- I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project, we rented some black light projectors and lit up the whole neighborhood, surprising everybody around.
We wanted to tell them that they are the ones who brought light to us.
The Zaraeeb community are strong, honest, hard workers, and they know their value.
The people of Cairo call them "the Zabaleen," which means "the people of the garbage," but ironically, the people of Manshiyat Naser call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen. They say, they are the ones who produce the garbage, not them.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The goal was to leave something to this community, but I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives.
You know, the art project was just a pretext for this amazing human experience.
The art piece at some point will disappear, vanish, and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house, so it's covering part of the painting, so I might need to go back and paint over it.
(Laughter)
It was about the experience, about the story, about the moment.
From the streets of the neighborhood, the painting appears in fragments, isolated from one another, standing alone.
But connected with the sign of calligraphy that today reveals the powerful message that we should all think about before we want to judge somebody.
"Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hello, everybody. I brought with me today a baby diaper.
You'll see why in a second.
Baby diapers have interesting properties.
They can swell enormously when you add water to them, an experiment done by millions of kids every day.
(Laughter)
But the reason why is that they're designed in a very clever way.
They're made out of a thing called a swellable material.
It's a special kind of material that, when you add water, it will swell up enormously, maybe a thousand times in volume.
And this is a very useful, industrial kind of polymer.
But what we're trying to do in my group at MIT is to figure out if we can do something similar to the brain.
Can we make it bigger, big enough that you can peer inside and see all the tiny building blocks, the biomolecules, how they're organized in three dimensions, the structure, the ground truth structure of the brain, if you will?
If we could get that, maybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized to yield thoughts and emotions and actions and sensations.
Maybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain that result in diseases, diseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy and Parkinson's, for which there are few treatments, much less cures, and for which, very often, we don't know the cause or the origins and what's really causing them to occur.
Now, our group at MIT is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years. We're designers. We're inventors. We're trying to figure out how to build technologies that let us look at and repair the brain.
And the reason is, the brain is incredibly, incredibly complicated.
So what we've learned over the first century of neuroscience is that the brain is a very complicated network, made out of very specialized cells called neurons with very complex geometries, and electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons.
Furthermore, neurons are connected in networks. They're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals and allow the neurons to talk to each other.
The density of the brain is incredible.
In a cubic millimeter of your brain, there are about 100,000 of these neurons and maybe a billion of those connections.
But it's worse.
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron, and, of course, this is just our artist's rendition of it. What you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules, little nanoscale machines organized in complex, 3D patterns, and together they mediate those electrical pulses, those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth.
Now, we don't know how the neurons in the brain are organized to form networks, and we don't know how the biomolecules are organized within neurons to form these complex, organized machines.
If we really want to understand this, we're going to need new technologies.
But if we could get such maps, if we could look at the organization of molecules and neurons and neurons and networks, maybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information from sensory regions, mixes it with emotion and feeling, and generates our decisions and actions.
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set of molecular changes that occur in a brain disorder.
And once we know how those molecules have changed, whether they've increased in number or changed in pattern, we could use those as targets for new drugs, for new ways of delivering energy into the brain in order to repair the brain computations that are afflicted in patients who suffer from brain disorders.
We've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century to try to confront this.
I think we've all seen brain scans taken using MRI machines.
These, of course, have the great power that they are noninvasive, they can be used on living human subjects.
But also, they're spatially crude.
Each of these blobs that you see, or voxels, as they're called, can contain millions and millions of neurons.
So it's not at the level of resolution where it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur or the changes in the wiring of these networks that contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings.
At the other extreme, you have microscopes.
Microscopes, of course, will use light to look at little tiny things.
For centuries, they've been used to look at things like bacteria. For neuroscience, microscopes are actually how neurons were discovered in the first place, about 130 years ago.
But light is fundamentally limited.
You can't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope.
You can't look at these tiny connections.
So if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful, to get down to the ground truth structure, we're going to need to have even better technologies.
My group, a couple years ago, started thinking: Why don't we do the opposite?
If it's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain, why can't we make the brain bigger?
It initially started with two grad students in my group, Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.
Now many others in my group are helping with this process.
We decided to try to figure out if we could take polymers, like the stuff in the baby diaper, and install it physically within the brain.
If we could do it just right, and you add water, you can potentially blow the brain up to where you could distinguish those tiny biomolecules from each other.
You would see those connections and get maps of the brain.
This could potentially be quite dramatic.
We brought a little demo here.
We got some purified baby diaper material.
It's much easier just to buy it off the Internet than to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers.
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here of this purified polymer.
And here we have some water.
What we're going to do is see if this teaspoon of the baby diaper material can increase in size.
You're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold before your very eyes.
I could pour much more of this in there, but I think you've got the idea that this is a very, very interesting molecule, and if can use it in the right way, we might be able to really zoom in on the brain in a way that you can't do with past technologies.
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.
What's going on in the baby diaper polymer?
If you could zoom in, it might look something like what you see on the screen.
Polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long, thin lines.
The chains are very tiny, about the width of a biomolecule, and these polymers are really dense.
They're separated by distances that are around the size of a biomolecule.
This is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain.
If we add water, what will happen is, this swellable material is going to absorb the water, the polymer chains will move apart from each other, and the entire material is going to become bigger.
And because these chains are so tiny and spaced by biomolecular distances, we could potentially blow up the brain and make it big enough to see.
Here's the mystery, then: How do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart?
If we could do that, maybe we could get ground truth maps of the brain.
We could look at the wiring.
We can peer inside and see the molecules within.
To explain this, we made some animations where we actually look at, in these artist renderings, what biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them.
Step one: what we'd have to do, first of all, is attach every biomolecule, shown in brown here, to a little anchor, a little handle.
We need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other, and to do that, we need to have a little handle that allows those polymers to bind to them and to exert their force.
Now, if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain, obviously, it's going to sit there on top.
So we need to find a way to make the polymers inside.
And this is where we're really lucky. It turns out, you can get the building blocks, monomers, as they're called, and if you let them go into the brain and then trigger the chemical reactions, you can get them to form those long chains, right there inside the brain tissue.
They're going to wind their way around biomolecules and between biomolecules, forming those complex webs that will allow you, eventually, to pull apart the molecules from each other.
And every time one of those little handles is around, the polymer will bind to the handle, and that's exactly what we need in order to pull the molecules apart from each other.
All right, the moment of truth.
We have to treat this specimen with a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other, and then, when we add water, that swellable material is going to start absorbing the water, the polymer chains will move apart, but now, the biomolecules will come along for the ride.
And much like drawing a picture on a balloon, and then you blow up the balloon, the image is the same, but the ink particles have moved away from each other.
And that's what we've been able to do now, but in three dimensions.
There's one last trick.
As you can see here, we've color-coded all the biomolecules brown. That's because they all kind of look the same.
Biomolecules are made out of the same atoms, but just in different orders.
So we need one last thing in order to make them visible.
We have to bring in little tags, with glowing dyes that will distinguish them.
So one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color.
Another kind of biomolecule might get a red color. And so forth. And that's the final step.
Now we can look at something like a brain and look at the individual molecules, because we've moved them far apart enough from each other that we can tell them apart.
So the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible.
We can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they're like constellations of information about life.
Here's an actual video of what it might look like.
We have here a little brain in a dish -- a little piece of a brain, actually.
We've infused the polymer in, and now we're adding water.
What you'll see is that, right before your eyes -- this video is sped up about sixtyfold -- this little piece of brain tissue is going to grow.
It can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume.
And the cool part is, because those polymers are so tiny, we're separating biomolecules evenly from each other.
It's a smooth expansion.
We're not losing the configuration of the information.
We're just making it easier to see.
So now we can take actual brain circuitry -- here's a piece of the brain involved with, for example, memory -- and we can zoom in.
We can start to actually look at how circuits are configured.
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.
Maybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured to process emotions, how the actual wiring of our brain is organized in order to make us who we are.
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully, the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level.
What if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out, wow, here are the 17 molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy or changing in Parkinson's disease or otherwise being altered?
If we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong, those become our therapeutic targets. We can build drugs that bind those. We can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain in order to help people with Parkinson's or epilepsy or other conditions that affect over a billion people around the world.
Now, something interesting has been happening. It turns out that throughout biomedicine, there are other problems that expansion might help with.
This is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient.
It turns out that if you look at cancers, if you look at the immune system, if you look at aging, if you look at development -- all these processes are involving large-scale biological systems. But of course, the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules, the machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick.
So what we're trying to do now is to figure out if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life in a wide variety of diseases.
Can we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor so that we can actually go after it in a smart way and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to?
You know, a lot of medicine is very high risk.
Sometimes, it's even guesswork.
My hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that's more reliable.
If you think about the original moon shot, where they actually landed on the moon, it was based on solid science.
We understood gravity; we understood aerodynamics. We knew how to build rockets.
The science risk was under control. It was still a great, great feat of engineering.
But in medicine, we don't necessarily have all the laws.
Do we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity, that are analogous to aerodynamics?
I would argue that with technologies like the kinds I'm talking about today, maybe we can actually derive those.
We can map the patterns that occur in living systems, and figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us.
You know, my wife and I have two young kids, and one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them than it currently is for us.
And my hope is, if we can turn biology and medicine from these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck, and make them things that we win by skill and hard work, then that would be a great advance.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Imagine you're walking through a forest.
I'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees, what we foresters call a stand, with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns.
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests, but a forest is much more than what you see, and today I want to change the way you think about forests.
You see, underground there is this other world, a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.
It might remind you of a sort of intelligence.
How do I know this? Here's my story. I grew up in the forests of British Columbia.
I used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns. They were giants. My grandfather was a giant, too.
He was a horse logger, and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
Grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods, and how my family was knit into it.
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.
He and I had this curiosity about forests, and my first big "aha" moment was at the outhouse by our lake.
Our poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit.
So grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog.
He was down there, swimming in the muck.
But as grandpa dug through that forest floor, I became fascinated with the roots, and under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons.
Eventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog, but it was at that moment that I realized that that palette of roots and soil was really the foundation of the forest.
And I wanted to know more.
So I studied forestry.
But soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people in charge of the commercial harvest.
The extent of the clear-cutting was alarming, and I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it.
Not only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs was astounding.
It seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine.
So I went back to school, and I studied my other world.
You see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro that one pine seedling root could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root.
But this was in the laboratory, and I wondered, could this happen in real forests? I thought yes. Trees in real forests might also share information below ground.
But this was really controversial, and some people thought I was crazy, and I had a really hard time getting research funding.
But I persevered, and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest, 25 years ago.
I grew 80 replicates of three species: paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar.
I figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web, but not the cedar.
It was in its own other world.
And I gathered my apparatus, and I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap.
So I went to Canadian Tire --
(Laughter)
and I bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth, a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.
And then I borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university: a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, a mass spectrometer, microscopes.
And then I got some really dangerous stuff: syringes full of radioactive carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
But I was legally permitted.
(Laughter)
Oh, and I forgot some stuff, important stuff: the bug spray, the bear spray, the filters for my respirator. Oh well.
The first day of the experiment, we got out to our plot and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off.
And I had no bear spray.
But you know, this is how forest research in Canada goes.
(Laughter)
So I came back the next day, and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.
So this time, we really got started, and I pulled on my white paper suit, I put on my respirator, and then I put the plastic bags over my trees.
I got my giant syringes, and I injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases, first the birch.
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas, into the bag of birch.
And then for fir, I injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
I used two isotopes, because I was wondering whether there was two-way communication going on between these species.
I got to the final bag, the 80th replicate, and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again.
And she started to chase me, and I had my syringes above my head, and I was swatting the mosquitos, and I jumped into the truck, and I thought, "This is why people do lab studies."
(Laughter)
I waited an hour. I figured it would take this long for the trees to suck up the CO2 through photosynthesis, turn it into sugars, send it down into their roots, and maybe, I hypothesized, shuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors.
After the hour was up, I rolled down my window, and I checked for mama grizzly.
Oh good, she's over there eating her huckleberries.
So I got out of the truck and I got to work.
I went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off.
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves. Kkhh! Perfect. The birch had taken up the radioactive gas.
Then the moment of truth.
I went over to the fir tree.
I pulled off its bag.
Kkhh! I ran the Geiger counter up its needles, and I heard the most beautiful sound. It was the sound of birch talking to fir, and birch was saying, "Hey, can I help you?" And fir was saying, "Yeah, can you send me some of your carbon?
Because somebody threw a shade cloth over me." I went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves, and as I suspected, silence.
Cedar was in its own world.
It was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir.
I was so excited, I ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates.
The evidence was clear.
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation.
It turns out at that time of the year, in the summer, that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch, especially when the fir was shaded.
And then in later experiments, we found the opposite, that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir, and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless.
So it turns out the two species were interdependent, like yin and yang.
And at that moment, everything came into focus for me.
I knew I had found something big, something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests, from not just competitors but to cooperators.
And I had found solid evidence of this massive belowground communications network, the other world.
Now, I truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we practice forestry, from clear-cutting and herbiciding to more holistic and sustainable methods, methods that were less expensive and more practical. What was I thinking? I'll come back to that.
So how do we do science in complex systems like forests?
Well, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests, and that's really tough, as I've shown you.
And we have to be really good at running from bears.
But mostly, we have to persevere in spite of all the stuff stacked against us.
And we have to follow our intuition and our experiences and ask really good questions.
And then we've got to gather our data and then go verify.
For me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest.
Some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old. You can check them out. That's how forest science works.
So now I want to talk about the science.
How were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating?
Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones -- information.
And you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved.
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root." You see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest.
They're the mushrooms.
The mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg, because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium, and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants.
And where the fungal cells interact with the root cells, there's a trade of carbon for nutrients, and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle.
The web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single footstep.
And not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest, individuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir, and it works kind of like the Internet.
You see, like all networks, mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.
We made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest.
In this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes, and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links.
The biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes.
We call those hub trees, or more fondly, mother trees, because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young, the ones growing in the understory.
And if you can see those yellow dots, those are the young seedlings that have established within the network of the old mother trees.
In a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees.
And using our isotope tracers, we have found that mother trees will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network to the understory seedlings, and we've associated this with increased seedling survival by four times.
Now, we know we all favor our own children, and I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin, like mama grizzly and her cub?
So we set about an experiment, and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings.
And it turns out they do recognize their kin.
Mother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
They send them more carbon below ground.
They even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids.
When mother trees are injured or dying, they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings.
So we've used isotope tracing to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network and into her neighboring seedlings, not only carbon but also defense signals.
And these two compounds have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses. So trees talk.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Through back and forth conversations, they increase the resilience of the whole community.
It probably reminds you of our own social communities, and our families, well, at least some families.
(Laughter)
So let's come back to the initial point. Forests aren't simply collections of trees, they're complex systems with hubs and networks that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate, and they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation, and this makes the forest resilient. That's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks.
But they're also vulnerable, vulnerable not only to natural disturbances like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high-grade logging and clear-cut logging.
You see, you can take out one or two hub trees, but there comes a tipping point, because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane. You can take out one or two and the plane still flies, but you take out one too many, or maybe that one holding on the wings, and the whole system collapses.
So now how are you thinking about forests? Differently?
(Audience) Yes.
Cool. I'm glad.
So, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research, my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry.
Well, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada.
This is about 100 kilometers to the west of us, just on the border of Banff National Park.
That's a lot of clear-cuts.
It's not so pristine.
In 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide, and I bet you thought it was Brazil.
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.
Now, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable.
Now, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles, degrade wildlife habitat, and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere, which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks.
Not only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches.
These simplified forests lack complexity, and they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs.
And as climate changes, this is creating a perfect storm for extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that just swept across North America, or that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta.
So I want to come back to my final question: instead of weakening our forests, how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?
Well, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self-heal.
In our recent experiments, we found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes that these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly.
So with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions.
And we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on.
First, we all need to get out in the forest.
We need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests.
You see, most of our forests now are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach, but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions.
Second, we need to save our old-growth forests.
These are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.
So this means less cutting.
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.
And third, when we do cut, we need to save the legacies, the mother trees and networks, and the wood, the genes, so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road.
We need to be conservationists.
And finally, fourthly and finally, we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration.
We have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self-heal.
And we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees competing with each other, they're supercooperators.
So back to Jigs. Jigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world, and it changed my view of forests.
I hope today to have changed how you think about forests.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The narrative of a rising Africa is being challenged.
About 10 years ago, I spoke about an Africa, an Africa of hope and opportunity, an Africa of entrepreneurs, an Africa very different from the Africa that you normally hear about of death, poverty and disease.
And that what I spoke about, became part of what is known now as the narrative of the rising Africa.
I want to tell you two stories about this rising Africa.
The first has to do with Rwanda, a country that has gone through many trials and tribulations.
And Rwanda has decided to become the technology hub, or a technology hub on the continent.
It's a country with mountainous and hilly terrain, a little bit like here, so it's very difficult to deliver services to people.
So what has Rwanda said?
In order to save lives, it's going to try using drones to deliver lifesaving drugs, vaccines and blood to people in hard-to-reach places in partnership with a company called Zipline, with UPS, and also with the Gavi, a global vaccine alliance.
In doing this, it will save lives.
This is part of the type of innovation we want to see in the rising Africa.
The second story has to do with something that I'm sure most of you have seen or will remember.
Very often, countries in Africa suffer drought and floods, and it's getting more frequent because of climate change effects.
When this happens, they normally wait for international appeals to raise money.
You see pictures of children with flies on their faces, carcasses of dead animals and so on. Now these countries, 32 countries, came together under the auspices of the African Union and decided to form an organization called the African Risk Capacity.
What does it do?
It's a weather-based insurance agency, and what these countries do is to pay insurance each year, about 3 million dollars a year of their own resources, so that in the event they have a difficult drought situation or flood, this money will be paid out to them, which they can then use to take care of their populations, instead of waiting for aid to come.
The African Risk Capacity last year paid 26 million dollars to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.
This enabled them to take care of 1.3 million people affected by drought.
They were able to restore livelihoods, buy fodder for cattle, feed children in school and in short keep the populations home instead of migrating out of the area.
So these are the kinds of stories of an Africa ready to take responsibility for itself, and to look for solutions for its own problems.
But that narrative is being challenged now because the continent has not been doing well in the last two years.
It had been growing at five percent per annum for the last one and a half decades, but this year's forecast was three percent. Why? In an uncertain global environment, commodity prices have fallen.
Many of the economies are still commodity driven, and therefore their performance has slipped.
And now the issue of Brexit doesn't make it any easier.
I never knew that the Brexit could happen and that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty such as we have.
So now we've got this situation, and I think it's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the African countries did right?
What did they do wrong?
How do we build on all of this and learn lessons so that we can keep Africa rising?
So let me talk about six things that I think we did right.
The first is managing our economies better.
The '80s and '90s were the lost decades, when Africa was not doing well, and some of you will remember an "Economist" cover that said, "The Lost Continent." But in the 2000s, policymakers learned that they needed to manage the macroeconomic environment better, to ensure stability, keep inflation low in single digits, keep their fiscal deficits low, below three percent of GDP, give investors, both domestic and foreign, some stability so they'll have confidence to invest in these economies.
So that was number one.
Two, debt. In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio of African countries was 130 percent, and they didn't have fiscal space.
They couldn't use their resources to invest in their development because they were paying debt.
There may be some of you in this room who worked to support African countries to get debt relief.
So private creditors, multilaterals and bilaterals came together and decided to do the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and give debt relief.
So this debt relief in 2005 made the debt-to-GDP ratio fall down to about 30 percent, and there was enough resources to try and reinvest.
The third thing was loss -making enterprises.
Governments were involved in business which they had no business being in.
And they were running businesses, they were making losses.
So some of these enterprises were restructured, commercialized, privatized or closed, and they became less of a burden on government.
The fourth thing was a very interesting thing.
The telecoms revolution came, and African countries jumped on it.
In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.
Today, we have about 687 million mobile lines on the continent.
And this has enabled us to go, move forward with some mobile technology where Africa is actually leading.
In Kenya, the development of mobile money -- M-Pesa, which all of you have heard about -- it took some time for the world to notice that Africa was ahead in this particular technology. And this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy.
You know, people who can now pay for solar the same way they pay for cards for their telephone.
So this was a very good development, something that went right.
We also invested more in education and health, not enough, but there were some improvements.
250 million children were immunized in the last one and a half decades.
The other thing was that conflicts decreased.
There were many conflicts on the continent.
Many of you are aware of that.
But they came down, and our leaders even managed to dampen some coups.
New types of conflicts have emerged, and I'll refer to those later.
So based on all this, there's also some differentiation on the continent that I want you to know about, because even as the doom and gloom is here, there are some countries — Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Senegal are performing relatively well at the moment.
But what did we do wrong?
Let me mention eight things.
You have to have more things wrong than right.
(Laughter)
So there are eight things we did wrong.
The first was that even though we grew, we didn't create enough jobs.
We didn't create jobs for our youth.
Youth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent, and underemployment is a serious problem.
The second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough.
Even those jobs we created were low-productivity jobs, so we moved people from low-productivity agriculture to low-productivity commerce and working in the informal sector in the urban areas.
The third thing is that inequality increased.
So we created more billionaires.
50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars own more wealth than the bottom 75 million people on the continent.
Poverty, the proportion of people in poverty -- that's the fourth thing -- did decrease, but the absolute numbers did not because of population growth.
And population growth is something that we don't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent.
And I think we will need to get a handle on it, particularly how we educate girls.
That is the road to really working on this particular issue.
The fifth thing is that we didn't invest enough in infrastructure.
We had investment from the Chinese.
That helped some countries, but it's not enough.
The consumption of electricity in Africa on the continent in Sub-Saharan Africa is equivalent to Spain.
The total consumption is equivalent to that of Spain.
So many people are living in the dark, and as the President of the African Development Bank said recently, Africa cannot develop in the dark.
The other thing we have not done is that our economies retain the same structure that we've had for decades.
So even though we've been growing, the structure of the economies has not changed very much.
We are still exporting commodities, and exporting commodities is what?
It's exporting jobs.
Our manufacturing value-added is only 11 percent.
We are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth, and trade among ourselves is low.
Only about 12 percent of our trade is among ourselves.
So that's another serious problem.
Then governance. Governance is a serious issue.
We have weak institutions, and sometimes nonexistent institutions, and I think this gives way for corruption.
Corruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on, and we have to fight tooth and nail, that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies and the way we manage our finances.
We also need to be wary of new conflicts, new types of conflicts, such as we have with Boko Haram in my country, Nigeria, and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.
We need to partner with international partners, developed countries, to fight this together.
Otherwise, we create a new reality which is not the type we want for a rising Africa.
And finally, the issue of education.
Our education systems in many countries are broken.
We are not creating the types of skills needed for the future.
So we have to find a way to educate better.
So those are the things that we are not doing right.
Now, where do we go from there?
I believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success.
Very often, when people succeed or countries succeed, they forget what made them succeed.
Learning what you're successful at, managing it and keeping it is vital for us.
So all those things I said we did right, we have to learn to do it right again, keep doing it right.
Managing the economy while creating stability is vital, getting prices right, and policy consistency.
Very often, we are not consistent.
One regime goes out, another comes in and they throw away even the functioning policies that were there before.
What does this do?
It creates uncertainty for people, for households, uncertainties for business.
They don't know whether and how to invest.
Debt: we must manage the success we had in reducing our debt, but now countries are back to borrowing again, and we see our debt-to-GDP ratio beginning to creep up, and in certain countries, debt is becoming a problem, so we have to avoid that. So managing success.
The next thing is focusing with a laser beam on those things we did not do well.
First and foremost is infrastructure.
Yes, most countries now recognize they have to invest in this, and they are trying to do the best they can to do that. We must. The most important thing is power.
You cannot develop in the dark.
And then governance and corruption: we have to fight.
We have to make our countries transparent.
And above all, we have to engage our young people.
We have genius in our young people.
I see it every day.
It's what makes me wake up in the morning and feel ready to go.
We have to unleash the genius of our young people, get out of their way, support them to create and innovate and lead the way.
And I know that they will lead us in the right direction.
And our women, and our girls: we have to recognize that girls and women are a gift.
They have strength, and we have to unleash that strength so that they can contribute to the continent.
I strongly believe that when we do all of these things, we find that the rising Africa narrative is not a fluke.
It's a trend.
It's a trend, and if we continue, if we unleash our youth, if we unleash our women, we may step backwards sometimes, we may even step sideways, but the trend is clear.
Africa will continue to rise.
And I tell you businesspeople in the audience, investment in Africa is not for today, is not for tomorrow, it's not a short-term thing, it's a longer term thing.
But if you are not invested in Africa, then you will be missing one of the most important emerging opportunities in the world.
Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned corruption in your talk, and you're known, well-known as a strong anticorruption fighter.
But that's had consequences.
People have fought back, and your mother was kidnapped.
How have you been handling this?
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: It's been very difficult.
Thank you for mentioning the issue of the kidnap of my mother.
It's a very difficult subject.
But what it means is that when you fight corruption, when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money, they don't just keep quiet.
They fight back, and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you, do you give up, or do you fight on?
Do you find a way to stay on and fight back?
And the answer that I had with the teams I worked with is we have to fight on.
We have to create those institutions.
We have to find ways to stop these people from taking away the heritage of the future.
And so that's what we did.
And even out of government, we continued to make that point.
In our countries, nobody, nobody is going to fight corruption for us but us.
And therefore, that comes with consequences, and we just have to do the best we can.
But I thank you and thank TED for giving us a voice to say to those people, you will not win, and we will not be intimidated.
Thank you.
June 29, 2016.
My dear fellow citizen:
I write to you today, to you who have lost in this era.
At this moment in our common life, when the world is full of breaking and spite and fear,
I address this letter simply to you, even though we both know there are many of you behind this "you," and many of me behind this "I."
I write to you because at present, this quaking world we share scares me.
I gather it scares you, too.
Some of what we fear, I suspect, we fear in common.
But much of what we fear seems to be each other.
You fear the world I want to live in, and I fear your visions in turn.
Do you know that feeling you get when you know it's going to storm before it storms?
Do you also feel that now, fellow citizen?
That malaise and worry that some who know feel reminds them of the 1930s?
Perhaps you don't, because our fears of each other are not in sync.
In this round, I sense that your fears of me, of the world that I have insisted is right for us both, has gathered over a generation.
It took time for your fears to trigger my fears, not least because at first, I never thought I needed to fear you.
I heard you but did not listen, all these years when you said that this amazing new world wasn't amazing for you, for many of you, across the industrialized world; that the open, liquid world I relished, of people and goods and technologies flowing freely, going where they pleased, globally, was not, for you, an emancipation.
I have walked through your towns and, while looking, failed to see.
I did notice in Stephenville, Texas, that the town square was dominated by one lawyer's office after another, because of all the people rotating in and out of the prison.
I did notice the barren shops in Wagner, South Dakota, and the VFW gathering hall that stood in mockery of a community's dream to endure.
I did notice at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart, that far too many people in their 20s and 30s looked a decade or two from death, with patchy, flared-up skin and thinning, stringy hair and browning, ground-down teeth and a lostness in their eyes.
I did notice that the young people I encountered in Paris, in Florence, in Barcelona, had degrees but no place to take them, living on internships well into their 30s, their lives prevented from launching, because of an economy that creates wealth — just not jobs.
I did notice the news about those parts of London becoming ghost quarters, where the global super-rich turn fishy money into empty apartments and price lifelong residents of a city, young couples starting out, out of their own home.
And I heard that the fabric of your life was tearing.
You used to be able to count on work, and now you couldn't.
and now you couldn't. You used to be able to nourish your children, and guarantee that they would climb a little bit further in life than you had,
You used to be made to feel dignity in your work, and now you didn't.
It used to be normal for people like you to own a home, and now it wasn't.
I cannot say I didn't know these things, but I was distracted creating a future in which we could live on Mars, even as you struggled down here on Earth.
I was distracted innovating immortality, even as many of you began to live shorter lives than your parents had.
I heard all of these things, but I didn't listen.
I looked but didn't see.
I read, didn't understand.
I paid attention only when you began to vote and shout, and when your voting and shouting, when the substance of it, began to threaten me.
I listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions and electing vulgar demagogues.
Only then did your pain become of interest to me.
I know that feeling hurt is often prologue to dealing hurt.
I wonder now if you would be less eager to deal it if I had stood with you when you merely felt it.
I ask myself why I didn't stand with you then.
One reason is that I became entranced by the gurus of change, became a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty's sake, and of globalization and open borders and kaleidoscopic diversity.
Once change became my totalizing faith, I could be blind.
I could fail to see change's consequences.
I could overlook the importance of roots, traditions, rituals, stability -- and belonging.
And the more fundamentalist I became in my worship of change and openness, the more I drove you towards the other polarity, to cling, to freeze, to close, to belong.
I now see as I didn't before that not having the right skin or right organ is not the only varietal of disadvantage.
There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage in having those privileged traits and yet feeling history to be moving away from you; that while the past was hospitable to people like you, the future will be more hospitable to others; that the world is growing less familiar, less yours day by day.
I will not concede for a moment that old privileges should not dwindle.
They cannot dwindle fast enough.
It is for you to learn to live in a new century in which there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs.
If and when your anger turns to hate, please know that there is no space for that in our shared home.
But I will admit, fellow citizen, that I have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status.
I have forgotten that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling.
A similar thing happened with the economy that you and I share.
Just as I cannot and don't wish to turn back to the clock on equality and diversity, and yet must understand the sense of loss they can inspire, so, too, I refuse and could not if I wished turn back the clock on an ever more closely knit, interdependent world, and on inventions that won't stop being invented.
And yet I must understand your experience of these things.
You have for years been telling me that your experience of these things is not as good as my theories forecast.
Yet before you could finish a complaining sentence about the difficulty of living with erratic hours, volatile pay, vanishing opportunities, about the pain of dropping your children off at 24-hour day care to make your 3am shift, I shot back at you -- before you could finish your sentence -- my dogma, about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility and freedom.
Language is one of the only things that we truly share, and I sometimes used this joint inheritance to obfuscate and deflect and justify myself; to re-brand what was good for me as something appearing good for us both, when I threw around terms like "the sharing economy," and "disruption" and "global resourcing."
I see now that what I was really doing, at times, was buying your pain on the cheap, sprucing it up and trying to sell it back to you as freedom.
I have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe that the system that has been good to me, that has made my life ever more seamless, is also the best system for you.
I have condescended to you with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests -- voting against your interests, as if I know your interests.
That is just my dogmatic economism talking.
I have a weakness for treating people's economic interests as their only interest, ignoring things like belonging and pride and the desire to send a message to those who ignore you.
So here we are, in a scary but not inexplicable moment of demagoguery, fracture, xenophobia, resentment and fear.
And I worry for us both if we continue down this road, me not listening, you feeling unheard, you shouting to get me to listen.
I worry when each of us is seduced by visions of the future that have no place for the other.
If this goes on, if this goes on, there may be blood.
There are already hints of this blood in newspapers every day. There may be roundups, raids, deportations, camps, secessions.
And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.
There may be even talk of war in places that were certain they were done with it.
There is always the hope of redemption.
But it will not be a cheap, shallow redemption that comes through blather about us all being in it together.
This will take more.
It will take accepting that we both made choices to be here.
We create our "others." As parents, as neighbors, as citizens, we witness and sometimes ignore each other into being.
You were not born vengeful.
I have some role in whatever thirst you now feel for revenge, and that thirst now tempts me to plot ever more elaborate escapes from our common life, from the schools and neighborhoods and airports and amusement parks that we used to share.
We face, then, a problem not of these large, impersonal forces.
We face a problem of your and my relations.
We chose ways of relating to each other that got us here.
We can choose ways of relating that get us out.
fellow citizen? But there are things we might have to let go of, starting with our own cherished versions of reality.
Imagine if you let go of fantasies of a society purged of these or those people.
Imagine if I let go of my habit of saving the world behind your back, of deliberating on the future of your work, your food, your schools, in places where you couldn't get past security.
We can do this only if we first accept that we have neglected each other.
If there is hope to summon in this ominous hour, it is this.
We have, for too long, chased various shimmering dreams at the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other, the dream of tending to each other, of unleashing each other's wonders, of moving through history together.
We could dare to commit to the dream of each other as the thing that matters before every neon thing.
Let us dare.
Sincerely yours,
a fellow citizen.
(Applause)
How do we build a society without fossil fuels?
This is a very complex challenge, and I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition.
And I'm aware that this is a contentious statement, but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development.
We can do it differently.
And it's time, it really is time, to debunk the myth that a country has to choose between development on the one hand and environmental protection, renewables, quality of life, on the other.
I come from Costa Rica, a developing country.
We are nearly five million people, and we live right in the middle of the Americas, so it's very easy to remember where we live.
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources, five of them.
(Applause)
Hydropower, geothermal, wind, solar, biomass.
Did you know that last year, for 299 days, we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity?
It's a fantastic achievement, and yet, it hides a paradox, which is that nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil.
Why? Because of our transportation system, which is totally dependent on fossil fuels, like it is in most countries.
So if we think of the energy transition as a marathon, the question is, how do we get to the finish line, how do we decarbonize the rest of the economy?
And it's fair to say that if we don't succeed, it's difficult to see who will.
So that is why I want to talk to you about Costa Rica, because I believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels.
If you know one thing about our country, it's that we don't have an army.
So I'm going to take you back to 1948.
That year, the country was coming out of civil war.
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died, and families were bitterly split.
And yet, a surprising idea won the hearts and minds: we would reboot the country, and that Second Republic would have no army.
So we abolished it.
And the president at the time, José Figueres, found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base.
The following year, 1949, we made that decision permanent in the new constitution, and that is why I can tell you that story nearly 70 years later.
And I'm grateful. I'm grateful they made that decision before I was born, because it allowed me and millions of others to live in a very stable country.
And you might be thinking that it was good luck, but it wasn't.
There was a pattern of deliberate choices.
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given free education and free health care.
We called that social guarantees.
By abolishing the army, we were able to turn military spending into social spending, and that was a driver of stability.
In the '50s --
(Applause)
In the '50s, we started investing in hydropower, and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels for electricity generation, which is what the world is struggling with today.
In the '70s we invested in national parks, and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic of growth, growth, growth at any cost that you see others embracing, especially in the developing world.
In the '90s, we pioneered payments for ecosystem services, and that helped us reverse deforestation and boosted ecotourism, which today is a key engine of growth.
So investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy. Quite the opposite.
And it doesn't mean we are perfect, and it doesn't mean we don't have contradictions.
That's not the point.
The point is that, by making our own choices, we were able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems.
Also, if you take a country like ours, the GDP per capita is around 11,000 dollars, depending on how you measure it.
But according to the Social Progress Index, we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning GDP into social progress.
Abolishing the army, investing in nature and people, did something very powerful, too.
It shaped the narrative, the narrative of a small country with big ideas, and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative.
So the question is, what is the next big idea for this generation?
And I believe what comes next is for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good, just as we did with the army.
Fossil fuels create climate change.
We know that, and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change.
So as a developing country, it is in our best interest to build development without fossil fuels that harm people in the first place.
Because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead?
Remember, this is the country where electricity comes from water in our rivers, heat from volcanoes, wind turbines, solar panels, biowaste.
Abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars, buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy.
And transportation, let me tell you, has become an existential issue for us Costa Ricans, because the model we have is not working for us.
It's hurting people, it's hurting companies, and it's hurting our health.
Because when policies and infrastructure fail, this is what happens on a daily basis.
Two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening.
I don't understand why we have to accept this as normal.
It's offensive to have to waste our time like this every single day.
And this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see in other countries where traffic is exploding.
You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa." Presa means "imprisoned." And people are turning violent in a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida. It's happening. So a lot is at stake.
The good news is that when we talk about clean transportation and different mobility, we're not talking about some distant utopia out there.
We're talking about electric mobility that is happening today.
By 2022, electric cars and conventional cars are expected to cost the same, and cities are already trying electric buses.
And these really cool creatures are saving money, and they reduce pollution.
So if we want to get rid of oil-based transportation, we can, because we have options now that we didn't have before.
It's really exciting. But of course, some get very uncomfortable with this idea, and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil, and so is Costa Rica, so get real.
That's what they tell you.
And you know what the answer to that argument is?
That in 1948, we didn't say the world is stuck with armies, so let's keep our army, too.
No, we made a very brave choice, and that choice made the whole difference.
So it's time for this generation to be brave again and abolish fossil fuels for good.
And I'll give you three reasons why we have to do this.
First, our model of transportation and urbanization is broken, so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future.
We don't want cities that are built for cars. We want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes.
And we want public transportation, lots of it, public transportation that is clean and dignifying.
Because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars, our cities will become unbearable.
Second, we have to change, but incremental change is not going to be sufficient.
We need transformational change.
And there are some incremental projects in my country, and I am the first one to celebrate them.
But let's not kid ourselves.
We're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there while we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure, more cars, more roads, more oil.
We're talking about breaking free from oil, and you cannot get there through incrementalism.
Third, and you know this one, the world is hungry for inspiration.
It craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues, especially in developing countries.
in order to generate all our electricity? So I believe Costa Rica can be an inspiration to others, as we did last year when we disclosed that for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels
The news went viral around the world.
Also, and this makes me extremely proud, a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres, played a decisive role in the negotiations of the Paris climate agreement.
So we have to protect that legacy and be an example.
So what comes next? The people. How do we get people to own this?
How do we get people to believe that it's possible to build a society without fossil fuels?
A lot of work from the ground up is needed.
That is why, in 2014, we created Costa Rica Limpia. "Limpia" means "clean," because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens.
If citizens don't get engaged, clean transportation decisions will be bogged down by endless, and I mean endless, technical discussions, and by avalanches of lobbying by various established interests.
Wanting to be a green country powered by renewables is already part of our story.
We should not let anybody take that away from us.
Last year, we brought people from our seven provinces to talk about climate change in terms that matter to them, and we also brought this year another group of Costa Ricans to talk about renewable energy.
And you know what?
These people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air.
It brings people together.
And the key to real participation is to help people not to feel small.
People feel powerless, and they are tired of not being heard.
So what we do is concrete things, and we translate technical issues into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together.
For the first time, we're tracking the promises that were made on clean transportation, and politicos know that they have to deliver it, but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions -- citizens, companies, champions of public transportation -- that will make electric mobility the new normal, especially in a developing country.
By the time the next election comes, I believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels.
Because this question has to enter our mainstream politics.
And I'm telling you, this is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda.
It's about the country that we want and the cities that we have and the cities that we want and who makes that choice.
Because at the end of the day, what we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people, for Costa Ricans that are alive today and especially for those who haven't been born.
This is our National Museum today. It's bright and peaceful, and when you stand up in front of it, it's really hard to believe these were military barracks at the end of the '40s.
We started a new life without an army in this place, and here is where our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day.
And we will make history again.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Guys, we have an issue.
(Laughter)
Growth is fading away, and it's a big deal.
Our global economy stops growing.
And it's not new.
Growth has actually declined for the last 50 years.
If we continue like this, we need to learn how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade.
This is scary because when the economy doesn't grow, our children don't get better lives.
What's even scarier is that when the pie does not grow, each of us get a smaller piece. We're then ready to fight for a bigger one.
This creates tensions and serious conflicts.
Growth matters a lot.
If we look at the history of growth, times of big growth have always been fueled by big manufacturing revolutions.
It happened three times, every 50-60 years.
The steam engine in the middle of the 19th century, the mass-production model in the beginning of the 20th century -- thanks, Mr. Ford.
And the first automation wave in the 1970s.
Why did these manufacturing revolutions create huge growth in our economies?
Because they have injected huge productivity improvement.
It's rather simple: in order to grow, you need to be producing more, putting more into our economy.
This means either more labor or more capital or more productivity.
Each time, productivity has been the growth lever.
I'm here today to tell you that we are on the verge of another huge change, and that this change, surprisingly enough, is going to come from manufacturing, again. It will get us out of our growth slump and it will change radically the way globalization has been shaped over the last decade.
I'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution that is currently underway.
It's not as if we've done nothing with manufacturing since the last revolution.
Actually, we've made some pretty lame attempts to try to revitalize it.
But none of them have been the big overhaul we really need to get us growing again.
For example, we've tried to relocate our factories offshore in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor.
Not only did this not inspire productivity, but it only saved money for a short period of time, because cheap labor didn't stay cheap for long.
Then, we've tried to make our factories larger and we specialized them by product.
The idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand.
This did help productivity for a while.
But it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain.
Let's take fashion retail.
Traditional clothing companies have built offshore, global, rigid supply chains.
When fast-fashion competitors like Zara started replenishing their stocks faster from two collections a year to one collection a month, none of them have been able to keep up with the pace.
Most of them are in great difficulties today.
Yet, with all of their shortcomings, those are the factories we know today.
When you open the doors, they look the same as they did 50 years ago.
We've just changed the location, the size, the way they operate.
Can you name anything else that looks the same as it did 50 years ago? It's crazy. We've made all the tweaks to the model that we could, and now we hit its limits.
After all of our attempts to fix the manufacturing model failed, we thought growth could come from elsewhere.
We turned to the tech sector -- there's been quite a lot of innovations there.
Just to name one: the Internet.
We hoped it could produce growth.
And indeed, it changed our lives.
It made big waves in the media, the service, the entertainment spaces.
But it hasn't done much for productivity.
Actually, what's surprising is that productivity is on the decline despite all of those innovation efforts.
Imagine that -- sitting at work, scrolling through Facebook, watching videos on YouTube has made us less productive. Weird.
(Laughter)
This is why we are not growing.
We failed at reinventing the manufacturing space, and large technological innovations have played away from it.
But what if we could combine those forces?
What if the existing manufacturing and large technological innovation came together to create the next big manufacturing reinvention.
Bingo! This is the fourth manufacturing revolution, and it's happening right now.
Major technologies are entering the manufacturing space, big time. They will boost industrial productivity by more than a third.
This is massive, and it will do a lot in creating growth.
Let me tell you about some of them.
Have you already met advanced manufacturing robots?
They are the size of humans, they actually collaborate with them, and they can be programmed in order to perform complex, non-repetitive tasks.
Today in our factories, only 8 percent of the tasks are automated.
The less complex, the more repetitive ones.
It will be 25 percent in 10 years.
It means that by 2025, advanced robots will complement workers to be, together, 20 percent more productive, to manufacture 20 percent more outputs, to achieve 20 percent additional growth.
This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.
These robots are working for us right now.
Last year in the US, they helped Amazon prepare and ship all the products required for Cyber Monday, the annual peak of online retail.
Last year in the US, it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history.
Consumers spent 3 billion dollars on electronics that day.
That's real economic growth.
Then there's additive manufacturing, 3D printing.
3D printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it's now making its way through metal.
Those are not small industries.
Plastic and metals represent 25 percent of global manufacturing production.
Let's take a real example. In the aerospace industry, fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture, for one reason: they are made up of 20 different parts that need to be separately produced and then painstakingly assembled.
Aerospace companies are now using 3D printing, which allows them to turn those 20 different parts into just one. The results? 40 percent more productivity, 40 percent more output produced, 40 percent more growth for this specific industry.
But actually, the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity.
It's about producing better, smarter products.
It's about scale customization.
Imagine a world where you can buy the exact products you want with the functionalities you need, with the design you want, with the same cost and lead time as a product that's been mass produced, like your car, or your clothes or your cell phone.
The new manufacturing revolution makes it possible.
Advanced robots can be programmed in order to perform any product configuration without any setup time or ramp up.
3D printers instantaneously produce any customized design.
We are now able to produce a batch of one product, your product, at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many.
Those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play.
Not only will manufacturing become more productive, it will also become more flexible, and those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing.
But actually, there are even some bigger implications for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back into the limelight.
It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.
First, our factories will be relocated into our home markets.
In the world of scale customization, consumer proximity is the new norm.
Then, our factories will be smaller, agile.
Scale does not matter anymore, flexibility does.
They will be operating on a multi-product, made-to-order basis.
The change will be drastic.
Globalization will enter a new era.
The East-to-West trade flows will be replaced by regional trade flows.
East for East, West for West.
When you think about that, the old model was pretty much insane.
Piling up stocks, making products travel the whole world before they reach their end consumers.
The new model, producing just next to the consumer market, will be much cleaner, much better for our environment.
In mature economies, manufacturing will be back home, creating more employment, more productivity and more growth.
Good news, isn't it?
But here's the thing with growth -- it does not come automatically.
Mature economies will have to seize it.
We'll have to massively re-train our workforce.
In most countries, like in my country, France, we've told our children that manufacturing had no future.
That it was something happening far away.
We need to reverse that and teach manufacturing again at university.
Only the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth.
It's also a chance for developing economies.
Of course China and other emerging economies won't be the factory of the world anymore.
Actually, it was not a sustainable model in the long term, as those countries are becoming richer.
Last year, it was already as expensive to produce in Brazil as to produce in France.
By 2018, manufacturing costs in China will be on par with the US.
The new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition of those emerging economies towards a model driven by domestic consumption.
And this is good, because this is where growth will be created.
In the next five years, the next billion consumers in China will inject more growth in our economies than the top five European markets together.
This fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us.
If we play it right, we'll see sustainable growth in all of our economies.
This means more wealth distributed to all of us and a better future for our children.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a palliative care physician and I would like to talk to you today about health care.
I'd like to talk to you about the health and care of the most vulnerable population in our country -- those people dealing with the most complex serious health issues.
I'd like to talk to you about economics as well.
And the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you -- it scares the hell out of me.
I'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine: a paradigm of care for this population, grounded in what they value. Patient-centric care based on their values that helps this population live better and longer.
It's a care model that tells the truth and engages one-on-one and meets people where they're at.
I'd like to start by telling the story of my very first patient.
It was my first day as a physician, with the long white coat ... I stumbled into the hospital and right away there's a gentleman, Harold, 68 years old, came to the emergency department.
He had had headaches for about six weeks that got worse and worse and worse and worse.
Evaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain.
The attending physician directed me to go share with Harold and his family the diagnosis, the prognosis and options of care.
Five hours into my new career, I did the only thing I knew how.
I walked in, sat down, took Harold's hand, took his wife's hand and just breathed.
He said, "It's not good news is it, sonny?"
I said, "No."
And so we talked and we listened and we shared.
And after a while I said, "Harold, what is it that has meaning to you?
What is it that you hold sacred?"
And he said, "My family."
I said, "What do you want to do?"
He slapped me on the knee and said, "I want to go fishing."
I said, "That, I know how to do."
Harold went fishing the next day.
He died a week later.
As I've gone through my training in my career, I think back to Harold.
And I think that this is a conversation that happens far too infrequently.
And it's a conversation that had led us to crisis, to the biggest threat to the American way of life today, which is health care expenditures.
So what do we know?
We know that this population, the most ill, takes up 15 percent of the gross domestic product -- nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.
So the sickest 15 percent take up 15 percent of the GDP.
If we extrapolate this out over the next two decades with the growth of baby boomers, at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.
Sixty percent of the gross domestic product of the United States of America — it has very little to do with health care at that point.
It has to do with a gallon of milk, with college tuition.
It has to do with every thing that we value and every thing that we know presently.
It has at stake the free-market economy and capitalism of the United States of America.
Let's forget all the statistics for a minute, forget the numbers.
Let's talk about the value we get for all these dollars we spend.
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas, about six years ago, looked at every dollar spent by Medicare -- generally this population.
We found that those patients who have the highest per capita expenditures had the highest suffering, pain, depression.
And, more often than not, they die sooner.
How can this be? We live in the United States, it has the greatest health care system on the planet.
We spend 10 times more on these patients than the second-leading country in the world.
That doesn't make sense.
But what we know is, out of the top 50 countries on the planet with organized health care systems, we rank 37th.
Former Eastern Bloc countries and sub-Saharan African countries rank higher than us as far as quality and value.
Something I experience every day in my practice, and I'm sure, something many of you on your own journeys have experienced: more is not more.
Those individuals who had more tests, more bells, more whistles, more chemotherapy, more surgery, more whatever -- the more that we do to someone, it decreases the quality of their life.
And it shortens it, most often.
So what are we going to do about this?
What are we doing about this?
And why is this so?
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen, is that we, the health care industry -- long white-coat physicians -- are stealing from you.
Stealing from you the opportunity to choose how you want to live your lives in the context of whatever disease it is.
We focus on disease and pathology and surgery and pharmacology. We miss the human being.
How can we treat this without understanding this?
We do things to this; we need to do things for this.
The triple aim of healthcare: one, improve patient experience. Two, improve the population health. Three, decrease per capita expenditure across a continuum.
Our group, palliative care, in 2012, working with the sickest of the sick -- cancer, heart disease, lung disease, renal disease, dementia -- how did we improve patient experience?
"I want to be at home, Doc."
"OK, we'll bring the care to you."
Quality of life, enhanced.
Think about the human being.
Two: population health. How did we look at this population differently, and engage with them at a different level, a deeper level, and connect to a broader sense of the human condition than my own?
How do we manage this group, so that of our outpatient population, 94 percent, in 2012, never had to go to the hospital?
Not because they couldn't.
But they didn't have to.
We brought the care to them.
We maintained their value, their quality.
Number three: per capita expenditures.
For this population, that today is 2.3 trillion dollars and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP, we reduced health care expenditures by nearly 70 percent.
They got more of what they wanted based on their values, lived better and are living longer, for two-thirds less money.
While Harold's time was limited, palliative care's is not.
Palliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis through the end of life. The hours, weeks, months, years, across a continuum -- with treatment, without treatment.
Meet Christine. Stage III cervical cancer, so, metastatic cancer that started in her cervix, spread throughout her body.
She's in her 50s and she is living.
This is not about end of life, this is about life.
This is not just about the elderly, this is about people.
This is Richard. End-stage lung disease.
"Richard, what is it that you hold sacred?"
"My kids, my wife and my Harley."
(Laughter)
"Alright! I can't drive you around on it because I can barely pedal a bicycle, but let's see what we can do."
Richard came to me, and he was in rough shape.
He had this little voice telling him that maybe his time was weeks to months.
And then we just talked. And I listened and tried to hear -- big difference.
Use these in proportion to this.
I said, "Alright, let's take it one day at a time," like we do in every other chapter of our life. And we have met Richard where Richard's at day-to-day.
And it's a phone call or two a week, but he's thriving in the context of end-stage lung disease.
Now, palliative medicine is not just for the elderly, it is not just for the middle-aged.
It is for everyone.
Meet my friend Jonathan. We have the honor and pleasure of Jonathan and his father joining us here today.
Jonathan is in his 20s, and I met him several years ago. He was dealing with metastatic testicular cancer, spread to his brain.
He had a stroke, he had brain surgery, radiation, chemotherapy.
Upon meeting him and his family, he was a couple of weeks away from a bone marrow transplant, and in listening and engaging, they said, "Help us understand -- what is cancer?"
How did we get this far without understanding what we're dealing with?
How did we get this far without empowering somebody to know what it is they're dealing with, and then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings to know if that is what we should do?
Lord knows we can do any kind of thing to you. But should we?
And don't take my word for it.
All the evidence that is related to palliative care these days demonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer.
There was a seminal article out of the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010.
A study done at Harvard by friends of mine, colleagues.
End-stage lung cancer: one group with palliative care, a similar group without.
The group with palliative care reported less pain, less depression.
They needed fewer hospitalizations.
And, ladies and gentlemen, they lived three to six months longer.
If palliative care were a cancer drug, every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it.
Why don't they?
Again, because we goofy, long white-coat physicians are trained and of the mantra of dealing with this, not with this.
This is a space that we will all come to at some point.
But this conversation today is not about dying, it is about living.
Living based on our values, what we find sacred and how we want to write the chapters of our lives, whether it's the last or the last five.
What we know, what we have proven, is that this conversation needs to happen today -- not next week, not next year.
What is at stake is our lives today and the lives of us as we get older and the lives of our children and our grandchildren.
Not just in that hospital room or on the couch at home, but everywhere we go and everything we see.
Palliative medicine is the answer to engage with human beings, to change the journey that we will all face, and change it for the better.
To my colleagues, to my patients, to my government, to all human beings, I ask that we stand and we shout and we demand the best care possible, so that we can live better today and ensure a better life tomorrow.
We need to shift today so that we can live tomorrow.
Thank you very much.

In July of 1911, a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp with his team.
After climbing a steep hill and wiping the sweat from his brow, he described what he saw beneath him.
He saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage this incredible interlocking maze of structures built of granite, beautifully put together.
What's amazing about this project is that it was the first funded by National Geographic, and it graced the front cover of its magazine in 1912.
This professor used state-of-the-art photography equipment to record the site, forever changing the face of exploration.
The site was Machu Picchu, discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.
When he saw the site, he asked, "This is an impossible dream.
What could it be?"
So today, 100 years later, I invite you all on an incredible journey with me, a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.
(Cheers)
We will do nothing less than use state-of-the-art technology to map an entire country.
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham, but we are expanding it to the world, making archaeological exploration more open, inclusive, and at a scale simply not previously possible.
This is why I am so excited to share with you all today that we will begin the 2016 TED Prize platform in Latin America, more specifically Peru.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We will be taking Hiram Bing ham's impossible dream and turning it into an amazing future that we can all share in together.
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.
It has absolutely stunning jewelry, like what you can see here.
It has amazing Moche pottery of human figures.
It has the Nazca Lines and amazing textiles.
So as part of the TED Prize platform, we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations, first of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery.
They're going to be helping us build out this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have.
Maybe some of you used it with the MH370 crash and search for the airplane.
Of course, they'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery.
National Geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration.
As well, they'll be providing us with rich content for the platform, including some of the archival imagery like you saw at the beginning of this talk and some of their documentary footage.
We've already begun to build and plan the platform, and I'm just so excited.
So here's the cool part. My team, headed up by Chase Childs, is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery.
Of course, what you can see here is 0.3-meter data. This is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru.
It dates to 850 AD. It's a really amazing city, but let's zoom in.
This is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see.
You can see individual structures, individual buildings.
And we've already begun to find previously unknown sites.
What we can say already is that as part of the platform, you will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites, like this one here, and this potentially large one here.
Unfortunately, we've also begun to uncover large-scale looting at sites, like what you see here.
So many sites in Peru are threatened, but the great part is that all of this data is going to be shared with archaeologists on the front lines of protecting these sites.
So I was just in Peru, meeting with their Minister of Culture as well as UNESCO.
We'll be collaborating closely with them.
Just so you all know, the site is going to be in both English and Spanish, which is absolutely essential to make sure that people in Peru and across Latin America can participate.
Our main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here, Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo, professor at Catholic University.
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist and former vice-minister, Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists so they can explore these sites on the ground.
He also runs this amazing drone mapping program, some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here.
And this data will be incorporated into the platform, and also he'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find.
Our on-the-ground partner who will be helping us with education, outreach, as well as site preservation components, is the Sustainable Preservation Initiative, led by Dr. Larry Coben. Some of you may not be aware that some of the world's poorest communities coexist with some of the world's most well-known archaeological sites.
What SPI does is it helps to empower these communities, in particular women, with new economic approaches and business training.
So it helps to teach them to create beautiful handicrafts which are then sold on to tourists.
This empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage and take ownership of it.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with 24 of these women at a well-known archaeological site called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.
These women were unbelievably inspiring, and what's great is that SPI will help us transform communities near some of the sites that you help to discover.
Peru is just the beginning.
We're going to be expanding this platform to the world, but already I've gotten thousands of emails from people all across the world -- professors, educators, students, and other archaeologists -- who are so excited to help participate.
In fact, they're already suggesting amazing places for us to help discover, including Atlantis.
I don't know if we're going to be looking for Atlantis, but you never know.
So I'm just so excited to launch this platform.
It's going to be launched formally by the end of the year.
And I have to say, if what my team has already discovered in the past few weeks are any indication, what the world discovers is just going to be beyond imagination.
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
There's a big question at the center of life in our democracies today: How do we fight terror without destroying democracies, without trampling human rights?
I've spent much of my career working with journalists, with bloggers, with activists, with human rights researchers all around the world, and I've come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down on protecting and defending human rights, freedom of the press and a free and open internet, radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist.
I actually want to drill down on this a little bit. So, one of the countries that has been on the frontlines of this issue is Tunisia, which was the only country to come out of the Arab Spring with a successful democratic revolution.
Five years later, they're struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant ISIS recruitment.
And many Tunisians are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari has summed up the situation with this character who says, "I don't give a damn about human rights.
I don't give a damn about the revolution.
I don't give a damn about democracy and liberty.
I just want to be safe." "Satisfied?" asked his jailer. "You're safe now."
If the Tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in this place, they will be a model not only for their region, but for all of us.
The reality is that civil society, journalists and activists are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand, and, in many countries, also from their own governments.
We're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed, charged and intimidated by their own governments, many of which are allies with the West in the war on terror. Just three examples. A friend and former colleague of mine, Hisham Almiraat, has been charged with threatening state security, along with six other activists in Morocco.
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi has been jailed and flogged for insulting Islam and criticizing the Saudi regime on his blog.
More recently, the Turkish representative for Reporters Without Borders, Erol Önderoglu, has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda, because he and some other activists have been supporting Kurdish media.
Anti-terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities and for peaceful debate; this needs to be supported by a robust, independent local media.
But while that's not really happening, Washington is teaming up with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood to pour millions — hundreds of millions of dollars — into what's called "counter-messaging," a fancy word for propaganda.
To counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet, in Europe, Internet Referral Units are being set up, so that people can report on extremist content that they find and get it censored.
The problem is, that all of this propaganda, monitoring and censorship completely fails to make up for the fact that the people who are the most credible voices, who can present credible ideas and alternative solutions to real economic, social and political problems in their community that are causing people to turn to extremism in the first place, are being silenced by their own governments.
This is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world.
Freedom House, the human rights organization, reports that 2015 marks the 10th straight year in a row of decline in freedom worldwide.
And this is not just because of the actions of authoritarian governments. It's also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down on dissenters, whistle-blowers and investigative journalists.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has warned that "preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand-in-hand." It's not to say that governments shouldn't keep us safe -- of course they should -- but we need public oversight, transparency and accountability to the rule of law.
Meanwhile, extremists are literally killing off civil society in some countries.
Since 2013 in Bangladesh, over a dozen secular bloggers and community activists have been literally slaughtered by extremists while the government has done very little.
From the city of Raqqa in Syria, people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf have been assassinated for their reporting out of ISIS-controlled territory.
The citizen media group called Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently relies on strong encryption to send out their reports and shield themselves from interception and surveillance.
Yet authorities in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption, because the bad guys are using it, too.
We have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption.
Otherwise, dissent and investigative journalism are going to become even more difficult in even more places.
And the bad guys -- the criminals and terrorists -- are still going to find ways to communicate.
Kudos to the companies that are standing up for their users' right to use encryption.
But when it comes to censorship, the picture is much more troubling.
Yes, there's a real problem of extremist content spreading all over the internet.
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and deactivating accounts that are connected to the extremist's speech.
The problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box, and there is collateral damage.
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi, an activist who makes fun of ISIS on Twitter.
He had his account deactivated, because he shares a surname with a prominent ISIS leader.
Last December, a number of women named Isis, which also happens to be the name of an Egyptian goddess, had their accounts deactivated.
And this woman, who lives in the United States and is a computer programmer, reported on Twitter about her deactivation on Facebook, managed to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated.
But that's the thing — she had to get media attention.
And journalists aren't immune.
David Thomson, an expert on terrorism and reporter for Radio France International, had reports deleted from his Facebook account and had his account deactivated for several days, because they contained pictures of ISIS flags, even though he was just reporting on ISIS, not promoting it.
And then we have stories from people like this Egyptian man, Ahmed Abdellahy, who reported recently in an event in Washington DC that some of his arguments with extremists -- he now spends his time on social media arguing with ISIS followers, trying to get them to turn away -- some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted, which he believes has the effect of shielding them from alternative points of view.
It's unclear whether Facebook even knows the extent of the collateral damage, or the other companies as well.
But we do know that journalism, activism and public debate are being silenced in the effort to stamp out extremist speech.
So with these companies having so much power over the public discourse, they need to be held accountable.
They need to carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems that we're clearly seeing.
They need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms, and they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanisms, so people can get their content reinstated.
Now, I've been talking for the last 10 minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these.
This is a picture of members of the citizen media network, Global Voices, that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.
Interestingly, about 5 years ago, right after the Arab Spring, the data scientist Gilad Lotan created a network map of the people in Global Voices who were heavy users of Twitter during the Arab Spring.
And he found that many of these people served as key information nodes between activists and journalists throughout the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution.
We've got to make sure that these people not only survive, but are able to continue to thrive.
Many of them are still active, other than the ones who have gone to jail or have been driven into hiding or exile.
All around the world, people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression are linking up in their communities and across borders.
We've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies to do a better job of protecting their rights.
We've also got to be more mindful about how our own personal, political, consumer and business choices affect people like these around the world.
Also, if you follow the news, it's pretty clear that that alone isn't going to be enough.
We've got to take personal responsibility by joining — or at very least, actively supporting — the growing ecosystem of individuals and groups who are fighting for social justice, environmental sustainability, government accountability, human rights, freedom of the press and a free and open internet, all around the world.
I believe that, ultimately, we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism, demagoguery and hate.
But... we've got to do this by really beefing up the global networks of citizens around the world, powered by people who are working hard every day, and taking personal risk for a future world that is more peaceful, just, open and free.
(Applause) Thanks very much for listening.
I once had this nightmare: I'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines.
In real life, I love to hike, but every time I want to go on a hike, it makes me nervous.
I have this thought in the back of my mind that I might lose a limb.
This underlying fear started 10 years ago, after I met Mohammed, a cluster bomb survivor of the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.
Mohammed, like so many other survivors all around the world, had to live through the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions on a daily basis.
When the one-month conflict started in Lebanon, I was still working at Agence France-Presse in Paris.
I remember how I was glued to the screens, anxiously following the news.
I wanted to reassure myself that the falling bombs missed my parents' home.
When I arrived in Beirut on assignment to cover that war, I was relieved to be united with my family, after they had finally managed to escape southern Lebanon.
The day the war was over, I remember seeing this image -- one of blocked roads, of displaced people eagerly rushing south, back to their homes, regardless of what they would find.
An estimated four million cluster submunitions were spread in Lebanon during the 34-day conflict.
Mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict.
The fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents' home made it easier to follow him through the years.
It was now almost 10 years since we first met.
I saw the young boy who had to endure physical and emotional trauma.
I saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends tattoos, in return for a set fee of five dollars.
And I know the young, jobless man who spends hours surfing the Internet trying to meet a girl who might become his girlfriend.
His fate and the effects of losing his legs are now his daily reality.
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed have to deal with so many details that never occur to us.
Who would have imagined that so many daily tasks we do or take for granted, such as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor, would become sources of stress and anxiety?
Well, that's what eventually became of Mohammed, due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.
Ten years ago, I had no clue what a cluster bomb was, nor its horrifying implications.
I learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used in so many parts of the world and continues to kill on a regular basis, without distinguishing between a military target or a child.
I naively asked myself, "But seriously, who made those weapons?
And what for?"
Let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is. It's a large canister filled with bomblets.
When it's dropped from the air, it opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets.
They scatter around wide areas and on impact, many fail to explode.
Those unexploded ones end up just like landmines -- sitting on the ground, waiting for their next target.
If someone steps on them by accident or picks them up, they can explode.
These weapons are extremely unpredictable, which makes the threat even bigger.
One day, a farmer can work his land without a problem.
The next day, he can make fire and burn some branches, and the submunitions close by could be set off because of the heat.
The problem is children mistake those bomblets for toys, because they can look like bouncy balls or soda cans.
Being a documentary photographer, I decided to go back to Lebanon a few months after the conflict ended to meet cluster bomb survivors.
And I met a few -- Hussein and Rasha, who both lost a leg to submunitions.
Their stories are similar to so many other kids' stories across the world and are a testimony to the horrifying implications of the continuous use of such weapons.
That's when I met Mohammed, in January 2007.
He was 11 years old, and I met him exactly four months after his accident.
When I first saw him, he was going through painful physiotherapy to recover from his fresh wounds.
Still in shock at such a young age, Mohammed was struggling to get used to his new body.
He would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.
What drew me closer to his story was my instant realization of the difficulties Mohammed was likely to face in the future -- that what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury at the age of 11, would increase manyfold.
Even before his disability, Mohammed's life wasn't easy.
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp for Palestinian refugees, and this is where he still lives.
Lebanon holds some 400,000 Palestinian refugees, and they suffer from discriminatory laws.
They're not allowed to work in the public sector or practice certain professions and are denied the right to own property.
This is one of the reasons why Mohammed doesn't really regret dropping out of school right after his injury.
He said, "What's the point of a university degree when I can't find a job to start with?"
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle of impact on communities, and not only the lives of their victims.
Many who get injured by this weapon drop out of school, can't find jobs or even lose their jobs, therefore losing the ability to provide for their families.
This is not to mention the continuous physical pain and the experience of feeling isolated.
These weapons affect the poorest of the poor.
The high medical cost is a burden to the families.
They end up relying on humanitarian agencies, which is insufficient and unsustainable, especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured.
Ten years after Mohammed's injury, he is still unable to afford proper prosthetic legs.
He's very cautious with his steps, as a couple of falls over the years brought him embarrassment among his friends.
He joked that since he doesn't have legs, some days he tries to walk on his hands.
One of the worst yet invisible impacts of the weapon is the psychological scars it leaves.
In one of Mohammed's early medical reports, he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.
He suffered from anxiety, poor appetite, sleep disturbance and showed signs of anger.
The reality is Mohammed never received proper help to fully recover.
His current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost -- even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards Europe today through the Mediterranean.
Knowing how risky such a journey would be, he said, "If I were to die on the way, it doesn't matter." To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.
Cluster bombs are a world problem, as this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities for generations to come.
In an online interview with the director of the Mines Advisory Group, Jamie Franklin, he said, "The US forces dropped over two million tons of munitions over Laos.
If they couldn't find their targets in Vietnam, there were free-drop areas in Laos where planes would drop their loads before going back to base, because it's dangerous to land with loaded planes." According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, in Laos alone -- one of the poorest countries in the world -- nine to 27 million unexploded submunitions remain.
Some 11,000 people have been killed or injured since 1973.
This lethal weapon has been used by over 20 states during armed conflicts in over 35 countries, such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.
So far, 119 states have joined an international treaty banning cluster bombs, which is officially called the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
But some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions -- namely, the United States, Russia and China -- remain outside of this lifesaving treaty and continue to produce them, reserve the right to produce them in the future, keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles and even possibly use them in the future.
Cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
According to research on the worldwide investments in cluster munitions producers by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO, financial institutions invested billions of US dollars into companies that make cluster munitions.
The majority of these institutions are based in countries that have not yet signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
Getting back to Mohammed, one of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons.
When I ask him if it's safe to work in the field he said, "I'm not sure." Research shows that cluster munitions often contaminate areas where agriculture is the main source of income.
According to Handicap International's research, 98 percent of those killed or injured by cluster munitions are civilians.
Eighty-four percent of casualties are males.
In countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields, they simply do it and risk it.
Mohammed is the only male to three sisters.
Culturally, he's expected to provide for his family, but he simply can't.
He tried to have so many different jobs, but he couldn't keep any due to his physical disability and the less-than-friendly environment to people with disabilities, to say the least.
It hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a job, and he's turned away with a small amount of money paid to him out of pity.
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money, I just want to earn it."
Mohammed today is 21 years old.
He's illiterate, and he communicates with voice messages.
Here is one of his messages. (Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)
Laura Boushnak: He said, "My dream is to run, and I'm pretty sure once I start running, I would never stop."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.
You live on a small farm in the Philippines.
Your animals are your family's sole source of income -- as long as they're healthy. You know that any day, one of your pigs can catch the flu, the swine flu.
Living in tight quarters, one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing, until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm.
If it's a bad enough virus, the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye.
If you called in a veterinarian, he or she would visit your farm and take samples from your pigs' noses and mouths.
But then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab.
Two weeks later, you'd hear back the results.
Two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
Today, farmers can take those samples themselves.
They can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs' noses and mouths with a little filter paper, place that little filter paper in a tiny tube, and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their pigs' noses and mouths.
And without leaving their farms, they take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox, program it to detect DNA or RNA from the swine flu virus, and within one hour get back the results, visualize the results.
This reality is possible because today we're living in the era of personal DNA technology.
Every one of us can actually test DNA ourselves.
DNA is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions that help build the living world. Humans have DNA. Pigs have DNA. Even bacteria and some viruses have DNA too.
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA inform how our bodies develop, grow, function.
And in many cases, that same information can trigger disease.
Your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule, the DNA double helix, that has over three billion letters, beginning to end.
But the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short -- a few dozen to several thousand letters long.
So when we're looking to answer a question based on DNA, we actually don't need to read all those three billion letters, typically.
That would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover, pausing at every line, just to find the nearest pizza joint.
(Laughter)
Luckily, three decades ago, humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information.
These DNA machines are wonderful.
They can find any line in DNA.
But once they find it, that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded by so much other DNA, that what these machines then do is copy the target gene, and one copy piles on top of another, millions and millions and millions of copies, until that gene stands out against the rest; until we can visualize it, interpret it, read it, understand it, until we can answer: Does my pig have the flu?
Or other questions buried in our own DNA: Am I at risk of cancer?
Am I of Irish descent?
Is that child my son?
(Laughter)
This ability to make copies of DNA, as simple as it sounds, has transformed our world.
Scientists use it every day to detect and address disease, to create innovative medicines, to modify foods, to assess whether our food is safe to eat or whether it's contaminated with deadly bacteria.
Even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on DNA evidence.
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.
But for 30 years, the power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower, or bigwig PhD scientist work.
Well, several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer, like you.
I cofounded one of these companies.
Three years ago, together with a fellow biologist and friend of mine, Zeke Alvarez Saavedra, we decided to make personal DNA machines that anyone could use.
Our goal was to bring DNA science to more people in new places.
We started working in our basements.
We had a simple question: What could the world look like if everyone could analyze DNA? We were curious, as curious as you would have been if I had shown you this picture in 1980.
(Laughter)
You would have thought, "Wow!
I can now call my Aunt Glenda from the car and wish her a happy birthday.
I can call anyone, anytime.
This is the future!" Little did you know, you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations for you and Aunt Glenda to celebrate together.
With another tap, you'd be ordering her gift. And yet one more tap, and you'd be "liking" Auntie Glenda on Facebook.
(Laughter) And all of this, while sitting on the toilet. It is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us.
And the same is true for personal DNA technology today.
For example, I could never have imagined that a truffle farmer, of all people, would use personal DNA machines.
Dr. Paul Thomas grows truffles for a living.
We see him pictured here, holding the first UK-cultivated truffle in his hands, on one of his farms.
Truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees.
And it's a rare fungus.
Some species may fetch 3,000, 7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.
I learned from Paul that the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high.
When he sources new truffles to grow on his farms, he's exposed to the threat of knockoffs -- truffles that look and feel like the real thing, but they're of lower quality.
But even to a trained eye like Paul's, even when looked at under a microscope, these truffles can pass for authentic.
So in order to grow the highest quality truffles, the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over, Paul has to use DNA analysis.
Isn't that mind-blowing?
I bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again without thinking of its genes.
(Laughter)
But personal DNA machines can also save human lives.
Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist at the University of Cambridge.
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.
When the Ebola outbreak broke out in Western Africa, he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease.
Results could take up to a week to come back -- that's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering.
Ian decided to move his lab into Makeni, Sierra Leone.
Here we see Ian Goodfellow moving over 10 tons of equipment into a pop-up tent that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within 24 hours.
But here's a surprise: the same equipment that Ian could use at his lab in the UK to sequence and diagnose Ebola, just wouldn't work under these conditions. We're talking 35 Celsius heat and over 90 percent humidity here.
But instead, Ian could use personal DNA machines small enough to be placed in front of the air-conditioning unit to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives.
This may seem like an extreme place for DNA analysis, but let's move on to an even more extreme environment: outer space. Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.
When astronauts live aboard the International Space Station, they're orbiting the planet 250 miles high.
They're traveling at 17,000 miles per hour.
Picture that -- you're seeing 15 sunsets and sunrises every day.
You're also living in microgravity, floating. And under these conditions, our bodies can do funky things.
One of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed, making astronauts more prone to infection.
A 16-year-old girl, a high school student from New York, Anna-Sophia Boguraev, wondered whether changes to the DNA of astronauts could be related to this immune suppression, and through a science competition called "Genes In Space," Anna-Sophia designed an experiment to test this hypothesis using a personal DNA machine aboard the International Space Station.
Here we see Anna-Sophia on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral, watching her experiment launch to the International Space Station.
That cloud of smoke is the rocket that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment to the International Space Station, where, three days later, astronaut Tim Peake carried out her experiment -- in microgravity.
Personal DNA machines are now aboard the International Space Station, where they can help monitor living conditions and protect the lives of astronauts.
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity, the mark of a child genius.
Well, to me, it signals something bigger: that DNA technology is finally within the reach of every one of you.
A few years ago, a college student armed with a personal computer could code an app, an app that is now a social network with more than one billion users.
Could we be moving into a world of one personal DNA machine in every home?
I know families who are already living in this reality.
The Daniels family, for example, set up a DNA lab in the basement of their suburban Chicago home.
This is not a family made of PhD scientists.
This is a family like any other.
They just like to spend time together doing fun, creative things.
By day, Brian is an executive at a private equity firm.
At night and on weekends, he experiments with DNA alongside his kids, ages seven and nine, as a way to explore the living world.
Last time I called them, they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden.
They were testing tomatoes that they had picked, taking the flesh of their skin, putting it in a test tube, mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA and then using their home DNA copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits.
For the Daniels family, the personal DNA machine is like the chemistry set for the 21st century.
(Laughter) Most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks or doing at-home paternity testing.
But we've definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually get hands-on with DNA in your kitchen.
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA and extract meaningful information from it.
And it's at times like this that profound transformation is bound to happen; moments when a transformative, powerful technology that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower, finally becomes within the reach of every one of us, from farmers to schoolchildren.
Think about the moment when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords, or when computers left the mainframe and entered your home or your office.
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution may be hard to predict, but one thing is certain: revolutions don't go backwards, and DNA technology is already spreading faster than our imagination.
So if you're curious, get up close and personal with DNA -- today.
It is in our DNA to be curious.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
As a lover of human anatomy, I'm so excited that we're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus.
Through practices such as preventive medicine, patient empowerment and self-monitoring -- down to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day.
All of this works to promote a healthy connection between ourselves and our bodies.
Despite all this focus on the healthy self, general public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking.
Many people don't know the location of their vital organs, or even how they function.
And that's because human anatomy is a difficult and time-intensive subject to learn.
How many of you here made it through anatomy?
Wow, good -- most of you are in medicine.
I, like you, spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures.
Something no student of anatomy could do without the help of visuals.
Because at the end of the day, whether you remember every little structure or not, these medical illustrations are what makes studying anatomy so intriguing.
In looking at them, we're actually viewing a manual of our very selves.
But what happens when we're done studying?
These beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook, or an app, referenced only when needed.
And for the public, medical illustrations may only be encountered passively on the walls of a doctor's office.
From the beginnings of modern medicine, medical illustration, and therefore anatomy, have existed primarily within the realm of medical education.
Yet there's something fascinating happening right now.
Artists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world and are thrusting it into the public space.
For the past nine years, I have been cataloguing and sharing this rise in anatomical art with the public -- all from my perspective as a medical illustrator.
But before I get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today, it's important to understand how art influenced anatomy in the past.
Now, anatomy is by its very nature a visual science, and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the Renaissance.
They relied on artists to help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public.
And this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations.
Anatomy was caught in a struggle between science, art and culture that lasted for over 500 years.
Artists rendered dissected cadavers as alive, posed in these humorous anatomical stripteases.
Imagine seeing that in your textbooks today.
They also showed them as very much dead -- unwillingly stripped of their skin.
Disembodied limbs were often posed in literal still lives.
And some illustrations even included pop culture references.
This is Clara, a famous rhinoceros that was traveling Europe in the mid-1700s, at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity.
Including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.
The introduction of color then brought a whole new depth and clarity to anatomy that made it stunning.
By the early 20th century, the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators.
They created a universal representation of anatomy -- something that was neither alive nor dead, that was free from those influences of artistic culture.
And this focus on no-frills accuracy was precisely for the benefit of medical education.
And this is what we get to study from today.
But why is it that medical illustration — both past and present — captures our imaginations?
Now, we are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body.
And medical illustration is still art. Nothing can elicit an emotional response — from joy to complete disgust — more than the human body.
And today, artists armed with that emotion, are grasping anatomy from the medical world, and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways.
A perfect example of this is Spanish contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.
He takes 19th century anatomical illustrations of the male body and envelops them in a female sensuality.
The women in his paintings taunt us to view beyond their surface anatomy, thereby introducing a strong femininity that was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation.
Artistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body.
This is an X-ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle in a roller-skating accident.
As a tribute to her trauma, she commissioned Montreal-based architect Federico Carbajal to construct a wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg.
Now, notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture.
These are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle.
It's medical hardware that's been repurposed as art.
People often ask me how I choose the art that I showcase online or feature in gallery shows.
And for me it's a balance between the technique and a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself, which is why the work of Michael Reedy struck me.
His serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor.
For instance, take a look at her face.
Notice those red marks.
Michael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition as these maniacal cartoon monsters annoying and out of control in the background.
On the mirrored figure, he renders the full anatomy and covers it in glitter, making it look like candy.
By doing this, Michael downplays the common perception of anatomy so closely tied to just disease and death.
Now, this next concept might not make much sense, but human anatomy is no longer limited to humans.
When you were a child, did you ever wish that your toys could come to life?
Well, Jason Freeny makes those dreams come true with his magical toy dissections.
(Laughter)
One might think that this would bring a morbid edge to one's innocent childhood characters, but Jason says of his dissections, "One thing I've never seen in a child's reaction to my work is fear." It's always wonder, amazement and wanting to explore.
Fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction.
This anatomization also extends to politically and socially charged objects.
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War," we see a gun dissected to reveal human organs.
But if you look closely, you'll notice that it lacks a brain.
And if you keep looking, you might also notice that Noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum at the business end of that gun barrel.
Now, this next artist I've been following for many years, watching him excite the public about anatomy.
Danny Quirk is a young artist who paints his subjects in the process of self-dissection.
He bends the rules of medical illustration by inserting a very dramatic light and shadow.
And this creates a 3-D illusion that lends itself very well to painting directly on the human skin.
Danny makes it look as if a person's skin has actually been removed.
And this effect — also cool and tattoo-like — easily transitions into a medical illustration.
Now Danny is currently traveling the world, teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings, which is why it was so shocking to find out that he was rejected from medical illustration programs.
But he's doing just fine.
Then there are artists who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world and are placing it directly on the streets.
London-based SHOK-1 paints giant X-rays of pop culture icons.
His X-rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own, and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person.
You come to admire his work because reproducing X-rays by hand, let alone with spray paint, is extremely difficult.
But then again this is a street artist, who also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry.
Nychos, an Austrian street artist, takes the term "exploded view" to a whole new level, splattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world.
Influenced by comics and heavy metal, Nychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy that I just love.
Street artists believe that art belongs to the public.
And this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world.
It forces you to look at it, and confront your own perceptions about anatomy, whether you find it beautiful, gross, morbid or awe-inspiring, like I do.
That it elicits these responses at all is due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it.
All of the artists that I showed you here today referenced medical illustrations for their art. But for them, anatomy isn't just something to memorize, but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level; to depict it in ways that we can relate, whether it be through cartoons, body painting or street art.
Anatomical art has the power to reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook, to ignite an excitement in the public, and reinvigorate an enthusiasm in the medical world, ultimately connecting our innermost selves with our bodies through art.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I spend most of my time thinking about little girls, which is kind of a weird thing for a grown man in our society to say. But I do. I spend most of my time thinking about little girls, and I think it's primarily because I have one.
This one's mine, and I think you would really like her.
She is smart and funny and kind to people and a good friend.
But when I talk about my daughter, the word I find myself saying most is "athlete." My kid's athletic.
She is strong and fast and has great balance and good body control.
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion in Shaolin Kempo.
At nine years old, she is already halfway to a black belt.
My daughter is athletic.
Now, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds stands in front of you and says his daughter is athletic, you might think that's a reflection of him. It is not.
(Laughter)
My wife in high school was a two-time all-state soccer player and a two-time all-state volleyball player, and I played "Dungeons and Dragons." And that is why, although my daughter is an athlete, she's also a huge nerd, which I love.
She walks around our house in a cloak of flames that she made herself.
She sits on the Iron Throne --
(Laughter)
even though she has never seen "Game of Thrones," primarily because we are not the worst parents who ever lived.
But she knows there's someone called the Mother of Dragons, and she calls herself that and she loves it.
She's a huge comic book fan.
Right now, her favorite character is Groot. She loves Groot. She adores The Incredible Hulk.
But my daughter really at heart, her thing is Star Wars.
My kid is a Jedi.
Although some days she's also a Sith, which is a choice that I can respect.
(Laughter)
But here's the question that I have to ask. Why is it that when my daughter dresses up, whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk, whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul, why is every character she dresses up as a boy?
And where are all the female superheroes?
And that is not actually the question, because there's plenty of female superheroes.
My question really is, where is all the female superhero stuff?
Where are the costumes? Where are the toys?
Because every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up, she's learning stuff through a process that, in my own line of work, as a professor of media studies, we refer to as public pedagogy.
That is, it is how societies are taught ideologies.
It's how you learned what it meant to be a man or a woman, what it meant to behave yourself in public, what it meant to be a patriot and have good manners.
It's all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people.
It's, in short, how we learn what we know about other people and about the world.
But we live in a 100-percent media-saturated society.
What that means is that every single aspect of your human existence outside of your basic bodily functions is in some way touched by media.
From the car that you drive to the food that you eat to the clothes that you wear to the way you construct your relationships to the very language you use to formulate thought -- all of that is in some way mediated.
So the answer in our society to how do we learn what we know about other people and about the world is largely through media.
Well, there's a wrinkle in that, in that our society, media don't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices.
They also exist as corporate entities.
And when the distribution of information is tied to financial gain, there's a problem.
How big of a problem?
Well think about this: in 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies.
In any market, 50 companies doing something is a lot of companies.
It's a lot of different worldviews.
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six, six companies. They are NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
These six companies produce nine out of every 10 movies you watch, nine out of every 10 television shows, nine out of every 10 songs, nine out of every 10 books.
So my question to you is, if six companies control 90 percent of American media, how much influence do you think they have over what you're allowed to see every day?
Because in media studies, we spend a lot of time saying that media can't tell us what to think, and they can't; they're terrible at that.
But that's not their job.
Media don't tell us what to think. Media tell us what to think about.
They control the conversation, and in controlling the conversation, they don't have to get you to think what they want you to think.
They'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about, and more importantly, not thinking about things they don't want you to think about.
They control the conversation,
How does this work in practice? Let's just take one of those companies. We'll do an easy one.
Let's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second.
The reason why I always pick the Walt Disney Company is this.
Is there a single person in this room who has never seen a Disney movie? Look around. Exactly. I picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration in our society.
Every single person has been exposed to Disney, so it's an easy one for me to use.
Since 1937, Disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls.
It's made a huge chunk of its money.
Unless, of course, the princess your daughter is interested in, as my daughter is, is this one.
See, in 2012, Disney purchased LucasFilm for the sum of four billion dollars, and immediately they flooded the Disney stores with Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and Yoda and not Princess Leia. Why? Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses.
So Disney did not put Princess Leia merchandise in the store, and when people went to Disney and said, "Hey, where's all the Princess Leia stuff?" Disney said, "We have no intention of putting Princess Leia merchandise in the store." And fans were angry and they took to Twitter with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.
And Disney said, "Wait, that's not what we meant.
What we meant was, we don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will." And that was in 2012, and it is 2015, and if you go to the Disney Store, as I recently have, and look for Princess Leia merchandise, do you know how many Princess Leia items there are in the Disney Store?
Zero, because Disney has no intention of putting Princess Leia in the store.
And we shouldn't be surprised because we found out that was their policy when they bought Marvel in 2009 for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
Because when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls, you also kind of want to make money from boys.
And so what better to sell boys than superheroes?
So now Disney had access to Captain America and to Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and they had access even to a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of.
That's how good Marvel was at selling superheroes.
Last year, they released a film called "Guardians of the Galaxy." It's a film that absolutely should not work.
Nobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me.
One of the characters is a talking tree.
One of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon.
It should not work. And they made a killing off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."
This character here in the middle, her name is Gamora.
She's played by Zoe Saldana, and she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja, and she is played by a beautiful black woman, and my daughter fell in love with her.
So like any good nerd dad, I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff, and when I got to the store, I learned a very interesting thing.
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack, well, Gamora's not on it.
They probably should have marketed this as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
(Laughter)
And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, she wasn't on it, and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt, she wasn't on it.
And as a matter of fact, if I went to the store, as I did, and looked at the display, you would find a small picture of Gamora right here, but if you look at any of the actual merchandise on that shelf, Gamora is not on any of it.
Now, I could have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #WheresGamora, like millions of fans did across the world, but the truth was I wasn't even really that surprised, because I was there when Disney had released "The Avengers." And just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron," and we were very excited, because there was not one but two female superheroes, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.
And we were very excited.
But here's the real thing about this.
Even though Scarlett Johansson, who is one of the most popular actresses in America, plays Black Widow, and Black Widow is the star of not one, not two, but five different Marvel movies, there is not a single piece of Black Widow merchandise available. Not one. And if you go to the Disney store and look for a Black Widow costume, what you will find, is you will find Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.
You will find Iron Man and Thor.
You will even find War Machine, who isn't even really in the movie that long.
Who you will not find is Black Widow.
And I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, as many people did, # WheresNatasha.
But I'm tired of doing that.
I'm tired of having to do that.
All over the country right now, there are kids playing with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set, where Captain America rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet and it's really awesome.
You know how awesome it is?
So awesome that when it happened in the movie, it was Black Widow that did it.
Not only has she been erased, but she has been replaced with a male figure.
And so what is this teaching us?
I mean, over the next five years, Disney and Warner Bros. and a bunch of movie studios are going to release over 30 feature-length films with comic book characters, and of those 30 feature-length films, exactly two of them will have female solo leads. Two. Now, there will be females in the rest of these movies, but they will be sidekicks, they will be love interests, they will be members of teams. They will not be the main character.
And if what we learn, what we know about other people and about the world we learn through media, then these companies are teaching my daughter that even if she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja, all four of which are true of her, it doesn't matter.
She will either be ignored like Gamora or erased and replaced with a boy like Black Widow.
And it's not fair.
It's not fair to her and it's not fair to your sons and daughters either.
But here's the thing: I'm raising a little girl, and she has a little tomboy in her, which by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl.
What that basically is saying is, those traits that define you, they're not really yours, they're just on loan to you for a little while from boys.
But do you know how much grief she's going to take in her life for having a little tomboy in her? Zero. None. People will think it's cute.
They'll call her feisty, because in our society, adding so-called male traits to girls is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.
Mike is a little boy in Florida.
He's 11 years old, and the thing that he loves most in the world is a show called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic," like millions of other children across America.
Now, the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine, but there are millions of boys and grown men who enjoy "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic." They have a club.
They call themselves Bronies, pony bros, guys who like ponies.
I happen to be one of them.
And what are Mike and myself and millions of other boys and men learning in this feminine, sissified world of "My Little Pony?" Well, they're learning to study hard and to work hard and to party hard and to look good and to feel good and to do good, and heaven preserve us from teaching these wussified concepts to boys.
So the other kids in his neighborhood pick on Mike and they beat him up and they make fun of him, and at 11 years old, Mike goes home, finds a belt, wraps it around his neck, and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed.
Because we have developed a society in which you would rather be dead as a boy than thought of as liking stuff for girls.
And that is not Mike's fault. That is our fault.
We have failed him.
We have failed our children.
And we have to do better for them.
We have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes appear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls. We have to stop.
And when I was putting this together, people said to me, "Well, that's never going to happen." And I said, "Oh really?" Because just this year, Target announced that they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles.
They were going to mix it up.
Now, before we break our shoulders patting Target on the back, just this week they released a shirt in which one of the most iconic scenes in "Star Wars: A New Hope" where Princess Leia stands up to the Dark Lord of the Sith, was released on a t-shirt in which she's mysteriously replaced by Luke.
So let's don't pat ourselves on the back too much.
Just this week also, Disney announced it was no longer going to gender its Halloween costumes, which I say, "Thank you, Disney, except the only costumes you make are of male superheroes, so does it matter who you have wearing them?" Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie, announced they're going to release a line of DC superhero girls.
And the funny thing is, they met with girls and asked them what they wanted to see in dolls, and you can see, they have calves and elbows that bend so they can do superhero stuff.
And please buy them.
And don't just buy them for your daughters, buy them for your sons.
Because it's important that boys play with and as female superheroes just as my daughter plays with and as male superheroes.
As a matter of fact, what I would love is a world in which every person who goes to the store goes with a little flowchart in their head of whether or not they should buy this toy for a boy or a girl, and it's a real simple flowchart because it only has one question on it.
It says, "Is this toy operated with your genitals?"
(Laughter)
If the answer is yes, then that is not a toy for children.
(Laughter)
And if the answer is no, then it's for boys and girls.
It's really simple.
Because today is about the future of the future, and in my future, boys and girls are equally respected, equally valued, and most importantly, equally represented.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The technology likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades has arrived.
And it's not social media.
It's not big data.
It's not robotics.
It's not even AI.
You'll be surprised to learn that it's the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin.
It's called the blockchain. Blockchain.
Now, it's not the most sonorous word in the world, but I believe that this is now the next generation of the internet, and that it holds vast promise for every business, every society and for all of you, individually.
You know, for the past few decades, we've had the internet of information.
And when I send you an email or a PowerPoint file or something, I'm actually not sending you the original, I'm sending you a copy.
And that's great.
This is democratized information.
But when it comes to assets -- things like money, financial assets like stocks and bonds, loyalty points, intellectual property, music, art, a vote, carbon credit and other assets -- sending you a copy is a really bad idea.
If I send you 100 dollars, it's really important that I don't still have the money -- (Laughter)
and that I can't send it to you.
This has been called the "double-spend" problem by cryptographers for a long time.
So today, we rely entirely on big intermediaries -- middlemen like banks, government, big social media companies, credit card companies and so on -- to establish trust in our economy.
And these intermediaries perform all the business and transaction logic of every kind of commerce, from authentication, identification of people, through to clearing, settling and record keeping.
And overall, they do a pretty good job.
But there are growing problems.
To begin, they're centralized.
That means they can be hacked, and increasingly are -- JP Morgan, the US Federal Government, LinkedIn, Home Depot and others found that out the hard way.
They exclude billions of people from the global economy, for example, people who don't have enough money to have a bank account.
They slow things down.
It can take a second for an email to go around the world, but it can take days or weeks for money to move through the banking system across a city.
And they take a big piece of the action -- 10 to 20 percent just to send money to another country.
They capture our data, and that means we can't monetize it or use it to better manage our lives.
Our privacy is being undermined.
And the biggest problem is that overall, they've appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically: we have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality.
So what if there were not only an internet of information, what if there were an internet of value -- some kind of vast, global, distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody. And where every kind of asset, from money to music, could be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged and managed, all without powerful intermediaries?
What if there were a native medium for value?
Well, in 2008, the financial industry crashed and, perhaps propitiously, an anonymous person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto created a paper where he developed a protocol for a digital cash that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.
And this cryptocurrency enabled people to establish trust and do transactions without a third party.
And this seemingly simple act set off a spark that ignited the world, that has everyone excited or terrified or otherwise interested in many places.
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin -- Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down, and that should be of interest to you if you're a speculator.
More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.
It's not a fiat currency controlled by a nation-state.
And that's of greater interest.
But the real pony here is the underlying technology.
It's called blockchain.
So for the first time now in human history, people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer.
And trust is established, not by some big institution, but by collaboration, by cryptography and by some clever code.
And because trust is native to the technology, I call this, "The Trust Protocol."
Now, you're probably wondering: How does this thing work? Fair enough. Assets -- digital assets like money to music and everything in between -- are not stored in a central place, but they're distributed across a global ledger, using the highest level of cryptography.
And when a transaction is conducted, it's posted globally, across millions and millions of computers.
And out there, around the world, is a group of people called "miners." These are not young people, they're Bitcoin miners.
They have massive computing power at their fingertips -- 10 to 100 times bigger than all of Google worldwide.
These miners do a lot of work.
And every 10 minutes, kind of like the heartbeat of a network, a block gets created that has all the transactions from the previous 10 minutes.
Then the miners get to work, trying to solve some tough problems.
And they compete: the first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block, is rewarded in digital currency, in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin.
And then -- this is the key part -- that block is linked to the previous block and the previous block to create a chain of blocks.
And every one is time-stamped, kind of like with a digital waxed seal.
So if I wanted to go and hack a block and, say, pay you and you with the same money, I'd have to hack that block, plus all the preceding blocks, the entire history of commerce on that blockchain, not just on one computer but across millions of computers, simultaneously, all using the highest levels of encryption, in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world that's watching me. Tough to do. This is infinitely more secure than the computer systems that we have today. Blockchain. That's how it works.
So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one. There are many. The Ethereum blockchain was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.
He's [22] years old, and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities.
One of them is that you can build smart contracts.
It's kind of what it sounds like.
It's a contract that self-executes, and the contract handles the enforcement, the management, performance and payment -- the contract kind of has a bank account, too, in a sense -- of agreements between people.
And today, on the Ethereum blockchain, there are projects underway to do everything from create a new replacement for the stock market to create a new model of democracy, where politicians are accountable to citizens.
(Applause)
So to understand what a radical change this is going to bring, let's look at one industry, financial services. Recognize this? Rube Goldberg machine. It's a ridiculously complicated machine that does something really simple, like crack an egg or shut a door.
Well, it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry, honestly.
I mean, you tap your card in the corner store, and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies, each with their own computer system, some of them being 1970s mainframes older than many of the people in this room, and three days later, a settlement occurs.
Well, with a blockchain financial industry, there would be no settlement, because the payment and the settlement is the same activity, it's just a change in the ledger.
So Wall Street and all around the world, the financial industry is in a big upheaval about this, wondering, can we be replaced, or how do we embrace this technology for success?
Now, why should you care?
Well, let me describe some applications. Prosperity. The first era of the internet, the internet of information, brought us wealth but not shared prosperity, because social inequality is growing.
And this is at the heart of all of the anger and extremism and protectionism and xenophobia and worse that we're seeing growing in the world today, Brexit being the most recent case.
So could we develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality?
Because the only approach today is to redistribute wealth, tax people and spread it around more.
Could we pre-distribute wealth?
Could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place by democratizing wealth creation, engaging more people in the economy, and then ensuring that they got fair compensation?
Let me describe five ways that this can be done.
Number one: Did you know that 70 percent of the people in the world who have land have a tenuous title to it?
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras, some dictator comes to power, he says, "I know you've got a piece of paper that says you own your farm, but the government computer says my friend owns your farm." This happened on a mass scale in Honduras, and this problem exists everywhere.
Hernando de Soto, the great Latin American economist, says this is the number one issue in the world in terms of economic mobility, more important than having a bank account, because if you don't have a valid title to your land, you can't borrow against it, and you can't plan for the future.
So today, companies are working with governments to put land titles on a blockchain.
And once it's there, this is immutable.
You can't hack it.
This creates the conditions for prosperity for potentially billions of people.
Secondly: a lot of writers talk about Uber and Airbnb and TaskRabbit and Lyft and so on as part of the sharing economy.
This is a very powerful idea, that peers can come together and create and share wealth.
My view is that ... these companies are not really sharing.
In fact, they're successful precisely because they don't share.
They aggregate services together, and they sell them.
What if, rather than Airbnb being a $25 billion corporation, there was a distributed application on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb, and it was essentially owned by all of the people who have a room to rent.
And when someone wants to rent a room, they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria, they sift through, it helps them find the right room, and then the blockchain helps with the contracting, it identifies the party, it handles the payments just through digital payments -- they're built into the system.
And it even handles reputation, because if she rates a room as a five-star room, that room is there, and it's rated, and it's immutable.
So, the big sharing-economy disruptors in Silicon Valley could be disrupted, and this would be good for prosperity.
Number three: the biggest flow of funds from the developed world to the developing world is not corporate investment, and it's not even foreign aid. It's remittances. This is the global diaspora; people have left their ancestral lands, and they're sending money back to their families at home.
This is 600 billion dollars a year, and it's growing, and these people are getting ripped off.
Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.
She lives in Toronto, and every month she goes to the Western Union office with some cash to send her remittances to her mom in Manila.
It costs her around 10 percent; the money takes four to seven days to get there; her mom never knows when it's going to arrive.
It takes five hours out of her week to do this.
Six months ago, Analie Domingo used a blockchain application called Abra.
And from her mobile device, she sent 300 bucks.
It went directly to her mom's mobile device without going through an intermediary.
And then her mom looked at her mobile device -- it's kind of like an Uber interface, there's Abra "tellers" moving around.
She clicks on a teller that's a five-star teller, who's seven minutes away.
The guy shows up at the door, gives her Filipino pesos, she puts them in her wallet.
The whole thing took minutes, and it cost her two percent.
This is a big opportunity for prosperity.
Number four: the most powerful asset of the digital age is data.
And data is really a new asset class, maybe bigger than previous asset classes, like land under the agrarian economy, or an industrial plant, or even money.
And all of you -- we -- create this data.
We create this asset, and we leave this trail of digital crumbs behind us as we go throughout life.
And these crumbs are collected into a mirror image of you, the virtual you.
And the virtual you may know more about you than you do, because you can't remember what you bought a year ago, or said a year ago, or your exact location a year ago.
And the virtual you is not owned by you — that's the big problem.
So today, there are companies working to create an identity in a black box, the virtual you owned by you.
And this black box moves around with you as you travel throughout the world, and it's very, very stingy.
It only gives away the shred of information that's required to do something.
A lot of transactions, the seller doesn't even need to know who you are.
They just need to know that they got paid.
And then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data and enabling you to monetize it.
And this is a wonderful thing, because it can also help us protect our privacy, and privacy is the foundation of a free society.
Let's get this asset that we create back under our control, where we can own our own identity and manage it responsibly.
Finally --
(Applause)
Finally, number five: there are a whole number of creators of content who don't receive fair compensation, because the system for intellectual property is broken.
It was broken by the first era of the internet. Take music. Musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain.
You know, if you were a songwriter, 25 years ago, you wrote a hit song, it got a million singles, you could get royalties of around 45,000 dollars.
Today, you're a songwriter, you write a hit song, it gets a million streams, you don't get 45k, you get 36 dollars, enough to buy a nice pizza.
So Imogen Heap, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, is now putting music on a blockchain ecosystem.
She calls it "Mycelia." And the music has a smart contract surrounding it.
And the music protects her intellectual property rights.
You want to listen to the song?
It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents that flow into a digital account.
You want to put the song in your movie, that's different, and the IP rights are all specified.
You want to make a ringtone? That's different. She describes that the song becomes a business.
It's out there on this platform marketing itself, protecting the rights of the author, and because the song has a payment system in the sense of bank account, all the money flows back to the artist, and they control the industry, rather than these powerful intermediaries.
Now, this is --
(Applause)
This is not just songwriters, it's any creator of content, like art, like inventions, scientific discoveries, journalists.
There are all kinds of people who don't get fair compensation, and with blockchains, they're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain.
And that's a wonderful thing.
So, these are five opportunities out of a dozen to solve one problem, prosperity, which is one of countless problems that blockchains are applicable to.
Now, technology doesn't create prosperity, of course -- people do.
But my case to you is that, once again, the technology genie has escaped from the bottle, and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons at this uncertain time in human history, and it's giving us another kick at the can, another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things, and solve some of the world's most difficult problems, if we will it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There are things we say when we catch the eye of a stranger or a neighbor walking by.
We say, "Hello, how are you?
It's a beautiful day.
How do you feel? "These sound kind of meaningless, right?
And, in some ways, they are.
They have no semantic meaning.
It doesn't matter how you are or what the day is like.
They have something else.
They have social meaning.
What we mean when we say those things is: I see you there.
I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.
I make eye contact, say hello, I offer help, I listen.
I get all kinds of stories.
About seven years ago, I started documenting my experiences to try to figure out why.
What I found was that something really beautiful was going on.
This is almost poetic.
These were really profound experiences.
They were unexpected pleasures.
They were genuine emotional connections.
They were liberating moments.
So one day, I was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change, which, I'm a New Yorker, so that means I was actually standing in the street on the storm drain, as if that could get me across faster.
And there's an old man standing next to me.
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat and sort of an old-man hat, and he looked like somebody from a movie.
And he says to me, "Don't stand there.
You might disappear. "So this is absurd, right?
But I did what he said.
I stepped back onto the sidewalk.
And he smiled, and he said, "Good. You never know. I might have turned around, and zoop, you're gone."
This was weird, and also really wonderful.
He was so warm, and he was so happy that he'd saved me.
We had this little bond.
For a minute, I felt like my existence as a person had been noticed, and I was worth saving.
The really sad thing is, in many parts of the world, we're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default, that we can't trust them, that they might hurt us.
But most strangers aren't dangerous.
We're uneasy around them because we have no context.
We don't know what their intentions are.
So instead of using our perceptions and making choices, we rely on this category of "stranger."
I have a four-year-old. When I say hello to people on the street, she asks me why. She says, "Do we know them?"
I say, "No, they're our neighbor."
"Are they our friend?"
"No, it's just good to be friendly."
I think twice every time I say that to her, because I mean it, but as a woman, particularly, I know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions.
It is good to be friendly, and it's good to learn when not to be, but none of that means we have to be afraid.
There are two huge benefits to using our senses instead of our fears.
The first one is that it liberates us.
When you think about it, using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done.
Categories are something our brains use.
When it comes to people, it's sort of a shortcut for learning about them.
We see male, female, young, old, black, brown, white, stranger, friend, and we use the information in that box.
It's quick, it's easy and it's a road to bias.
And it means we're not thinking about people as individuals.
I know an American researcher who travels frequently in Central Asia and Africa, alone.
She's entering into towns and cities as a complete stranger.
She has no bonds, no connections.
She's a foreigner.
Her survival strategy is this: get one stranger to see you as a real, individual person.
If you can do that, it'll help other people see you that way, too.
The second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy.
I know it sounds a little counterintuitive, intimacy and strangers, but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling that sociologists call "fleeting intimacy." So, it's a brief experience that has emotional resonance and meaning.
It's the good feeling I got from being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man, or how I feel like part of a community when I talk to somebody on my train on the way to work.
Sometimes it goes further. Researchers have found that people often feel more comfortable being honest and open about their inner selves with strangers than they do with their friends and their families -- that they often feel more understood by strangers.
This gets reported in the media with great lament. "Strangers communicate better than spouses!" It's a good headline, right?
I think it entirely misses the point.
The important thing about these studies is just how significant these interactions can be; how this special form of closeness gives us something we need as much as we need our friends and our families.
So how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers?
There are two reasons.
The first one is that it's a quick interaction.
It has no consequences.
It's easy to be honest with someone you're never going to see again, right? That makes sense. The second reason is where it gets more interesting.
We have a bias when it comes to people we're close to.
We expect them to understand us.
We assume they do, and we expect them to read our minds.
So imagine you're at a party, and you can't believe that your friend or your spouse isn't picking up on it that you want to leave early.
And you're thinking, "I gave you the look."
With a stranger, we have to start from scratch.
We tell the whole story, we explain who the people are, how we feel about them; we spell out all the inside jokes. And guess what? Sometimes they do understand us a little better.
OK. So now that we know that talking to strangers matters, how does it work?
There are unwritten rules we tend to follow.
The rules are very different depending on what country you're in, what culture you're in.
In most parts of the US, the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy.
This is known as civil inattention.
So, imagine two people are walking towards each other on the street.
They'll glance at each other from a distance.
That's the civility, the acknowledgment.
And then as they get closer, they'll look away, to give each other some space.
In other cultures, people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all.
People from Denmark tell me that many Danes are so averse to talking to strangers, that they would rather miss their stop on the bus than say "excuse me" to someone that they need to get around.
Instead, there's this elaborate shuffling of bags and using your body to say that you need to get past, instead of using two words.
In Egypt, I'm told, it's rude to ignore a stranger, and there's a remarkable culture of hospitality.
Strangers might ask each other for a sip of water.
Or, if you ask someone for directions, they're very likely to invite you home for coffee.
We see these unwritten rules most clearly when they're broken, or when you're in a new place and you're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is.
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit is where the action is.
In case it's not clear, I really want you to do this. OK? So here's how it's going to go.
Find somebody who is making eye contact.
That's a good signal.
The first thing is a simple smile.
If you're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here, smile. See what happens.
Another is triangulation. There's you, there's a stranger, there's some third thing that you both might see and comment on, like a piece of public art or somebody preaching in the street or somebody wearing funny clothes. Give it a try. Make a comment about that third thing, and see if starts a conversation.
Another is what I call noticing.
This is usually giving a compliment.
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.
I'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now, but shoes are fabulous in general.
And they're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes.
People always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes.
You may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle.
It can be awkward to talk to someone on the street; you don't know how they're going to respond.
But you can always talk to their dog or their baby.
The dog or the baby is a social conduit to the person, and you can tell by how they respond whether they're open to talking more.
The last one I want to challenge you to is disclosure.
This is a very vulnerable thing to do, and it can be very rewarding.
So next time you're talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable, tell them something true about yourself, something really personal.
You might have that experience I talked about of feeling understood.
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up, people ask me, "What does your dad do?" or, "Where does he live?" And sometimes I tell them the whole truth, which is that he died when I was a kid.
Always in those moments, they share their own experiences of loss.
We tend to meet disclosure with disclosure, even with strangers.
So, here it is. When you talk to strangers, you're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life and theirs.
You're making unexpected connections.
If you don't talk to strangers, you're missing out on all of that.
We spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers.
What would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves?
We could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other.
We could make a space for change.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The conventional wisdom about our world today is that this is a time of terrible decline.
And that's not surprising, given the bad news all around us, from ISIS to inequality, political dysfunction, climate change, Brexit, and on and on. But here's the thing, and this may sound a little weird.
Look, it's not that I don't see the problems. I read the same headlines that you do.
What I dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them, namely that we're all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless.
Now, why do I say this? It's not like I'm particularly optimistic by nature.
But something about the media's constant doom-mongering with its fixation on problems and not on answers has always really bugged me.
So a few years ago I decided, well, I'm a journalist, I should see if I can do any better by going around the world and actually asking folks if and how they've tackled their big economic and political challenges.
And what I found astonished me.
It turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there, often in the most unexpected places, and they've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all.
Not only are there theoretical fixes; those fixes have been tried. They've worked. And they offer hope for the rest of us.
I'm going to show you what I mean by telling you about how three of the countries I visited -- Canada, Indonesia and Mexico -- overcame three supposedly impossible problems.
Their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use, and not just for those particular problems, but for many others, too.
When most people think about my homeland, Canada, today, if they think about Canada at all, they think cold, they think boring, they think polite.
They think we say "sorry" too much in our funny accents.
And that's all true.
(Laughter)
Sorry.
(Laughter)
But Canada's also important because of its triumph over a problem currently tearing many other countries apart: immigration.
Consider, Canada today is among the world's most welcoming nations, even compared to other immigration-friendly countries.
Its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than France's, and its percentage of foreign-born residents is double that of Sweden.
Meanwhile, Canada admitted 10 times more Syrian refugees in the last year than did the United States.
(Applause)
And now Canada is taking even more.
And yet, if you ask Canadians what makes them proudest of their country, they rank "multiculturalism," a dirty word in most places, second, ahead of hockey. Hockey.
(Laughter)
In other words, at a time when other countries are now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out, Canadians want even more of them in.
Now, here's the really interesting part.
Canada wasn't always like this.
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy.
They called it "White Canada," and as you can see, they were not just talking about the snow.
So how did that Canada become today's Canada?
Well, despite what my mom in Ontario will tell you, the answer had nothing to do with virtue.
Canadians are not inherently better than anyone else.
The real explanation involves the man who became Canada's leader in 1968, Pierre Trudeau, who is also the father of the current prime minister.
(Applause)
The thing to know about that first Trudeau is that he was very different from Canada's previous leaders.
He was a French speaker in a country long-dominated by its English elite.
He was an intellectual.
He was even kind of groovy.
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.
He hung out with the Beatles.
(Laughter)
And like all hipsters, he could be infuriating at times.
But he nevertheless pulled off one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen.
His formula, I've learned, involved two parts.
First, Canada threw out its old race-based immigration rules, and it replaced them with new color-blind ones that emphasized education, experience and language skills instead.
And what that did was greatly increase the odds that newcomers would contribute to the economy.
Then part two, Trudeau created the world's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration and the idea that diversity was the key to Canada's identity.
Now, in the years that followed, Ottawa kept pushing this message, but at the same time, ordinary Canadians soon started to see the economic, the material benefits of multiculturalism all around them.
And these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open-minded Canada of today.
Let's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem, Islamic extremism.
In 1998, the people of Indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator, Suharto.
It was an amazing moment, but it was also a scary one.
With 250 million people, Indonesia is the largest Muslim-majority country on Earth.
It's also hot, huge and unruly, made up of 17,000 islands, where people speak close to a thousand languages.
Now, Suharto had been a dictator, and a nasty one.
But he'd also been a pretty effective tyrant, and he'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics.
So experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things, the country would explode, or religious extremists would take over and turn Indonesia into a tropical version of Iran.
And that's just what seemed to happen at first.
In the country's first free elections, in 1999, Islamist parties scored 36 percent of the vote, and the islands burned as riots and terror attacks killed thousands.
Since then, however, Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.
While ordinary folks have grown more pious on a personal level -- I saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit than I would have a decade ago -- the country's politics have moved in the opposite direction.
Indonesia is now a pretty decent democracy.
And yet, its Islamist parties have steadily lost support, from a high of about 38 percent in 2004 down to 25 percent in 2014.
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.
And while a few Indonesians have recently joined ISIS, their number is tiny, far fewer in per capita terms than the number of Belgians.
Try to think of one other Muslim-majority country that can say all those same things.
In 2014, I went to Indonesia to ask its current president, a soft-spoken technocrat named Joko Widodo, "Why is Indonesia thriving when so many other Muslim states are dying?"
"Well, what we realized," he told me, "is that to deal with extremism, we needed to deal with inequality first."
See, Indonesia's religious parties, like similar parties elsewhere, had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption.
So that's what Joko and his predecessors did too, thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.
They also cracked down hard on terrorism, but Indonesia's democrats have learned a key lesson from the dark years of dictatorship, namely that repression only creates more extremism.
So they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy.
They used the police instead of the army.
They only detained suspects if they had enough evidence.
They held public trials.
They even sent liberal imams into the jails to persuade the jihadists that terror is un-Islamic.
And all of this paid off in spectacular fashion, creating the kind of country that was unimaginable 20 years ago.
So at this point, my optimism should, I hope, be starting to make a bit more sense.
Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism are impossible to deal with.
Join me now on one last trip, this time to Mexico.
Now, of our three stories, this one probably surprised me the most, since as you all know, the country is still struggling with so many problems.
And yet, a few years ago, Mexico did something that many other countries from France to India to the United States can still only dream of.
It shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years.
To understand how, we need to rewind to the year 2000, when Mexico finally became a democracy.
Rather than use their new freedoms to fight for reform, Mexico's politicians used them to fight one another.
Congress deadlocked, and the country's problems -- drugs, poverty, crime, corruption -- spun out of control.
Things got so bad that in 2008, the Pentagon warned that Mexico risked collapse.
Then in 2012, this guy named Enrique Peña Nieto somehow got himself elected president.
Now, this Peña hardly inspired much confidence at first.
Sure, he was handsome, but he came from Mexico's corrupt old ruling party, the PRI, and he was a notorious womanizer.
In fact, he seemed like such a pretty boy lightweight that women called him "bombón," sweetie, at campaign rallies.
And yet this same bombón soon surprised everyone by hammering out a truce between the country's three warring political parties.
And over the next 18 months, they together passed an incredibly comprehensive set of reforms.
They busted open Mexico's smothering monopolies.
They liberalized its rusting energy sector.
They restructured its failing schools, and much more.
To appreciate the scale of this accomplishment, try to imagine the US Congress passing immigration reform, campaign finance reform and banking reform. Now, try to imagine Congress doing it all at the same time. That's what Mexico did.
Not long ago, I met with Peña and asked how he managed it all.
The President flashed me his famous twinkly smile --
(Laughter)
and told me that the short answer was "compromiso," compromise.
Of course, I pushed him for details, and the long answer that came out was essentially "compromise, compromise and more compromise." See, Peña knew that he needed to build trust early, so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election.
To ward off pressure from special interests, he kept their meetings small and secret, and many of the participants later told me that it was this intimacy, plus a lot of shared tequila, that helped build confidence.
So did the fact that all decisions had to be unanimous, and that Peña even agreed to pass some of the other party's priorities before his own.
As Santiago Creel, an opposition senator, put it to me, "Look, I'm not saying that I'm special or that anyone is special, but that group, that was special." The proof?
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held, and Mexico moved forward for the first time in years. Bueno.
So now we've seen how these three countries overcame three of their great challenges.
And that's very nice for them, right?
But what good does it do the rest of us?
Well, in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories, like the way Rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war or Brazil has reduced inequality, or South Korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer than any other country on Earth, I've noticed a few common threads.
Now, before describing them, I need to add a caveat.
I realize, of course, that all countries are unique.
So you can't simply take what worked in one, port it to another and expect it to work there too.
Nor do specific solutions work forever.
You've got to adapt them as circumstances change.
That said, by stripping these stories to their essence, you absolutely can distill a few common tools for problem-solving that will work in other countries and in boardrooms and in all sorts of other contexts, too.
Number one, embrace the extreme.
In all the stories we've just looked at, salvation came at a moment of existential peril.
And that was no coincidence.
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office, he faced two looming dangers.
First, though his vast, underpopulated country badly needed more bodies, its preferred source for white workers, Europe, had just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from World War II.
The other problem was that Canada's long cold war between its French and its English communities had just become a hot one.
Quebec was threatening to secede, and Canadians were actually killing other Canadians over politics.
Now, countries face crises all the time. Right? That's nothing special.
But Trudeau's genius was to realize that Canada's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform.
Canada had to open up.
It had no choice.
And it had to rethink its identity.
Again, it had no choice.
And that gave Trudeau a once-in-a-generation opportunity to break the old rules and write new ones.
And like all our other heroes, he was smart enough to seize it.
Number two, there's power in promiscuous thinking.
Another striking similarity among good problem-solvers is that they're all pragmatists.
They'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them, and they don't let details like party or ideology or sentimentality get in their way.
As I mentioned earlier, Indonesia's democrats were clever enough to steal many of the Islamists' best campaign promises for themselves.
They even invited some of the radicals into their governing coalition.
Now, that horrified a lot of secular Indonesians.
But by forcing the radicals to actually help govern, it quickly exposed the fact that they weren't any good at the job, and it got them mixed up in all of the grubby compromises and petty humiliations that are part of everyday politics.
And that hurt their image so badly that they've never recovered.
Number three, please all of the people some of the time.
I know I just mentioned how crises can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.
And that's true, but problem-solving often requires more than just boldness.
It takes showing restraint, too, just when that's the last thing you want to do.
Take Trudeau: when he took office, he could easily have put his core constituency, that is Canada's French community, first.
He could have pleased some of the people all of the time.
And Peña could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition, as was traditional in Mexico.
Yet he chose to embrace his enemies instead, while forcing his own party to compromise.
And Trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms and to see multiculturalism, not language and not skin color, as what made them quintessentially Canadian.
Nobody got everything they wanted, but everyone got just enough that the bargains held.
So at this point you may be thinking, "OK, Tepperman, if the fixes really are out there like you keep insisting, then why aren't more countries already using them?" It's not like they require special powers to pull off.
I mean, none of the leaders we've just looked at were superheroes.
They didn't accomplish anything on their own, and they all had plenty of flaws.
Take Indonesia's first democratic president, Abdurrahman Wahid.
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic that he once fell asleep in the middle of his own speech.
(Laughter)
True story.
So what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability, and it's not circumstances.
It's something much simpler.
Making big changes involves taking big risks, and taking big risks is scary.
Overcoming that fear requires guts, and as you all know, gutsy politicians are painfully rare.
But that doesn't mean we voters can't demand courage from our political leaders. I mean, that's why we put them in office in the first place. And given the state of the world today, there's really no other option.
The answers are out there, but now it's up to us to elect more women and men brave enough to find them, to steal them and to make them work.
Thank you.

Rainn Wilson: It takes its toll, being alone.
I'm a little bit lost, and it's finally time to make a real connection. Who am I?
(Drums)
I'm a single white male, 45 years of age. I love animals. Gainfully employed. I'm a people person. I keep fit. Who am I looking for?
I'm looking for my idea mate.
Are you that idea that matches with who I really am?
(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food?
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do.
RW: Wow, we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date, huh?
RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do.
People in these areas -- they're exposed to crappy food.
I want people to know that growing your own food is like printing your own money.
RW: You're like a food superhero!
RF: Food is the problem and food is the solution.

Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.
My job is to put every word possible into the dictionary.
RW: I love words, too -- just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.
What if you love a word that you've just made up, like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?
RW: Well, I'm a little nearsighted, but yeah.
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean, your brain has no access to this world.
In fact, even the sensory information that your eyes are receiving, your ears are receiving, is completely meaningless because it could mean anything.
That tree could be a large object far away or a small object up close, and your brain has no way of knowing.
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd.
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your closest living relatives.
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
RW: I'm just curious: Do we have any conflict that needs managing or social issues to resolve?
IBI: Remember -- you're on a date with my idea, not me.
Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win.
RW: An epic win?
JM: An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive, you didn't even know it was possible until you achieved it.
You're not making the face.
You're making the "I'm not good at life" face.
RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you.
I am seeing other ideas. OK? I'm dating around.
That's the situation.

(Bottles clink)
It's funny the things you forget.
I went to see my mother the other day, and she told me this story that I'd completely forgotten about how, when we were driving together, she would pull the car over, and by the time she had gotten out of the car, and gone around the car to let me out of the car, I would have already gotten out of the car and pretended to have died. (Laughter)
People say we live in an age of information overload. Right? I don't know about that, but I just know that I get too many marketing emails.
"Just three weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!" And I resented this, because not only do I not remember signing up to that, but I resent the fact that they appear to think that I should be excited about a shop opening.
So what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email, and I pressed, "Unsubscribe." And I thought that'd be the end of it.
But a week later, I got another one that said,
"Just two weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"
And I thought, obviously, I haven't clicked hard enough.
And here's the problem: The internet gave us access to everything; but it also gave everything access to us.
It's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life, without having emails about supermarket chains and Candy Crush Saga.
And I was really annoyed with them, and I thought, OK, I was about to write a strongly worded email, which I can do quite well. (Laughter)
(Laughter) So I replied to it, and I said, "I literally cannot wait!!!!" "What do you need from me?"
They got back to me; a guy called Dan said,
(Laughter) "Hi James. I've asked a colleague to help me with your query."
Like it needs help. And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?
(Laughter) He said, "I think you have misunderstood." "A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned."
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks until,' 'Two weeks until' emails? I was getting excited."
(Laughter) "I'm sorry you're disappointed." (Laughter) I said, "Not to worry.
Let's do something anyway!
(Laughter) I'll be honest, then my relationship with Dan deteriorated somewhat, because the next email I got was this: "Thanks for your email - your Case Number is..." (Laughter)
(Laughter) And I got — and I was just like, this is... — and I, I.... And I said, "Danny?" And I thought, this is terrible.
All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.
(Laughter) I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle." And then we were back to this.
And that might have been the end of the story, but I remembered that anything -- everything -- even something as mundane as getting out of a car, can be fun if you find the right game.
So, this is what I replied: [Thanks for your email - your Case Number is # 0000001.] (Laughter)
It was just a beautiful relationship. We just kept going. It was lovely. But to be honest, guys, it was quite labor-intensive, and I had other stuff to do, believe it or not.
So what I did is I have a little email auto-replier program.
And I set it up so every time it receives an email from SafeMart, it just pings one back.
"Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..." So I set it up, and it says, Then it has a little formula that I wrote to up the case number every time. And I put it on the server and set it running.
(Laughter) (Applause) I checked back on it the other day, and it appears there have been a number of emails going back and forth. We're on 21,439.
It gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know that these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another for eternity.
And as legacies go, I don't think that's bad.
So guys, just remember: if ever you feel weighed down by the bureaucracy and often mundanity of modern life, don't fight the frustration.
(Laughter) Let it be the catalyst for whimsy.
Twelve years ago, I picked up a camera for the first time to film the olive harvest in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.
I thought I was there to make a single documentary and would then move on to some other part of the world.
But something kept bringing me back.
Now, usually, when international audiences hear about that part of the world, they often just want that conflict to go away.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad, and we wish it could just disappear.
We feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world.
But every time we turn our attention to the news, it seems like one more country has gone up in flames.
So I've been wondering whether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way -- whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict, we focus instead on how to wage conflict.
This has been a big question for me, one I've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit Just Vision.
After witnessing several different kinds of struggles in the Middle East, I started noticing some patterns on the more successful ones.
I wondered whether these variables held across cases, and if they did, what lessons we could glean for waging constructive conflict, in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.
There is some science about this.
In a study of 323 major political conflicts from 1900 to 2006, Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns were almost 100 percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns.
Nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm to those waging the campaign, as well as their opponents.
And, critically, they typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies.
In other words, nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way of waging conflict.
But if that's such an easy choice, why don't more groups use it?
Political scientist Victor Asal and colleagues have looked at several factors that shape a political group's choice of tactics.
And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence is not whether that group is more left-wing or right-wing, not whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs, not whether it's up against a democracy or a dictatorship, and not even the levels of repression that that group is facing.
The greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life.
(Applause)
When a movement includes in its discourse language around gender equality, it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence, and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.
The research squared up with my own documentation of political organizing in Israel and Palestine.
I've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions, such as the one I documented in a village called Budrus, were much more likely to achieve their goals.
This village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map when Israel started building the separation barrier.
The proposed route would require the destruction of this community's olive groves, their cemeteries and would ultimately enclose the village from all sides.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
The odds were massively stacked against them.
But they had a secret weapon: a 15-year-old girl who courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer which was about to uproot an olive tree, stopping it.
In that moment, the community of Budrus realized what was possible if they welcomed and encouraged women to participate in public life.
And so it was that the women of Budrus went to the front lines day after day, using their creativity and acumen to overcome multiple obstacles they faced in a 10-month unarmed struggle.
And as you can probably tell at this point, they win at the end.
The separation barrier was changed completely to the internationally recognized green line, and the women of Budrus came to be known across the West Bank for their indomitable energy.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I want to pause for a second, which you helped me do, because I do want to tackle two very serious misunderstandings that could happen at this point.
The first one is that I don't believe women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men.
But I do believe that in today's world, women experience power differently.
Having had to navigate being in the less powerful position in multiple aspects of their lives, women are often more adept at how to surreptitiously pressure for change against large, powerful actors.
The term "manipulative," often charged against women in a derogatory way, reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals.
And finding alternatives to direct confrontation is at the core of nonviolent resistance.
Now to the second potential misunderstanding.
I've been talking a lot about my experiences in the Middle East, and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate Muslim and Arab societies to be more inclusive of their women.
If we were to do that, they would be more successful.
They do not need this kind of help.
Women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the Middle East, but they tend to be invisible to the international community.
Our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible in our news cycle.
And we end up with a narrative that not only erases women from the struggles in the region but often misrepresents the struggles themselves.
In the late 1980s, an uprising started in Gaza, and quickly spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
It came to be known as the First Intifada, and people who have any visual memory of it generally conjure up something like this: Palestinian men throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.
The news coverage at the time made it seem like stones, Molotov cocktails and burning tires were the only activities taking place in the Intifada.
This period, though, was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing in the forms of strikes, sit-ins and the creation of parallel institutions.
During the First Intifada, whole sectors of the Palestinian civilian population mobilized, cutting across generations, factions and class lines.
They did this through networks of popular committees, and their use of direct action and communal self-help projects challenged Israel's very ability to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.
According to the Israeli Army itself, 97 percent of activities during the First Intifada were unarmed.
And here's another thing that is not part of our narrative about that time.
For 18 months in the Intifada, women were the ones calling the shots behind the scenes: Palestinian women from all walks of life in charge of mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people in a concerted effort to withdraw consent from the occupation.
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build a self-sufficient Palestinian economy by encouraging women in Gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards, an activity deemed illegal by the Israeli authorities at that time; Rabeha Diab, who took over decision-making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported; Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising's directives in order to spread them across the territories without getting caught; and Zahira Kamal, who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year.
Despite their extraordinary achievements, none of these women have made it into our narrative of the First Intifada.
We do this in other parts of the globe, too.
In our history books, for instance, and in our collective consciousness, men are the public faces and spokespersons for the 1960s struggle for racial justice in the United States.
But women were also a critical driving force, mobilizing, organizing, taking to the streets.
How many of us think of Septima Clark when we think of the United States Civil Rights era? Remarkably few. But she played a crucial role in every phase of the struggle, particularly by emphasizing literacy and education.
She's been omitted, ignored, like so many other women who played critical roles in the United States Civil Rights Movement.
This is not about getting credit.
It's more profound than that.
The stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves, and to how we believe movements are run and how movements are won.
The stories we tell about a movement like the First Intifada or the United States Civil Rights era matter deeply and have a critical influence in the choices Palestinians, Americans and people around the world will make next time they encounter an injustice and develop the courage to confront it.
If we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles, we fail to offer up role models to future generations.
Without role models, it becomes harder for women to take up their rightful space in public life.
in public life. And as we saw earlier, one of the most critical variables in determining whether a movement will be successful or not is a movement's ideology regarding the role of women
This is a question of whether we're moving towards more democratic and peaceful societies.
In a world where so much change is happening, and where change is bound to continue at an increasingly faster pace, it is not a question of whether we will face conflict, but rather a question of which stories will shape how we choose to wage conflict.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here today to talk about the two ideas that, at least based on my observations at Khan Academy, are kind of the core, or the key leverage points for learning.
And it's the idea of mastery and the idea of mindset.
I saw this in the early days working with my cousins.
A lot of them were having trouble with math at first, because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their learning.
And because of that, at some point they got to an algebra class and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre-algebra, and because of that, they thought they didn't have the math gene.
Or they'd get to a calculus class, and they'd be a little bit shaky on the algebra.
I saw it in the early days when I was uploading some of those videos on YouTube, and I realized that people who were not my cousins were watching.
(Laughter)
And at first, those comments were just simple thank-yous.
I thought that was a pretty big deal.
I don't know how much time you all spend on YouTube. Most of the comments are not "Thank you."
(Laughter)
They're a little edgier than that.
But then the comments got a little more intense, student after student saying that they had grown up not liking math.
It was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics.
By the time they got to algebra, they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn't engage with it.
They thought they didn't have the math gene.
But when they were a bit older, they took a little agency and decided to engage.
They found resources like Khan Academy and they were able to fill in those gaps and master those concepts, and that reinforced their mindset that it wasn't fixed; that they actually were capable of learning mathematics.
And in a lot of ways, this is how you would master a lot of things in life.
It's the way you would learn a martial art.
In a martial art, you would practice the white belt skills as long as necessary, and only when you've mastered it you would move on to become a yellow belt.
and only when you've mastered it It's the way you learn a musical instrument: you practice the basic piece over and over again, you go on to the more advanced one.
But what we point out -- this is not the way a traditional academic model is structured, the type of academic model that most of us grew up in.
In a traditional academic model, we group students together, usually by age, and around middle school, by age and perceived ability, and we shepherd them all together at the same pace.
And what typically happens, let's say we're in a middle school pre-algebra class, and the current unit is on exponents, the teacher will give a lecture on exponents, then we'll go home, do some homework.
The next morning, we'll review the homework, then another lecture, homework, lecture, homework.
That will continue for about two or three weeks, and then we get a test.
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent, maybe you get a 90 percent, maybe you get a 95 percent.
And even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge, I didn't know 25 percent of the material.
Even the A student, what was the five percent they didn't know?
Even though we've identified the gaps, the whole class will then move on to the next subject, probably a more advanced subject that's going to build on those gaps.
It might be logarithms or negative exponents.
And that process continues, and you immediately start to realize how strange this is.
I didn't know 25 percent of the more foundational thing, and now I'm being pushed to the more advanced thing.
And this will continue for months, years, all the way until at some point, I might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class and I hit a wall.
And it's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult or because the student isn't bright.
It's because I'm seeing an equation and they're dealing with exponents and that 30 percent that I didn't know is showing up. And then I start to disengage.
To appreciate how absurd that is, imagine if we did other things in our life that way. Say, home-building.
(Laughter)
So we bring in the contractor and say, "We were told we have two weeks to build a foundation.
Do what you can."
(Laughter)
So they do what they can. Maybe it rains. Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.
And two weeks later, the inspector comes, looks around, says, "OK, the concrete is still wet right over there, that part's not quite up to code ... I'll give it an 80 percent."
(Laughter)
You say, "Great!
That's a C. Let's build the first floor. "
(Laughter)
Same thing. We have two weeks, do what you can, inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.
Great, that's a D-plus.
Second floor, third floor, and all of a sudden, while you're building the third floor, the whole structure collapses.
And if your reaction is the reaction you typically have in education, or that a lot of folks have, you might say, maybe we had a bad contractor, or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection.
But what was really broken was the process.
We were artificially constraining how long we had to something, pretty much ensuring a variable outcome, and we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps, but then we built right on top of it.
So the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite.
Instead of artificially constraining, fixing when and how long you work on something, pretty much ensuring that variable outcome, the A, B, C, D, F -- do it the other way around.
What's variable is when and how long a student actually has to work on something, and what's fixed is that they actually master the material.
And it's important to realize that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better, but it'll reinforce the right mindset muscles.
It makes them realize that if you got 20 percent wrong on something, it doesn't mean that you have a C branded in your DNA somehow.
It means that you should just keep working on it.
You should have grit; you should have perseverance; you should take agency over your learning.
Now, a lot of skeptics might say, well, hey, this is all great, philosophically, this whole idea of mastery-based learning and its connection to mindset, students taking agency over their learning.
It makes a lot of sense, but it seems impractical.
To actually do it, every student would be on their own track.
It would have to be personalized, you'd have to have private tutors and worksheets for every student.
And these aren't new ideas -- there were experiments in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago, where they did mastery-based learning and saw great results, but they said it wouldn't scale because it was logistically difficult.
The teacher had to give different worksheets to every student, give on-demand assessments.
But now today, it's no longer impractical.
We have the tools to do it.
Students see an explanation at their own time and pace?
There's on-demand video for that. They need practice? They need feedback? There's adaptive exercises readily available for students.
And when that happens, all sorts of neat things happen.
One, the students can actually master the concepts, but they're also building their growth mindset, they're building grit, perseverance, they're taking agency over their learning.
And all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen in the actual classroom.
Instead of it being focused on the lecture, students can interact with each other.
They can get deeper mastery over the material. They can go into simulations, Socratic dialogue.
To appreciate what we're talking about and the tragedy of lost potential here, I'd like to give a little bit of a thought experiment.
If we were to go 400 years into the past to Western Europe, which even then, was one of the more literate parts of the planet, you would see that about 15 percent of the population knew how to read.
And I suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read, say a member of the clergy, "What percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading?" They might say, "Well, with a great education system, maybe 20 or 30 percent." But if you fast forward to today, we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic, that pretty close to 100 percent of the population is capable of reading.
But if I were to ask you a similar question: "What percentage of the population do you think is capable of truly mastering calculus, or understanding organic chemistry, or being able to contribute to cancer research?" A lot of you might say, "Well, with a great education system, maybe 20, 30 percent."
But what if that estimate is just based on your own experience in a non-mastery framework, your own experience with yourself or observing your peers, where you're being pushed at this set pace through classes, accumulating all these gaps?
Even when you got that 95 percent, what was that five percent you missed?
And it keeps accumulating -- you get to an advanced class, all of a sudden you hit a wall and say, "I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher; not meant to be a physicist; not meant to be a mathematician." I suspect that that actually is the case, but if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework, if you were allowed to really take agency over your learning, and when you get something wrong, embrace it -- view that failure as a moment of learning -- that number, the percent that could really master calculus or understand organic chemistry, is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.
And this isn't even just a "nice to have." I think it's a social imperative.
We're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we're going into this information revolution.
And it's clear that some things are happening.
In the industrial age, society was a pyramid. At the base of the pyramid, you needed human labor. In the middle of the pyramid, you had an information processing, a bureaucracy class, and at the top of the pyramid, you had your owners of capital and your entrepreneurs and your creative class.
But we know what's happening already, as we go into this information revolution.
The bottom of that pyramid, automation, is going to take over.
Even that middle tier, information processing, that's what computers are good at.
So as a society, we have a question: All this new productivity is happening because of this technology, but who participates in it?
Is it just going to be that very top of the pyramid, in which case, what does everyone else do? How do they operate? Or do we do something that's more aspirational?
Do we actually attempt to invert the pyramid, where you have a large creative class, where almost everyone can participate as an entrepreneur, an artist, as a researcher?
And I don't think that this is utopian.
I really think that this is all based on the idea that if we let people tap into their potential by mastering concepts, by being able to exercise agency over their learning, that they can get there.
And when you think of it as just a citizen of the world, it's pretty exciting.
I mean, think about the type of equity we can we have, and the rate at which civilization could even progress.
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.
I think it's going to be a pretty exciting time to be alive.
Thank you. (Applause)
I'm a journalist, so I like to look for the untold stories, the lives that quietly play out under the scream of headlines.
I've also been going about the business of putting down roots, choosing a partner, making babies.
So for the last few years, I've been trying to understand what constitutes the 21st-century good life, both because I'm fascinated by the moral and philosophical implications, but also because I'm in desperate need of answers myself.
We live in tenuous times.
In fact, for the first time in American history, the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were.
This is true of rich and poor, men and women.
Now, some of you might hear this and feel sad.
After all, America is deeply invested in this idea of economic transcendence, that every generation kind of leapfrogs the one before it, earning more, buying more, being more.
We've exported this dream all over the world, so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya inherit our insatiable expectation for more.
But when I read this historic poll for the first time, it didn't actually make me feel sad.
It felt like a provocation. "Better off" -- based on whose standards?
Is "better off" finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life?
Those are nearly extinct.
People move jobs, on average, every 4.7 years, and it's estimated that by 2020, nearly half of Americans will be freelancers.
OK, so is better off just a number?
Is it about earning as much as you possibly can?
By that singular measurement, we are failing.
Median per capita income has been flat since about 2000, adjusted for inflation.
All right, so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence?
Less of us are doing that.
Nearly five million people lost their homes in the Great Recession, and even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go -- or be tricked into going, in many predatory cases -- to hold that deed.
Home-ownership rates are at their lowest since 1995.
All right, so we're not finding steady employment, we're not earning as much money, and we're not living in big fancy houses.
Toll the funeral bells for everything that made America great.
But, are those the best measurements of a country's greatness, of a life well lived?
What I think makes America great is its spirit of reinvention.
In the wake of the Great Recession, more and more Americans are redefining what "better off" really means.
Turns out, it has more to do with community and creativity than dollars and cents.
Now, let me be very clear: the 14.8 percent of Americans living in poverty need money, plain and simple.
And all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation by employers and financial institutions.
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor is anything but profoundly immoral.
But, too often we let the conversation stop there.
We talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience; about the poor as if they were solely victims.
Part of what I've learned in my research and reporting is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable.
Now, if necessity is the mother of invention, I've come to believe that recession can be the father of consciousness.
It confronts us with profound questions, questions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask in times of relative comfort. How should we work? How should we live? All of us, whether we realize it or not, seek answers to these questions, with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears.
My great-grandfather was a drunk in Detroit, who sometimes managed to hold down a factory job.
He had, as unbelievable as it might sound, 21 children, with one woman, my great-grandmother, who died at 47 years old of ovarian cancer.
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child, and I cannot even fathom what she must have gone through.
And if you're trying to do the math -- there were six sets of twins.
So my grandfather, their son, became a traveling salesman, and he lived boom and bust.
So my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors and pretending his parents weren't home.
He actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage, when his father admitted he didn't have money to go back to the orthodontist.
So my dad, unsurprisingly, became a bankruptcy lawyer.
Couldn't write this in a novel, right?
He was obsessed with providing a secure foundation for my brother and I.
So I ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle.
My parents made sure that I grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap.
And ironically, and probably sometimes to their frustration, it is their steadfast commitment to security that allows me to question its value, or at least its value as we've historically defined it in the 21st century.
How should we work? So let's dig into this first question:
We should work like our mothers.
That's right -- we've spent decades trying to fit women into a work world built for company men.
And many have done backbends to fit in, but others have carved a more unconventional path, creating a patchwork of meaning and money with enough flexibility to do what they need to do for those that they love.
My mom called it "just making it work." Today I hear life coaches call it "a portfolio career." Whatever you call it, more and more men are craving these whole, if not harried, lives.
They're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons.
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said, "Labor is a way of knowing." Labor is a way of knowing.
In other words, what we work on is what we understand about the world.
If this is true, and I think it is, then women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones and the sick ones and the aging ones, have disproportionately benefited from the most profound kind of knowing there is: knowing the human condition.
By prioritizing care, men are, in a sense, staking their claim to the full range of human existence.
Now, this means the nine-to-five no longer works for anyone.
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete, as are career ladders.
Whole industries are being born and dying every day.
It's all nonlinear from here.
So we need to stop asking kids, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" and start asking them, "How do you want to be when you grow up?" Their work will constantly change.
The common denominator is them.
So the more they understand their gifts and create crews of ideal collaborators, the better off they will be.
The challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net to fit this increasingly fragmented economy.
We need portable health benefits.
We need policies that reflect that everyone deserves to be vulnerable or care for vulnerable others, without becoming destitute.
We need to seriously consider a universal basic income.
We need to reinvent labor organizing.
The promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit our 21st century values, not some archaic idea about bringing home the bacon, is long overdue -- just ask your mother.
How should we live? Now, how about the second question:
We should live like our immigrant ancestors.
When they came to America, they often shared apartments, survival tactics, child care -- always knew how to fill one more belly, no matter how small the food available.
But they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream, the white picket fence.
And even today, we see a white picket fence and we think success, self-possession.
But when you strip away the sentimentality, what it really does is divides us.
Many Americans are rejecting the white picket fence and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it, and reclaiming village life, reclaiming interdependence instead.
Fifty million of us, for example, live in intergenerational households.
This number exploded with the Great Recession, but it turns out people actually like living this way.
Two-thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof say it's improved their relationships.
Some people are choosing to share homes not with family, but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community.
CoAbode, an online platform for single moms looking to share homes with other single moms, has 50,000 users.
And people over 65 are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements.
They understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity.
Which is true of all of us when you think about it, young and old alike.
For too long, we've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle.
But all the research proves otherwise.
It shows that the healthiest, happiest and even safest -- in terms of both climate change disaster, in terms of crime, all of that -- are Americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors.
Now, I've experienced this firsthand.
For the last few years, I've been living in a cohousing community.
It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees, this prolific blackberry bush that snakes around a community garden, all smack-dab, by the way, in the middle of urban Oakland.
The nine units are all built to be different, different sizes, different shapes, but they're meant to be as green as possible.
So big, shiny black solar cells on our roof mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds more than five bucks in a month.
The 25 of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions and professions, and we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have.
But additionally, we share an industrial-sized kitchen and eating area, where we have common meals twice a week.
Now, people, when I tell them I live like this, often have one of two extreme reactions. Either they say, "Why doesn't everyone live like this?" Or they say, "That sounds totally horrifying.
I would never want to do that." So let me reassure you: there is a sacred respect for privacy among us, but also a commitment to what we call "radical hospitality" -- not the kind advertised by the Four Seasons, but the kind that says that every single person is worthy of kindness, full stop, end of sentence.
The biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this?
You share all the domestic labor -- the repairing, the cooking, the weeding -- but you also share the emotional labor.
Rather than depending only on the idealized family unit to get all of your emotional needs met, you have two dozen other people that you can go to to talk about a hard day at work or troubleshoot how to handle an abusive teacher.
Teenagers in our community will often go to an adult that is not their parent to ask for advice.
It's what bell hooks called "revolutionary parenting," this humble acknowledgment that kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults to emulate and count on.
Turns out, adults are healthier, too.
It's a lot of pressure, trying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence.
The "new better off," as I've come to call it, is less about investing in the perfect family and more about investing in the imperfect village, whether that's relatives living under one roof, a cohousing community like mine, or just a bunch of neighbors who pledge to really know and look out for one another.
It's good common sense, right?
And yet, money has often made us dumb about reaching out.
The most reliable wealth is found in relationship.
The new better off is not an individual prospect at all.
In fact, if you're a failure or you think you're a failure, I've got some good news for you: you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored.
Maybe you're a mediocre earner but a masterful father.
Maybe you can't afford your dream home, but you throw legendary neighborhood parties.
If you're a textbook success, the implications of what I'm saying could be more grim for you.
You might be a failure by standards you hold dear but that the world doesn't reward. Only you can know.
I know that I am not a tribute to my great-grandmother, who lived such a short and brutish life, if I earn enough money to afford every creature comfort.
You can't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning.
There is no home big enough to erase the pain that she must have endured.
I am a tribute to her if I live a life as connected and courageous as possible.
In the midst of such widespread uncertainty, we may, in fact, be insecure.
But we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple.
We can turn inward, lose faith in the power of institutions to change -- even lose faith in ourselves.
Or we can turn outward, cultivate faith in our ability to reach out, to connect, to create.
Turns out, the biggest danger is not failing to achieve the American Dream.
The biggest danger is achieving a dream that you don't actually believe in.
So don't do that.
Do the harder, more interesting thing, which is to compose a life where what you do every single day, the people you give your best love and ingenuity and energy to, aligns as closely as possible with what you believe.
That, not something as mundane as making money, is a tribute to your ancestors.
That is the beautiful struggle.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has, and I know this personally.
I played 10 years of football, was struck in the head thousands of times.
And I have to tell you, though, what was much worse than that was a pair of bike accidents I had where I suffered concussions, and I'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one today as I stand in front of you.
There is a fear around concussion that does have some evidence behind it.
There is information that a repeated history of concussion can lead to early dementia, such as Alzheimer's, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
That was the subject of the Will Smith movie "Concussion." And so everybody is caught up in football and what they see in the military, but you may not know that bike riding is the leading cause of concussion for kids, sports-related concussion, that is.
And so another thing that I should tell you that you may not know is that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football and many activities, they're not designed or tested for how well they can protect your children against concussion.
They're in fact designed and tested for their ability to protect against skull fracture.
And so I get this question all the time from parents, and they ask me, "Would you let your own child play football?" Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?" And I think that as a field, we're a long way from giving an answer with any kind of confidence there.
So I look at that question from a bit of a different lens, and I want to know, how can we prevent concussion? Is that even possible?
And most experts think that it's not, but the work that we're doing in my lab is starting to reveal more of the details around concussion so that we can have a better understanding.
The reason we're able to prevent skull fracture with helmets is because it's pretty simple.
We know how it works.
Concussion has been much more of a mystery.
So to give you a sense of what might be happening in a concussion, I want to show you the video here that you see when you type into Google, "What is a concussion?" The CDC website comes up, and this video essentially tells the whole story.
What you see is the head moves forward, the brain lags behind, then the brain catches up and smashes into the skull.
It rebounds off the skull and then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull.
And what you'll notice is highlighted in this video from the CDC, which I'll note was funded by the NFL, is that the outer surface of the brain, where it was to have smashed into the skull, looks like it's been damaged or injured, so it's on the outer surface of the brain.
And what I'd like to do with this video is to tell you that there are some aspects that are probably right, indicative of what the scientists think happens with concussion, but there's probably more that's wrong with this video.
So one thing that I do agree with, and I think most experts would, is that the brain does have these dynamics.
It does lag behind the skull and then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate.
That we think is true.
However, the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video is probably not right at all.
There's very little room in the cranial vault, only a few millimeters, and it's filled entirely with cerebral spinal fluid, which acts as a protective layer.
And so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the skull.
The other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around, and that's not true either.
Your brain is one of the softest substances in your body, and you can think of it kind of like jello.
So as your head is moving back and forth, your brain is twisting and turning and contorting, and the tissue is getting stretched.
And so most experts, I think, would agree that concussion is not likely to be something that's happening on this outer surface of the brain, but rather it's something that's much deeper towards the center of the brain.
Now, the way that we're approaching this problem to try to understand the mechanisms of concussion and to figure out if we can prevent it is we are using a device like this.
It's a mouthguard.
It has sensors in it that are essentially the same that are in your cell phone: accelerometers, gyroscopes, and when someone is struck in the head, it can tell you how their head moved at a thousand samples per second.
The principle behind the mouthguard is this: it fits onto your teeth.
Your teeth are one of the hardest substances in your body.
So it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves.
People have tried other approaches, with helmets.
We've looked at other sensors that go on your skin, and they all simply move around too much, and so we found that this is the only reliable way to take a good measurement.
So now that we've got this device, we can go beyond studying cadavers, because you can only learn so much about concussion from studying a cadaver, and we want to learn and study live humans.
So where can we find a group of willing volunteers to go out and smash their heads into each other on a regular basis and sustain concussion?
Well, I was one of them, and it's your local friendly Stanford football team.
So this is our laboratory, and I want to show you the first concussion we measured with this device.
One of the things that I should point out is the device has this gyroscope in it, and that allows you to measure the rotation of the head.
Most experts think that that's the critical factor that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion. So please watch this video.
Announcer: Cougars bring extra people late, but Luck has time, and Winslow is crushed.
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times is probably a little excessive there.
But you get the idea.
So when you look at just the film here, pretty much the only thing you can see is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.
But when we extract the data out of the mouthguard that he was wearing, we can see much more detail, much richer information.
And one of the things that we noticed here is that he was struck in the lower left side of his face mask. And so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive.
His head did not move to the right.
In fact, it rotated first to the left.
Then as the neck began to compress, the force of the blow caused it to whip back to the right.
So this left-right motion was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon, and we think that is probably what led to the brain injury.
Now, this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion, but what we really want to know is what's happening inside of the brain.
So we collaborate with Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden. They've developed a finite element model of the brain.
And so this is a simulation using the data from our mouthguard from the injury I just showed you, and what you see is the brain -- this is a cross-section right in the front of the brain twisting and contorting as I mentioned.
So you can see this doesn't look a lot like the CDC video.
Now, the colors that you're looking at are how much the brain tissue is being stretched.
And so the red is 50 percent.
That means the brain has been stretched to 50 percent of its original length, the tissue in that particular area.
And the main thing I want to draw your attention to is this red spot.
So the red spot is very close to the center of the brain, and relatively speaking, you don't see a lot of colors like that on the exterior surface as the CDC video showed.
Now, to explain a little more detail about how we think concussion might be happening, one thing I should mention is that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely when you're struck and your head rotates in this direction.
This is more common in sports like football, but this seems to be more dangerous.
So what might be happening there?
Well, one thing that you'll notice in the human brain that is different than other animals is we have these two very large lobes.
We have the right brain and the left brain.
And the key thing to notice in this figure here is that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain there's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain.
And in that fissure, what you can't see in this image, you'll have to trust me, there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.
It's called the falx, and it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head, and it's quite stiff.
And so what that allows for is when you're struck and your head rotates in this left-right direction, forces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain.
Now, what's there at the bottom of this fissure?
It's the wiring of your brain, and in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure is the single largest fiber bundle that is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain.
It's called the corpus callosum.
And we think that this might be one of the most common mechanisms of concussion, and as the forces move down, they strike the corpus callosum, it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion.
This finding is also consistent of what we've seen in this brain disease that I mentioned, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
So this is an image of a middle-aged ex-professional football player, and the thing that I want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum, and I'll page back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum and the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, it is greatly atrophied.
And the same goes for all of the space in the ventricles.
These ventricles are much larger.
And so all of this tissue near the center of the brain has died off over time.
So what we're learning is indeed consistent.
Now, there is some good news here, and I hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk. One of the things that we've noticed, specifically about this mechanism of injury, is although there's a rapid transmission of the forces down this fissure, it still takes a defined amount of time.
And what we think is that if we can slow the head down just enough so that the brain does not lag behind the skull but instead it moves in synchrony with the skull, then we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion.
So how can we slow the head down?
(Laughter)
A gigantic helmet. So with more space, you have more time, and this is a bit of a joke, but some of you may have seen this.
This is bubble soccer, and it's a real sport.
In fact, I saw some young adults playing this sport down the street from my house the other day, and as far as I know there have been no reported concussions.
(Laughter)
But in all seriousness, this principle does work, but this has gone too far.
This isn't something that's practical for bike riding or playing football.
And so we are collaborating with a company in Sweden called Hövding.
Some of you may have seen their work, and they're using the same principle of air to give you some extra space to prevent concussion.
Kids, don't try this at home please.
This stuntman does not have a helmet.
He instead has a neck collar, and this neck collar has sensors in it, the same type of sensors that are in our mouthguard, and it detects when he's likely to have a fall, and there's an airbag that explodes and triggers, the same way that an airbag works in your car, essentially.
And in the experiments we've done in my lab with their device, we found that it can greatly reduce the risk of concussion in some scenarios compared to a normal bicycle helmet.
So it's a pretty exciting development.
But in order for us to actually realize the benefits of technology that can prevent concussion, it needs to meet regulations.
That's a reality.
And this device is for sale in Europe but is not for sale in the US, and probably won't be any time soon.
So I wanted to tell you why.
There are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons.
Bike helmets are federally regulated.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has been given jurisdiction to approve any bike helmet for sale, and this is the test they use.
This is back to what I was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture.
That's what this test is for.
And that's an important thing to do.
It can save your life, but it's not sufficient, I would say.
So for example, one thing this test doesn't evaluate is it doesn't tell you is that airbag going to trigger at the right time and place, and not trigger when it doesn't need to?
Similarly, it's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not?
And if you look at football helmets, which aren't regulated, they still have a very similar test.
They're not regulated by the government, anyway.
They have an industry body, which is the way most industries work.
But this industry body, I can tell you, has been quite resistant to updating their standards.
So in my lab, we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion, but we want to understand how can we have better test standards?
And we hope that the government can use this type of information to encourage innovation by letting consumers know how protected are you with a given helmet.
And I want to bring this back finally to the original question I asked, which is, would I feel comfortable letting my child play football or ride a bicycle?
And this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience. I'm much more nervous about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.
So she's a year and a half old, and she's already, well, wants to anyway, race down the streets of San Francisco.
This is the bottom of one of these streets.
And so my personal goal is to -- and I believe this is possible -- is to further develop these technologies, and in fact, we're working on something in my lab in particular that really makes optimal use of the given space of a helmet.
And I am confident that we will be able to, before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler, have something available that can in fact really reduce the risk of concussion and comply with regulatory bodies.
And so what I'd like to do -- and I know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature, I've got a couple years here -- is to be able to tell parents and grandparents when I'm asked, it is safe and healthy for your children to engage in these activities.
And I'm very fortunate to have a wonderful team at Stanford that's working hard on this.
So I hope to come back in a few years with the final story, but for now I will tell you, please don't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion. There is hope.
Thank you.
(Applause)
You know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.
In fact, I'm not very interested in parenting, per Se.
It's just that there's a certain style of parenting these days that is kind of messing up kids, impeding their chances to develop into theirselves.
There's a certain style of parenting these days that's getting in the way.
I guess what I'm saying is, we spend a lot of time being very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids and their education or their upbringing, and rightly so.
But at the other end of the spectrum, there's a lot of harm going on there as well, where parents feel a kid can't be successful unless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening, and micromanaging every moment, and steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers.
When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, because Lord knows, in raising my two teenagers, I've had these tendencies myself, our kids end up leading a kind of checklisted childhood.
And here's what the checklisted childhood looks like.
We keep them safe and sound and fed and watered, and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes at the right schools, and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools.
But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards and the sports, the activities, the leadership.
We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, because colleges want to see that.
And check the box for community service.
I mean, show the colleges you care about others.
(Laughter)
And all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection.
We expect our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform at ourselves, and so because so much is required, we think, well then, of course we parents have to argue with every teacher and principal and coach and referee and act like our kid's concierge and personal handler and secretary.
And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be, to be sure they're not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges that deny almost every applicant.
And here's what it feels like to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.
First of all, there's no time for free play.
There's no room in the afternoons, because everything has to be enriching, we think.
It's as if every piece of homework, every quiz, every activity is a make-or-break moment for this future we have in mind for them, and we absolve them of helping out around the house, and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep as long as they're checking off the items on their checklist.
And in the checklisted childhood, we say we just want them to be happy, but when they come home from school, what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades.
And they see in our faces that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's.
And then we walk alongside them and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the Westminster Dog Show --
(Laughter)
coaxing them to just jump a little higher and soar a little farther, day after day after day.
And when they get to high school, they don't say, "Well, what might I be interested in studying or doing as an activity?" They go to counselors and they say, "What do I need to do to get into the right college?" And then, when the grades start to roll in in high school, and they're getting some B's, or God forbid some C's, they frantically text their friends and say, "Has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades?"
And our kids, regardless of where they end up at the end of high school, they're breathless. They're brittle. They're a little burned out.
They're a little old before their time, wishing the grown-ups in their lives had said, "What you've done is enough, this effort you've put forth in childhood is enough." And they're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering, will this life ever turn out to have been worth it?
Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it.
We seem to behave -- it's like we literally think they will have no future if they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them.
Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid they won't have a future we can brag about to our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars. Yeah.
(Applause)
But if you look at what we've done, if you have the courage to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores, but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich," we send our children the message: "Hey kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me." And so with our overhelp, our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding, we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, which is a really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, far more important than that self-esteem they get every time we applaud.
Self-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions lead to outcomes, not -- There you go.
(Applause)
Not one's parents' actions on one's behalf, but when one's own actions lead to outcomes.
So simply put, if our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must, then they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking, planning, deciding, doing, hoping, coping, trial and error, dreaming and experiencing of life for themselves.
Now, am I saying every kid is hard-working and motivated and doesn't need a parent's involvement or interest in their lives, and we should just back off and let go? Hell no.
(Laughter)
That is not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is, when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood, all in furtherance of some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers, that that's too narrow a definition of success for our kids.
And even though we might help them achieve some short-term wins by overhelping -- like they get a better grade if we help them do their homework, they might end up with a longer childhood résumé when we help -- what I'm saying is that all of this comes at a long-term cost to their sense of self.
What I'm saying is, we should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges they might be able to apply to or might get into and far more concerned that they have the habits, the mindset, the skill set, the wellness, to be successful wherever they go.
What I'm saying is, our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Did I just say chores?
Did I just say chores? I really did. But really, here's why. The longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the Harvard Grant Study.
It found that professional success in life, which is what we want for our kids, that professional success in life comes from having done chores as a kid, and the earlier you started, the better, that a roll-up-your-sleeves- and-pitch-in mindset, a mindset that says, there's some unpleasant work, someone's got to do it, it might as well be me, a mindset that says, I will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole, that that's what gets you ahead in the workplace.
Now, we all know this. You know this.
We all know this, and yet, in the checklisted childhood, we absolve our kids of doing the work of chores around the house, and then they end up as young adults in the workplace still waiting for a checklist, but it doesn't exist, and more importantly, lacking the impulse, the instinct to roll up their sleeves and pitch in and look around and wonder, how can I be useful to my colleagues? How can I anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need?
A second very important finding from the Harvard Grant Study said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work, love of humans: our spouse, our partner, our friends, our family.
So childhood needs to teach our kids how to love, and they can't love others if they don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves if we can't offer them unconditional love.
(Applause)
Right. And so, instead of being obsessed with grades and scores when our precious offspring come home from school, or we come home from work, we need to close our technology, put away our phones, and look them in the eye and let them see the joy that fills our faces when we see our child for the first time in a few hours.
And then we have to say, "How was your day?
What did you like about today?" And when your teenage daughter says, "Lunch," like mine did, and I want to hear about the math test, not lunch, you have to still take an interest in lunch.
You gotta say, "What was great about lunch today?" They need to know they matter to us as humans, not because of their GPA.
All right, so you're thinking, chores and love, that sounds all well and good, but give me a break.
The colleges want to see top scores and grades and accolades and awards, and I'm going to tell you, sort of.
The very biggest brand-name schools are asking that of our young adults, but here's the good news.
Contrary to what the college rankings racket would have us believe --
(Applause)
you don't have to go to one of the biggest brand name schools to be happy and successful in life.
Happy and successful people went to state school, went to a small college no one has heard of, went to community college, went to a college over here and flunked out.
The evidence is in this room, is in our communities, that this is the truth.
And if we could widen our blinders and be willing to look at a few more colleges, maybe remove our own egos from the equation, we could accept and embrace this truth and then realize, it is hardly the end of the world if our kids don't go to one of those big brand-name schools.
And more importantly, if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college, whichever one it is, well, they'll have gone there on their own volition, fueled by their own desire, capable and ready to thrive there.
I have to admit something to you.
I've got two kids I mentioned, Sawyer and Avery. They're teenagers. And once upon a time, I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery like little bonsai trees --
(Laughter)
that I was going to carefully clip and prune and shape into some perfect form of a human that might just be perfect enough to warrant them admission to one of the most highly selective colleges.
But I've come to realize, after working with thousands of other people's kids --
(Laughter)
and raising two kids of my own, my kids aren't bonsai trees.
They're wildflowers of an unknown genus and species --
(Laughter)
and it's my job to provide a nourishing environment, to strengthen them through chores and to love them so they can love others and receive love and the college, the major, the career, that's up to them.
My job is not to make them become what I would have them become, but to support them in becoming their glorious selves.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Have you heard the news? We're in a clean energy revolution.
And where I live in Berkeley, California, it seems like every day I see a new roof with new solar panels going up, electric car in the driveway.
Germany sometimes gets half its power from solar, and India is now committed to building 10 times more solar than we have in California, by the year 2022.
Even nuclear seems to be making a comeback.
Bill Gates is in China working with engineers, there's 40 different companies that are working together to try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste, that can't melt down and is cheaper than coal.
And so you might start to ask: Is this whole global warming problem going to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined?
That was the question we wanted to know, so my colleagues and I decided to take a deep dive into the data.
We were a little skeptical of some parts of the clean energy revolution story, but what we found really surprised us.
The first thing is that clean energy has been increasing.
This is electricity from clean energy sources over the last 20 years.
But when you look at the percentage of global electricity from clean energy sources, it's actually been in decline from 36 percent to 31 percent.
And if you care about climate change, you've got to go in the opposite direction to 100 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources, as quickly as possible.
Now, you might wonder, "Come on, how much could five percentage points of global electricity be?" Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.
It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants the size of Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear plant, or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz, which is one of the biggest solar farms in the world, and certainly our biggest in California.
A big part of this is simply that fossil fuels are increasing faster than clean energy. And that's understandable. There's just a lot of poor countries that are still using wood and dung and charcoal as their main source of energy, and they need modern fuels.
But there's something else going on, which is that one of those clean energy sources in particular has actually been on the decline in absolute terms, not just relatively.
And that's nuclear.
You can see its generation has declined seven percent over the last 10 years.
Now, solar and wind have been making huge strides, so you hear a lot of talk about how it doesn't really matter, because solar and wind is going to make up the difference.
But the data says something different.
When you combine all the electricity from solar and wind, you see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear.
Let's take a closer look in the United States.
Over the last couple of years -- really 2013, 2014 -- we prematurely retired four nuclear power plants.
They were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels, and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar.
And it's not unique to us.
People think of California as a clean energy and climate leader, but when we looked at the data, what we found is that, in fact, California reduced emissions more slowly than the national average, between 2000 and 2015.
What about Germany? They're doing a lot of clean energy.
But when you look at the data, German emissions have actually been going up since 2009, and there's really not anybody who's going to tell you that they're going to meet their climate commitments in 2020.
The reason isn't hard to understand. Solar and wind provide power about 10 to 20 percent of the time, which means that when the sun's not shining, the wind's not blowing, you still need power for your hospitals, your homes, your cities, your factories.
And while batteries have made some really cool improvements lately, the truth is, they're just never going to be as efficient as the electrical grid.
Every time you put electricity into a battery and take it out, you lose about 20 to 40 percent of the power.
That's why when, in California, we try to deal with all the solar we've brought online -- we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar -- when the sun goes down, and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their TV sets, and every other appliance in the house, we need a lot of natural gas backup.
So what we've been doing is stuffing a lot of natural gas into the side of a mountain.
And that worked pretty well for a while, but then late last year, it sprung a leak.
This is Aliso Canyon.
So much methane gas was released, it was the equivalent of putting half a million cars on the road.
It basically blew through all of our climate commitments for the year.
Well, what about India? Sometimes you have to go places to really get the right data, so we traveled to India a few months ago.
We met with all the top officials -- solar, nuclear, the rest -- and what they told us is, "We're actually having more serious problems than both Germany and California.
We don't have backup; we don't have all the natural gas.
And that's just the start of it.
Say we want to get to 100 gigawatts by 2022.
But last year we did just five, and the year before that, we did five."
So, let's just take a closer look at nuclear.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has looked at the carbon content of all these different fuels, and nuclear comes out really low -- it's actually lower even than solar.
And nuclear obviously provides a lot of power -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
During a year, a single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time.
What's interesting is that when you look at countries that have deployed different kinds of clean energies, there's only a few that have done so at a pace consistent with dealing with the climate crisis.
So nuclear seems like a pretty good option, but there's this big problem with it, which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of, which is that people really don't like it.
There was a study, a survey done of people around the world, not just in the United States or Europe, about a year and a half ago.
And what they found is that nuclear is actually one of the least popular forms of energy.
Even oil is more popular than nuclear.
And while nuclear kind of edges out coal, the thing is, people don't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear, which really operates on our unconscious.
So what is it that we fear? There's really three things.
There's the safety of the plants themselves -- the fears that they're going to melt down and cause damage; there's the waste from them; and there's the association with weapons.
And I think, understandably, engineers look at those concerns and look for technological fixes.
That's why Bill Gates is in China developing advanced reactors.
That's why 40 different entrepreneurs are working on this problem.
And I, myself, have been very excited about it.
We did a report: "How to Make Nuclear Cheap." In particular, the thorium reactor shows a lot of promise.
So when the climate scientist, James Hansen, asked if I wanted to go to China with him and look at the Chinese advanced nuclear program, I jumped at the chance.
We were there with MIT and UC Berkeley engineers.
And I had in my mind that the Chinese would be able to do with nuclear what they did with so many other things -- start to crank out small nuclear reactors on assembly lines, ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks and send them around the world.
I would get one at home in Berkeley.
But what I found was somewhat different.
The presentations were all very exciting and very promising; they have multiple reactors that they're working on.
The time came for the thorium reactor, and a bunch of us were excited.
They went through the whole presentation, they got to the timeline, and they said, "We're going to have a thorium molten salt reactor ready for sale to the world by 2040." And I was like, "What?"
(Laughter)
I looked at my colleagues and I was like, "Excuse me -- can you guys speed that up a little bit?
Because we're in a little bit of a climate crisis right now.
And your cities are really polluted, by the way." And they responded back, they were like, "I'm not sure what you've heard about our thorium program, but we don't have a third of our budget, and your department of energy hasn't been particularly forthcoming with all that data you guys have on testing reactors." And I said, "Well, I've got an idea.
You know how you've got 10 years where you're demonstrating that reactor? Let's just skip that part, and let's just go right to commercializing it.
That will save money and time." And the engineer just looked at me and said, "Let me ask you a question: Would you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before?"
So what about the other reactors? There's a reactor that's coming online now, they're starting to sell it.
It's a high-temperature gas reactor.
It can't melt down.
But it's really big and bulky, that's part of the safety, and nobody thinks it's going to ever get cheaper than the reactors that we have.
The ones that use waste as fuel are really cool ideas, but the truth is, we don't actually know how to do that yet.
There's some risk that you'll actually make more waste, and most people think that if you're including that waste part of the process, it's just going to make the whole machine a lot more expensive, it's just adding another complicated step.
The truth is, there's real questions about how much of that we're going to do.
I mean, we went to India and asked about the nuclear program.
The government said before the Paris climate talks that they were going to do something like 30 new nuclear plants.
But when we got there and interviewed people and even looked at the internal documents, they're now saying they're going to do about five.
And in most of the world, especially the rich world, they're not talking about building new reactors.
We're actually talking about taking reactors down before their lifetimes are over.
Germany's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that.
I mentioned the United States — we could lose half of our reactors over the next 15 years, which would wipe out 40 percent of the emissions reductions we're supposed to get under the Clean Power Plan.
Of course, in Japan, they took all their nuclear plants offline, replaced them with coal, natural gas, oil burning, and they're only expected to bring online about a third to two-thirds.
So when we went through the numbers, and just added that up -- how much nuclear do we see China and India bringing online over the next 15 years, how much do we see at risk of being taken offline -- this was the most startling finding.
What we found is that the world is actually at risk of losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years.
In other words: we're not in a clean energy revolution; we're in a clean energy crisis.
So it's understandable that engineers would look for a technical fix to the fears that people have of nuclear.
But when you consider that these are big challenges to do, that they're going to take a long time to solve, there's this other issue, which is: Are those technical fixes really going to solve people's fears?
Let's take safety. You know, despite what people think, it's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer.
I mean, every medical journal that looks at it -- this is the most recent study from the British journal, "Lancet," one of the most respected journals in the world -- nuclear is the safest way to make reliable power.
Everybody's scared of the accidents.
So you go look at the accident data -- Fukushima, Chernobyl -- the World Health Organization finds the same thing: the vast majority of harm is caused by people panicking, and they're panicking because they're afraid.
In other words, the harm that's caused isn't actually caused by the machines or the radiation.
It's caused by our fears.
And what about the waste? Everyone worries about the waste.
Well, the interesting thing about the waste is how little of it there is.
This is just from one plant.
If you take all the nuclear waste we've ever made in the United States, put it on a football field, stacked it up, it would only reach 20 feet high.
And people say it's poisoning people or doing something -- it's not, it's just sitting there, it's just being monitored.
There's not very much of it.
By contrast, the waste that we don't control from energy production -- we call it "pollution," and it kills seven million people a year, and it's threatening very serious levels of global warming.
And the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel, there's always going to be some fuel left over.
That means there's always going to be people that think it's a big problem for reasons that maybe don't have as much to do with the actual waste as we think.
Well, what about the weapons? Maybe the most surprising thing is that we can't find any examples of countries that have nuclear power and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.
In fact, it works the opposite.
What we find is the only way we know how to get rid large numbers of nuclear weapons is by using the plutonium in the warheads as fuel in our nuclear power plants.
And so, if you are wanting to get the world rid of nuclear weapons, then we're going to need a lot more nuclear power.
(Applause)
As I was leaving China, the engineer that brought Bill Gates there kind of pulled me aside, and he said, "You know, Michael, I appreciate your interest in all the different nuclear supply technologies, but there's this more basic issue, which is that there's just not enough global demand.
I mean, we can crank out these machines on assembly lines, we do know how to make things cheap, but there's just not enough people that want them."
And so, let's do solar and wind and efficiency and conservation.
Let's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs.
I think we should triple the amount of money we're spending on it.
But I just think the most important thing, if we're going to overcome the climate crisis, is to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis isn't from within our machines, it's from within ourselves.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago.
I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger.
This man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident that could have killed me.
And the whole thing left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger?
In other words, what are the causes of his or anybody else's capacity for altruism?
But first let me tell you what happened.
That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog darted out in front of my car.
And I did exactly what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it.
And I discovered why you're not supposed to do that.
I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died.
And I was sure in that moment that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life.
And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again.
He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure I forgot to say thank you.
So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you to that stranger.
(Applause)
I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree.
I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others.
Where does it come from, and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms that it can take?
These questions are really important to understanding basic aspects of human social nature.
A lot of people, and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated by our own welfare.
But if that's true, why do some people, like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things, like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves?
Answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people who engage in such acts different than other people.
But until recently, very little work on this topic had been done.
The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual.
So it's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other.
What could possibly explain an action like that?
One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism.
But then the question becomes, why do some people seem to have more of it than others?
And the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways.
But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths.
A common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group.
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior.
Once my colleagues and I at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings of other researchers now, have shown that people who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics.
First, although they're not generally insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress.
And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one.
And fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues.
The part of the brain that's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala.
There are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions.
And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions.
Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues.
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent.
So all of these findings are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting.
But remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do.
So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy?
A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive to this expression and maybe larger than average as well?
As my research has now shown, all three things are true.
And we discovered this by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists.
These are people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger.
So these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?" is a very common question.
And the answer may be that the brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics.
They are better at recognizing other people's fear.
They're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress.
This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions.
And remember, this is the same part of the brain that we found was underreactive in people who are psychopathic.
And finally, their amygdalas are larger than average as well, by about eight percent.
So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism.
But I should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're more compassionate than average.
They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate and altruistic not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not extraordinary.
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me.
And I've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney.
And I found it's a really difficult question for them to answer.
I say, "How is it that you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't?
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.
What is it that makes you so special?"
And what do they say?
They say, "Nothing.
There's nothing special about me.
I'm just the same as everybody else."
And I think that's actually a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this.
They have no center.
These altruists literally don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently important than anybody else.
When I asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique.
Your study here is going to find out that I'm just the same as you."
I think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion than anybody else.
And I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person.
But I also think that this is a view of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people.
And I think this because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere.
The psychologist Steven Pinker and others have shown that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening circles of others, which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment.
And it's led to increases in all kinds of altruism.
A hundred years ago, people would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today.
Is it possible that a hundred years from now people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today? Maybe.
So what's at the root of all these amazing changes?
In part it seems to be increases in wealth and standards of living.
As societies become wealthier and better off, people seem to turn their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations.
But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not.
And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering of those distant strangers.
But what's clear is the kinds of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Don't answer that out loud. But put a number in your head.
Now: How much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid?
Again, don't answer out loud.
(Laughter)
At work, how much do you think the person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid? Do you know? Should you know?
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions.
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary.
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors, and we're definitely not supposed to tell our office neighbors.
The assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid, then all hell would break loose.
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights, there might even be a few people who quit.
But what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife?
And what would happen if we removed that secrecy?
What if openness actually increased the sense of fairness and collaboration inside a company?
What would happen if we had total pay transparency?
For the past several years, I've been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders who question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company.
And the question of pay keeps coming up.
And the answers keep surprising.
It turns out that pay transparency -- sharing salaries openly across a company -- makes for a better workplace for both the employee and for the organization.
When people don't know how their pay compares to their peers', they're more likely to feel underpaid and maybe even discriminated against.
Do you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea that you feel underpaid or discriminated against?
But keeping salaries secret does exactly that, and it's a practice as old as it is common, despite the fact that in the United States, the law protects an employee's right to discuss their pay.
In one famous example from decades ago, the management of Vanity Fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled: "Forbidding Discussion Among Employees of Salary Received." "Forbidding" discussion among employees of salary received.
Now that memo didn't sit well with everybody.
New York literary figures Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood, all writers in the Algonquin Round Table, decided to stand up for transparency and showed up for work the next day with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck.
(Laughter)
Imagine showing up for work with your salary just written across your chest for all to see.
But why would a company even want to discourage salary discussions?
Why do some people go along with it, while others revolt against it?
It turns out that in addition to the assumed reasons, pay secrecy is actually a way to save a lot of money.
You see, keeping salaries secret leads to what economists call "information asymmetry." This is a situation where, in a negotiation, one party has loads more information than the other.
And in hiring or promotion or annual raise discussions, an employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money.
Imagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise if you knew everybody's salary.
Economists warn that information asymmetry can cause markets to go awry.
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier, and suddenly everybody is shouting at each other.
In fact, they even warn that information asymmetry can lead to a total market failure.
And I think we're almost there.
Here's why: first, most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers'.
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees, two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid.
And of everybody who felt that they were underpaid, 60 percent said that they intended to quit, regardless of where they were -- underpaid, overpaid or right at the market rate.
If you were part of this survey, what would you say? Are you underpaid? Well, wait -- how do you even know, because you're not allowed to talk about it?
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy, makes it easier to ignore the discrimination that's already present in the market today.
In a 2011 report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent.
This is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from.
But in the Federal Government, where salaries are pinned to certain levels and everybody knows what those levels are, the gender wage gap shrinks to 11 percent -- and this is before controlling for any of the factors that economists argue over whether or not to control for.
If we really want to close the gender wage gap, maybe we should start by opening up the payroll.
If this is what total market failure looks like, then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness.
Now, I realize that letting people know what you make might feel uncomfortable, but isn't it less uncomfortable than always wondering if you're being discriminated against, or if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly?
Openness remains the best way to ensure fairness, and pay transparency does that.
That's why entrepreneurial leaders and corporate leaders have been experimenting with sharing salaries for years. Like Dane Atkinson. Dane is a serial entrepreneur who started many companies in a pay secrecy condition and even used that condition to pay two equally qualified people dramatically different salaries, depending on how well they could negotiate.
And Dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this.
So when he started his newest company, SumAll, he committed to salary transparency from the beginning.
And the results have been amazing.
And in study after study, when people know how they're being paid and how that pay compares to their peers', they're more likely to work hard to improve their performance, more likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.
That's why Dane's not alone.
From technology start-ups like Buffer, to the tens of thousands of employees at Whole Foods, where not only is your salary available for everyone to see, but the performance data for the store and for your department is available on the company intranet for all to see.
Now, pay transparency takes a lot of forms. It's not one size fits all.
Some post their salaries for all to see.
Some only keep it inside the company.
Some post the formula for calculating pay, and others post the pay levels and affix everybody to that level.
So you don't have to make signs for all of your employees to wear around the office.
And you don't have to be the only one wearing a sign that you made at home.
But we can all take greater steps towards pay transparency.
For those of you that have the authority to move forward towards transparency: it's time to move forward.
And for those of you that don't have that authority: it's time to stand up for your right to.
So how much do you get paid?
And how does that compare to the people you work with? You should know. And so should they.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010, my goal was simple: open a school to close a prison.
Now to some, this was an audacious goal, because our school is located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn -- one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of New York City.
Like many urban schools with high poverty rates, we face numerous challenges, like finding teachers who can empathize with the complexities of a disadvantaged community, lack of funding for technology, low parental involvement and neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade.
So here I was, the founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school, and I only had 45 kids to start. Thirty percent of them had special needs.
Eighty-six percent of them were below grade level in English and in math.
And 100 percent were living below the poverty level.
If our children are not in our classrooms, how will they learn?
And if they're not learning, where would they end up?
It was evident when I would ask my 13-year-old, "Young man, where do you see yourself in five years?"
And his response: "I don't know if I'm gonna live that long."
Or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant.
To me, this was unacceptable.
It was also evident that they had no idea that there was a landscape of opportunity that existed beyond their neighborhood.
We call our students "scholars," because they're lifelong learners.
And the skills that they learn today will prepare them for college and career readiness.
I chose the royal colors of purple and black, because I want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness, and that through education, they are future engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs and even leaders who can and will take over this world.
To date, we have had three graduating classes, at a 98 --
(Applause)
At a 98-percent graduation rate.
This is nearly 200 children, who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools in New York City.
(Applause)
It was a cold day in January when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet, met Brandon Stanton, the founder of the popular blog "Humans of New York." Brandon shared the story of a young man from Brownsville who had witnessed violence firsthand, by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof.
Yet he can still be influenced by a principal who had opened up a school that believes in all children.
Vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children who are struggling to survive, which is why we must make education a priority.
Brandon's post created a global sensation that touched the lives of millions.
This resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised for our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities, Summer STEAM programs, as well as college scholarships.
You need to understand that when 200 young people from Brownsville visited Harvard, they now understood that a college of their choice was a real possibility.
And the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose.
The revolution in education is happening in our schools, with adults who provide love, structure, support and knowledge.
These are the things that inspire children.
But it is not an easy task.
And there are high demands within an education system that is not perfect.
But I have a dynamic group of educators who collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum.
They take time beyond their school day, and come in on weekends and even use their own money to often provide resources when we do not have it.
And as the principal, I have to inspect what I expect.
So I show up in classes and I conduct observations to give feedback, because I want my teachers to be just as successful as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.
And I give them access to me every single day, which is why they all have my personal cell number, including my scholars and those who graduated -- which is probably why I get phone calls and text messages at three o'clock in the morning.
(Laughter)
But we are all connected to succeed, and good leaders do this.
Tomorrow's future is sitting in our classrooms.
And they are our responsibility.
That means everyone in here, and those who are watching the screen.
We must believe in their brilliance, and remind them by teaching them that there indeed is power in education.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Why bother? The game is rigged.
My vote won't count.
The choices are terrible.
Voting is for suckers.
Perhaps you've thought some of these things. Perhaps you've even said them.
And if so, you wouldn't be alone, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.
The game of public policy today is rigged in many ways.
How else would more than half of federal tax breaks flow up to the wealthiest five percent of Americans?
And our choices indeed are often terrible.
For many people across the political spectrum, Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election.
But in any year, you can look up and down the ballot and find plenty to be uninspired about.
But in spite of all this, I still believe voting matters.
And crazy as it may sound, I believe we can revive the joy of voting.
Today, I want to talk about how we can do that, and why.
There used to be a time in American history when voting was fun, when it was much more than just a grim duty to show up at the polls.
That time is called "most of American history."
(Laughter)
From the Revolution to the Civil Rights Era, the United States had a vibrant, robustly participatory and raucous culture of voting.
It was street theater, open-air debates, fasting and feasting and toasting, parades and bonfires.
During the 19th century, immigrants and urban political machines helped fuel this culture of voting.
That culture grew with each successive wave of new voters.
During Reconstruction, when new African-American voters, new African-American citizens, began to exercise their power, they celebrated in jubilee parades that connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote.
A few decades later, the suffragettes brought a spirit of theatricality to their fight, marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise.
And the Civil Rights Movement, which sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship that had been betrayed by Jim Crow, put voting right at the center.
From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma, that generation of activists knew that voting matters, and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power is key to actually claiming power.
But it's been over a half century since Selma and the Voting Rights Act, and in the decades since, this face-to-face culture of voting has just about disappeared.
It's been killed by television and then the internet.
The couch has replaced the commons.
Screens have made citizens into spectators.
And while it's nice to share political memes on social media, that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle calls "being alone together."
What we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together, in person, in loud and passionate ways, so that instead of being "eat your vegetables" or "do you duty," voting can feel more like "join the club" or, better yet, "join the party."
Imagine if we had, across the country right now, in local places but nationwide, a concerted effort to revive a face-to-face set of ways to engage and electioneer: outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style; soapbox speeches by citizens; public debates held inside pubs; streets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals; battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep their candidates.
Now, all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you, but in fact, it doesn't have to be any more 18th century than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton," which is to say vibrantly contemporary.
And the fact is that all around the world, today, millions of people are voting like this.
In India, elections are colorful, communal affairs.
In Brazil, election day is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.
In Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a spectacle, eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle to the street theater of elections.
You might ask, well, here in America, who has time for this?
And I would tell you that the average American watches five hours of television a day.
You might ask, who has the motivation? And I'll tell you, any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a prop, not as a talking point, but as a participant, as a creator.
Well, how do we make this happen?
Simply by making it happen.
That's why a group of colleagues and I launched a new project called "The Joy of Voting." In four cities across the United States -- Philadelphia, Miami, Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas -- we've gathered together artists and activists, educators, political folks, neighbors, everyday citizens to come together and create projects that can foster this culture of voting in a local way.
In Miami, that means all-night parties with hot DJs where the only way to get in is to show that you're registered to vote.
In Akron, it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood.
In Philadelphia, it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town.
And in Wichita, it's making mixtapes and live graffiti art in the North End to get out the vote.
There are 20 of these projects, and they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity, and they are changing people.
Let me tell you about a couple of them.
In Miami, we've commissioned and artist, a young artist named Atomico, to create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of "I voted" stickers.
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.
He wasn't even registered.
So as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers, he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics.
He got himself registered, and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election, and on election day he was out there not just passing out stickers, but chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote, and talking about the election with passersby.
In Akron, a theater company called the Wandering Aesthetics has been putting on these pickup truck plays.
And to do so, they put out an open call to the public asking for speeches, monologues, dialogues, poems, snippets of anything that could be read aloud and woven into a performance.
They got dozens of submissions.
One of them was a poem written by nine students in an ESL class, all of them Hispanic migrant workers from nearby Hartville, Ohio.
I want to read to you from this poem.
It's called "The Joy of Voting."
"I would like to vote for the first time because things are changing for Hispanics.
I used to be afraid of ghosts.
Now I am afraid of people.
There's more violence and racism.
Voting can change this.
The border wall is nothing.
It's just a wall.
The wall of shame is something.
It's very important to vote so we can break down this wall of shame.
I have passion in my heart.
Voting gives me a voice and power.
I can stand up and do something."
"The Joy of Voting" project isn't just about joy. It's about this passion. It's about feeling and belief, and it isn't just our organization's work.
All across this country right now, immigrants, young people, veterans, people of all different backgrounds are coming together to create this kind of passionate, joyful activity around elections, in red and blue states, in urban and rural communities, people of every political background.
What they have in common is simply this: their work is rooted in place.
Because remember, all citizenship is local.
When politics becomes just a presidential election, we yell and we scream at our screens, and then we collapse, exhausted.
But when politics is about us and our neighbors and other people in our community coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination, then we begin to remember that this stuff matters.
We begin to remember that this is the stuff of self-government.
Why bother? Which brings me back to where I began. There's one way to answer this question.
Voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief.
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest that makes any society thrive.
When we vote, even if it is in anger, we are part of a collective, creative leap of faith.
Voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had.
It's no accident that democracy and theater emerged around the same time in ancient Athens.
Both of them yank the individual out of the enclosure of her private self.
Both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual.
Both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined, and can be reimagined.
This moment right now, when we think about the meaning of imagination, is so fundamentally important, and our ability to take that spirit and to take that sense that there is something greater out there, is not just a matter of technical expertise.
It's not just a matter of making the time or having the know-how.
It is a matter of spirit.
But let me give you an answer to this question, "Why bother?" that is maybe a little less spiritual and a bit more pointed. Why bother voting? Because there is no such thing as not voting.
Not voting is voting, for everything that you may detest and oppose.
Not voting can be dressed up as an act of principled, passive resistance, but in fact not voting is actively handing power over to those whose interests are counter to your own, and those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence.
Not voting is for suckers.
Imagine where this country would be if all the folks who in 2010 created the Tea Party had decided that, you know, politics is too messy, voting is too complicated.
There is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything.
They didn't preemptively silence themselves.
They showed up, and in the course of showing up, they changed American politics.
Imagine if all of the followers of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders had decided not to upend the political status quo and blow apart the frame of the previously possible in American politics.
They did that by voting.
We live in a time right now, divided, often very dark, where across the left and the right, there's a lot of talk of revolution and the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy.
Well, here's the thing: everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution.
In the 2012 presidential election, young voters, Latino voters, Asian-American voters, low-income voters, all showed up at less than 50 percent.
In the 2014 midterm elections, turnout was 36 percent, which was a 70-year low.
And in your average local election, turnout hovers somewhere around 20 percent.
I invite you to imagine 100 percent. Picture 100 percent. Mobilize 100 percent, and overnight, we get revolution.
Overnight, the policy priorities of this country change dramatically, and every level of government becomes radically more responsive to all the people.
What would it take to mobilize 100 percent?
Well, we do have to push back against efforts afoot all across the country right now to make voting harder.
But at the same time, we have to actively create a positive culture of voting that people want to belong to, be part of, and experience together.
We have to make purpose.
We have to make joy.
So yes, let's have that revolution, a revolution of spirit, of ideas, of policy and participation, a revolution against cynicism, a revolution against the self-fulfilling sense of powerlessness.
Let's vote this revolution into existence, and while we're at it, let's have some fun.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I remember the very first time I went to a nice restaurant, a really nice restaurant.
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner, and I remember beforehand the waitress walked around and asked whether we wanted some wine, so I said, "Sure, I'll take some white wine."
And she immediately said, "Would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?"
And I remember thinking, "Come on, lady, stop with the fancy French words and just give me some white wine." But I used my powers of deduction and recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc were two separate types of white wine, and so I told her that I would take the chardonnay, because frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce for me.
So I had a lot of experiences like that during my first couple of years as a law student at Yale, because, despite all outward appearances, I'm a cultural outsider.
I didn't come from the elites.
I didn't come from the Northeast or from San Francisco.
I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's really struggling in a lot of ways, ways that are indicative of the broader struggles of America's working class.
Heroin has moved in, killing a lot of people, people I know.
Family violence, domestic violence, and divorce have torn apart families.
And there's a very unique sense of pessimism that's moved in.
Think about rising mortality rates in these communities and recognize that for a lot of these folks, the problems that they're seeing are actually causing rising death rates in their own communities, so there's a very real sense of struggle.
I had a very front-row seat to that struggle.
My family has been part of that struggle for a very long time.
I come from a family that doesn't have a whole lot of money.
The addiction that plagued my community also plagued my family, and even, sadly, my own mom.
There were a lot of problems that I saw in my own family, problems caused sometimes by a lack of money, problems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital that really affected my life.
If you had looked at my life when I was 14 years old and said, "Well, what's going to happen to this kid?" you would have concluded that I would have struggled with what academics call upward mobility.
So upward mobility is an abstract term, but it strikes at something that's very core at the heart of the American Dream.
It's the sense, and it measures whether kids like me who grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life, whether they're going to have a chance to live a materially better existence, or whether they're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from.
And one of the things we've learned, unfortunately, is that upward mobility isn't as high as we'd like it to be in this country, and interestingly, it's very geographically distributed.
So take Utah, for instance.
In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK, very likely to live their share and their part in the American Dream.
But if you think of where I'm from, in the South, in Appalachia, in southern Ohio, it's very unlikely that kids like that will rise.
The American Dream in those parts of the country is in a very real sense just a dream.
So why is that happening?
So one reason is obviously economic or structural.
So you think of these areas.
They're beset by these terrible economic trends, built around industries like coal and steel that make it harder for folks to get ahead.
That's certainly one problem.
There's also the problem of brain drain, where the really talented people, because they can't find high-skilled work at home, end up moving elsewhere, so they don't build a business or non-profit where they're from, they end up going elsewhere and taking their talents with them.
There are failing schools in a lot of these communities, failing to give kids the educational leg up that really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life.
These things are all important.
I don't mean to discount these structural barriers.
But when I look back at my life and my community, something else was going on, something else mattered.
It's difficult to quantify, but it was no less real.
So for starters, there was a very real sense of hopelessness in the community that I grew up in.
There was a sense that kids had that their choices didn't matter.
No matter what happened, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how hard they tried to get ahead, nothing good would happen.
So that's a tough feeling to grow up around.
That's a tough mindset to penetrate, and it leads sometimes to very conspiratorial places.
So let's just take one political issue that's pretty hot, affirmative action.
So depending on your politics, you might think that affirmative action is either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace or the classroom.
But if you grow up in an area like this, you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back.
That's especially true if you're a member of the white working class.
You see it as something that isn't just about good or bad policy. You see it as something that's actively conspiring, where people with political and financial power are working against you.
And there are a lot of ways that you see that conspiracy against you -- perceived, real, but it's there, and it warps expectations.
So if you think about what do you do when you grow up in that world, you can respond in a couple of ways.
One, you can say, "I'm not going to work hard, because no matter how hard I work, it's not going to matter." Another thing you might do is say, "Well, I'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success, like a university education or a prestigious job, because the people who care about those things are unlike me.
They're never going to let me in. "When I got admitted to Yale, a family member asked me if I had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee. Seriously. And it's obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check on the application, but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places that you have to pretend to be somebody you're not to get past these various social barriers.
It's a very significant problem.
Even if you don't give in to that hopelessness, even if you think, let's say, that your choices matter and you want to make the good choices, you want to do better for yourself and for your family, it's sometimes hard to even know what those choices are when you grow up in a community like I did.
I didn't know, for example, that you had to go to law school to be a lawyer.
I didn't know that elite universities, as research consistently tells us, are cheaper for low-income kids because these universities have bigger endowments, can offer more generous financial aid.
I remember I learned this when I got the financial aid letter from Yale for myself, tens of thousands of dollars in need-based aid, which is a term I had never heard before.
But I turned to my aunt when I got that letter and said, "You know, I think this just means that for the first time in my life, being poor has paid really well."
So I didn't have access to that information because the social networks around me didn't have access to that information.
I learned from my community how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.
I learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe.
The trick, by the way, is frozen butter, not warm butter.
But I didn't learn how to get ahead.
I didn't learn how to make the good decisions about education and opportunity that you need to make to actually have a chance in this 21st century knowledge economy.
Economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks, from our friends and colleagues and family "social capital." The social capital that I had wasn't built for 21st century America, and it showed.
There's something else that's really important that's going on that our community doesn't like to talk about, but it's very real.
Working-class kids are much more likely to face what's called adverse childhood experiences, which is just a fancy word for childhood trauma: getting hit or yelled at, put down by a parent repeatedly, watching someone hit or beat your parent, watching someone do drugs or abuse alcohol. These are all instances of childhood trauma, and they're pretty commonplace in my family.
Importantly, they're not just commonplace in my family right now. They're also multigenerational.
So my grandparents, the very first time that they had kids, they expected that they were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good. They were middle class, they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill.
But what ended up happening is that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma that had gone back many generations.
My mom was 12 when she saw my grandma set my grandfather on fire.
His crime was that he came home drunk after she told him, "If you come home drunk, I'm gonna kill you." And she tried to do it.
Think about the way that that affects a child's mind.
And we think of these things as especially rare, but a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund found that 40 percent of low-income kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma, compared to only 29 percent for upper-income kids.
And think about what that really means.
If you're a low-income kid, almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma.
This is not an isolated problem.
This is a very significant issue.
We know what happens to the kids who experience that life.
They're more likely to do drugs, more likely to go to jail, more likely to drop out of high school, and most importantly, they're more likely to do to their children what their parents did to them.
This trauma, this chaos in the home, is our culture's very worst gift to our children, and it's a gift that keeps on giving.
So you combine all that, the hopelessness, the despair, the cynicism about the future, the childhood trauma, the low social capital, and you begin to understand why me, at the age of 14, was ready to become just another statistic, another kid who failed to beat the odds.
But something unexpected happened. I did beat the odds.
Things turned up for me.
I graduated from high school, from college, I went to law school, and I have a pretty good job now. So what happened?
Well, one thing that happened is that my grandparents, the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame, they really shaped up by the time I came around.
They provided me a stable home, a stable family.
They made sure that when my parents weren't able to do the things that kids need, they stepped in and filled that role.
My grandma especially did two things that really matter.
One, she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework and the things that kids should be focused on.
But she was also this incredibly perceptive woman, despite not even having a middle school education.
She recognized the message that my community had for me, that my choices didn't matter, that the deck was stacked against me.
She once told me, "JD, never be like those losers who think the deck is stacked against them.
You can do anything you want to."
And yet she recognized that life wasn't fair.
It's hard to strike that balance, to tell a kid that life isn't fair, but also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter.
But mamaw was able to strike that balance.
The other thing that really helped was the United States Marine Corps.
So we think of the Marine Corps as a military outfit, and of course it is, but for me, the US Marine Corps was a four-year crash course in character education.
It taught me how to make a bed, how to do laundry, how to wake up early, how to manage my finances.
These are things my community didn't teach me.
I remember when I went to go buy a car for the very first time, I was offered a dealer's low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent, and I was ready to sign on the dotted line.
But I didn't take that deal, because I went and took it to my officer who told me, "Stop being an idiot, go to the local credit union, and get a better deal." And so that's what I did.
But without the Marine Corps, I would have never had access to that knowledge.
I would have had a financial calamity, frankly.
The last thing I want to say is that I had a lot of good fortune in the mentors and people who have played an important role in my life.
From the Marines, from Ohio State, from Yale, from other places, people have really stepped in and ensured that they filled that social capital gap that it was pretty obvious, apparently, that I had.
That comes from good fortune, but a lot of children aren't going to have that good fortune, and I think that raises really important questions for all of us about how we're going to change that.
We need to ask questions about how we're going to give low-income kids who come from a broken home access to a loving home.
We need to ask questions about how we're going to teach low-income parents how to better interact with their children, with their partners.
We need to ask questions about how we give social capital, mentorship to low-income kids who don't have it.
We need to think about how we teach working class children about not just hard skills, like reading, mathematics, but also soft skills, like conflict resolution and financial management.
Now, I don't have all of the answers.
I don't know all of the solutions to this problem, but I do know this: in southern Ohio right now, there's a kid who is anxiously awaiting their dad, wondering whether, when he comes through the door, he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.
There's a kid whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out, and he doesn't know why she doesn't cook him dinner, and he goes to bed hungry that night.
There's a kid who has no hope for the future but desperately wants to live a better life.
They just want somebody to show it to them.
I don't have all the answers, but I know that unless our society starts asking better questions about why I was so lucky and about how to get that luck to more of our communities and our country's children, we're going to continue to have a very significant problem.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is the Bop.
The Bop is a type of social dance.
Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression that emerges from a community.
A social dance isn't choreographed by any one person.
It can't be traced to any one moment.
Each dance has steps that everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual and their creative identity.
Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change and they spread like wildfire.
They are as old as our remembered history.
In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American traditions influenced our history.
The present always contains the past.
And the past shapes who we are and who we will be.
(Clapping)
The Juba dance was born from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation.
Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans to remember where they're from.
It may have looked something like this.
Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around the slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities of West Africa.
It was about keeping cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity.
It was the same subversive spirit that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms of Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters.
The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk was performed for the masters, who never suspected they were being made fun of.
Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston.
The Charleston was all about improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston.
Started by a tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs.
Now, social dance is about community and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant you belonged to a group.
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's no surprise that the Twist can be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from the Congo during slavery.
But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement, the Twist is popularized by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist: white teenagers, kids in Latin America, making its way into songs and movies.
Through social dance, the boundaries between groups become blurred.
The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.
Along with the emergence of hip-hop, African-American social dance took on even more visibility, borrowing from its long past, shaping culture and being shaped by it.
Today, these dances continue to evolve, grow and spread.
Why do we dance? To move, to let loose, to express. Why do we dance together? To heal, to remember, to say: "We speak a common language.
We exist and we are free."
I was recently traveling in the Highlands of New Guinea, and I was talking with a man who had three wives.
I asked him, "How many wives would you like to have?" And there was this long pause, and I thought to myself, "Is he going to say five?
Is he going to say 10? Is he going to say 25?" And he leaned towards me and he whispered, "None."
(Laughter)
Eighty-six percent of human societies permit a man to have several wives: polygyny.
But in the vast majority of these cultures, only about five or ten percent of men actually do have several wives.
Having several partners can be a toothache.
In fact, co-wives can fight with each other, sometimes they can even poison each other's children.
And you've got to have a lot of cows, a lot of goats, a lot of money, a lot of land, in order to build a harem.
We are a pair-bonding species.
Ninety-seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young; human beings do.
I'm not suggesting that we're not -- that we're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners.
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures, I understand, actually, some of the genetics of it, and some of the brain circuitry of it.
It's very common around the world, but we are built to love.
How is technology changing love?
I'm going to say almost not at all. I study the brain.
I and my colleagues have put over 100 people into a brain scanner -- people who had just fallen happily in love, people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long-term.
And it is possible to remain "in love" long-term.
And I've long ago maintained that we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction: sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love and feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a long-term partner.
And together, these three brain systems -- with many other parts of the brain -- orchestrate our sexual, our romantic and our family lives.
But they lie way below the cortex, way below the limbic system where we feel our emotions, generate our emotions.
They lie in the most primitive parts of the brain, linked with energy, focus, craving, motivation, wanting and drive.
In this case, the drive to win life's greatest prize: a mating partner.
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago among our first ancestors, and they're not going to change if you swipe left or right on Tinder.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
There's no question that technology is changing the way we court: emailing, texting, emojis to express your emotions, sexting, "liking" a photograph, selfies ... We're seeing new rules and taboos for how to court.
But, you know -- is this actually dramatically changing love?
What about the late 1940s, when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?
(Laughter)
How about the introduction of the birth control pill?
Unchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin, women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality.
Even dating sites are not changing love.
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com, I've been it for 11 years.
I keep telling them and they agree with me, that these are not dating sites, they are introducing sites.
When you sit down in a bar, in a coffee house, on a park bench, your ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened, and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors did 100,000 years ago.
We can give you various people -- all the dating sites can -- but the only real algorithm is your own human brain.
Technology is not going to change that.
Technology is also not going to change who you choose to love.
I study the biology of personality, and I've come to believe that we've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving, linked with the dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen systems.
So I created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits -- the constellation of traits -- linked with each of these four brain systems.
I then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in 40 countries.
Fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire, and I've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to whom.
And as it turns out, those who were very expressive of the dopamine system tend to be curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic -- I would imagine there's an awful lot of people like that in this room -- they're drawn to people like themselves.
Curious, creative people need people like themselves.
People who are very expressive of the serotonin system tend to be traditional, conventional, they follow the rules, they respect authority, they tend to be religious -- religiosity is in the serotonin system -- and traditional people go for traditional people.
In that way, similarity attracts.
In the other two cases, opposites attract.
People very expressive of the testosterone system tend to be analytical, logical, direct, decisive, and they go for their opposite: they go for somebody who's high estrogen, somebody who's got very good verbal skills and people skills, who's very intuitive and who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive.
We have natural patterns of mate choice.
Modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love.
But technology is producing one modern trend that I find particularly important.
It's associated with the concept of paradox of choice.
For millions of years, we lived in little hunting and gathering groups.
You didn't have the opportunity to choose between 1,000 people on a dating site.
In fact, I've been studying this recently, and I actually think there's some sort of sweet spot in the brain; I don't know what it is, but apparently, from reading a lot of the data, we can embrace about five to nine alternatives, and after that, you get into what academics call "cognitive overload," and you don't choose any.
So I've come to think that due to this cognitive overload, we're ushering in a new form of courtship that I call "slow love." I arrived at this during my work with Match.com. Every year for the last six years, we've done a study called "Singles in America." We don't poll the Match population, we poll the American population.
We use 5,000-plus people, a representative sample of Americans based on the US census.
We've got data now on over 30,000 people, and every single year, I see some of the same patterns.
Every single year when I ask the question, over 50 percent of people have had a one-night stand -- not necessarily last year, but in their lives -- 50 percent have had a friends with benefits during the course of their lives, and over 50 percent have lived with a person long-term before marrying.
Americans think that this is reckless.
I have doubted that for a long time; the patterns are too strong.
There's got to be some Darwinian explanation -- Not that many people are crazy.
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic that really came home to me.
It was a very interesting academic article in which I found that 67 percent of singles in America today who are living long-term with somebody, have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce.
They're terrified of the social, legal, emotional, economic consequences of divorce.
So I came to realize that I don't think this is recklessness; I think it's caution.
Today's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed.
You learn a lot between the sheets, not only about how somebody makes love, but whether they're kind, whether they can listen and at my age, whether they've got a sense of humor.
(Laughter)
And in an age where we have too many choices, we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage, I think people are taking their time to love.
And actually, what's happening is, what we're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage before you tie the knot.
Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale.
But the human brain --
(Laughter)
The human brain always triumphs, and indeed, in the United States today, 86 percent of Americans will marry by age 49.
And even in cultures around the world where they're not marrying as often, they are settling down eventually with a long-term partner.
So it began to occur to me: during this long extension of the precommitment stage, if you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry, maybe we're going to see more happy marriages.
So I did a study of 1,100 married people in America -- not on Match.com, of course -- and I asked them a lot of questions.
But one of the questions was, "Would you re-marry the person you're currently married to?" And 81 percent said, "Yes."
In fact, the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology.
It's not even slow love.
It's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world.
For millions of years, our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups.
Women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double-income family was the rule.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
Then the environment changed some 10,000 years ago, we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women became obliged, really, to marry the right person, from the right background, from the right religion and from the right kin and social and political connections.
Men's jobs became more important: they had to move the rocks, fell the trees, plow the land.
They brought the produce to local markets, and came home with the equivalent of money.
Along with this, we see a rise of a host of beliefs: the belief of virginity at marriage, arranged marriages -- strictly arranged marriages -- the belief that the man is the head of the household, that the wife's place is in the home and most important, honor thy husband, and 'til death do us part. These are gone. They are going, and in many places, they are gone.
We are right now in a marriage revolution.
We are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes -- something I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
I'm not a Pollyanna; there's a great deal to cry about.
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures, I've studied, as I say, adultery in many -- there's a whole pile of problems.
As William Butler Yeats, the poet, once said, "Love is the crooked thing." I would add, "Nobody gets out alive."
(Laughter)
We all have problems. But in fact, I think the poet Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.
He said, "The dark, uneasy world of family life -- where the greatest can fail, and the humblest succeed."
But I will leave you with this: love and attachment will prevail, technology cannot change it.
And I will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships must take into account one the most powerful determinants of human behavior: the unquenchable, adaptable and primordial human drive to love.
Thank you.
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much for that, Helen.
As you know, there's another speaker here with us that works in your same field.
She comes at it from a different perspective.
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples.
You study data, Esther studies the stories the couples tell her when they come to her for help.
Let's have her join us on the stage. Esther?
(Applause)
So Esther, when you were watching Helen's talk, was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you'd like to comment on?
Esther Perel: It's interesting, because on the one hand, the need for love is ubiquitous and universal.
But the way we love -- the meaning we make out of it -- the rules that govern our relationships, I think, are changing fundamentally.
We come from a model that, until now, was primarily regulated around duty and obligation, the needs of the collective and loyalty.
And we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual rights, and self-fulfillment and happiness.
And so, that was the first thing I thought, that the need doesn't change, but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot.
On the paradox of choice -- you know, on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness, I think, to be able to have so many options.
And at the same time, as you talk about this cognitive overload, I see many, many people who ... who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this massa of choice, creating a case of "FOMO" and then leading us -- FOMO, fear of missed opportunity, or fear of missing out -- it's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' -- the right one?"
So we've created what I call this thing of "stable ambiguity." Stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in intimacy-building.
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup.
So, here on the internet you have three major ones.
One is icing and simmering, which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries.
(Laughter)
Yeah?
And then comes ghosting. And ghosting is, basically, you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot, and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another, because you're making it invisible even to yourself.
(Laughter)
Yeah?
So I was thinking -- these words came up for me as I was listening to you, like how a vocabulary also creates a reality, and at the same time, that's my question to you: Do you think when the context changes, it still means that the nature of love remains the same?
You study the brain and I study people's relationships and stories, so I think it's everything you say, plus.
But I don't always know the degree to which a changing context ... Does it at some point begin to change -- If the meaning changes, does it change the need, or is the need clear of the entire context?
HF: Wow! Well --
Well, I've got three points here, right?
First of all, to your first one: there's no question that we've changed, that we now want a person to love, and for thousands of years, we had to marry the right person from the right background and right kin connection.
And in fact, in my studies of 5,000 people every year, I ask them, "What are you looking for?" And every single year, over 97 percent say --
EP: The list grows --
HF: Well, no.
The basic thing is over 97 percent of people want somebody that respects them, somebody they can trust and confide in, somebody who makes them laugh, somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive. That never changes. And there's certainly -- you know, there's two parts --
EP: But you know how I call that?
That's not what people used to say --
HF: That's exactly right.
EP: They said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship, economic support, children.
We went from a production economy to a service economy.
(Laughter)
We did it in the larger culture, and we're doing it in marriage.
HF: Right, no question about it.
But it's interesting, the millennials actually want to be very good parents, whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused on being a good parent.
You see all of these nuances.
There's two basic parts of personality: there's your culture -- everything you grew up to do and believe and say -- and there's your temperament.
Basically, what I've been talking about is your temperament.
And that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs.
And in terms of the paradox of choice, there's no question about it that this is a pickle.
There were millions of years where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hole, and you went for it.
EP: Yes, but you --
HF: I do want to say one more thing.
The bottom line is, in hunting and gathering societies, they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives.
They weren't square!
And I'm not suggesting that we do, but the bottom line is, we've always had alternatives.
Mankind is always -- in fact, the brain is well-built to what we call "equilibrate," to try and decide: Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?
How do I handle this there? And so I think we're seeing another play-out of that now.
KS: Well, thank you both so much.
I think you're going to have a million dinner partners for tonight!
I'd like you to imagine the world anew.
I'd like to show you some maps, which have been drawn by Ben Hennig, of the planet in a way that most of you will never have seen the planet depicted before.
Here's an image that you're very familiar with.
I'm old enough that I was actually born before we saw this image.
Apparently some of my first words were "moona, moona," but I think that's my mom having a particular fantasy about what her baby boy could see on the flickering black and white TV screen.
It's only been a few centuries since we've actually, most of us, thought of our planet as spherical.
When we first saw these images in the 1960s, the world was changing at an incredible rate.
In my own little discipline of human geography, a cartographer called Waldo Tobler was drawing new maps of the planet, and these maps have now spread, and I'm going to show you one of them now.
This map is a map of the world, but it's a map which looks to you a little bit strange.
It's a map in which we stretched places, so that those areas which contain many people are drawn larger, and those areas, like the Sahara and the Himalayas, in which there are few people, have been shrunk away.
Everybody on the planet is given an equal amount of space.
The cities are shown shining bright.
The lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes.
And there's one particular line that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian through past Singapore, through the Suez Canal, through the Mediterranean and round to Rotterdam.
And it's showing you the route of what was the world's largest ship just a year ago, a ship which was taking so many containers of goods that when they were unloaded, if the lorries had all gone in convoy, they would have been 100 kilometers long.
This is how our world is now connected.
This is the quantity of stuff we are now moving around the world, just on one ship, on one voyage, in five weeks.
We've lived in cities for a very long time, but most of us didn't live in cities.
This is Çatalhöyük, one of the world's first cities.
At its peak 9,000 years ago, people had to walk over the roofs of others' houses to get to their home.
If you look carefully at the map of the city, you'll see it has no streets, because streets are something we invented. The world changes. It changes by trial and error.
We work out slowly and gradually how to live in better ways.
And the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently.
It's only within the last six, seven, or eight generations that we have actually realized that we are a species.
It's only within the last few decades that a map like this could be drawn.
Again, the underlying map is the map of world population, but over it, you're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of Africa with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times.
I have to redraw this map every few months, because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date was wrong.
We are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed.
And we're changing.
A lot of change is gradual. It's accretion. We don't notice the change because we only have short lives, 70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.
This graph is showing you the annual rate of population growth in the world.
It was very low until around about 1850, and then the rate of population growth began to rise so that around the time I was born, when we first saw those images from the moon of our planet, our global population was growing at two percent a year.
If it had carried on growing at two percent a year for just another couple of centuries, the entire planet would be covered with a seething mass of human bodies all touching each other.
And people were scared.
They were scared of population growth and what they called "the population bomb" in 1968.
But then, if you look at the end of the graph, the growth began to slow.
The decade -- the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, the noughties, and in this decade, even faster -- our population growth is slowing.
Our planet is stabilizing.
We are heading towards nine, 10, or 11 billion people by the end of the century.
Within that change, you can see tumult.
You can see the Second World War.
You can see the pandemic in 1918 from influenza.
You can see the great Chinese famine.
These are the events we tend to concentrate on.
We tend to concentrate on the terrible events in the news.
We don't tend to concentrate on the gradual change and the good news stories.
We worry about people. We worry about how many people there are.
We worry about how you can get away from people.
But this is the map of the world changed again to make area large, the further away people are from each area.
So if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody, here's the best places to go.
And every year, these areas get bigger, because every year, we are coming off the land globally.
We are moving into the cities.
We are packing in more densely.
There are wolves again in Europe, and the wolves are moving west across the continent.
Our world is changing.
You have worries. This is a map showing where the water falls on our planet.
We now know that.
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was, where three continents meet, Africa, Asia, and Europe, and you can see there are a large number of people living there in areas with very little water.
And you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well.
And we can get a bit more sophisticated.
Instead of making the map be shaped by people, we can shape the map by water, and then we can change it every month to show the amount of water falling on every small part of the globe.
And you see the monsoons moving around the planet, and the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat.
And all of this only became possible within my lifetime to see this is where we are living.
We have enough water.
This is a map of where we grow our food in the world.
This is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn.
People worry that there won't be enough food, but we know, if we just ate less meat and fed less of the crops to animals, there is enough food for everybody as long as we think of ourselves as one group of people.
And we also know about what we do so terribly badly nowadays.
You will have seen this map of the world before.
This is the map produced by taking satellite images, if you remember those satellites around the planet in the very first slide I showed, and producing an image of what the Earth looks like at night.
When you normally see that map, on a normal map, the kind of map that most of you will be used to, you think you are seeing a map of where people live.
Where the lights are shining up is where people live.
But here, on this image of the world, remember we've stretched the map again.
Everywhere has the same density of people on this map.
If an area doesn't have people, we've shrunk it away to make it disappear.
So we're showing everybody with equal prominence.
Now, the lights no longer show you where people are, because people are everywhere.
Now the lights on the map, the lights in London, the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo, the lights on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, the lights show you where people live who are so profligate with energy that they can afford to spend money powering lights to shine up into the sky, so satellites can draw an image like this.
And the areas that are dark on the map are either areas where people do not have access to that much energy, or areas where people do, but they have learned to stop shining the light up into the sky.
And if I could show you this map animated over time, you would see that Tokyo has actually become darker, because ever since the tsunami in Japan, Japan has had to rely on a quarter less electricity because it turned the nuclear power stations off.
And the world didn't end.
You just shone less light up into the sky.
There are a huge number of good news stories in the world.
Infant mortality is falling and has been falling at an incredible rate.
A few years ago, the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year.
More children are going to school and learning to read and write and getting connected to the Internet and going on to go to university than ever before at an incredible rate, and the highest number of young people going to university in the world are women, not men.
I can give you good news story after good news story about what is getting better in the planet, but we tend to concentrate on the bad news that is immediate.
Rebecca Solnit, I think, put it brilliantly, when she explained: "The accretion of incremental, imperceptible changes which can constitute progress and which render our era dramatically different from the past" -- the past was much more stable -- "a contrast obscured by the undramatic nature of gradual transformation, punctuated by occasional tumult." Occasionally, terrible things happen.
You are shown those terrible things on the news every night of the week.
You are not told about the population slowing down.
You are not told about the world becoming more connected.
You are not told about the incredible improvements in understanding.
You are not told about how we are learning to begin to waste less and consume less.
This is my last map. On this map, we have taken the seas and the oceans out.
Now you are just looking at about 7.4 billion people with the map drawn in proportion to those people.
You're looking at over a billion in China, and you can see the largest city in the world in China, but you do not know its name.
You can see that India is in the center of this world.
You can see that Europe is on the edge.
And we in Exeter today are on the far edge of the planet.
We are on a tiny scrap of rock off Europe which contains less than one percent of the world's adults, and less than half a percent of the world's children.
We are living in a stabilizing world, an urbanizing world, an aging world, a connecting world.
There are many, many things to be frightened about, but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do, and we need to see that we are now living in a new world.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about a failure of intuition that many of us suffer from.
It's really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger.
I'm going to describe a scenario that I think is both terrifying and likely to occur, and that's not a good combination, as it turns out.
And yet rather than be scared, most of you will feel that what I'm talking about is kind of cool.
I'm going to describe how the gains we make in artificial intelligence could ultimately destroy us.
And in fact, I think it's very difficult to see how they won't destroy us or inspire us to destroy ourselves.
And yet if you're anything like me, you'll find that it's fun to think about these things.
And that response is part of the problem. OK? That response should worry you.
And if I were to convince you in this talk that we were likely to suffer a global famine, either because of climate change or some other catastrophe, and that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are very likely to live like this, you wouldn't think, "Interesting.
I like this TED Talk."
Famine isn't fun. Death by science fiction, on the other hand, is fun, and one of the things that worries me most about the development of AI at this point is that we seem unable to marshal an appropriate emotional response to the dangers that lie ahead.
I am unable to marshal this response, and I'm giving this talk.
It's as though we stand before two doors.
Behind door number one, we stop making progress in building intelligent machines.
Our computer hardware and software just stops getting better for some reason.
Now take a moment to consider why this might happen.
I mean, given how valuable intelligence and automation are, we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to.
What could stop us from doing this?
A full-scale nuclear war? A global pandemic? An asteroid impact? Justin Bieber becoming president of the United States?
(Laughter)
The point is, something would have to destroy civilization as we know it.
You have to imagine how bad it would have to be to prevent us from making improvements in our technology permanently, generation after generation.
Almost by definition, this is the worst thing that's ever happened in human history.
So the only alternative, and this is what lies behind door number two, is that we continue to improve our intelligent machines year after year after year.
At a certain point, we will build machines that are smarter than we are, and once we have machines that are smarter than we are, they will begin to improve themselves.
And then we risk what the mathematician IJ Good called an "intelligence explosion," that the process could get away from us.
Now, this is often caricatured, as I have here, as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us.
But that isn't the most likely scenario.
It's not that our machines will become spontaneously malevolent.
The concern is really that we will build machines that are so much more competent than we are that the slightest divergence between their goals and our own could destroy us.
Just think about how we relate to ants. We don't hate them.
We don't go out of our way to harm them.
In fact, sometimes we take pains not to harm them. We step over them on the sidewalk. But whenever their presence seriously conflicts with one of our goals, let's say when constructing a building like this one, we annihilate them without a qualm.
The concern is that we will one day build machines that, whether they're conscious or not, could treat us with similar disregard.
Now, I suspect this seems far-fetched to many of you.
I bet there are those of you who doubt that superintelligent AI is possible, much less inevitable.
But then you must find something wrong with one of the following assumptions.
And there are only three of them.
Intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems.
Actually, this is a little bit more than an assumption.
We have already built narrow intelligence into our machines, and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman intelligence already.
And we know that mere matter can give rise to what is called "general intelligence," an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains, because our brains have managed it. Right? I mean, there's just atoms in here, and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior, we will eventually, unless we are interrupted, we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines.
It's crucial to realize that the rate of progress doesn't matter, because any progress is enough to get us into the end zone.
We don't need Moore's law to continue. We don't need exponential progress.
We just need to keep going.
The second assumption is that we will keep going.
We will continue to improve our intelligent machines.
And given the value of intelligence -- I mean, intelligence is either the source of everything we value or we need it to safeguard everything we value.
It is our most valuable resource.
So we want to do this.
We have problems that we desperately need to solve.
We want to cure diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.
We want to understand economic systems.
We want to improve our climate science.
So we will do this, if we can.
The train is already out of the station, and there's no brake to pull.
Finally, we don't stand on a peak of intelligence, or anywhere near it, likely.
And this really is the crucial insight.
This is what makes our situation so precarious, and this is what makes our intuitions about risk so unreliable.
Now, just consider the smartest person who has ever lived.
On almost everyone's shortlist here is John von Neumann.
I mean, the impression that von Neumann made on the people around him, and this included the greatest mathematicians and physicists of his time, is fairly well-documented.
If only half the stories about him are half true, there's no question he's one of the smartest people who has ever lived.
So consider the spectrum of intelligence.
Here we have John von Neumann.
And then we have you and me.
And then we have a chicken.
(Laughter)
Sorry, a chicken.
(Laughter)
There's no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be.
(Laughter)
It seems overwhelmingly likely, however, that the spectrum of intelligence extends much further than we currently conceive, and if we build machines that are more intelligent than we are, they will very likely explore this spectrum in ways that we can't imagine, and exceed us in ways that we can't imagine.
And it's important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed alone. Right? So imagine if we just built a superintelligent AI that was no smarter than your average team of researchers at Stanford or MIT.
Well, electronic circuits function about a million times faster than biochemical ones, so this machine should think about a million times faster than the minds that built it.
So you set it running for a week, and it will perform 20,000 years of human-level intellectual work, week after week after week.
How could we even understand, much less constrain, a mind making this sort of progress?
The other thing that's worrying, frankly, is that, imagine the best case scenario.
So imagine we hit upon a design of superintelligent AI that has no safety concerns.
We have the perfect design the first time around.
It's as though we've been handed an oracle that behaves exactly as intended.
Well, this machine would be the perfect labor-saving device.
It can design the machine that can build the machine that can do any physical work, powered by sunlight, more or less for the cost of raw materials.
So we're talking about the end of human drudgery.
We're also talking about the end of most intellectual work.
So what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance?
Well, we'd be free to play Frisbee and give each other massages.
Add some LSD and some questionable wardrobe choices, and the whole world could be like Burning Man.
(Laughter)
Now, that might sound pretty good, but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic and political order?
It seems likely that we would witness a level of wealth inequality and unemployment that we have never seen before.
Absent a willingness to immediately put this new wealth to the service of all humanity, a few trillionaires could grace the covers of our business magazines while the rest of the world would be free to starve.
And what would the Russians or the Chinese do if they heard that some company in Silicon Valley was about to deploy a superintelligent AI?
This machine would be capable of waging war, whether terrestrial or cyber, with unprecedented power.
This is a winner-take-all scenario.
To be six months ahead of the competition here is to be 500,000 years ahead, at a minimum.
So it seems that even mere rumors of this kind of breakthrough could cause our species to go berserk.
Now, one of the most frightening things, in my view, at this moment, are the kinds of things that AI researchers say when they want to be reassuring.
And the most common reason we're told not to worry is time.
This is all a long way off, don't you know.
This is probably 50 or 100 years away.
One researcher has said, "Worrying about AI safety is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars." This is the Silicon Valley version of "don't worry your pretty little head about it."
(Laughter)
No one seems to notice that referencing the time horizon is a total non sequitur.
If intelligence is just a matter of information processing, and we continue to improve our machines, we will produce some form of superintelligence.
And we have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely.
Let me say that again.
to create the conditions to do that safely. We have no idea how long it will take us
And if you haven't noticed, 50 years is not what it used to be.
This is 50 years in months.
This is how long we've had the iPhone.
This is how long "The Simpsons" has been on television.
Fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face.
Once again, we seem to be failing to have an appropriate emotional response to what we have every reason to believe is coming.
The computer scientist Stuart Russell has a nice analogy here.
He said, imagine that we received a message from an alien civilization, which read: "People of Earth, we will arrive on your planet in 50 years.
Get ready." And now we're just counting down the months until the mothership lands?
We would feel a little more urgency than we do.
Another reason we're told not to worry is that these machines can't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves.
They'll be grafted onto our brains, and we'll essentially become their limbic systems.
Now take a moment to consider that the safest and only prudent path forward, recommended, is to implant this technology directly into our brains.
Now, this may in fact be the safest and only prudent path forward, but usually one's safety concerns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you stick it inside your head.
(Laughter)
The deeper problem is that building superintelligent AI on its own seems likely to be easier than building superintelligent AI and having the completed neuroscience that allows us to seamlessly integrate our minds with it.
And given that the companies and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves as being in a race against all others, given that to win this race is to win the world, provided you don't destroy it in the next moment, then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do will get done first.
Now, unfortunately, I don't have a solution to this problem, apart from recommending that more of us think about it.
I think we need something like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence.
Not to build it, because I think we'll inevitably do that, but to understand how to avoid an arms race and to build it in a way that is aligned with our interests.
When you're talking about superintelligent AI that can make changes to itself, it seems that we only have one chance to get the initial conditions right, and even then we will need to absorb the economic and political consequences of getting them right.
But the moment we admit that information processing is the source of intelligence, that some appropriate computational system is what the basis of intelligence is, and we admit that we will improve these systems continuously, and we admit that the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know, then we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god.
Now would be a good time to make sure it's a god we can live with.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?
I would be shocked if you hadn't.
This is a technology -- it's for genome editing -- and it's so versatile and so controversial that it's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations.
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?
Should we edit a human embryo?
And my personal favorite: How can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the Earth, using this technology?
This type of science is moving much faster than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it.
And so, for the past six years, I've made it my personal mission to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications.
Now, CRISPR has been the subject of a huge media hype, and the words that are used most often are "easy" and "cheap." So what I want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the myths and the realities around CRISPR.
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome, the first thing that you have to do is damage the DNA.
The damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix.
And then the cellular repair processes kick in, and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want, and not a natural edit. That's how it works. It's a two-part system.
You've got a Cas9 protein and something called a guide RNA.
I like to think of it as a guided missile.
So the Cas9 -- I love to anthropomorphize -- so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing that wants to chew DNA, and the guide RNA is the leash that's keeping it out of the genome until it finds the exact spot where it matches.
And the combination of those two is called CRISPR.
It's a system that we stole from an ancient, ancient bacterial immune system.
The part that's amazing about it is that the guide RNA, only 20 letters of it, are what target the system.
This is really easy to design, and it's really cheap to buy.
So that's the part that is modular in the system; everything else stays the same.
This makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use.
The guide RNA and the Cas9 protein complex together go bouncing along the genome, and when they find a spot where the guide RNA matches, then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix, it rips them apart, that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut, and all of a sudden, you've got a cell that's in total panic because now it's got a piece of DNA that's broken.
What does it do? It calls its first responders.
There are two major repair pathways.
The first just takes the DNA and shoves the two pieces back together.
This isn't a very efficient system, because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added.
It's an OK way to maybe, like, knock out a gene, but it's not the way that we really want to do genome editing.
The second repair pathway is a lot more interesting.
In this repair pathway, it takes a homologous piece of DNA.
And now mind you, in a diploid organism like people, we've got one copy of our genome from our mom and one from our dad, so if one gets damaged, it can use the other chromosome to repair it. So that's where this comes from. The repair is made, and now the genome is safe again.
The way that we can hijack this is we can feed it a false piece of DNA, a piece that has homology on both ends but is different in the middle.
So now, you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled.
So you can change a letter, you can take letters out, but most importantly, you can stuff new DNA in, kind of like a Trojan horse.
CRISPR is going to be amazing, in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it's going to catalyze.
The thing that's special about it is this modular targeting system.
I mean, we've been shoving DNA into organisms for years, right?
But because of the modular targeting system, we can actually put it exactly where we want it.
The thing is that there's a lot of talk about it being cheap and it being easy.
And I run a community lab.
I'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like,
"Hey, can I come to your open night and, like, maybe use CRISPR and engineer my genome?"
(Laugher)
Like, seriously.
I'm, "No, you can't."
(Laughter)
"But I've heard it's cheap. I've heard it's easy."
We're going to explore that a little bit.
So, how cheap is it?
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.
It's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars, and it cuts the time a lot, too.
It can cut it from weeks to days. That's great. You still need a professional lab to do the work in; you're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab.
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table.
It's really not easy to do this kind of work.
Not to mention, there's a patent battle going on, so even if you do invent something, the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are in this incredible patent battle.
It's really fascinating to watch it happen, because they're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they've got people saying, "Oh, well, I signed my notebook here or there." This isn't going to be settled for years.
And when it is, you can bet you're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee in order to use this stuff.
So, is it really cheap?
Well, it's cheap if you're doing basic research and you've got a lab.
How about easy? Let's look at that claim. The devil is always in the details.
We don't really know that much about cells.
They're still kind of black boxes.
For example, we don't know why some guide RNAs work really well and some guide RNAs don't.
We don't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the other.
And besides that, there's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place.
In a petri dish, that's not that hard, but if you're trying to do it on a whole organism, it gets really tricky.
It's OK if you use something like blood or bone marrow -- those are the targets of a lot of research now.
There was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out, editing it, and putting it back with a precursor of CRISPR.
And this is a line of research that people are going to do.
But right now, if you want to get into the whole body, you're probably going to have to use a virus.
So you take the virus, you put the CRISPR into it, you let the virus infect the cell.
But now you've got this virus in there, and we don't know what the long-term effects of that are.
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects, a very small percentage, but they're still there.
What's going to happen over time with that?
These are not trivial questions, and there are scientists that are trying to solve them, and they will eventually, hopefully, be solved.
But it ain't plug-and-play, not by a long shot.
So: Is it really easy?
Well, if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system, yes, it is.
Now the other thing is, we don't really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen by changing particular spots in the genome.
We're a long way away from figuring out how to give a pig wings, for example.
Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle for an extra leg.
That would be kind of cool, right?
But what is happening is that CRISPR is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really, really important work, like making better models of diseases in animals, for example, or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats, or even doing really basic research on what genes do.
This is the story of CRISPR we should be telling, and I don't like it that the flashier aspects of it are drowning all of this out.
Lots of scientists did a lot of work to make CRISPR happen, and what's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society.
Think about it. We've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people to spend all their time doing research.
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR, and I would say that makes us all the shepherds of CRISPR.
We all have a responsibility.
So I would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies, because, really, only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies, the use of these technologies and make sure that, in the end, it's a positive outcome -- for both the planet and for us.
Thanks.
(Applause)
When Dorothy was a little girl, she was fascinated by her goldfish.
Her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the water.
Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded, "Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads."
(Laughter) In her mind, it was a fact as true as any other.
Fish swim backwards by wagging their heads. She believed it.
Our lives are full of fish swimming backwards.
We make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic. We harbor bias. We know that we are right, and they are wrong.
We fear the worst.
We strive for unattainable perfection.
We tell ourselves what we can and cannot do.
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we don't even notice them.
I'm going to tell you five facts about myself.
One fact is not true.
One: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics.
Two: I currently run a construction company in Orlando.
Three: I starred on a television sitcom.
Four: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease.
Five: I served as a law clerk to two US Supreme Court justices.
Which fact is not true?
Actually, they're all true. Yeah. They're all true.
At this point, most people really only care about the television show.
(Laughter)
I know this from experience.
OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class." And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show, which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy.
(Laughter)
Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness? Why is that? We make assumptions about so-called disabilities.
As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day.
My point today is not about my blindness, however.
It's about my vision.
Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open.
It taught me to spot those backwards-swimming fish that our minds create.
Going blind cast them into focus.
What does it feel like to see?
It's immediate and passive.
You open your eyes and there's the world. Seeing is believing. Sight is truth. Right? Well, that's what I thought.
Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated.
My sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions.
The salesperson I was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin.
Reaching down to wash my hands, I suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink, when my fingers felt its true shape.
A friend described the photograph in my hand, and only then I could see the image depicted.
Objects appeared, morphed and disappeared in my reality.
It was difficult and exhausting to see.
I pieced together fragmented, transitory images, consciously analyzed the clues, searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope, until I saw nothing at all.
I learned that what we see is not universal truth.
It is not objective reality.
What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain.
Let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience.
Your visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain. That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing.
Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information.
The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.
So sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources.
It's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling.
But make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion.
Here's where it gets interesting.
To create the experience of sight, your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world, other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention.
All of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight.
These linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously.
So for example, what you see impacts how you feel, and the way you feel can literally change what you see.
Numerous studies demonstrate this.
If you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video, for example, your answer will be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles.
A hill appears steeper if you've just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if you're wearing a heavy backpack.
We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.
What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you.
You create your own reality, and you believe it.
I believed mine until it broke apart. The deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion.
You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality.
We create our own realities in many other ways.
Let's take fear as just one example.
Your fears distort your reality.
Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain.
Fear fills the void at all costs, passing off what you dread for what you know, offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous, substituting assumption for reason.
Psychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing.
(Laughter)
Right? Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.
Now, fear is self-realizing.
When you face the greatest need to look outside yourself and think critically, fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind, shrinking and distorting your view, drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions.
When you face a compelling opportunity to take action, fear lulls you into inaction, enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves.
When I was diagnosed with my blinding disease, I knew blindness would ruin my life.
Blindness was a death sentence for my independence.
It was the end of achievement for me.
Blindness meant I would live an unremarkable life, small and sad, and likely alone. I knew it. This was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed it.
It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind.
If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived it.
I am certain of that.
So how do you live your life eyes wide open?
It is a learned discipline.
It can be taught.
It can be practiced.
I will summarize very briefly.
Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail.
See beyond your fears. Recognize your assumptions. Harness your internal strength.
Silence your internal critic.
Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success.
Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference.
Open your hearts to your bountiful blessings.
Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains -- they are your excuses, rationalizations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender.
They are fictions you perceive as reality.
Choose to see through them.
Choose to let them go.
You are the creator of your reality.
With that empowerment comes complete responsibility.
I chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined. I chose to build there a blessed life.
Far from alone, I share my beautiful life with Dorothy, my beautiful wife, with our triplets, whom we call the Tripskys, and with the latest addition to the family, sweet baby Clementine.
What do you fear? What lies do you tell yourself?
How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions?
What reality are you creating for yourself?
In your career and personal life, in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your backwards-swimming fish do you great harm.
They exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential, and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection.
I urge you to search them out.
Helen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
For me, going blind was a profound blessing, because blindness gave me vision.
I hope you can see what I see.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question.
This is an audience of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators.
You are a CEO of a company down in Florida, and many are probably wondering, how is it to be a blind CEO?
What kind of specific challenges do you have, and how do you overcome them?
Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became a blessing.
I don't get visual feedback from people.
BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah. So, for example, in my leadership team meetings, I don't see facial expressions or gestures.
I've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback.
I basically force people to tell me what they think.
And in this respect, it's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company, because we communicate at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters.
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world's universal language, for better or for worse.
Let's face it, it's the language of the internet, it's the language of finance, it's the language of air traffic control, of popular music, diplomacy -- English is everywhere.
Now, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people, but more Chinese people are learning English than English speakers are learning Chinese.
Last I heard, there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English.
English is taking over.
And in addition to that, it's been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now -- there are about 6,000 -- will no longer be spoken.
There will only be some hundreds left.
And on top of that, it's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible, but it gets better every year.
The reason I'm reciting those things to you is because I can tell that we're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked, which is: Why should we learn foreign languages -- other than if English happens to be foreign to one?
Why bother to learn another one when it's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one?
I think there are a lot of reasons, but I first want to address the one that you're probably most likely to have heard of, because actually it's more dangerous than you might think.
And that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts, that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind of acid trip, so to speak.
That is a marvelously enticing idea, but it's kind of fraught.
So it's not that it's untrue completely.
So for example, in French and Spanish the word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine.
So, "la table," "la mesa," you just have to deal with it.
It has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be asked how you would imagine a table talking, then much more often than could possibly be an accident, a French or a Spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high and feminine voice.
So if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl, as opposed to if you are an English speaker.
It's hard not to love data like that, and many people will tell you that that means that there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages.
But you have to watch out, because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope, the us being those of us who speak English natively. What is the worldview from English?
So for example, let's take an English speaker. Up on the screen, that is Bono. He speaks English. I presume he has a worldview.
Now, that is Donald Trump.
In his way, he speaks English as well.
(Laughter)
And here is Ms. Kardashian, and she is an English speaker, too.
So here are three speakers of the English language.
What worldview do those three people have in common?
What worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them?
It's a highly fraught concept.
And so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought, but it tends to be in rather darling, obscure psychological flutters.
It's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world.
Now, if that's the case, then why learn languages?
If it isn't going to change the way you think, what would the other reasons be? There are some. One of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture, if you want to drink it in, if you want to become part of it, then whether or not the language channels the culture -- and that seems doubtful -- if you want to imbibe the culture, you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in.
There's no other way.
There's an interesting illustration of this.
I have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out.
There's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand -- read out in English on the page, "Dennis Ar-cand," if you want to look him up.
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal." And many of the characters are vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian, French-speaking women.
There's one scene closest to the end, where they have to take a friend to an Anglophone hospital.
In the hospital, they have to speak English.
Now, they speak English but it's not their native language, they'd rather not speak English.
And they speak it more slowly, they have accents, they're not idiomatic.
Suddenly these characters that you've fallen in love with become husks of themselves, they're shadows of themselves.
To go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture.
And so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be left, one reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them, just by virtue of the fact that it is their code. So that's one reason.
Second reason: it's been shown that if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in, and that you are probably a better multitasker.
And these are factors that set in early, and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language. Bilingualism is healthy.
And then, third -- languages are just an awful lot of fun.
Much more fun than we're often told.
So for example, Arabic: "kataba," he wrote, "yaktubu," he writes, she writes. "Uktub," write, in the imperative.
What do those things have in common?
All those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars.
They stay still, and the vowels dance around the consonants.
Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths?
You can get that from Hebrew, you can get that from Ethiopia's main language, Amharic. That's fun.
Or languages have different word orders.
Learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country, or the feeling that you get when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle.
A language can do that to you.
So for example, "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back," a book that I'm sure we all often return to, like "Moby Dick." One phrase in it is, "Do you know where I found him?
Do you know where he was?
He was eating cake in the tub, Yes he was! "Fine.
Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master, "You can know, I did where him find?
He was tub inside gorging cake, No mistake gorging chewing!" That just feels good.
Imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time.
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?
Me either, but if I did, I would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker's dozen of vowels like English has, but a good 30 different vowels scooching and oozing around in the Cambodian mouth like bees in a hive.
That is what a language can get you.
And more to the point, we live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language.
It used to be that you had to go to a classroom, and there would be some diligent teacher -- some genius teacher in there -- but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times.
You had to go to class.
If you didn't have that, you had something called a record.
I cut my teeth on those.
There was only so much data on a record, or a cassette, or even that antique object known as a CD.
Other than that you had books that didn't work, that's just the way it was.
Today you can lay down -- lie on your living room floor, sipping bourbon, and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone.
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well.
You can do it any time, therefore you can do it more and better.
You can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages.
I take some "Dilbert" in various languages every single morning; it can increase your skills.
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people.
So I highly recommend that you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking, because there's never been a better time to do it.
It's an awful lot of fun.
It won't change your mind, but it will most certainly blow your mind.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Good evening. My journey to this stage began when I came to America at the age of 17.
You see, I'm one of the 84 million Americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants.
Each of us has a dream when we come here, a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed.
I was one of the lucky ones.
My revised dream led me to the work I do today: training immigrants to run for public office and leading a movement for inclusive democracy.
But I don't want you to think it was a cakewalk, that America opened its arms wide and welcomed me.
It's still not doing that.
And I've learned a few lessons along the way that I wanted to share with you, because I think that together we can make American democracy better and stronger.
I was born in India, the world's largest democracy, and when I was four, my family moved to Belize, the world's smallest democracy perhaps.
And at the age of 17, I moved to the United States, the world's greatest democracy.
I came because I wanted to study English literature.
You see, as a child, I buried my nose in books, and I thought, why not make a living doing that as an adult?
But after I graduated from college and got a graduate degree, I found myself moving from one less ideal job to another.
Maybe it was the optimism that I had about America that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change.
The door that I thought was open was actually just slightly ajar -- this door of America that would open wide if you had the right name, the right skin color, the right networks, but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion, the wrong immigration status, the wrong skin color.
And I just couldn't accept that.
So I started a career as a social entrepreneur, starting an organization for young people like myself -- I was young at the time that I started it -- who traced their heritage to the Indian subcontinent.
In that work, I became and advocate for South Asians and other immigrants.
I lobbied members of Congress on policy issues.
I volunteered on election day to do exit polling.
But I couldn't vote, and I couldn't run for office.
So in 2000, when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from 95 dollars to 225 dollars, I decided it was time to apply before I could no longer afford it.
I filled out a long application, answering questions about my current and my past affiliations.
And once the application was submitted, there were fingerprints to be taken, a test to study for, endless hours of waiting in line.
You might call it extreme vetting.
And then in December of 2000, I joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in Brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long considered home.
My journey from international student to American citizen took 16 years, a short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories.
And soon after I had taken that formal step to becoming an American, the attacks of September 11, 2001, changed the immigration landscape for decades to come.
My city, New York City, was reeling and healing, and in the midst of it, we were in an election cycle.
Two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in New York City.
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg mayor of New York City.
We also adopted by ballot referendum the Office of Immigrant Affairs for the City of New York.
Five months after that election, the newly elected mayor appointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for this newly established office.
I want you to come back to that time.
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.
I had basically floundered in various jobs in America before I started a community-based organization in a church basement in Queens.
The attacks of September 11 sent shock waves through my community.
People who were members of my family, young people I had worked with, were experiencing harassment at schools, at workplaces and in airports.
And now I was going to represent their concerns in government.
No job felt more perfect for me.
And here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner.
First, well-meaning New Yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of law enforcement.
Most of us don't really know the difference, do we, between a sheriff and local police and the FBI.
And most of us, when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity, if not concern.
So if you're an undocumented parent, every day when you say goodbye to your child, send them off to school and go to work, you don't know what the chances are that you're going to see them at the end of the day.
Because a raid at your workplace, a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever.
The second thing I learned is that when people like me, who understood that fear, who had learned a new language, who had navigated new systems, when people like us were sitting at the table, we advocated for our communities' needs in a way that no one else could or would.
I understood what that feeling of fear was like.
People in my family were experiencing it.
Young people I had worked with were being harassed, not just by classmates, but also by their teachers.
My husband, then boyfriend, thought twice before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much.
What I learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered.
And it's these three things -- immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points -- that I think can help make our democracy stronger.
We actually have the power to change the outcome of elections, to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face of the pale, male, stale leadership that we have in our country today.
So how do we do that? Well, let's talk first about votes.
It will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in America are white.
But it might surprise you to know that one in three voters are black, Latino or Asian.
But here's the thing: it doesn't just matter who can vote, it matters who does vote.
So in 2012, half of the Latino and Asian-American voters did not vote.
And these votes matter not just in presidential elections.
They matter in local and state elections.
In 2015, Lan Diep, the eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam, ran for a seat in the San Jose City Council.
He lost that election by 13 votes.
This year, he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat, and this time he won, by 12 votes.
Every one of our votes matters.
And when people like Lan are sitting at the policy table, they can make a difference.
We need those voices.
We need those voices. in part because American leadership does not look like America's residents.
There are over 500,000 local and state offices in America.
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos, the two largest immigrant groups in our country.
In the city of Yakima, Washington, where 49 percent of the population is Latino, there has never been a Latino on the city council until this year.
Three newly elected Latinas joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.
One of them is Carmen Méndez.
She is a first-generation college student.
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico, and partly in Yakima, Washington.
She's a single mother, a community advocate.
Her voice on the Yakima City Council is advocating on behalf of the Latino community and of all Yakima residents.
And she's a role model for her daughter and other Latinas.
But the third most untapped resource in American democracy is the vantage point that immigrants bring.
We have fought to be here. We have come for economic and educational opportunity.
We have come for political and religious freedom. We have come in the pursuit of love.
That dedication, that commitment to America we also bring to public service.
People like Athena Salman, who just last week won the primary for a seat in the Arizona State House.
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank and moved to Chicago, where he met her mother.
Her mother is part Italian, part Mexican and part German.
Together they moved to Arizona and built a life.
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse, is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up so they can achieve the financial stability that we all are looking for.
Immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points are what we all need to work to include in American democracy.
It's not just my work. It's also yours.
And it's not going to be easy.
We never know what putting a new factor into an equation will do.
And it's a little scary.
You're scared that I'm going to take away your place at the table, and I'm scared that I'm never going to get a place at the table.
And we're all scared that we're going to lose this country that we know and love.
I'm scared you're going to take it away from me, and you're scared I'm going to take it away from you.
Look, it's been a rough election year, a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader.
But I have fought to be in this country and I continue to do so every day.
So my optimism never wavers, because I know that there are millions of immigrants just like me, in front of me, behind me and all around me.
It's our country, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It was April, last year.
I was on an evening out with friends to celebrate one of their birthdays.
We hadn't been all together for a couple of weeks; it was a perfect evening, as we were all reunited.
At the end of the evening, I caught the last underground train back to the other side of London.
The journey was smooth.
I got back to my local station and I began the 10-minute walk home.
As I turned the corner onto my street, my house in sight up ahead, I heard footsteps behind me that seemed to have approached out of nowhere and were picking up pace.
Before I had time to process what was happening, a hand was clapped around my mouth so that I could not breathe, and the young man behind me dragged me to the ground, beat my head repeatedly against the pavement until my face began to bleed, kicking me in the back and neck while he began to assault me, ripping off my clothes and telling me to "shut up," as I struggled to cry for help.
With each smack of my head to the concrete ground, a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today: "Is this going to be how it all ends?"
Little could I have realized, I'd been followed the whole way from the moment I left the station.
And hours later, I was standing topless and barelegged in front of the police, having the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed for forensic evidence.
Now, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings of vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come.
But wanting to find a way to condense these feelings into something ordered that I could work through, I decided to do what felt most natural to me: I wrote about it.
It started out as a cathartic exercise.
I wrote a letter to my assaulter, humanizing him as "you," to identify him as part of the very community that he had so violently abused that night.
Stressing the tidal-wave effect of his actions, I wrote: "Did you ever think of the people in your life?
I don't know who the people in your life are.
I don't know anything about you.
But I do know this: you did not just attack me that night.
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend, I'm a sister, I'm a pupil, I'm a cousin, I'm a niece, I'm a neighbor; I'm the employee who served everyone coffee in the café under the railway.
And all the people who form these relations to me make up my community.
And you assaulted every single one of them.
You violated the truth that I will never cease to fight for, and which all of these people represent: that there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad."
But, determined not to let this one incident make me lose faith in the solidarity in my community or humanity as a whole, I recalled the 7 / 7 terrorist bombings in July 2005 on London transport, and how the mayor of London at the time, and indeed my own parents, had insisted that we all get back on the tubes the next day, so we wouldn't be defined or changed by those that had made us feel unsafe.
I told my attacker, "You've carried out your attack, but now I'm getting back on my tube.
My community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark.
We will get on the last tubes home, and we will walk up our streets alone, because we will not ingrain or submit to the idea that we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so.
We will continue to come together, like an army, when any member of our community is threatened.
And this is a fight you will not win."
At the time of writing this letter —
(Applause)
Thank you.
At the time of writing this letter, I was studying for my exams in Oxford, and I was working on the local student paper there.
Despite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me, it was an isolating time.
I didn't know anyone who'd been through this before; at least I didn't think I did.
I'd read news reports, statistics, and knew how common sexual assault was, yet I couldn't actually name a single person that I'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before.
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision, I decided that I would publish my letter in the student paper, hoping to reach out to others in Oxford that might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way.
At the end of the letter, I asked others to write in with their experiences under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty," to emphasize that survivors of assault could express themselves without feeling shame or guilt about what happened to them -- to show that we could all stand up to sexual assault.
What I never anticipated is that almost overnight, this published letter would go viral.
Soon, we were receiving hundreds of stories from men and women across the world, which we began to publish on a website I set up.
And the hashtag became a campaign.
There was an Australian mother in her 40s who described how on an evening out, she was followed to the bathroom by a man who went to repeatedly grab her crotch.
There was a man in the Netherlands who described how he was date-raped on a visit to London and wasn't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to.
I had personal Facebook messages from people in India and South America, saying, how can we bring the message of the campaign there? One of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nikki, who described growing up, being molested my her own father.
And I had friends open up to me about experiences ranging from those that happened last week to those that happened years ago, that I'd had no idea about.
And the more we started to receive these messages, the more we also started to receive messages of hope -- people feeling empowered by this community of voices standing up to sexual assault and victim-blaming.
One woman called Olivia, after describing how she was attacked by someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time, said, "I've read many of the stories posted here, and I feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward, then I can, too.
I've been inspired by many, and I hope I can be as strong as them someday.
I'm sure I will."
People around the world began tweeting under this hashtag, and the letter was republished and covered by the national press, as well as being translated into several other languages worldwide.
But something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting.
For something to be front-page news, given the word "news" itself, we can assume it must be something new or something surprising.
And yet sexual assault is not something new.
Sexual assault, along with other kinds of injustices, is reported in the media all the time.
But through the campaign, these injustices were framed as not just news stories, they were firsthand experiences that had affected real people, who were creating, with the solidarity of others, what they needed and had previously lacked: a platform to speak out, the reassurance they weren't alone or to blame for what happened to them and open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue.
The voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story -- not the voices of journalists or commentators on social media.
And that's why the story was news.
We live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media, which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change.
But it's also made us increasingly reactive, from the smallest annoyances of, "Oh, my train's been delayed," to the greatest injustices of war, genocides, terrorist attacks.
Our default response has become to leap to react to any kind of grievance by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging -- anything to show others that we, too, have reacted.
The problem with reacting in this manner en masse is it can sometimes mean that we don't actually react at all, not in the sense of actually doing anything, anyway.
It might make ourselves feel better, like we've contributed to a group mourning or outrage, but it doesn't actually change anything.
And what's more, it can sometimes drown out the voices of those directly affected by the injustice, whose needs must be heard.
Worrying, too, is the tendency for some reactions to injustice to build even more walls, being quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions to complex problems.
One British tabloid, on the publication of my letter, branded a headline stating, "Oxford Student Launches Online Campaign to Shame Attacker." But the campaign never meant to shame anyone.
It meant to let people speak and to make others listen.
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice, commenting on my attacker's ethnicity or class to push their own prejudiced agendas.
And some even accused me of feigning the whole thing to push, and I quote, my "feminist agenda of man-hating." (Laughter)
I know, right? As if I'm going to be like, "Hey guys!
Sorry I can't make it, I'm busy trying to hate the entire male population by the time I'm 30. "
(Laughter)
Now, I'm almost sure that these people wouldn't say the things they say in person.
But it's as if because they might be behind a screen, in the comfort in their own home when on social media, people forget that what they're doing is a public act -- that other people will be reading it and be affected by it.
Returning to my analogy of getting back on our trains, another main concern I have about this noise that escalates from our online responses to injustice is that it can very easily slip into portraying us as the affected party, which can lead to a sense of defeatism, a kind of mental barrier to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change after a negative situation.
A couple of months before the campaign started or any of this happened to me, I went to a TEDx event in Oxford, and I saw Zelda la Grange speak, the former private secretary to Nelson Mandela.
One of the stories she told really struck me.
She spoke of when Mandela was taken to court by the South African Rugby Union after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs.
In the courtroom, he went up to the South African Rugby Union's lawyers, shook them by the hand and conversed with them, each in their own language.
And Zelda wanted to protest, saying they had no right to his respect after this injustice they had caused him.
He turned to her and said, "You must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle."
At the time of hearing these words, I didn't really know why they were so important, but I felt they were, and I wrote them down in a notebook I had on me.
But I've thought about this line a lot ever since.
Revenge, or the expression of hatred towards those who have done us injustice may feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong, but we need to break out of these cycles if we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice into positive social change.
To do otherwise continues to let the enemy determine the grounds for battle, creates a binary, where we who have suffered become the affected, pitted against them, the perpetrators.
And just like we got back on our tubes, we can't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat.
But I don't want to discourage a social media response, because I owe the development of the #NotGuilty campaign almost entirely to social media.
But I do want to encourage a more considered approach to the way we use it to respond to injustice.
The start, I think, is to ask ourselves two things.
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?
In my case, there were several answers to this.
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved, under the assumption they wouldn't have to be held to account or recognize the damage they had caused.
Not only that, but thousands of men and women suffer every day from sexual abuse, often in silence, yet it's still a problem we don't give the same airtime to as other issues.
It's still an issue many people blame victims for.
Next, ask yourself: How, in recognizing these reasons, could I go about reversing them?
With us, this was holding my attacker to account -- and many others.
It was calling them out on the effect they had caused.
It was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault, opening up discussions amongst friends, amongst families, in the media that had been closed for too long, and stressing that victims shouldn't feel to blame for what happened to them.
We might still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely.
But in this way, we can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice, as a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues, to make those in positions of authority aware of an issue by listening to those directly affected by it.
Because sometimes these questions don't have easy answers.
In fact, they rarely do.
But this doesn't mean we still can't give them a considered response.
In situations where you can't go about thinking how you'd reverse this feeling of injustice, you can still think, maybe not what you can do, but what you can not do.
You can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice, more hatred.
You can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice.
And you can not react to injustice, only to forget about it the next day, just because the rest of Twitter has moved on.
Sometimes not reacting instantly is, ironically, the best immediate course of action we can take.
Because we might be angry, upset and energized by injustice, but let's consider our responses.
Let us hold people to account, without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves.
Let us remember that distinction, so often forgotten by internet users, between criticism and insult.
Let us not forget to think before we speak, just because we might have a screen in front of us.
And when we create noise on social media, let it not drown out the needs of those affected, but instead let it amplify their voices, so the internet becomes a place where you're not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you.
All these considered approaches to injustice evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built: to network, to have signal, to connect -- all these terms that imply bringing people together, not pushing people apart.
Because if you look up the word "justice" in the dictionary, before punishment, before administration of law or judicial authority, you get: "The maintenance of what is right." And I think there are few things more "right" in this world than bringing people together, than unions.
And if we allow social media to deliver that, then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice, indeed.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
One hot October morning, I got off the all-night train in Mandalay, the old royal capital of Burma, now Myanmar.
And out on the street, I ran into a group of rough men standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.
And one of them came up and offered to show me around.
The price he quoted was outrageous.
It was less than I would pay for a bar of chocolate at home.
So I clambered into his trishaw, and he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas.
And as he did, he told me how he had come to the city from his village.
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.
His dream was to be a teacher.
But of course, life is hard under a military dictatorship, and so for now, this was the only way he could make a living.
Many nights, he told me, he actually slept in his trishaw so he could catch the first visitors off the all-night train.
And very soon, we found that in certain ways, we had so much in common -- we were both in our 20s, we were both fascinated by foreign cultures -- that he invited me home.
So we turned off the wide, crowded streets, and we began bumping down rough, wild alleyways.
There were broken shacks all around.
I really lost the sense of where I was, and I realized that anything could happen to me now.
I could get mugged or drugged or something worse. Nobody would know.
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut, which consisted of just one tiny room.
And then he leaned down, and reached under his bed.
And something in me froze.
I waited to see what he would pull out.
And finally he extracted a box.
Inside it was every single letter he had ever received from visitors from abroad, and on some of them he had pasted little black-and-white worn snapshots of his new foreign friends.
So when we said goodbye that night, I realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel, which is to take a plunge, to go inwardly as well as outwardly to places you would never go otherwise, to venture into uncertainty, ambiguity, even fear.
At home, it's dangerously easy to assume we're on top of things.
Out in the world, you are reminded every moment that you're not, and you can't get to the bottom of things, either.
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled," Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us, "but only insofar as we are unsettled is there any hope for us."
At this conference, we've been lucky enough to hear some exhilarating new ideas and discoveries and, really, about all the ways in which knowledge is being pushed excitingly forwards.
But at some point, knowledge gives out.
And that is the moment when your life is truly decided: you fall in love; you lose a friend; the lights go out.
And it's then, when you're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself, that you find out who you are.
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.
Science has unquestionably made our lives brighter and longer and healthier.
And I am forever grateful to the teachers who showed me the laws of physics and pointed out that three times three makes nine.
I can count that out on my fingers any time of night or day.
But when a mathematician tells me that minus three times minus three makes nine, that's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust.
The opposite of knowledge, in other words, isn't always ignorance.
It can be wonder. Or mystery. Possibility. And in my life, I've found it's the things I don't know that have lifted me up and pushed me forwards much more than the things I do know.
It's also the things I don't know that have often brought me closer to everybody around me.
For eight straight Novembers, recently, I traveled every year across Japan with the Dalai Lama.
And the one thing he said every day that most seemed to give people reassurance and confidence was, "I don't know."
"What's going to happen to Tibet?" "When are we ever going to get world peace?" "What's the best way to raise children?"
"Frankly," says this very wise man, "I don't know."
The Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman has spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior, and his conclusion is that we are always much more confident of what we think we know than we should be.
We have, as he memorably puts it, an "unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance." We know -- quote, unquote -- our team is going to win this weekend, and we only remember that knowledge on the rare occasions when we're right.
Most of the time, we're in the dark.
And that's where real intimacy lies.
Do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow?
Do you want to know?
The parents of us all, as some people call them, Adam and Eve, could never die, so long as they were eating from the tree of life.
But the minute they began nibbling from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they fell from their innocence.
They grew embarrassed and fretful, self-conscious.
And they learned, a little too late, perhaps, that there are certainly some things that we need to know, but there are many, many more that are better left unexplored.
Now, when I was a kid, I knew it all, of course. I had been spending 20 years in classrooms collecting facts, and I was actually in the information business, writing articles for Time Magazine.
And I took my first real trip to Japan for two-and-a-half weeks, and I came back with a 40-page essay explaining every last detail about Japan's temples, its fashions, its baseball games, its soul.
But underneath all that, something that I couldn't understand so moved me for reasons I couldn't explain to you yet, that I decided to go and live in Japan.
And now that I've been there for 28 years, I really couldn't tell you very much at all about my adopted home.
Which is wonderful, because it means every day I'm making some new discovery, and in the process, looking around the corner and seeing the hundred thousand things I'll never know.
Knowledge is a priceless gift.
But the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance.
Thinking that you know your lover or your enemy can be more treacherous than acknowledging you'll never know them.
Every morning in Japan, as the sun is flooding into our little apartment, I take great pains not to consult the weather forecast, because if I do, my mind will be overclouded, distracted, even when the day is bright.
I've been a full-time writer now for 34 years.
And the one thing that I have learned is that transformation comes when I'm not in charge, when I don't know what's coming next, when I can't assume I am bigger than everything around me.
And the same is true in love or in moments of crisis.
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again and we're bumping off the broad, well-lit streets; and we're reminded, really, of the first law of travel and, therefore, of life: you're only as strong as your readiness to surrender.
In the end, perhaps, being human is much more important than being fully in the know.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"We're declaring war against cancer, and we will win this war by 2015."
This is what the US Congress and the National Cancer Institute declared just a few years ago, in 2003.
Now, I don't know about you, but I don't buy that.
I don't think we quite won this war yet, and I don't think anyone here will question that.
Now, I will argue that a primary reason why we're not winning this war against cancer is because we're fighting blindly.
I'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine.
His name is Ehud, and a few years ago, Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.
And not just any type of brain cancer: he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.
In fact, it was so deadly that the doctors told him that they only have 12 months, and during those 12 months, they have to find a treatment.
They have to find a cure, and if they cannot find a cure, he will die.
Now, the good news, they said, is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from, but the bad news is that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not, well, that takes them about three months or so.
So they cannot try that many things.
Well, Ehud is now going into his first treatment, and during that first treatment, just a few days into that treatment, I'm meeting with him, and he tells me, "Adam, I think this is working.
I think we really lucked out here.
Something is happening. "
And I ask him, "Really?
How do you know that, Ehud? "
And he says, "Well, I feel so terrible inside.
Something's gotta be working up there.
It just has to."
Well, unfortunately, three months later, we got the news, it didn't work.
And so Ehud goes into his second treatment.
And again, the same story. "It feels so bad, something's gotta be working there." And then three months later, again we get bad news.
Ehud is going into his third treatment, and then his fourth treatment.
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.
Now, when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle, you get really swamped with emotions.
A lot of things are going through your head.
For me, it was mostly outrage.
I was just outraged that, how come this is the best that we can offer?
And I started looking more and more into this.
As it turns out, this is not just the best that doctors could offer Ehud. It's not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally.
We're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer.
I picked up one of those statistics, and I'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before.
This is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer, in this case females in the United States, ever since the 1930s.
You'll notice that there aren't that many things that have changed.
It's still a huge issue.
You'll see a few changes, though.
You'll see lung cancer, for example, on the rise. Thank you, cigarettes. And you'll also see that, for example, stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers, is essentially eliminated. Now, why is that?
Anyone knows, by the way? Why is it that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer?
What was the huge, huge medical technology breakthrough that came to our world that saved humanity from stomach cancer?
Was it maybe a new drug, or a better diagnostic? You guys are right, yeah. It's the invention of the refrigerator, and the fact that we're no longer eating spoiled meats.
So the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented.
(Laughter)
And so -- yeah, I know. We're not doing so well here.
I don't want to miniaturize the progress and everything that's been done in cancer research.
Look, there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research that discovered major, major things that taught us about cancer.
But all that said, we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us.
Again, I will argue that the primary reason why this is the case, why we have not done that remarkably well, is really we're fighting blindly here.
And this is where medical imaging comes in. This is where my own work comes in.
And so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging that's offered today to brain cancer patients, or actually generally to all cancer patients, take a look at this PET scan right here. Let's see. There we go.
So this is a PET / CT scan, and what you'll see in this PET / CT scan is the CT scan will show you where the bones are, and the PET scan will show you where tumors are.
Now, what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is signaling to us outside of the body, "Hey, I'm here." And those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions, and they're going all over the body looking for cells that are hungry for sugar.
You'll see that the heart, for example, lights up there. That's because the heart needs a lot of sugar.
You'll also see that the bladder lights up there. That's because the bladder is the thing that's clearing the sugar away from our body.
And then you'll see a few other hot spots, and these are in fact the tumors.
Now, this is a really a wonderful technology.
For the first time it allowed us to look into someone's body without picking up each and every one of the cells and putting them under the microscope, but in a noninvasive way allowing us to look into someone's body and ask, "Hey, has the cancer metastasized?
Where is it?" And the PET scans here are showing you very clearly where are these hot spots, where is the tumor.
So as miraculous as this might seem, unfortunately, well, it's not that great.
You see, those small little hot spots there.
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors?
So it's about 100 million cancer cells, and let me make sure that this number sunk in.
In each and every one of these small little blips that you're seeing on the image, there needs to be at least 100 million cancer cells in order for it to be detected.
Now, if that seemed to you like a very large number, it is a very large number.
This is in fact an incredibly large number, because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough to do something about it, to do something meaningful about it, well, we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size, and ideally just a handful of cells in size.
So we're clearly pretty far away from this.
So we're going to play a little experiment here.
I'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine that you are brain surgeons.
And you guys are now at an operating room, and there's a patient in front of you, and your task is to make sure that the tumor is out.
So you're looking down at the patient, the skin and the skull have already been removed, so you're looking at the brain.
And all you know about this patient is that there's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so in the right frontal lobe of this person's brain.
And that's more or less it.
So you're looking down, and unfortunately everything looks the same, because brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue really just look the same.
And so you're going in with your thumb, and you start to press a little bit on the brain, because tumors tend to be a little harder, stiffer, and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say, "It seems like the tumor is right there." Then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece.
And as you're taking the tumor out, then you're getting to a stage where you think, "Alright, I'm done.
I took out everything. "And at this stage, if that's — so far everything sounded, like, pretty crazy — you're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here.
Because now you need to decide, should I stop here and let this patient go, risking that there might be some leftover cancer cells behind that I just couldn't see, or should I take away some extra margins, typically about an inch or so around the tumor just to be sure that I removed everything?
So this is not a simple decision to make, and unfortunately this is the decision that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day as they're seeing their patients.
And so I remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab, and we say, "Boy, there's got to be a better way." But not just like you tell a friend that there's got to be a better way.
There's just got to be a better way here.
This is just incredible.
And so we looked back.
Remember those PET scans I told you about, the sugar and so on.
We said, hey, how about instead of using sugar molecules, let's maybe take tiny, tiny little particles made of gold, and let's program them with some interesting chemistry around them.
Let's program them to look for cancer cells.
And then we will inject these gold particles into these patients by the billions again, and we'll have them go all over the body, and just like secret agents, if you will, go and walk by every single cell in our body and knock on the door of that cell, and ask, "Are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell?
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.
If you're a cancer cell, we're sticking in and shining out and telling us, "Hey, look at me, I'm here." And they'll do it through some interesting cameras that we developed in the lab.
And once we see that, maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone.
And so we've tested that, and boy, this works well.
So I'm going to show you an example now.
What you're looking at here is an image of a mouse's brain, and we've implanted into this mouse's brain a small little tumor.
And so this tumor is now growing in this mouse's brain, and then we've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient, and take out piece by piece out of the tumor.
And while he's doing that, we're going to take images to see where the gold particles are.
And so we're going to first start by injecting these gold particles into this mouse, and we're going to see right here at the very left there that image at the bottom is the image that shows where the gold particles are.
The nice thing is that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor, and then they shine out and tell us, "Hey, we're here.
Here's the tumor. "
So now we can see the tumor, but we're not showing this to the doctor yet.
We're asking the doctor, now please start cutting away the tumor, and you'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor and you see that first quadrant is now missing.
The doctor then took the second quadrant, the third, and now it appears to be everything.
And so at this stage, the doctor came back to us and said, "Alright, I'm done.
What do you want me to do?
Should I keep things as they are or do you want me to take some extra margins around?"
And then we said, "Well, hang on." We told the doctor, "You've missed those two spots, so rather than taking huge margins around, only take out those tiny little areas.
Take them out, and then let's take a look."
And so the doctor took them away, and lo and behold, the cancer is now completely gone.
Now, the important thing is that it's not just that the cancer is completely gone from this person's brain, or from this mouse's brain.
The most important thing is that we did not have to take huge amounts of healthy brain in the process.
And so now we can actually imagine a world where doctors and surgeons, as they take away a tumor, they actually know what to take out, and they no longer have to guess with their thumb.
Now, here's why it's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors.
Those leftover tumors, even if it's just a handful of cells, they will grow to recur the tumor, for the tumor to come back.
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail is because of those small little extra margins that were left positive, those small little leftover tumors that were left there.
So this is clearly very nice, but what I really want to share with you is where I think we're heading from here.
And so in my lab at Stanford, my students and I are asking, what should we be working on now?
And I think where medical imaging is heading to is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately.
The ability like this would allow us to actually pick up tumors way, way earlier in the process, way before it's 100 million cells inside, so we can actually do something about it.
An ability to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us to ask insightful questions.
So in the lab, we are now getting to a point where we can actually start asking these cancer cells real questions, like, for example, are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not?
So if you're not responding, we'll know to stop the treatment right away, days into the treatment, not three months.
And so also for patients like Ehud that are going through these nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs, for them not to suffer through those horrendous side effects of the drugs when the drugs are in fact not even helping them.
So to be frank here, we're pretty far away from winning the war against cancer, just to be realistic.
But at least I am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a painter. I make large-scale figurative paintings, which means I paint people like this.
But I'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective.
It's something we all go through, and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody.
To give you some background on me, I grew up the youngest of eight.
Yes, eight kids in my family.
I have six older brothers and a sister.
To give you a sense of what that's like, when my family went on vacation, we had a bus.
(Laughter)
My supermom would drive us all over town to our various after-school activities -- not in the bus.
We had a regular car, too.
She would take me to art classes, and not just one or two.
She took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16, because that's all I wanted to do.
She even took a class with me in New York City.
Now, being the youngest of eight, I learned a few survival skills.
Rule number one: don't let your big brother see you do anything stupid.
So I learned to be quiet and neat and careful to follow the rules and stay in line.
But painting was where I made the rules.
That was my private world.
By 14, I knew I really wanted to be an artist.
My big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting.
So I continued honing my skills.
I went to graduate school and I got an MFA, and at my first solo show, my brother asked me, "What do all these red dots mean next to the paintings?" Nobody was more surprised than me.
The red dots meant that the paintings were sold and that I'd be able to pay my rent with painting.
Now, my apartment had four electrical outlets, and I couldn't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time, but still, I could pay my rent.
So I was very happy.
Here's a painting from back around that time.
I needed it to be as realistic as possible. It had to be specific and believable.
This was the place where I was isolated and in total control.
Since then, I've made a career of painting people in water.
Bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment.
It was intimate and private, and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade.
I made about 200 of these paintings, some of them six to eight feet, like this one.
For this painting, I mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and I floated cooking oil on the surface and stuck a girl in it, and when I lit it up, it was so beautiful I couldn't wait to paint it.
I was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity, always looking for something new to add: vinyl, steam, glass.
I once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair just to see what that would look like.
Don't do that.
(Laughter)
So it was going well. I was finding my way.
I was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists, always going to openings and events.
I was having some success and recognition and I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets.
My mom and I would stay up very late talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other.
She made beautiful pottery.
I have a friend named Bo who made this painting of his wife and I dancing by the ocean, and he called it "The Light Years." I asked him what that meant, and he said, "Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, you're no longer a child, but you're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life." That was it.
It was the light years. On October 8, 2011, the light years came to an end.
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
It had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain.
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.
I totally lost it.
And when I got myself together and I looked at her, I realized, this isn't about me. This is about figuring out how to help her.
My father is a doctor, and so we had a great advantage having him in charge, and he did a beautiful job taking care of her.
But I, too, wanted to do everything I could to help, so I wanted to try everything. We all did. I researched alternative medicines, diets, juicing, acupuncture.
Finally, I asked her, "Is this what you want me to do?" And she said, "No." She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later. "
She knew what was happening, and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn't know: how she wanted to go through this.
I just needed to ask her.
I realized that if I tried to fix it, I would miss it.
So I just started to be with her, whatever that meant and whatever situation came up, just really listen to her.
If before I was resisting, then now I was surrendering, giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with her.
Time slowed down, and the date was irrelevant.
We developed a routine. Early each morning I would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her.
My brother would come for breakfast and we'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway.
So I'd help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen.
She had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of, and she loved Irish soda bread for breakfast.
Afterwards was the shower, and she loved this part.
She loved the warm water, so I made this as indulgent as I could, like a spa.
My sister would help sometimes.
We had warm towels and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second.
I'd blow-dry her hair.
My brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids, and that was the highlight of her day.
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair, and she didn't want to eat so much, and she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee.
I couldn't support her myself anymore, so we hired an aide to help me with the showers.
These simple daily activities became our sacred ritual, and we repeated them day after day as the cancer grew.
It was humbling and painful and exactly where I wanted to be.
We called this time "the beautiful awful."
She died on October 26, 2012.
It was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis. She was gone. My brothers, sister, and father and I all came together in this supportive and attentive way.
It was as though our whole family dynamic and all our established roles vanished and we were just all together in this unknown, feeling the same thing and taking care of each other.
I'm so grateful for them.
As someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working, I had no idea that this kind of connection could be so important, so healing.
This was the most important thing.
It was what I always wanted.
So after the funeral, it was time for me to go back to my studio.
So I packed up my car and I drove back to Brooklyn, and painting is what I've always done, so that's what I did.
And here's what happened.
It's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me.
That safe, very, very carefully rendered safe place that I created in all my other paintings, it was a myth.
It didn't work.
And I was afraid, because I didn't want to paint anymore.
So I went into the woods.
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.
I got my paints, and I wasn't a landscape painter, but I wasn't really much of any kind of painter at all, so I had no attachment, no expectation, which allowed me to be reckless and free.
I actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight next to a light in the woods.
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.
I took all these paintings back to my studio, and scraped them, and carved into them, and poured paint thinner on them, put more paint on top, drew on them.
I had no plan, but I was watching what was happening.
This is the one with all the bugs in it.
I wasn't trying to represent a real space. It was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating me, and something started to happen.
I got curious again.
This is another one from the woods.
There was a caveat now, though.
I couldn't be controlling the paint like I used to.
It had to be about implying and suggesting, not explaining or describing.
And that imperfect, chaotic, turbulent surface is what told the story.
I started to be as curious as I was when I was a student.
So the next thing was I wanted to put figures in these paintings, people, and I loved this new environment, so I wanted to have both people and this atmosphere.
When the idea hit me of how to do this, I got kind of nauseous and dizzy, which is really just adrenaline, probably, but for me it's a really good sign.
And so now I want to show you what I've been working on.
It's something I haven't shown yet, and it's like a preview, I guess, of my upcoming show, what I have so far.
Expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub.
I'm going outside instead of inside.
Loosening control, savoring the imperfections, allowing the -- allowing the imperfections.
And in that imperfection, you can find a vulnerability.
I could feel my deepest intention, what matters most to me, that human connection that can happen in a space where there's no resisting or controlling.
I want to make paintings about that.
So here's what I learned.
We're all going to have big losses in our lives, maybe a job or a career, relationships, love, our youth.
We're going to lose our health, people we love.
These kinds of losses are out of our control.
They're unpredictable, and they bring us to our knees.
And so I say, let them.
Fall to your knees. Be humbled. Let go of trying to change it or even wanting it to be different. It just is. And then there's space, and in that space feel your vulnerability, what matters most to you, your deepest intention.
And be curious to connect to what and who is really here, awake and alive.
It's what we all want.
Let's take the opportunity to find something beautiful in the unknown, in the unpredictable, and even in the awful.
Thank you. (Applause)
Have you ever noticed when you ask someone to talk about a change they're making for the better in their personal lives, they're often really energetic?
Whether it's training for a marathon, picking up an old hobby, or learning a new skill, for most people, self-transformation projects occupy a very positive emotional space.
Self-transformation is empowering, energizing, even exhilarating.
I mean just take a look at some of the titles of self-help books: "Awaken the Giant Within," "Practicing the Power of Now," or here's a great one we can all relate to, "You are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life."
(Laughter)
When it comes to self-transformation, you can't help but get a sense of the excitement.
But there's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space.
The transformation of organizations.
If you're like most people, when you hear the words "Our organization is going to start a transformation," you're thinking, "Uh-oh."
(Laughter)
"Layoffs." The blood drains from your face, your mind goes into overdrive, frantically searching for some place to run and hide.
Well, you can run, but you really can't hide.
Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours involved in organizations.
And due to changes in globalization, changes due to advances in technology and other factors, the reality is our organizations are constantly having to adapt.
In fact, I call this the era of "always-on" transformation.
When I shared this idea with my wife Nicola, she said, "Always-on transformation?
That sounds exhausting." And that may be exactly what you're thinking -- and you would be right.
Particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been.
But because we can't hide, we need to sort out two things.
First, why is transformation so exhausting?
And second, how do we fix it?
First of all, let's acknowledge that change is hard.
People naturally resist change, especially when it's imposed on them.
But there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people than it needs to be.
First of all, leaders often wait too long to act.
As a result, everything is happening in crisis mode.
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.
Or, given the urgency, what they'll do is they'll just focus on the short-term results, but that doesn't give any hope for the future.
Or they'll just take a superficial, one-off approach, hoping that they can return back to business as usual as soon as the crisis is over.
This kind of approach is kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests.
In order to get test scores to go up, teachers will end up teaching to the test.
Now, that approach can work; test results often do go up.
But it fails the fundamental goal of education: to prepare students to succeed over the long term.
So given these obstacles, what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations so rather than being exhausting, it's actually empowering and energizing?
To do that, we need to focus on five strategic imperatives, all of which have one thing in common: putting people first.
The first imperative for putting people first is to inspire through purpose.
Most transformations have financial and operational goals.
These are important and they can be energizing to leaders, but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization.
To motivate more broadly, the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose.
Take LEGO. The LEGO Group has become an extraordinary global company.
Under their very capable leadership, they've actually undergone a series of transformations.
While each of these has had a very specific focus, the North Star, linking and guiding all of them, has been Lego's powerful purpose: inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. Expanding globally? It's not about increasing sales, but about giving millions of additional children access to LEGO building bricks. Investment and innovation? It's not about developing new products, but about enabling more children to experience the joy of learning through play.
Not surprisingly, that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.
The second imperative for putting people first is to go all in.
Too many transformations are nothing more than head-count cutting exercises; layoffs under the guise of transformation.
In the face of relentless competition, it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision to downsize the organization, just as you may have to lose some weight in order to run a marathon.
But losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time.
To win you need to go all in.
You need to go all in.
Rather than just cutting costs, you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term, initiatives to drive growth, actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates, and very importantly, investments to develop the leadership and the talent.
The third imperative for putting people first is to enable people with the capabilities that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond.
Over the years I've competed in a number of triathlons.
You know, frankly, I'm not that good, but I do have one distinct capability; I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.
(Laughter)
By the time I finish the swim, almost all the bikes are already gone.
(Laughter)
Real triathletes know that each leg -- the swim, the bike, the run -- really requires different capabilities, different tools, different skills, different techniques.
Likewise when we transform organizations, we need to be sure that we're giving our people the skills and the tools they need along the way.
Chronos, a global software company, recognized the need to transfer from building products -- software products -- to building software as a service.
To enable its people to take that transformation, first of all they invested in new tools that would enable their employees to monitor the usage of the features as well as customer satisfaction with the new service.
They also invested in skill development, so that their employees would be able to resolve customer service problems on the spot.
And very importantly, they also reinforced the collaborative behaviors that would be required to deliver an end-to-end seamless customer experience.
Because of these investments, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation, Chronos employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles.
In the era of "always-on" transformation, change is a constant.
My fourth imperative therefore is to instill a culture of continuous learning.
When Satya Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014, he embarked on an ambitious transformation journey to prepare the company to compete in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.
This included changes to strategy, the organization and very importantly, the culture.
Microsoft's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition -- not exactly conducive to learning.
Nadella took this head-on.
He rallied his leadership around his vision for a living, learning culture, shifting from a fixed mindset, where your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room, to a growth mindset, where your role was to listen, to learn and to bring out the best in people.
Well, early days, Microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture — clear evidence of Microsoft putting people first.
My fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders.
In a transformation, a leader needs to have a vision, a clear road map with milestones, and then you need to hold people accountable for results.
In other words, you need to be directive.
But in order to capture the hearts and minds of people, you also need to be inclusive.
Inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first.
I live in the San Francisco Bay area.
And right now, our basketball team is the best in the league.
We won the 2015 championship, and we're favored to win again this year.
There are many explanations for this.
They have some fabulous players, but one of the key reasons is their head coach, Steve Kerr, is an inclusive leader.
When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014, the Warriors were looking for a major transformation.
They hadn't won a national champions hip since 1975.
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision, and he immediately got to work.
From the outset, he reached out and engaged the players and the staff.
He created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions.
During games he would often ask, "What are you seeing that I'm missing?"
One the best examples of this came in game four of the 2015 finals.
The Warriors were down two games to one when Kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup; a bold move by any measure. The Warriors won the game and went on to win the championship.
And it is widely viewed that that move was the pivotal move in their victory.
Interestingly, it wasn't actually Kerr's idea.
It was the idea of his 28-year-old assistant, Nick U'Ren.
Because of Kerr's leadership style, U'Ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward.
And Kerr not only listened, but he implemented the idea and then afterwards, gave U'Ren all the credit -- actions all consistent with Kerr's highly inclusive approach to leadership.
In the era of "always-on" transformation, organizations are always going to be transforming.
But doing so does not have to be exhausting.
We owe it to ourselves, to our organizations and to society more broadly to boldly transform our approach to transformation.
To do that, we need to start putting people first.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause) Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars" first hit the airwaves, that is not what it looked like. (Laughter)
(Laughter) And the next day they were telling us the finer points of a good feather step.
And this blew our minds.
I mean, all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz, all of that just hit the public consciousness, and it changed everything.
(Laughter) But running parallel to this excitement, the excitement that suddenly, somehow, we were cool -- there was also this reservation.
Why this and why now?
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I would get together for training seminars or just for fun, we'd toss each other around, mix it up, take a break from having to lead all the time.
We even came up with a system for switching lead and follow while we were dancing, as a way of taking turns and playing fair.
It wasn't until we used that system as part of a performance in a small festival that we got an important tap on the shoulder.
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge and director of a playwright center, pulled us aside after the show and said, "Do you have any idea how political that was?" (Laughter) So that began an eight-year collaboration to create a play which not only further developed our system for switching but also explored the impact of being locked into a single role, and what's worse, being defined by that single role.
TC: Because, of course, classic Latin and ballroom dancing isn't just a system of dancing; it's a way of thinking, of being, of relating to each other that captured a whole period's values.
There's one thing that stayed consistent, though: the man leads and the woman follows.
So street salsa, championship tango, it's all the same -- he leads, she follows.
So this was gender training.
You weren't just learning to dance -- you were learning to "man" and to "woman." It's a relic.
And in the way of relics, you don't throw it out, but you need to know that this is the past.
This isn't the present.
It's like Shakespeare: respect it, revive it -- great!
But know that this is history.
This doesn't represent how we think today.
So we asked ourselves: If you strip it all down, what is at the core of partner dancing?
JF: Well, the core principle of partner dancing is that one person leads, the other one follows.
The machine works the same, regardless of who's playing which role. The physics of movement doesn't really give a crap about your gender.
(Laughter) So if we were to update the existing form, we would need to make it more representative of how we interact here, now, in 2015.
When you watch ballroom, don't just watch what's there.
Watch what's not.
The couple is always only a man and a woman. Together. Only. Ever. So, same-sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear.
In most mainstream international ballroom competitions, same-sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor, and in many cases, the rules prohibit them completely.
(Laughter) TC: Try this: Google-image, "professional Latin dancer," and then look for an actual Latino person.
(Laughter) There are no black people, there are no Asians, no mixed-race couples, so basically, non-white people just disappeared.
Even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm -- she can't be taller, he can't be shorter.
She can't be bolder, he can't be gentler.
If you were to take a ballroom dance and translate that into a conversation and drop that into a movie, we, as a culture, would never stand for this.
He dictates, she reacts.
No relationship -- gay, straight or anything -- that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that, and yet somehow, you put it on prime time, you slap some makeup on it, throw the glitter on, put it out there as movement, not as text, and we, as a culture, tune in and clap.
We are applauding our own absence.
(Music) (Applause) Too many people have disappeared from partner dancing. JF: Now, you just saw two men dancing together.
(Laughter) And you thought it looked ... a little strange. Interesting -- appealing, even -- but a little bit odd.
Even avid followers of the same-sex ballroom circuit can attest that while same-sex partner dancing can be dynamic and strong and exciting, it just doesn't quite seem to fit. Aesthetically speaking, if Alida and I take the classic closed ballroom hold ... this is considered beautiful.
(Laughter) See, the standard image that the leader must be larger and masculine and the follower smaller and feminine -- this is a stumbling point.
TC: So we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle.
So, what if we could keep the idea of lead and follow but toss the idea that this was connected to gender?
Further, what if a couple could lead and follow each other and then switch? And then switch back? What if it could be like a conversation, taking turns listening and speaking, just like we do in life?
What if we could dance like that?
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance, salsa.
In salsa, there's a key transitional step, called the cross-body lead.
We use it as punctuation to break up the improvisation.
It can be a little tricky to spot if you're not used to looking for it, so here it is.
(Laughter) One more time for the cheap seats. And here's the action one more time, nice and slow.
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking to this transitional step, the cross-body lead becomes a point where the lead and the follow can switch.
The person following can elect to take over the lead, or the person leading can choose to surrender it, essentially making it a counter-cross-body lead.
Here's how that looks in slow motion.
And here's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance.
With this simple tweak, the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation. Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow. And more importantly, you can change your mind.
Now, this is only one example of how this applies, but once the blinkers come off, anything can happen.
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking could apply to a classic waltz.
Because, of course, it isn't just a system of switching leads; it's a way of thinking that can actually make the dance itself more efficient.
So: the waltz. The waltz is a turning dance.
This means that for the lead, you spend half of the dance traveling backwards, completely blind.
(Laughter) And because of the follower's position, basically, no one can see where they're going.
(Laughter) TC: There are actually a lot of accidents out there that happen as a result of this blind spot.
But what if the partners were to just allow for a switch of posture for a moment?
A lot of accidents could be avoided.
Even if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen, it would be a lot safer, while at the same time, offering new aesthetics into the waltz.
(Laughter) Because physics doesn't give a damn about your gender. JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead in clubs, convention centers and as part of "First Dance," the play we created with Lisa, on stages in North America and in Europe.
And it never fails to engage.
I mean, beyond the unusual sight of seeing two men dancing together, it always evokes and engages. But why? The secret lies in what made Lisa see our initial demonstration as "political." It wasn't just that we were switching lead and follow; it's that we stayed consistent in our presence, our personality and our power, regardless of which role we were playing.
We were still us. And that's where the true freedom lies -- not just the freedom to switch roles, but the freedom from being defined by whichever role you're playing, the freedom to always remain true to yourself.
Forget what a lead is supposed to look like, or a follow.
Be a masculine follow or a feminine lead. Just be yourself. Obviously, this applies off the dance floor as well, but on the floor, it gives us the perfect opportunity to update an old paradigm, reinvigorate an old relic, and make it more representative of our era and our current way of being.
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing all the time with women and men and we love it.
But we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form that can produce silence and produce invisibility across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today.
(Music) We invented Liquid Lead as a way of stripping out all the ideas that don't belong to us and taking partner dancing back to what it really always was: the fine art of taking care of each other.
You are a high-ranking military service member deployed to Afghanistan.
You are responsible for the lives of hundreds of men and women, and your base is under attack.
Incoming mortar rounds are exploding all around you.
Struggling to see through the dust and the smoke, you do your best to assist the wounded and then crawl to a nearby bunker.
Conscious but dazed by the blasts, you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened.
As you regain your vision, you see a bloody face staring back at you.
The image is terrifying, but you quickly come to understand it's not real.
This vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep.
You choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job or being seen as weak.
You give the vision a name, Bloody Face in Bunker, and call it BFIB for short.
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind, secretly haunting you, for the next seven years.
Now close your eyes. Can you see BFIB? If you can, you're beginning to see the face of the invisible wounds of war, commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.
While I can't say I have post-traumatic stress disorder, I've never been a stranger to it.
When I was a little girl, I would visit my grandparents every summer.
It was my grandfather who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche.
While my grandfather was serving as a Marine in the Korean War, a bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out.
He watched as a corpsman passed him over, declaring him a goner, and then leaving him to die.
Years later, after his physical wounds had healed and he'd returned home, he rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life.
But at night I would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall.
And during the day I would announce myself as I entered the room, careful not to startle or agitate him.
He lived out the remainder of his days isolated and tight-lipped, never finding a way to express himself, and I didn't yet have the tools to guide him.
I wouldn't have a name for my grandfather's condition until I was in my 20s.
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy, I naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma.
And while sitting in class learning about post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD for short, my mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather began to take form.
We've had various names for post-traumatic stress throughout the history of war: homesickness, soldier's heart, shell shock, thousand-yard stare, for instance.
And while I was pursuing my degree, a new war was raging, and thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles, service members were surviving blast injuries they wouldn't have before.
But the invisible wounds were reaching new levels, and this pushed military doctors and researchers to try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury, or TBI, and PTSD have on the brain.
Due to advances in technology and neuroimaging, we now know there's an actual shutdown in the Broca's, or the speech-language area of the brain, after an individual experiences trauma.
This physiological change, or speechless terror as it's often called, coupled with mental health stigma, the fear of being judged or misunderstood, possibly even removed from their current duties, has led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women.
Generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences, and suffer in solitude.
I had my work cut out for me when I got my first job as an art therapist at the nation's largest military medical center, Walter Reed.
After working for a few years on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit, I eventually transferred to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE, which leads TBI care for active duty service members.
Now, I believed in art therapy, but I was going to have to convince service members, big, tough, strong, manly military men, and some women too, to give art-making as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.
The results have been nothing short of spectacular.
Vivid, symbolic artwork is being created by our servicemen and women, and every work of art tells a story.
We've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech-language issue with the brain.
Art-making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma.
Service members can use the art-making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way.
They can then apply words to their physical creations, reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain.
Now, we've seen this can work with all forms of art -- drawing, painting, collage -- but what seems to have the most impact is mask-making.
Finally, these invisible wounds don't just have a name, they have a face.
And when service members create these masks, it allows them to come to grips, literally, with their trauma.
And it's amazing how often that enables them to break through the trauma and start to heal.
Remember BFIB? That was a real experience for one of my patients, and when he created his mask, he was able to let go of that haunting image.
Initially, it was a daunting process for the service member, but eventually he began to think of BFIB as the mask, not his internal wound, and he would go to leave each session, he would hand me the mask, and say, "Melissa, take care of him." Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box to further contain him, and when the service member went to leave the NICoE, he chose to leave BFIB behind.
A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice, and both times BFIB was smiling and the service member didn't feel anxious.
Now, whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory, he continues to paint.
Every time he paints these disturbing images, he sees them less or not at all.
Philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy.
Now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound can be the part of the brain where healing happens too.
And art therapy is showing us how to make that connection.
We asked one of our service members to describe how mask-making impacted his treatment, and this is what he had to say.
(Video) Service Member: You sort of just zone out into the mask.
You zone out into the drawing, and for me, it just released the block, so I was able to do it.
And then when I looked at it after two days, I was like, "Holy crap, here's the picture, here's the key, here's the puzzle," and then from there it just soared.
I mean, from there my treatment just when out of sight, because they were like, Kurt, explain this, explain this.
And for the first time in 23 years, I could actually talk about stuff openly to, like, anybody.
I could talk to you about it right now if I wanted to, because it unlocked it.
It's just amazing.
And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD and TBI stuff together in one place that has never happened before. Sorry.
Melissa Walker: Over the past five years, we've had over 1,000 masks made.
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
Thank you.
(Applause) I wish I could have shared this process with my grandfather, but I know that he would be thrilled that we are finding ways to help today's and tomorrow's service members heal, and finding the resources within them that they can call upon to heal themselves.
Thank you. (Applause)
Let's talk about trust. We all know trust is fundamental, but when it comes to trusting people, something profound is happening.
Please raise your hand if you have ever been a host or a guest on Airbnb. Wow. That's a lot of you.
Who owns Bitcoin? Still a lot of you. OK.
And please raise your hand if you've ever used Tinder to help you find a mate.
(Laughter)
This one's really hard to count because you're kind of going like this.
(Laughter)
These are all examples of how technology is creating new mechanisms that are enabling us to trust unknown people, companies and ideas.
And yet at the same time, trust in institutions -- banks, governments and even churches -- is collapsing.
So what's happening here, and who do you trust?
Let's start in France with a platform -- with a company, I should say -- with a rather funny-sounding name, BlaBlaCar.
It's a platform that matches drivers and passengers who want to share long-distance journeys together.
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.
So it's a good idea to choose your fellow travelers wisely.
Social profiles and reviews help people make a choice.
You can see if someone's a smoker, you can see what kind of music they like, you can see if they're going to bring their dog along for the ride.
But it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you're going to talk in the car.
Bla, not a lot, bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat, and bla bla bla, you're not going to stop talking the entire way from London to Paris.
It's remarkable, right, that this idea works at all, because it's counter to the lesson most of us were taught as a child: never get in a car with a stranger.
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports more than four million people every single month.
To put that in context, that's more passengers than the Eurostar or JetBlue airlines carry.
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling millions of people across the world to take a trust leap.
A trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different to the way that we've always done it.
Let's try to visualize this together. OK. I want you to close your eyes.
There is a man staring at me with his eyes wide open.
I'm on this big red circle. I can see. So close your eyes.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I'll do it with you.
And I want you to imagine there exists a gap between you and something unknown.
That unknown can be someone you've just met. It can be a place you've never been to. It can be something you've never tried before. You got it? OK. You can open your eyes now.
For you to leap from a place of certainty, to take a chance on that someone or something unknown, you need a force to pull you over the gap, and that remarkable force is trust.
Trust is an elusive concept, and yet we depend on it for our lives to function.
I trust my children when they say they're going to turn the lights out at night.
I trusted the pilot who flew me here to keep me safe.
It's a word we use a lot, without always thinking about what it really means and how it works in different contexts of our lives.
There are, in fact, hundreds of definitions of trust, and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right.
But I don't like this definition of trust, because it makes trust sound rational and predictable, and it doesn't really get to the human essence of what it enables us to do and how it empowers us to connect with other people.
So I define trust a little differently.
I define trust as a confident relationship to the unknown.
Now, when you view trust through this lens, it starts to explain why it has the unique capacity to enable us to cope with uncertainty, to place our faith in strangers, to keep moving forward.
Human beings are remarkable at taking trust leaps.
Do you remember the first time you put your credit card details into a website?
That's a trust leap.
I distinctly remember telling my dad that I wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand Peugeot on eBay, and he rightfully pointed out that the seller's name was "Invisible Wizard" and that this probably was not such a good idea.
(Laughter)
So my work, my research focuses on how technology is transforming the social glue of society, trust between people, and it's a fascinating area to study, because there's still so much we do not know.
For instance, do men and women trust differently in digital environments?
Does the way we build trust face-to-face translate online? Does trust transfer? So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder, are you more likely to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?
But from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces, there is a common pattern that people follow, and I call it "climbing the trust stack." Let me use BlaBlaCar as an example to bring it to life.
On the first level, you have to trust the idea.
The second level is about having confidence in the platform, that BlaBlaCar will help you if something goes wrong.
And the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy.
Now, the first time we climb the trust stack, it feels weird, even risky, but we get to a point where these ideas seem totally normal.
Our behaviors transform, often relatively quickly.
In other words, trust enables change and innovation.
So an idea that intrigued me, and I'd like you to consider, is whether we can better understand major waves of disruption and change in individuals in society through the lens of trust.
Well, it turns out that trust has only evolved in three significant chapters throughout the course of human history: local, institutional and what we're now entering, distributed.
So for a long time, until the mid-1800s, trust was built around tight-knit relationships.
So say I lived in a village with the first five rows of this audience, and we all knew one another, and say I wanted to borrow money.
The man who had his eyes wide open, he might lend it to me, and if I didn't pay him back, you'd all know I was dodgy.
I would get a bad reputation, and you would refuse to do business with me in the future.
Trust was mostly local and accountability-based.
In the mid-19th century, society went through a tremendous amount of change.
People moved to fast-growing cities such as London and San Francisco, and a local banker here was replaced by large corporations that didn't know us as individuals.
We started to place our trust into black box systems of authority, things like legal contracts and regulation and insurance, and less trust directly in other people.
Trust became institutional and commission-based.
It's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so.
I am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust: the News Corp phone hacking, the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the widespread abuse in the Catholic Church, the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis, or more recently the Panama Papers that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes.
And the thing that really surprises me is why do leaders find it so hard to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize, when our trust is broken?
It would be easy to conclude that institutional trust isn't working because we are fed up with the sheer audacity of dishonest elites, but what's happening now runs deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions.
We're starting to realize that institutional trust wasn't designed for the digital age.
Conventions of how trust is built, managed, lost and repaired -- in brands, leaders and entire systems -- is being turned upside down.
Now, this is exciting, but it's frightening, because it forces many of us to have to rethink how trust is built and destroyed with our customers, with our employees, even our loved ones.
The other day, I was talking to the CEO of a leading international hotel brand, and as is often the case, we got onto the topic of Airbnb.
And he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success.
He was perplexed at how a company that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another could work so well across 191 countries.
So I said to him that I had a confession to make, and he looked at me a bit strangely, and I said -- and I'm sure many of you do this as well -- I don't always bother to hang my towels up when I'm finished in the hotel, but I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb.
And the reason why I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb is because guests know that they'll be rated by hosts, and that those ratings are likely to impact their ability to transact in the future.
It's a simple illustration of how online trust will change our behaviors in the real world, make us more accountable in ways we cannot yet even imagine.
I am not saying we do not need hotels or traditional forms of authority.
But what we cannot deny is that the way trust flows through society is changing, and it's creating this big shift away from the 20th century that was defined by institutional trust towards the 21st century that will be fueled by distributed trust.
Trust is no longer top-down.
It's being unbundled and inverted.
It's no longer opaque and linear.
A new recipe for trust is emerging that once again is distributed amongst people and is accountability-based.
And this shift is only going to accelerate with the emergence of the blockchain, the innovative ledger technology underpinning Bitcoin.
Now let's be honest, getting our heads around the way blockchain works is mind-blowing.
And one of the reasons why is it involves processing some pretty complicated concepts with terrible names.
I mean, cryptographic algorithms and hash functions, and people called miners, who verify transactions -- all that was created by this mysterious person or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.
Now, that is a massive trust leap that hasn't happened yet.
(Applause)
But let's try to imagine this.
So "The Economist" eloquently described the blockchain as the great chain of being sure about things.
The easiest way I can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets, and they are filled with assets.
So that could be a property title. It could be a stock trade. It could be a creative asset, such as the rights to a song.
Every time something moves from one place on the register to somewhere else, that asset transfer is time-stamped and publicly recorded on the blockchain.
It's that simple. Right.
So the real implication of the blockchain is that it removes the need for any kind of third party, such as a lawyer, or a trusted intermediary, or maybe not a government intermediary to facilitate the exchange.
So if we go back to the trust stack, you still have to trust the idea, you have to trust the platform, but you don't have to trust the other person in the traditional sense.
The implications are huge. In the same way the internet blew open the doors to an age of information available to everyone, the blockchain will revolutionize trust on a global scale.
Now, I've waited to the end intentionally to mention Uber, because I recognize that it is a contentious and widely overused example, but in the context of a new era of trust, it's a great case study.
Now, we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust.
We've already seen this, and it can go horribly wrong.
I am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations all around the world trying to get governments to ban Uber based on claims that it is unsafe.
I happened to be in London the day that these protests took place, and I happened to notice a tweet from Matt Hancock, who is a British minister for business.
And he wrote, "Does anyone have details of this #Uber app everyone's talking about?
(Laughter)
I'd never heard of it until today."
Now, the taxi associations, they legitimized the first layer of the trust stack.
They legitimized the idea that they were trying to eliminate, and sign-ups increased by 850 percent in 24 hours.
Now, this is a really strong illustration of how once a trust shift has happened around a behavior or an entire sector, you cannot reverse the story.
Every day, five million people will take a trust leap and ride with Uber.
In China, on Didi, the ride-sharing platform, 11 million rides taken every day.
That's 127 rides per second, showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon.
And the fascinating thing is that both drivers and passengers report that seeing a name and seeing someone's photo and their rating makes them feel safer, and as you may have experienced, even behave a little more nicely in the taxi cab.
Uber and Didi are early but powerful examples of how technology is creating trust between people in ways and on a scale never possible before.
Today, many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by strangers.
We meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with.
We share our homes with people we do not know.
This is just the beginning, because the real disruption happening isn't technological.
It's the trust shift it creates, and for my part, I want to help people understand this new era of trust so that we can get it right and we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems that are more transparent, inclusive and accountable.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Please meet Jane. She has a high-risk pregnancy.
Within 24 weeks, she's on bed rest at the hospital, being monitored for her preterm contractions.
She doesn't look the happiest.
That's in part because it requires technicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions.
Another reason Jane is not so happy is because she's worried.
In particular, she's worried about what happens after her 10-day stay on bed rest at the hospital.
What happens when she's home?
If she were to give birth this early it would be devastating.
As an African-American woman, she's twice as likely to have a premature birth or to have a stillbirth.
So Jane basically has one of two options: stay at the hospital on bed rest, a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth, and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill; or head home after her 10-day stay and hope for the best.
Neither of these two options seems appealing.
As I began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this, I began to ask myself and imagine: Is there an alternative?
Is there a way we could have the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital while someone is at home living their daily life?
With that in mind, I encouraged people in my research group to partner with some clever material scientists, and all of us came together and brainstormed.
And after a long process, we came up with a vision, an idea, of a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry or you could apply to yourself like a Band-Aid.
And after many trials and tribulations and years of endeavors, we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips, except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body.
These systems are about the thickness of a human hair.
They can measure the types of information that we want, things such as: bodily movement, bodily temperature, electrical rhythms of the body and so forth.
We can also engineer these systems, so they can integrate energy sources, and can have wireless transmission capabilities.
So as we began to build these types of systems, we began to test them on ourselves in our research group.
But in addition, we began to reach out to some of our clinical partners in San Diego, and test these on different patients in different clinical conditions, including moms-to-be like Jane.
Here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional belt.
In addition, our flexible electronic patches are there.
This picture demonstrates waveforms pertaining to the fetal heart rate, where the red corresponds to what was acquired with the conventional belts, and the blue corresponds to our estimates using our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms.
At this moment, we gave ourselves a big mental high five.
Some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition, and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context.
But there was still a problem. The problem was, the way we manufactured these systems was very inefficient, had low yield and was very error-prone.
In addition, as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital, they encouraged us to make sure that our electronics worked with typical medical adhesives that are used in a hospital.
We had an epiphany and said, "Wait a minute.
Rather than just making them work with adhesives, let's integrate them into adhesives, and that could solve our manufacturing problem."
This picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of Scotch tape by simply peeling it off of a wafer.
Ongoing work in our research group allows us to, in addition, embed integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives to do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them, processing them and encoding for wireless transmission.
All of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital.
So when we reached this point, we had some other challenges, from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective, to make sure that we could make it used practically.
In many digital health discussions, people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data, wirelessly transmit it, send it to the cloud, and in the cloud, we can extract meaningful information for interpretation.
And indeed, you can do all of that, if you're not worried about some of the energy challenges.
Think about Jane for a moment.
She doesn't live in Palo Alto, nor does she live in Beverly Hills.
What that means is, we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data.
There's another challenge that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about.
And that is, that Jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment.
She, people like her, her ancestors, have not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors and the hospital or insurance companies.
That means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy.
Jane might not feel that happy about all that data being processed into the cloud.
And Jane cannot be fooled; she reads the news.
She knows that if the federal government can be hacked, if the Fortune 500 can be hacked, so can her doctor.
And so with that in mind, we had an epiphany.
We cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world, but perhaps we can present them a smaller target.
What if we could actually, rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation run in the cloud, what if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits embedded into those adhesives?
And so when we integrate these things together, what this means is that now we can think about the future where someone like Jane can still go about living her normal daily life, she can be monitored, it can be done in a way where she doesn't have to get another job to pay her data plan, and we can also address some of her concerns about privacy.
So at this point, we're feeling very good about ourselves.
We've accomplished this, we've begun to address some of these questions about privacy and we feel like, pretty much the chapter is closed now.
Everyone lived happily ever after, right?
Well, not so fast.
(Laughter)
One of the things we have to remember, as I mentioned earlier, is that Jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment.
We have to remember that there are increasing and widening health disparities, and there's inequity in terms of proper care management.
And so what that means is that this simple picture of Jane and her data -- even with her being comfortable being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud, letting a doctor intervene if necessary -- is not the whole story.
So what we're beginning to do is to think about ways to have trusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like Jane and her health care providers.
For example, we've begun to partner with churches and to think about nurses that are church members, that come from that trusted community, as patient advocates and health coaches to people like Jane.
Another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies, increasingly, are attracted to some of these ideas.
They're increasingly realizing that perhaps it's better to pay one dollar now for a wearable device and a health coach, rather than paying 10 dollars later, when that baby is born prematurely and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit -- one of the most expensive parts of a hospital.
This has been a long learning process for us.
This iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem and not feeling totally comfortable, and identifying the next problem, has helped us go along this path of actually trying to not only innovate with this technology but make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most.
Another learning lesson we've taken from this process that is very humbling, is that as technology progresses and advances at an accelerating rate, we have to remember that human beings are using this technology, and we have to be mindful that these human beings -- they have a face, they have a name and a life.
And in the case of Jane, hopefully, two.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, I started my first job as a computer programmer in my very first year of college -- basically, as a teenager.
Soon after I started working, writing software in a company, a manager who worked at the company came down to where I was, and he whispered to me, "Can he tell if I'm lying?" There was nobody else in the room.
"Can who tell if you're lying?
And why are we whispering? "
"Can he tell if I'm lying?" The manager pointed at the computer in the room. Well, that manager was having an affair with the receptionist.
(Laughter)
And I was still a teenager. So I whisper-shouted back to him, "Yes, the computer can tell if you're lying."
(Laughter)
Well, I laughed, but actually, the laugh's on me.
Nowadays, there are computational systems that can suss out emotional states and even lying from processing human faces.
Advertisers and even governments are very interested.
I had become a computer programmer because I was one of those kids crazy about math and science.
But somewhere along the line I'd learned about nuclear weapons, and I'd gotten really concerned with the ethics of science. I was troubled. However, because of family circumstances, I also needed to start working as soon as possible.
So I thought to myself, hey, let me pick a technical field where I can get a job easily and where I don't have to deal with any troublesome questions of ethics. So I picked computers.
(Laughter)
Well, ha, ha, ha!
All the laughs are on me.
Nowadays, computer scientists are building platforms that control what a billion people see every day.
They're developing cars that could decide who to run over.
They're even building machines, weapons, that might kill human beings in war.
It's ethics all the way down.
Machine intelligence is here. We're now using computation to make all sort of decisions, but also new kinds of decisions.
We're asking questions to computation that have no single right answers, that are subjective and open-ended and value-laden.
We're asking questions like, "Who should the company hire?" "Which update from which friend should you be shown?" "Which convict is more likely to reoffend?" "Which news item or movie should be recommended to people?"
Look, yes, we've been using computers for a while, but this is different.
This is a historical twist, because we cannot anchor computation for such subjective decisions the way we can anchor computation for flying airplanes, building bridges, going to the moon. Are airplanes safer? Did the bridge sway and fall?
There, we have agreed-upon, fairly clear benchmarks, and we have laws of nature to guide us.
We have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs.
To make things more complicated, our software is getting more powerful, but it's also getting less transparent and more complex.
Recently, in the past decade, complex algorithms have made great strides.
They can recognize human faces. They can decipher handwriting. They can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages. They can detect tumors in medical imaging.
They can beat humans in chess and Go.
Much of this progress comes from a method called "machine learning." Machine learning is different than traditional programming, where you give the computer detailed, exact, painstaking instructions.
It's more like you take the system and you feed it lots of data, including unstructured data, like the kind we generate in our digital lives.
And the system learns by churning through this data.
And also, crucially, these systems don't operate under a single-answer logic.
They don't produce a simple answer; it's more probabilistic: "This one is probably more like what you're looking for."
Now, the upside is: this method is really powerful.
The head of Google's AI systems called it, "the unreasonable effectiveness of data." The downside is, we don't really understand what the system learned.
In fact, that's its power.
This is less like giving instructions to a computer; it's more like training a puppy-machine-creature we don't really understand or control. So this is our problem. It's a problem when this artificial intelligence system gets things wrong.
It's also a problem when it gets things right, because we don't even know which is which when it's a subjective problem.
We don't know what this thing is thinking.
So, consider a hiring algorithm -- a system used to hire people, using machine-learning systems.
Such a system would have been trained on previous employees' data and instructed to find and hire people like the existing high performers in the company. Sounds good. I once attended a conference that brought together human resources managers and executives, high-level people, using such systems in hiring.
They were super excited.
They thought that this would make hiring more objective, less biased, and give women and minorities a better shot against biased human managers.
And look -- human hiring is biased. I know. I mean, in one of my early jobs as a programmer, my immediate manager would sometimes come down to where I was really early in the morning or really late in the afternoon, and she'd say, "Zeynep, let's go to lunch!" I'd be puzzled by the weird timing. It's 4pm. Lunch? I was broke, so free lunch. I always went. I later realized what was happening.
My immediate managers had not confessed to their higher-ups that the programmer they hired for a serious job was a teen girl who wore jeans and sneakers to work.
I was doing a good job, I just looked wrong and was the wrong age and gender.
So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way certainly sounds good to me.
But with these systems, it is more complicated, and here's why: Currently, computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs, even if you have not disclosed those things.
They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings.
They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.
Remember -- for things you haven't even disclosed. This is inference.
I have a friend who developed such computational systems to predict the likelihood of clinical or postpartum depression from social media data.
The results are impressive.
Her system can predict the likelihood of depression months before the onset of any symptoms -- months before.
No symptoms, there's prediction.
She hopes it will be used for early intervention. Great! But now put this in the context of hiring.
So at this human resources managers conference, I approached a high-level manager in a very large company, and I said to her, "Look, what if, unbeknownst to you, your system is weeding out people with high future likelihood of depression?
They're not depressed now, just maybe in the future, more likely.
What if it's weeding out women more likely to be pregnant in the next year or two but aren't pregnant now?
What if it's hiring aggressive people because that's your workplace culture?" You can't tell this by looking at gender breakdowns.
Those may be balanced.
And since this is machine learning, not traditional coding, there is no variable there labeled "higher risk of depression," "higher risk of pregnancy," "aggressive guy scale." Not only do you not know what your system is selecting on, you don't even know where to begin to look.
It's a black box.
It has predictive power, but you don't understand it.
"What safeguards," I asked, "do you have to make sure that your black box isn't doing something shady?" She looked at me as if I had just stepped on 10 puppy tails.
(Laughter)
She stared at me and she said, "I don't want to hear another word about this." And she turned around and walked away.
Mind you -- she wasn't rude.
It was clearly: what I don't know isn't my problem, go away, death stare.
(Laughter)
Look, such a system may even be less biased than human managers in some ways.
And it could make monetary sense.
But it could also lead to a steady but stealthy shutting out of the job market of people with higher risk of depression.
Is this the kind of society we want to build, without even knowing we've done this, because we turned decision-making to machines we don't totally understand?
Another problem is this: these systems are often trained on data generated by our actions, human imprints.
Well, they could just be reflecting our biases, and these systems could be picking up on our biases and amplifying them and showing them back to us, while we're telling ourselves, "We're just doing objective, neutral computation."
Researchers found that on Google, women are less likely than men to be shown job ads for high-paying jobs.
And searching for African-American names is more likely to bring up ads suggesting criminal history, even when there is none.
Such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don't know, can have life-altering consequences.
In Wisconsin, a defendant was sentenced to six years in prison for evading the police.
You may not know this, but algorithms are increasingly used in parole and sentencing decisions.
He wanted to know: How is this score calculated?
It's a commercial black box.
The company refused to have its algorithm be challenged in open court.
But ProPublica, an investigative nonprofit, audited that very algorithm with what public data they could find, and found that its outcomes were biased and its predictive power was dismal, barely better than chance, and it was wrongly labeling black defendants as future criminals at twice the rate of white defendants.
So, consider this case: This woman was late picking up her godsister from a school in Broward County, Florida, running down the street with a friend of hers.
They spotted an unlocked kid's bike and a scooter on a porch and foolishly jumped on it.
As they were speeding off, a woman came out and said, "Hey!
That's my kid's bike! "They dropped it, they walked away, but they were arrested.
She was wrong, she was foolish, but she was also just 18.
She had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors.
Meanwhile, that man had been arrested for shoplifting in Home Depot -- 85 dollars' worth of stuff, a similar petty crime.
But he had two prior armed robbery convictions.
But the algorithm scored her as high risk, and not him.
Two years later, ProPublica found that she had not reoffended.
It was just hard to get a job for her with her record.
He, on the other hand, did reoffend and is now serving an eight-year prison term for a later crime.
Clearly, we need to audit our black boxes and not have them have this kind of unchecked power.
(Applause)
Audits are great and important, but they don't solve all our problems.
Take Facebook's powerful news feed algorithm -- you know, the one that ranks everything and decides what to show you from all the friends and pages you follow.
Should you be shown another baby picture?
(Laughter)
A sullen note from an acquaintance?
An important but difficult news item?
There's no right answer.
Facebook optimizes for engagement on the site: likes, shares, comments.
In August of 2014, protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of an African-American teenager by a white police officer, under murky circumstances.
The news of the protests was all over my algorithmically unfiltered Twitter feed, but nowhere on my Facebook.
Was it my Facebook friends?
I disabled Facebook's algorithm, which is hard because Facebook keeps wanting to make you come under the algorithm's control, and saw that my friends were talking about it.
It's just that the algorithm wasn't showing it to me.
I researched this and found this was a widespread problem.
The story of Ferguson wasn't algorithm-friendly.
It's not "likable." Who's going to click on "like?" It's not even easy to comment on.
Without likes and comments, the algorithm was likely showing it to even fewer people, so we didn't get to see this.
Instead, that week, Facebook's algorithm highlighted this, which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.
Worthy cause; dump ice water, donate to charity, fine.
But it was super algorithm-friendly.
The machine made this decision for us.
A very important but difficult conversation might have been smothered, had Facebook been the only channel.
Now, finally, these systems can also be wrong in ways that don't resemble human systems.
Do you guys remember Watson, IBM's machine-intelligence system that wiped the floor with human contestants on Jeopardy?
It was a great player.
But then, for Final Jeopardy, Watson was asked this question: "Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero, its second-largest for a World War II battle."
(Hums Final Jeopardy music)
Chicago. The two humans got it right.
Watson, on the other hand, answered "Toronto" -- for a US city category!
The impressive system also made an error that a human would never make, a second-grader wouldn't make.
Our machine intelligence can fail in ways that don't fit error patterns of humans, in ways we won't expect and be prepared for.
It'd be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for, but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine.
(Laughter)
In May of 2010, a flash crash on Wall Street fueled by a feedback loop in Wall Street's "sell" algorithm wiped a trillion dollars of value in 36 minutes.
I don't even want to think what "error" means in the context of lethal autonomous weapons.
So yes, humans have always made biases.
Decision makers and gatekeepers, in courts, in news, in war ... they make mistakes; but that's exactly my point.
We cannot escape these difficult questions.
We cannot outsource our responsibilities to machines.
(Applause)
Artificial intelligence does not give us a "Get out of ethics free" card.
Data scientist Fred Benenson calls this math-washing.
We need the opposite.
We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion, scrutiny and investigation.
We need to make sure we have algorithmic accountability, auditing and meaningful transparency.
We need to accept that bringing math and computation to messy, value-laden human affairs does not bring objectivity; rather, the complexity of human affairs invades the algorithms.
Yes, we can and we should use computation to help us make better decisions.
But we have to own up to our moral responsibility to judgment, and use algorithms within that framework, not as a means to abdicate and outsource our responsibilities to one another as human to human.
Machine intelligence is here. That means we must hold on ever tighter to human values and human ethics.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I stand before you as a man who lives life to the full in the here and now.
But for a long time, I lived for death.
I was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence.
I tried to right wrongs through power and aggression.
I had deep concerns for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them.
I thought violent jihad was noble, chivalrous and the best way to help.
At a time when so many of our people — young people especially — are at risk of radicalization through groups like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others, when these groups are claiming that their horrific brutality and violence are true jihad, I want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong — completely wrong — as was mine, then.
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.
It includes exertion and spirituality, self-purification and devotion.
It refers to positive transformation through learning, wisdom and remembrance of God.
The word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole.
Jihad may at times take the form of fighting, but only sometimes, under strict conditions, within rules and limits.
In Islam, the benefit of an act must outweigh the harm or hardship it entails.
More importantly, the verses in the Koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about forgiveness, benevolence or patience.
But now I believe that there are no circumstances on earth where violent jihad is permissible, because it will lead to greater harm.
But now the idea of jihad has been hijacked.
It has been perverted to mean violent struggle wherever Muslims are undergoing difficulties, and turned into terrorism by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.
But I have come to understand that true jihad means striving to the utmost to strengthen and live those qualities which God loves: honesty, trustworthiness, compassion, benevolence, reliability, respect, truthfulness -- human values that so many of us share.
I was born in Bangladesh, but grew up mostly in England.
And I went to school here.
My father was an academic, and we were in the UK through his work.
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh when everything changed.
The War of Independence impacted upon us terribly, pitting family against family, neighbor against neighbor.
And at the age of 12 I experienced war, destitution in my family, the deaths of 22 of my relatives in horrible ways, as well as the murder of my elder brother.
I witnessed killing ... animals feeding on corpses in the streets, starvation all around me, wanton, horrific violence -- senseless violence.
I was a young man, teenager, fascinated by ideas.
I wanted to learn, but I could not go to school for four years.
After the War of Independence, my father was put in prison for two and a half years, and I used to visit him every week in prison, and homeschooled myself.
My father was released in 1973 and he fled to England as a refugee, and we soon followed him. I was 17.
So these experiences gave me a sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world.
And I had a strong desire -- a very keen, deep desire -- to right wrongs and help the victims of oppression.
While studying at college in the UK, I met others who showed me how I could channel that desire and help through my religion.
And I was radicalized -- enough to consider violence correct, even a virtue under certain circumstances.
So I became involved in the jihad in Afghanistan.
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan population against the Soviet army.
And I thought that was jihad: my sacred duty, which would be rewarded by God.
I became a preacher. I was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the UK.
I recruited, I raised funds, I trained.
I confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist Islamists — these people who use the idea of jihad to justify their lust for power, authority and control on earth: a perversion perpetuated today by fascist Islamist groups like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.
For a period of around 15 years, I fought for short periods of time in Kashmir and Burma, besides Afghanistan.
Our aim was to remove the invaders, to bring relief to the oppressed victims and of course to establish an Islamic state, a caliphate for God's rule.
And I did this openly.
I didn't break any laws.
I was proud and grateful to be British -- I still am.
And I bore no hostility against this, my country, nor enmity towards the non-Muslim citizens, and I still don't.
During one battle in Afghanistan, some British men and I formed a special bond with a 15-year-old Afghani boy, Abdullah, an innocent, loving and lovable kid who was always eager to please. He was poor. And boys like him did menial tasks in the camp.
And he seemed happy enough, but I couldn't help wonder -- his parents must have missed him dearly.
And they must have dreamt about a better future for him.
A victim of circumstance caught up in a war, cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time.
One day I picked up this unexploded mortar shell in a trench, and I had it deposited in a makeshift mud hut lab.
And I went out on a short, pointless skirmish -- always pointless, And I came back a few hours later to discover he was dead.
He had tried to recover explosives from that shell.
It exploded, and he died a violent death, blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me.
So I started to question.
How did his death serve any purpose?
Why did he die and I lived?
I carried on. I fought in Kashmir.
I also recruited for the Philippines, Bosnia and Chechnya. And the questions grew.
Later in Burma, I came across Rohingya fighters, who were barely teenagers, born and brought up in the jungle, carrying machine guns and grenade launchers.
I met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices.
Looking at me, they begged me to take them away to England.
They simply wanted to go to school -- that was their dream.
My family -- my children of the same age -- were living at home in the UK, going to school, living a safe life.
And I couldn't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another about their dreams for such a life.
Victims of circumstances: these two young boys, sleeping rough on the ground, looking up at the stars, cynically exploited by their leaders for their personal lust for glory and power.
I soon witnessed boys like them killing one another in conflicts between rival groups.
And it was the same everywhere ... Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma, Philippines, Chechnya; petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another in the name of jihad. Muslims against Muslims. Not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers; not bringing relief to the oppressed.
Children being used, cynically exploited; people dying in conflicts which I was supporting in the name of jihad.
And it still carries on today.
Realizing that the violent jihad I had engaged in abroad was so different -- such a chasm between what I had experienced and what I thought was sacred duty -- I had to reflect on my activities here in the UK.
I had to consider my preaching, recruiting, fund-raising, training, but most importantly, radicalizing -- sending young people to fight and die as I was doing -- all totally wrong.
So I got involved in violent jihad in the mid '80s, starting with Afghanistan.
And by the time I finished it was in the year 2000.
I was completely immersed in it.
All around me people supported, applauded, even celebrated what we were doing in their name.
But by the time I learned to get out, completely disillusioned in the year 2000, 15 years had passed.
So what goes wrong? We were so busy talking about virtue, and we were blinded by a cause.
And we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character.
We told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed, but these were unwinnable wars.
We became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred, complicit in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.
So over time, a very long time, I opened my eyes.
I began to dare to face the truth, to think, to face the hard questions.
I got in touch with my soul.
What have I learned? That people who engage in violent jihadism, that people who are drawn to these types of extremisms, are not that different to everyone else.
But I believe such people can change.
They can regain their hearts and restore them by filling them with human values that heal.
When we ignore the realities, we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection.
And we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives.
I engaged in actions I thought were correct.
But now I began to question how I knew what I knew.
I endlessly told others to accept the truth, but I failed to give doubt its rightful place.
This conviction that people can change is rooted in my experience, my own journey.
Through wide reading, reflecting, contemplation, self-knowledge, I discovered, I realized that Islamists' world of us and them is false and unjust.
Through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted, to the inviolable truths, incontestable truths, I developed a more nuanced understanding.
I realized that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction, foolish preachers, only foolish preachers like I used to be, see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use to assert authenticity.
So I understood the vital importance of self-knowledge, political awareness and the necessity for a deep and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions, how they affect others.
So my plea today to everyone, especially those who sincerely believe in Islamist jihadism... refuse dogmatic authority; let go of anger, hatred and violence; learn to right wrongs without even attempting to justify cruel, unjust and futile behavior.
Instead create a few beautiful and useful things that outlive us.
Approach the world, life, with love.
Learn to develop or cultivate your hearts to see goodness, beauty and truth in others and in the world.
That way we do matter more to ourselves ... to each other, to our communities and, for me, to God.
This is jihad -- my true jihad.
Thank you.
The great philosopher Aristotle said if something doesn't exist, there's no word for it, and if there's no word for something, that something doesn't exist.
So when we talk about elections, we in established democracies, we know what we're talking about.
We've got the words. We have the vocabulary.
We know what a polling station is. We know what a ballot paper is.
But what about countries where democracy doesn't exist, countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic society?
I work in the field of electoral assistance, so that's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections.
When people ask me what I do, quite often I get this answer. "Oh, so you're one of these people who goes around the world imposing Western democracy on countries that can't handle it." Well, the United Nations does not impose anything on anybody. It really doesn't, and also, what we do is firmly anchored in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 21, that says that everybody should have the right to choose who governs them.
So that's the basis of the work.
I specialize in public outreach.
What does that mean? Another jargon. It actually means designing information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote understand where, when, how to register; where, when, how to vote; why, why it is important to take part.
So I'll probably devise a specific campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part, that they can be part of the process.
Young people as well.
All sorts of people. Handicapped people. We try to reach everybody.
And it's not always easy, because very often in this work, I've noticed now over the years that I've been doing it that words are lacking, and so what do you do?
Afghanistan. It's a country with high levels of illiteracy, and the thing about that was, it was in 2005, and we organized two elections on the same day.
The reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult, it seemed to be more efficient to do that.
It was, but on the other hand, explaining two elections instead of one was even more complicated.
So we used a lot of images, and when it came to the actual ballot, we had problems, because so many people wanted to take part, we had 300 candidates for 52 seats in the Wolesi Jirga, which is the parliamentary elections.
And for the Provincial Council, we had even more candidates.
We had 330 for 54 seats.
So talking about ballot design, this is what the ballot looked like.
It's the size of a newspaper.
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot — (Laughter) Yeah, and — this was the Provincial Council ballot. Even more. So you see, we did use a lot of symbols and things like that.
And we had other problems in Southern Sudan.
Southern Sudan was a very different story.
We had so many people who had never, of course, voted, but we had extremely, extremely high levels of illiteracy, very, very poor infrastructure.
For example -- I mean, it's a country the size of Texas, more or less.
We had seven kilometers of paved roads, seven kilometers in the whole country, and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes in Juba Airport.
So transporting electoral materials, etc., is exceedingly difficult.
People had no idea about what a box looked like.
It was very complicated, so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go, but there were 132 languages.
So that was extremely challenging.
Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.
It was the Arab Spring.
A huge amount of hope was generated by that enormous movement that was going on in the region.
There was Libya, there was Egypt, there was Yemen.
It was an enormous, enormous historical moment.
And I was sitting with the election commission, and we were talking about various aspects of the election, and I was hearing them using words that I hadn't actually heard before, and I'd worked with Iraqis, I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians, and suddenly they were using these words, and I just thought, "This is strange." And what really gave rise to it was this word "observer." We were discussing election observers, and the election commissioner was talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.
This means "to notice" in a passive sort of sense, as in, "I noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt." Did I go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not?
That is the role of an election observer.
It's very active, it's governed by all kinds of treaties, and it has got that control function in it.
And then I got wind of the fact that in Egypt, they were using this term "mutabi’," which means "to follow." So we were now having followers of an election.
So that's not quite right either, because there is a term that's already accepted and in use, which was the word "muraqib" which means "a controller." It's got that notion of control.
So I thought, three words for one concept. This is not good.
And with our colleagues, we thought perhaps it's our role to actually help make sure that the words are understood and actually create a work of reference that could be used across the Arab region.
And that's what we did.
So together with these colleagues, we launched the "Arabic Lexicon of Electoral Terminology," and we worked in eight different countries.
It meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you're going to organize a democratic election.
And we defined these terms, and we worked with the Arab colleagues and came to an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in Arabic.
Because the Arabic language is very rich, and that's part of the problem.
But there are 22 countries that speak Arabic, and they use modern standard Arabic, which is the Arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts, but of course, then from one country to the next in day to day language and use it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.
So that was another added layer of complication. So in one sense you had the problem that language wasn't fully ripe, if you like, neologisms were coming up, new expressions.
And so we defined all these terms, and then we had eight correspondents in the region.
We submitted the draft to them, they responded back to us. "Yes, we understand the definition.
We agree with it, but this is what we say in our country." Because we were not going to harmonize or force harmonization.
We were trying to facilitate understanding among people.
So in yellow, you see the different expressions in use in the various countries.
So this, I'm happy to say, it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field, sat with the election commissions in all these different countries, debated and defined and refined the draft, and finally published it in November 2014 in Cairo. And it's gone a long way.
We published 10,000 copies.
To date, there's about 3,000 downloads off the internet in PDF form.
I heard just recently from a colleague that they've taken it up in Somalia.
They're going to produce a version of this in Somalia, because there's nothing in Somalia at all.
So that's very good to know.
And this newly formed Arab Organization for Electoral Management Bodies, which is trying to professionalize how elections are run in the region, they're using it as well.
And the Arab League have now built up a pan-Arab observation unit, and they're using it.
So that's all really good.
However, this work of reference is quite high-pitched.
It's complex, and a lot of the terms are quite technical, so the average person probably doesn't need to know at least a third of it.
But the people of the Middle East have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education.
It's part of our curriculum at school.
It doesn't really exist in that part of the world, and I feel it's really the right of everybody to know how these things work.
And it's a good thing to think about producing a work of reference for the average person, and bearing in mind that now we have a basis to work with, but also we have technology, so we can reach out using telephone apps, video, animation.
There's all sorts of tools that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language.
We hear a lot of misery about the Middle East. We hear the chaos of war. We hear terrorism. We hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative news that comes to us all the time.
What we're not hearing is what are the people, the everyday people, thinking? What are they aspiring to?
Let's give them the means, let's give them the words. The silent majority is silent because they don't have the words.
The silent majority needs to know.
It is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with.
The silent majority does not need to be silent.
Let's help them have a voice.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
Some people are obsessed by French wines.
Others love playing golf or devouring literature.
One of my greatest pleasures in life is, I have to admit, a bit special.
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching cities from the sky, from an airplane window.
Some cities are calmly industrious, like Dusseldorf or Louisville.
Others project an energy that they can hardly contain, like New York or Hong Kong.
And then you have Paris or Istanbul, and their patina full of history.
I see cities as living beings.
And when I discover them from far above, I like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space.
Especially at night, when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden: the city's vascular system performing its vital function right before your eyes.
But when I'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day, that reality looks very different.
(Laughter)
Nothing -- not public radio, no podcast --
(Laughter) Not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living.
(Laughter)
Isn't it absurd that we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages?
(Laughter)
In the US alone, we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014.
With that amount of time, ancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza.
(Laughter)
We do that in one year.
A monumental waste of time, energy and human potential.
For decades, our remedy for congestion was simple: build new roads or enlarge existing ones. And it worked. It worked admirably for Paris, when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards.
And it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities.
But in more established urban centers, significant network expansions are almost impossible: habitat is just too dense, real estate, too expensive and public finances, too fragile.
Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick, and we should pay attention.
Our current way of thinking is not working.
For our transportation to flow, we need a new source of inspiration.
So after 16 years working in transportation, my "aha moment" happened when speaking with a biotech customer.
She was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system. "Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system -- all the veins and arteries in our body making miracles of logistics every day." This is the moment I realized that biology has been in the transportation business for billions of years.
It has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients, gases and proteins.
It really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory.
So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us?
I wanted to know: Why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives, when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis?
And the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks.
I don't know if you realize, but each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies -- 60,000 miles.
That's two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference, inside you.
What it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us, not just under the surface of our skin.
But if you look at our cities, yes, we have some underground subway systems and some tunnels and bridges, and also some helicopters in the sky.
But the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground, on the surface.
So in other words, while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us, our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional.
And so what we need is to embrace that verticality.
If our surface grid is saturated, well, let's elevate our traffic.
This Chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams -- that was an eye-opener on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities.
And we can go higher, and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid.
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods.
And we can keep climbing, and fly.
The fact that a company like Airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis is telling us something.
Flying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu to attractive business-case territory.
And that's an exciting moment.
So building this 3-D transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams.
But it's not the only one.
We have to question other fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use.
Just imagine a very familiar scene: You've been driving for 42 minutes.
The two kids behind you are getting restless.
And you're late.
Do you see that slow car in front of you?
Always comes when you're late, right?
(Laughter)
That driver is looking for parking.
There is no parking spot available in the area, but how would he know?
It is estimated that up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking.
Do you see the 100 cars around you?
Eighty-five of them only have one passenger.
Those 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus.
So the question is: Why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most?
Why are we doing this to ourselves?
Biology would never do this.
Space inside our arteries is fully utilized.
At every heartbeat, a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body.
And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either.
In healthy conditions, more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized.
Can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were 95 percent full, all the additional space you would have to walk, to bike and to enjoy our cities?
The reason blood is so incredibly efficient is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues; otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins.
No, they're shared.
They're shared by all the cells of our body.
And because our network is so extensive, each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them.
Blood is both a collective and individual form of transportation.
But for our cities, we've been stuck.
We've been stuck in an endless debate between creating a car-centric society or extensive mass-transit systems.
I think we should transcend this.
I think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars and the efficiencies of trains and buses. Just imagine. You're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train, along with 1,200 passengers.
The problem with urban trains is that sometimes you have to stop five, ten, fifteen times before your final destination.
What if in this train you didn't have to stop?
In this train, wagons can detach dynamically while you're moving and become express, driverless buses that move on a secondary road network.
And so without a single stop, nor a lengthy transfer, you are now sitting in a bus that is headed toward your suburb.
And when you get close, the section you're sitting in detaches and self-drives you right to your doorstep.
It is collective and individual at the same time.
This could be one of the shared, modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.
Now... as if walking in a city buzzing with drones, flying taxis, modular buses and suspended magnetic pods was not exotic enough, I think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.
If you think about it, the current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans.
They're trying to learn traffic rules, which is relatively simple, and coping with human unpredictability, which is more challenging.
But what would happen when whole cities become driverless?
Would we need traffic lights?
Would we need lanes?
How about speed limits?
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.
They never stop at red lights.
In the first driverless cities, you would have no red lights and no lanes.
And when all the cars are driverless and connected, everything is predictable and reaction time, minimum.
They can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them.
So instead of rigid traffic rules, flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms.
The result: a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns and the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai.
(Laughter)
Traffic will be functionally exuberant. It will be liquid like our blood.
And by a strange paradox, the more robotized our traffic grid will be, the more organic and alive its movement will feel.
So yes, biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today.
But this process has taken billions of years, and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations.
We can't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system.
We now have the dreams, the concepts and the technology to create 3-D transportation networks, invent new vehicles and change the flow in our cities.
Let's do it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to start by doing an experiment.
I'm going to play three videos of a rainy day.
But I've replaced the audio of one of the videos, and instead of the sound of rain, I've added the sound of bacon frying.
So I want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is.
All right. Actually, I lied.
They're all bacon.
(Bacon sizzles)
(Applause)
My point here isn't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene, but it's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies.
We're not looking for accuracy.
So on the subject of deception, I wanted to quote one of my favorite authors.
In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic; and all great art comes from lying and deceiving, and telling beautiful, untrue things.
So when you're watching a movie and a phone rings, it's not actually ringing.
It's been added later in postproduction in a studio.
All of the sounds you hear are fake.
Everything, apart from the dialogue, is fake.
When you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings --
(Wings flap)
They haven't really recorded the bird.
It sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet or shaking kitchen gloves.
(Flaps)
The burning of a cigarette up close --
(Cigarette burns)
It actually sounds a lot more authentic if you take a small Saran Wrap ball and release it.
(A Saran Warp ball being released)
Punches?
That's often done by sticking a knife in vegetables, usually cabbage.
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)
The next one -- it's breaking bones.
(Bones break)
Well, no one was really harmed.
It's actually ... breaking celery or frozen lettuce.
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)
Making the right sounds is not always as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section.
But it's often a lot more complicated than that.
So let's reverse-engineer together the creation of a sound effect.
One of my favorite stories comes from Frank Serafine.
He's a contributor to our library, and a great sound designer for "Tron" and "Star Trek" and others.
He was part of the Paramount team that won the Oscar for best sound for "The Hunt for Red October." In this Cold War classic, in the '90s, they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine.
So they had a small problem: they couldn't really find a submarine in West Hollywood.
So basically, what they did is, they went to a friend's swimming pool, and Frank performed a cannonball, or bomba.
They placed an underwater mic and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool.
So here's what the underwater mic sounds like.
(Underwater plunge)
Adding the overhead mic, it sounded a bit like this:
(Water splashes)
So now they took the sound and pitched it one octave down, sort of like slowing down a record.
(Water splashes at lower octave) And then they removed a lot of the high frequencies.
(Water splashes) And pitched it down another octave.
(Water splashes at lower octave) And then they added a little bit of the splash from the overhead microphone.
(Water splashes) And by looping and repeating that sound, they got this:
(Propeller churns)
So, creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we're inside the submarine.
But once you've created your sounds and you've synced them to the image, you want those sounds to live in the world of the story.
And one the best ways to do that is to add reverb.
So this is the first audio tool I want to talk about.
Reverberation, or reverb, is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended.
So it's sort of like the -- all the reflections from the materials, the objects and the walls around the sound.
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.
The original sound is less than half a second long.
(Gunshot) By adding reverb, we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom.
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom) Or like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church.
(Gunshot reverbs church)
Or in a canyon.
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)
So reverb gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source.
If the sound is the taste, then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound.
But reverb can do a lot more.
Listening to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on-screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we're listening to a commentator, to an objective narrator that's not participating in the on-screen action.
Also, emotionally intimate moments in cinema are often heard with zero reverb, because that's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear.
On the completely other side, adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we're listening to a flashback, or perhaps that we're inside the head of a character or that we're listening to the voice of God.
Or, even more powerful in film, Morgan Freeman.
(Laughter)
So --
(Applause)
But what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use?
Well, here's a really big one. It's silence. A few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention.
And in the Western world, we're not really used to verbal silences.
They're considered awkward or rude.
So silence preceding verbal communication can create a lot of tension.
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie, where it's full of explosions and automatic guns.
Loud stops being loud anymore, after a while.
So in a yin-yang way, silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect.
But what does silence mean?
Well, it depends how it's used in each film.
Silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought.
We often relate silences with ... contemplation, meditation, being deep in thought.
But apart from having one meaning, silence becomes a blank canvas upon which the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts.
But I want to make it clear: there is no such thing as silence.
And I know this sounds like the most pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
But even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds, you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood.
And in cinema, traditionally, there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector.
And even in today's Dolby world, there's not really any moment of silence if you listen around you.
There's always some sort of noise.
Now, since there's no such thing as silence, what do filmmakers and sound designers use?
Well, as a synonym, they often use ambiences.
Ambiences are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location.
Each location has a unique sound, and each room has a unique sound, which is called room tone.
So here's a recording of a market in Morocco.
(Voices, music)
And here's a recording of Times Square in New York.
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)
Room tone is the addition of all the noises inside the room: the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.
Here's a recording of my apartment in Brooklyn.
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler, the fridge and street traffic)
Ambiences work in a most primal way.
They can speak directly to our brain subconsciously.
So, birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality, perhaps because, as a species, we've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years.
(Birds chirp) On the other hand, industrial sounds have been introduced to us a little more recently.
Even though I really like them personally -- they've been used by one of my heroes, David Lynch, and his sound designer, Alan Splet -- industrial sounds often carry negative connotations.
(Machine noises)
Now, sound effects can tap into our emotional memory.
Occasionally, they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie.
The sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger.
(Thunder)
Church bells can remind us of the passing of time, or perhaps our own mortality.
(Bells ring)
And breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship or a friendship.
(Glass breaks)
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds, for example, brass or wind instruments played very loud, may remind us of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear.
(Brass and wind instruments play)
So now we've spoken about on-screen sounds.
But occasionally, the source of a sound cannot be seen.
That's what we call offscreen sounds, or "acousmatic." Acousmatic sounds -- well, the term "acousmatic" comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece, who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years, not revealing himself to his disciples.
I think the mathematician and philosopher thought that, in that way, his students might focus more on the voice, and his words and its meaning, rather than the visual of him speaking.
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz, or "1984's" Big Brother, separating the voice from its source, separating cause and effect sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or panopticism, and therefore, authority.
There's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound.
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries close to the ceiling, creating the illusion that we're listening to angels up in the sky.
Richard Wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience.
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin, famously hid in dark corners of clubs.
I think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source, you create a sense of mystery.
This has been seen in cinema over and over, with Hitchcock, and Ridley Scott in "Alien." Hearing a sound without knowing its source is going to create some sort of tension.
Also, it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that wasn't there during filming.
And if all this sounds a little theoretical, I wanted to play a little video.
(Toy squeaks)
(Typewriter)
(Drums)
(Ping-pong)
What I'm sort of trying to demonstrate with these tools is that sound is a language.
It can trick us by transporting us geographically; it can change the mood; it can set the pace; it can make us laugh or it can make us scared.
On a personal level, I fell in love with that language a few years ago, and somehow managed to make it into some sort of profession.
And I think with our work through the sound library, we're trying to kind of expand the vocabulary of that language.
And in that way, we want to offer the right tools to sound designers, filmmakers, and video game and app designers, to keep telling even better stories and creating even more beautiful lies.
So thanks for listening.
(Applause)
I'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word, one that people will do almost anything to avoid becoming.
Billion-dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it, and those of us who undeniably are it are left to navigate a relentless storm surrounding it.
I'm not sure if any of you have noticed, but I'm fat.
Not the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind, or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly.
I'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind.
Let's not sugarcoat it.
I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.
I am the elephant in the room.
When I walked out on stage, some of you may have been thinking, "Aww, this is going to be hilarious, because everybody knows that fat people are funny."
(Laughter)
Or you may have been thinking, "Where does she get her confidence from?" Because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable.
The fashion-conscious members of the audience may have been thinking how fabulous I look in this Beth Ditto dress --
(Cheers)
thank you very much. Whereas some of you might have thought, "Hmm, black would have been so much more slimming."
(Laughter)
You may have wondered, consciously or not, if I have diabetes, or a partner, or if I eat carbs after 7pm.
(Laughter)
You may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night, and that you really should renew your gym membership.
These judgments are insidious. They can be directed at individuals and groups, and they can also be directed at ourselves.
And this way of thinking is known as fatphobia.
Like any form of systematic oppression, fatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures like capitalism, patriarchy and racism, and that can make it really difficult to see, let alone challenge.
We live in a culture where being fat is seen as being a bad person -- lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible and morally suspect.
And we tend to see thinness as being universally good -- responsible, successful, and in control of our appetites, bodies and lives.
We see these ideas again and again in the media, in public health policy, doctors' offices, in everyday conversations and in our own attitudes.
We may even blame fat people themselves for the discrimination they face because, after all, if we don't like it, we should just lose weight. Easy. This antifat bias has become so integral, so ingrained to how we value ourselves and each other that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size and where that disdain comes from.
But we must question it, because the enormous value we place on how we look affects every one of us.
And do we really want to live in a society where people are denied their basic humanity if they don't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable?
So when I was six years old, my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage.
I was about a foot taller and a foot wider than most of the group.
When it came to doing our first performance, I was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu. I was going to sparkle. As the other girls slipped easily into their Lycra and tulle creations, not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me.
I was determined not to be excluded from the performance, so I turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.
I need a fourfour."
(Laughter)
Thanks, Mom.
And although I didn't recognize it at the time, claiming space for myself in that glorious fourfour was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist.
Now, I'm not saying that this whole body-love thing has been an easy skip along a glittering path of self-acceptance since that day in class. Far from it. I soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal can be a frustrating and isolating place.
I've spent the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages, and it's been quite the roller coaster.
I've been openly laughed at, abused from passing cars and been told that I'm delusional.
I also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high.
(Cheer)
Thanks. And through it all, that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me, and she has helped me stand before you today as an unapologetic fat person, a person that simply refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how I should move through the world in this body of mine.
(Applause)
And I'm not alone.
I am part of an international community of people who choose to, rather than passively accepting that our bodies are and probably always will be big, we actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today.
People who honor our strength and work with, not against, our perceived limitations, people who value health as something much more holistic than a number on an outdated BMI chart.
Instead, we value mental health, self-worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall well-being.
People who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies is a barrier to anything, really.
There are doctors, academics and bloggers who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject.
There are fatshionistas who reclaim their bodies and their beauty by wearing fatkinis and crop tops, exposing the flesh that we're all taught to hide.
There are fat athletes who run marathons, teach yoga or do kickboxing, all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo.
And these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our body-shaming culture.
But to be clear, I'm not saying that people shouldn't change their bodies if that's what they want to do.
Reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love and can look like a million different things, from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes, even weight loss.
It's simple: it's your body, and you decide what's best to do with it.
My way of engaging in activism is by doing all the things that we fatties aren't supposed to do, and there's a lot of them, inviting other people to join me and then making art about it.
The common thread through most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies, from the catwalk to club shows, from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages.
And reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community-building approach.
This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" --
(Laughter)
the fat fem synchronized swim team I started with a group of friends in Sydney.
The impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care should not be underestimated.
(Laughter)
Throughout my career, I have learned that fat bodies are inherently political, and unapologetic fat bodies can blow people's minds.
When director Kate Champion, of acclaimed dance theater company Force Majeure, asked me to be the artistic associate on a work featuring all fat dancers, I literally jumped at the opportunity.
And I mean literally. "Nothing to Lose" is a work made in collaboration with performers of size who drew from their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are.
And it was as far from ballet as you could imagine.
The very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company was, to put it mildly, controversial, because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before anywhere in the world.
People were skeptical. "What do you mean, 'fat dancers?' Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?
Where did they do their dance training?
Are they going to have the stamina for a full-length production?"
But despite the skepticism, "Nothing to Lose" became a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.
We received rave reviews, toured, won awards and were written about in over 27 languages.
These incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide.
I've lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives, how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people's bodies, and how it made them confront their own bias.
But of course, work that pushes people's buttons is not without its detractors.
I have been told that I'm glorifying obesity.
I have received violent death threats and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people's bodies and lives and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell.
I've even been called "the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" --
(Laughter)
a comment so absurd that it is funny.
But it also speaks to the panic, the literal terror, that the fear of fat can evoke.
It is this fear that's feeding the diet industry, which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies, for waiting to be the after-photo before we truly start to live our lives.
Because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia.
Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.
By advocating for self-determination and respect for all of us, we can shift society's reluctance to embrace diversity and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the spring of 2016, a legal battle between Apple and the Federal Bureau of Investigation captured the world's attention.
Apple has built security features into its mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner.
That means that criminals, hackers and yes, even governments are all locked out.
For Apple's customers, this is a great thing.
But governments are not so happy.
You see, Apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business.
Apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors.
There are really two smartphone operating systems in the global smartphone market: iOS and Android. iOS is made by Apple. Android is made by Google.
Apple has spent a lot of time and money to make sure that its products are as secure as possible.
Apple encrypts all data stored on iPhones by default, and text messages sent from one Apple customer to another Apple customer are encrypted by default without the user having to take any actions.
What this means is that, if the police seize an iPhone and it has a password, they'll have a difficult time getting any data off of it, if they can do it at all.
In contrast, the security of Android just really isn't as good.
Android phones, or at least most of the Android phones that have been sold to consumers, do not encrypt data stored on the device by default, and the built-in text messaging app in Android does not use encryption.
So if the police seize an Android phone, chances are, they'll be able to get all the data they want off of that device.
Two smartphones from two of the biggest companies in the world; one that protects data by default, and one that doesn't.
Apple is a seller of luxury goods.
It dominates the high end of the market.
And we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that include more features.
But not everyone can afford an iPhone.
That's where Android really, really dominates: at the middle and low end of the market, smartphones for the billion and a half people who cannot or will not spend 600 dollars on a phone.
But the dominance of Android has led to what I call the "digital security divide." That is, there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy and security of the rich, who can afford devices that secure their data by default, and of the poor, whose devices do very little to protect them by default.
So, think of the average Apple customer: a banker, a lawyer, a doctor, a politician.
These individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets that encrypt their calls, their text messages, all the data on the device, without them doing really anything to secure their information.
In contrast, the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance.
In the United States, where I live, African-Americans are more likely to be seen as suspicious or more likely to be profiled, and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance.
But African-Americans are also disproportionately likely to use Android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance.
This is a problem.
We must remember that surveillance is a tool.
It's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power.
And while I think it's absolutely great that companies like Apple are making it easy for people to encrypt, if the only people who can protect themselves from the gaze of the government are the rich and powerful, that's a problem.
And it's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem.
It's a civil rights problem.
So the lack of default security in Android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users who are depending on these devices.
This is actually a problem for our democracy.
I'll explain what I mean.
Modern social movements rely on technology -- from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street.
The organizers of these movements and the members of these movements increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones.
And so, naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones.
Now, it's quite possible that a future Martin Luther King or a Mandela or a Gandhi will have an iPhone and be protected from government surveillance.
But chances are, they'll probably have a cheap, $20 Android phone in their pocket.
And so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide, if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state, not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance, but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.
I have a question for you.
We saw recently in the press that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack.
So I wanted to ask you a personal question, which is: Do you do that?
And, on behalf of everyone here, particularly myself, Should we be doing that?
Should we be covering these things?
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker -- actually, I like Band-Aids, because you can remove them and put them back on whenever you want to make a call or a Skype call.
Putting a sticker over your web cam is probably the best thing you can do for your privacy in terms of bang for buck. There really is malware, malicious software out there that can take over your web cam, even without the light turning on.
This is used by criminals. This is used by stalkers.
You can buy $19.99 "spy on your ex-girlfriend" software online. It's really terrifying.
And then, of course, it's used by governments.
And there's obviously a sexual violence component to this, which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively against women and other people who can be shamed in our society.
Even if you think you have nothing to hide, at the very least, if you have children, teenagers in your lives, make sure you put a sticker on their camera and protect them.
HW: Wow. Thank you so much. CS: Thank you.
HW: Thanks, Chris.
For over a decade, I have studied young people that have been pushed out of school, so called "dropouts." As they end up failed by the education system, they're on the streets where they're vulnerable to violence, police harassment, police brutality and incarceration.
I follow these young people for years at a time, across institutional settings, to try to understand what some of us call the "school-to-prison pipeline."
When you look at a picture like this, of young people who are in my study ... you might see trouble.
I mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand, he's 14 years old and it's a school day.
Other people, when they see this picture, might see gangs, thugs, delinquents -- criminals.
But I see it different.
I see these young people through a perspective that looks at the assets that they bring to the education system.
So will you join me in changing the way we label young people from "at-risk" to "at-promise?"
(Applause)
How do I know that these young people have the potential and the promise to change?
I know this because I am one of them.
You see, I grew up in dire poverty in the inner city, without a father -- he abandoned me before I was even born.
We were on welfare, sometimes homeless, many times hungry.
By the time I was 15 years old, I had been incarcerated in juvy three times for three felonies.
My best friend had already been killed.
And soon after, while I'm standing next to my uncle, he gets shot.
And as I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive for over an hour ... he bleeds to death on the street.
I had lost faith and hope in the world, and I had given up on the system because the system had failed me.
I had nothing to offer and no one had anything to offer me. I was fatalistic. I didn't even think I could make it to my 18th birthday.
The reason I'm here today is because a teacher that cared reached out and managed to tap into my soul.
This teacher, Ms. Russ ... she was the kind of teacher that was always in your business.
(Laughter)
She was the kind of teacher that was like, "Victor, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."
(Laughter)
I wasn't ready. But she understood one basic principle about young people like me.
We're like oysters.
We're only going to open up when we're ready, and if you're not there when we're ready, we're going to clam back up.
Ms. Russ was there for me.
She was culturally relevant, she respected my community, my people, my family.
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.
He would take me to work with him because I was broke, and he knew I needed some money.
He collected glass bottles for a living.
Four in the morning on a school day, we'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van, and the bottles would break.
And my hands and arms would start to bleed and my tennis shoes and pants would get all bloody.
And I was terrified and in pain, and I would stop working.
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me, "Mijo, estamos buscando vida." "We're searching for a better life, we're trying to make something out of nothing."
Ms. Russ listened to my story, welcomed it into the classroom and said, "Victor, this is your power.
This is your potential.
Your family, your culture, your community have taught you a hard-work ethic and you will use it to empower yourself in the academic world so you can come back and empower your community."
With Ms. Russ's help, I ended up returning to school.
I even finished my credits on time and graduated with my class.
(Applause)
But Ms. Russ said to me right before graduation, "Victor, I'm so proud of you.
I knew you could do it.
Now it's time to go to college."
(Laughter)
College, me? Man, what is this teacher smoking thinking I'm going to college?
I applied with the mentors and support she provided, got a letter of acceptance, and one of the paragraphs read, "You've been admitted under probationary status." I said, "Probation?
I'm already on probation, that don't matter? "
(Laughter)
It was academic probation, not criminal probation.
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ do to succeed with young people like the ones I study?
I propose three strategies.
The first: let's get rid of our deficit perspective in education. "These people come from a culture of violence, a culture of poverty.
These people are at-risk; these people are truant.
These people are empty containers for us to fill with knowledge.
They have the problems, we have the solutions." Number two. Let's value the stories that young people bring to the schoolhouse.
Their stories of overcoming insurmountable odds are so powerful. And I know you know some of these stories.
These very same stories and experiences already have grit, character and resilience in them.
So let's help young people refine those stories.
Let's help them be proud of who they are, because our education system welcomes their families, their cultures, their communities and the skill set they've learned to survive.
And of course the third strategy being the most important: resources.
We have to provide adequate resources to young people.
Grit alone isn't going to cut it.
You can sit there and tell me all you want, "Hey man, pick yourself up by the bootstraps." But if I was born without any straps on my boots --
(Laughter)
How am I supposed to pick myself up?
(Applause)
Job training, mentoring, counseling... Teaching young people to learn from their mistakes instead of criminalizing them, and dragging them out of their classrooms like animals. How about this? I propose that we implement restorative justice in every high school in America.
(Applause)
So we went out to test these ideas in the community of Watts in LA with 40 young people that had been pushed out of school.
William was one of them.
William was the kind of kid that had been given every label.
He had dropped out, he was a gang member, a criminal.
And when we met him he was very resistant.
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say. "Hey, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."
(Laughter)
So over time -- over time he began to open up.
And I remember the day that he made the switch.
We were in a large group and a young lady in our program was crying because she told us her powerful story of her dad being killed and then his body being shown in the newspaper the next day.
And as she's crying, I don't know what to do, so I give her her space, and William had enough.
He slammed his hands on the desk and he said, "Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"
This young lady's tears and pain turned into joy and laughter knowing that her community had her back, and William had now learned that he did have a purpose in life: to help to heal the souls of people in his own community.
He told us his story.
We refined his story to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survivor that has overcome adversity.
We placed high value on it.
William went on to finish high school, get his security guard certificate to become a security guard, and is now working at a local school district.
(Applause)
Ms. Russ's mantra — her mantra was always, "when you teach to the heart, the mind will follow." The great writer Khalil Gibran says, "Out of suffering have emerged the greatest souls.
The massive characters are seared with scars." I believe that in this education revolution that we're talking about we need to invite the souls of the young people that we work with, and once they're able to refine -- identify their grit, resilience and character that they've already developed -- their academic performance will improve.
Let's believe in young people.
Let's provide them the right kinds of resources.
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.
She believed in me so much that she tricked me into believing in myself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to talk to you about my kids.
Now, I know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic, the most beautiful kid that ever lived.
But mine really are. (Laughter) I have 696 kids, and they are the most intelligent, inventive, innovative, brilliant and powerful kids that you'll ever meet.
Any student I've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid.
However, because their "real" parents aren't rich and, I argue, because they are mostly of color, they will seldom get to see in themselves the awesomeness that I see in them.
Because what I see in them is myself -- or what would have been myself.
I am the daughter of two hardworking, college-educated, African-American parents who chose careers as public servants: my father, a minister; my mother, an educator.
Wealth was never the primary ambition in our house.
Because of this lack of wealth, we lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth, and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth.
Luckily, however, we struck the educational jackpot in a voluntary desegregation program that buses inner-city kids -- black and brown -- out to suburban schools -- rich and white.
At five years old, I had to take an hour-long bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education.
At five years old, I thought everyone had a life just like mine.
I thought everyone went to school and were the only ones using the brown crayons to color in their family portraits, while everyone else was using the peach-colored ones.
At five years old, I thought everyone was just like me.
But as I got older, I started noticing things, like: How come my neighborhood friend don't have to wake up at five o'clock in the morning, and go to a school that's an hour away?
How come I'm learning to play the violin while my neighborhood friends don't even have a music class?
Why were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material that I had done two to three years prior?
See, as I got older, I started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly, like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to be doing; taking something that wasn't mine; receiving a gift, but with someone else's name on it.
All these amazing things that I was being exposed to and experiencing, I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.
I wasn't supposed to have a library, fully equipped athletic facilities, or safe fields to play in. I wasn't supposed to have theatre departments with seasonal plays and concerts -- digital, visual, performing arts.
I wasn't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs, school buses that brought me door-to-door, freshly prepared school lunches or even air conditioning.
These are things my kids don't get.
You see, as I got older, while I was grateful for this amazing opportunity that I was being given, there was this ever-present pang of: But what about everyone else?
There are thousands of other kids just like me, who deserve this, too.
Why doesn't everyone get this?
Why is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich?
It was like I had some sort of survivor's remorse.
All of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that I was saved from through a bus ride.
(Laughter) I was like an educational Moses screaming, "Let my people go ... to high-quality schools!" I'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated.
I'd seen the educational promised land, and I could not for the life of me justify the disparity.
I now teach in the very same school system from which I sought refuge.
I know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student, and now as a teacher, I don't have access to those same tools to give my students.
There have been countless nights when I've cried in frustration, anger and sorrow, because I can't teach my kids the way that I was taught, because I don't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me.
My kids deserve so much better.
We sit and we keep banging our heads against this term: "Achievement gap, achievement gap!" Is it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids don't? I mean, really. I think we've got it all wrong.
I think we, as Gloria Ladson-Billings says, should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is.
It's not an achievement gap; it's an education debt, for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested in the education of the black and brown child over time.
A little-known secret in American history is that the only American institution created specifically for people of color is the American slave trade — and some would argue the prison system, but that's another topic for another TED Talk. (Laughter) The public school system of this country was built, bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor.
While African-Americans were enslaved and prohibited from schooling, their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded.
Ever since then, every court case, educational policy, reform, has been an attempt to retrofit the design, rather than just stopping and acknowledging: we've had it all wrong from the beginning.
An oversimplification of American educational history.
All right, just bear with me. Blacks were kept out -- you know, the whole slavery thing.
With the help of philanthropic white people, they built their own schools.
Separate but equal was OK.
But while we all know things were indeed separate, they were in no ways equal.
Enter Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954; legal separation of the races is now illegal.
But very few people pay attention to all of the court cases since then, that have undone the educational promised land for every child that Brown v. Board intended.
Some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place.
Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine, the Civil Rights Movement, is a real awkward moment in my classroom, when I have to hear the voice of a child ask, "If schools were desegregated in 1954, how come there are no white kids here?" (Laughter) These kids aren't dumb.
They know exactly what's happening, and what's not.
They know that when it comes to schooling, black lives don't matter and they never have.
For years, I tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.
I'd amassed a modest classroom library of books I'd accumulated from secondhand shops, thrift stores, attics -- you know.
But whenever I said those dreadful words, "Take out a book and read," you'd think I'd just declared war. It was torture. One day, after I'd heard about this website called DonorsChoose, where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom and anonymous donors fulfill them, I figured I'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list of the teenager's dream library.
Over 200 brand-new books were sent to my room piece by piece.
(Laughter) To which I'd reply, "You deserve brand-new books." The whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls, as she peeled open a crisp paperback said, "Ms. Sumner -- you know, I figured you bought these books, 'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff.
But to know that a stranger, someone I don't even know, cares this much about me is pretty cool." Knowing that strangers will take care of you is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.
Ever since the donation, there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home, and then returning them with the exclamation, "This one was good!" (Laughter) Now when I say, "Take out a book and read," kids rush to my library.
It wasn't that they didn't want to read, but instead, they'd gladly read if the resources were there.
Institutionally speaking, our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child.
We keep focusing on the end results or test results, and getting frustrated.
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder, "How did it get so bad?
How did we get here? "Really?
If you neglect a child long enough, you no longer have the right to be surprised when things don't turn out well.
Stop being perplexed or confused or befuddled by the achievement gap, the income gap, the incarceration rates, or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new "it" term for the moment.
The problems we have as a country are the problems we created as a country.
The quality of your education is directly proportionate to your access to college, your access to jobs, your access to the future.
Until we live in a world where every kid can get a high-quality education no matter where they live, or the color of their skin, there are things we can do on a macro level.
School funding should not be decided by property taxes or some funky economic equation where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid, while poor kids are continuously having food and resources taken from their mouths.
Governors, senators, mayors, city council members -- if we're going to call public education public education, then it should be just that.
Otherwise, we should call it what it really is: poverty insurance. "Public education: keeping poor kids poor since 1954." (Laughter) If we really, as a country, believe that education is the "great equalizer," then it should be just that: equal and equitable.
Until then, there's no democracy in our democratic education.
On a mezzo level: historically speaking, the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others.
And unfortunately, today it still does.
If your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little Timmy down the street goes to an affluent school, challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom.
Close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter.
When resources are shared, they're not divided; they're multiplied.
And on a micro level: if you're a human being, donate.
Time, money, resources, opportunities -- whatever is in your heart.
There are websites like DonorsChoose that recognize the disparity and actually want to do something about it.
What is a carpenter with no tools?
What is an actress with no stage?
What is a scientist with no laboratory?
What is a doctor with no equipment?
I'll tell you: they're my kids.
Shouldn't they be your kids, too?
Thank you. (Applause)
June 2010. I landed for the first time in Rome, Italy.
I wasn't there to sightsee.
I was there to solve world hunger.
(Laughter)
That's right. I was a 25-year-old PhD student armed with a prototype tool developed back at my university, and I was going to help the World Food Programme fix hunger.
So I strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags, and I smiled as I thought to myself, "The engineer is here."
(Laughter)
Give me your data. I'm going to optimize everything.
(Laughter)
Tell me the food that you've purchased, tell me where it's going and when it needs to be there, and I'm going to tell you the shortest, fastest, cheapest, best set of routes to take for the food.
We're going to save money, we're going to avoid delays and disruptions, and bottom line, we're going to save lives. You're welcome.
(Laughter)
I thought it was going to take 12 months, OK, maybe even 13.
This is not quite how it panned out.
Just a couple of months into the project, my French boss, he told me, "You know, Mallory, it's a good idea, but the data you need for your algorithms is not there.
It's the right idea but at the wrong time, and the right idea at the wrong time is the wrong idea."
(Laughter)
Project over. I was crushed.
When I look back now on that first summer in Rome and I see how much has changed over the past six years, it is an absolute transformation.
It's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world. It's exciting. It's inspiring. But we're not there yet.
And brace yourself, executives, because I'm going to be putting companies on the hot seat to step up and play the role that I know they can.
My experiences back in Rome prove using data you can save lives.
OK, not that first attempt, but eventually we got there.
Let me paint the picture for you.
Imagine that you have to plan breakfast, lunch and dinner for 500,000 people, and you only have a certain budget to do it, say 6.5 million dollars per month. Well, what should you do? What's the best way to handle it?
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil? How much? It sounds simple. It's not. You have 30 possible foods, and you have to pick five of them.
That's already over 140,000 different combinations.
Then for each food that you pick, you need to decide how much you'll buy, where you're going to get it from, where you're going to store it, how long it's going to take to get there.
You need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well.
And that's already over 900 million options.
If you considered each option for a single second, that would take you over 28 years to get through. 900 million options.
So we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers to weed through all 900 million options in just a matter of days.
It turned out to be incredibly successful.
In an operation in Iraq, we saved 17 percent of the costs, and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional 80,000 people.
It's all thanks to the use of data and modeling complex systems.
But we didn't do it alone.
The unit that I worked with in Rome, they were unique.
They believed in collaboration.
They brought in the academic world. They brought in companies.
And if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger, we need everybody to the table.
We need the data people from humanitarian organizations leading the way, and orchestrating just the right types of engagements with academics, with governments.
And there's one group that's not being leveraged in the way that it should be. Did you guess it? Companies.
Companies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world.
I've been in the private sector for two years now.
I've seen what companies can do, and I've seen what companies aren't doing, and I think there's three main ways that we can fill that gap: by donating data, by donating decision scientists and by donating technology to gather new sources of data.
This is data philanthropy, and it's the future of corporate social responsibility.
Bonus, it also makes good business sense.
Companies today, they collect mountains of data, so the first thing they can do is start donating that data.
Some companies are already doing it.
Take, for example, a major telecom company.
They opened up their data in Senegal and the Ivory Coast and researchers discovered that if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers, you can see where people are traveling.
And that can tell you things like where malaria might spread, and you can make predictions with it.
Or take for example an innovative satellite company.
They opened up their data and donated it, and with that data you could track how droughts are impacting food production.
With that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen.
This is a great start.
There's important insights just locked away in company data.
And yes, you need to be very careful.
You need to respect privacy concerns, for example by anonymizing the data.
But even if the floodgates opened up, and even if all companies donated their data to academics, to NGOs, to humanitarian organizations, it wouldn't be enough to harness that full impact of data for humanitarian goals. Why? To unlock insights in data, you need decision scientists.
Decision scientists are people like me.
They take the data, they clean it up, transform it and put it into a useful algorithm that's the best choice to address the business need at hand.
In the world of humanitarian aid, there are very few decision scientists.
Most of them work for companies.
So that's the second thing that companies need to do.
In addition to donating their data, they need to donate their decision scientists.
Now, companies will say, "Ah!
Don't take our decision scientists from us.
We need every spare second of their time." But there's a way.
If a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist's time, it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period, say for example five years.
This might only amount to a couple of hours per month, which a company would hardly miss, but what it enables is really important: long-term partnerships.
Long-term partnerships allow you to build relationships, to get to know the data, to really understand it and to start to understand the needs and challenges that the humanitarian organization is facing.
In Rome, at the World Food Programme, this took us five years to do, five years.
That first three years, OK, that was just what we couldn't solve for.
Then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool, like in the operations in Iraq and other countries.
I don't think that's an unrealistic timeline when it comes to using data to make operational changes.
It's an investment. It requires patience. But the types of results that can be produced are undeniable.
In our case, it was the ability to feed tens of thousands more people.
So we have donating data, we have donating decision scientists, and there's actually a third way that companies can help: donating technology to capture new sources of data.
You see, there's a lot of things we just don't have data on.
Right now, Syrian refugees are flooding into Greece, and the UN refugee agency, they have their hands full.
The current system for tracking people is paper and pencil, and what that means is that when a mother and her five children walk into the camp, headquarters is essentially blind to this moment.
That's all going to change in the next few weeks, thanks to private sector collaboration.
There's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that I work for.
With this new system, there will be a data trail, so you know exactly the moment when that mother and her children walk into the camp.
And even more, you know if she's going to have supplies this month and the next.
Information visibility drives efficiency.
For companies, using technology to gather important data, it's like bread and butter.
They've been doing it for years, and it's led to major operational efficiency improvements.
Just try to imagine your favorite beverage company trying to plan their inventory and not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves. It's absurd. Data drives better decisions.
Now, if you're representing a company, and you're pragmatic and not just idealistic, you might be saying to yourself, "OK, this is all great, Mallory, but why should I want to be involved?" Well for one thing, beyond the good PR, humanitarian aid is a 24-billion-dollar sector, and there's over five billion people, maybe your next customers, that live in the developing world.
Further, companies that are engaging in data philanthropy, they're finding new insights locked away in their data.
Take, for example, a credit card company that's opened up a center that functions as a hub for academics, for NGOs and governments, all working together.
They're looking at information in credit card swipes and using that to find insights about how households in India live, work, earn and spend.
For the humanitarian world, this provides information about how you might bring people out of poverty.
But for companies, it's providing insights about your customers and potential customers in India.
It's a win all around.
Now, for me, what I find exciting about data philanthropy -- donating data, donating decision scientists and donating technology -- it's what it means for young professionals like me who are choosing to work at companies.
Studies show that the next generation of the workforce care about having their work make a bigger impact.
We want to make a difference, and so through data philanthropy, companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists.
And that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand.
Data philanthropy makes good business sense, and it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world.
If we coordinated the planning and logistics across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation, we could feed, clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people, and companies need to step up and play the role that I know they can in bringing about this revolution.
You've probably heard of the saying "food for thought." Well, this is literally thought for food.
It finally is the right idea at the right time.
(Laughter)
Très magnifique.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When you come to TEDx, you always think about technology, the world changing, becoming more innovative.
You think about the driverless.
Everyone's talking about driverless cars these days, and I love the concept of a driverless car, but when I go in one, you know, I want it really slow, I want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case.
I don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.
How about a driverless world?
And I ask you that because we are increasingly in one.
It's not supposed to be that way.
We're number one, the United States is large and in charge.
Americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing. Right? Whether it's the World Trade Organization or it's the IMF, the World Bank, the Bretton Woods Accord on currency, these were American institutions, our values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards.
That was the way the world worked.
So it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks, here it is.
This is our view of how the world is run.
President Obama has got the red carpet, he goes down Air Force One, and it feels pretty good, it feels pretty comfortable.
Well, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week and the G20. Oh my God. Right? This is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world's leaders in China.
The National Security Advisor was actually spewing expletives on the tarmac -- no red carpet, kind of left out the bottom of the plane along with all the media and everybody else.
Later on in the G20, well, there's Obama.
(Laughter)
Hi, George. Hi, Norman. They look like they're about to get into a cage match, right? And they did. It was 90 minutes long, and they talked about Syria.
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.
He's increasingly calling the shots.
He's the one willing to do stuff there.
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust, but it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do.
How about when the whole 20 are getting together?
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage, then the Americans are pulling their weight. Uh-oh.
(Laughter)
Xi Jinping seems fine. Angela Merkel has -- she always does -- that look, she always does that.
But Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do, and Obama is like, what's going on over there?
You see. And the problem is it's not a G20, the problem is it's a G-Zero world that we live in, a world order where there is no single country or alliance that can meet the challenges of global leadership.
The G20 doesn't work, the G7, all of our friends, that's history.
So globalization is continuing.
Goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before, but Americanization is not.
So if I've convinced you of that, I want to do two things with the rest of this talk.
I want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world.
I'll go around it.
And then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York.
So why? What are the implications. Why are we here?
Well, we're here because the United States, we spent two trillion dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were failed.
We don't want to do that anymore.
We have large numbers of middle and working classes that feel like they've not benefited from promises of globalization, so they don't want to see it particularly.
And we have an energy revolution where we don't need OPEC or the Middle East the way we used to.
We produce all that right here in the United States.
So the Americans don't want to be the global sheriff for security or the architect of global trade.
The Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values.
Well, then you look to Europe, and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship.
But it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II, all of the crises, the Brexit conversations, the hedging going on between the French and the Russians, or the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese.
China does want to do more leadership.
They do, but only in the economic sphere, and they want their own values, standards, currency, in competition with that of the US.
The Russians want to do more leadership.
You see that in Ukraine, in the Baltic states, in the Middle East, but not with the Americans.
They want their own preferences and order.
That's why we are where we are.
So what happens going forward?
Let's start easy, with the Middle East.
(Laughter)
You know, I left a little out, but you get the general idea.
Look, there are three reasons why the Middle East has had stability such as it is. Right? One is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the US and allies.
Number two, it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive.
And number three was no matter how bad the leaders were, the populations were relatively quiescent.
They didn't have the ability, and many didn't have the will to really rise up against.
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world, all three of those things are increasingly not true, and so failed states, terrorism, refugees and the rest.
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?
No, the Kurds will do better, and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
But generally speaking, it's not a good look.
OK, how about this guy? He's playing a poor hand very well.
There's no question he's hitting above his weight.
But long term -- I didn't mean that.
But long term, long term, if you think that the Russians were antagonized by the US and Europe expanding NATO right up to their borders when we said they weren't going to, and the EU encroaching them, just wait until the Chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars in every country around Russia they thought they had influence in.
The Chinese are going to dominate it. The Russians are picking up the crumbs.
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.
It's not all bad. Right? Asia actually looks a lot better.
There are real leaders across Asia, they have a lot of political stability.
They're there for a while.
Mr. Modi in India, Mr. Abe, who is probably about to get a third term written in in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, of course Xi Jinping who is consolidating enormous power, the most powerful leader in China since Mao.
Those are the three most important economies in Asia.
Now look, there are problems in Asia.
We see the sparring over the South China Sea.
We see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days, tested yet another nuclear weapon.
But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need to wave the flag, to go xenophobic, to actually allow escalation of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions.
They want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth.
And that's what they're actually doing.
Let's turn to Europe. Europe does look a little scared in this environment.
So much of what is happening in the Middle East is washing up quite literally onto European shores.
You see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism across all of the European states.
Let me tell you that over the long term, in a G-Zero world, European expansion will be seen to have gone too far.
Europe went right up to Russia, went right down to the Middle East, and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more Americanized, that would be less of a problem, but in a G-Zero world, those countries nearest Russia and nearest the Middle East actually have different economic capabilities, different social stability and different political preferences and systems than core Europe.
So Europe was able to truly expand under the G7, but under the G-Zero, Europe will get smaller.
Core Europe around Germany and France and others will still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated.
But the periphery, countries like Greece and Turkey and others, will not look that good at all.
Latin America, a lot of populism, made the economies not go so well.
They had been more opposed to the United States for decades.
Increasingly, they're coming back.
We see that in Argentina. We see it with the openness in Cuba.
We will see it in Venezuela when Maduro falls.
We will see it in Brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there.
The only place you see that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of Mexican president Peña Nieto.
There you could actually see a slip away from the United States over the coming years.
The US election matters a lot on that one, too.
(Laughter)
Africa, right? A lot of people have said it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.
In a G-Zero world, it is absolutely an amazing time for a few African countries, those governed well with a lot of urbanization, a lot of smart people, women really getting into the workforce, entrepreneurship taking off.
But for most of the countries in Africa, it's going to be a lot more dicey: extreme climate conditions, radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity, very poor governance, borders you can't defend, lots of forced migration.
Those countries can fall off the map.
So you're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across Africa.
Finally, back to the United States. What do I think about us?
Because there are a lot of upset people, not here at TEDx, I know, but in the United States, my God, after 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset. I understand that. But a lot of people are upset because they say, "Washington's broken, we don't trust the establishment, we hate the media." Heck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin.
Look, I do think we have to recognize, my fellow campers, that when you are being chased by the bear, in the global context, you need not outrun the bear, you need to only outrun your fellow campers.
(Laughter)
Now, I just told you about our fellow campers. Right? And from that perspective, we look OK.
A lot of people in that context say, "Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.
Let's send our kids to American universities." You know, our neighbors are awesome: Canada, Mexico and two big bodies of water.
You know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that?
Those are awesome neighbors.
Terrorism is a problem in the United States.
God knows we know it here in New York.
But it's a much bigger problem in Europe than the US.
It's a much bigger problem in the Middle East than it is in Europe.
These are factors of large magnitude.
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, and we're complaining bitterly about it. You know why? Because they can't swim here. Right? I mean, the Turks would love to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.
The Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right? That's not the situation.
That's the reality of the United States.
Now, that sounds pretty good.
Here's the challenge. In a G-Zero world, the way you lead is by example.
If we know we don't want to be the global cop anymore, if we know we're not going to be the architect of global trade, we're not going to be the cheerleader of global values, we're not going to do it the way we used to, the 21st century is changing, we need to lead by example -- be so compelling that all these other people are going to still say, it's not just they're faster campers. Even when the bear is not chasing us, this is a good place to be. We want to emulate them.
The election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example.
Hillary Clinton says it's going to be like the '90s.
We can still be that cheerleader on values. We can still be the architect of global trade. We can still be the global sheriff.
And Donald Trump wants to bring us back to the '30s.
He's saying, "Our way or the highway. You don't like it, lump it." Right? Neither are recognizing a fundamental truth of the G-Zero, which is that even though the US is not in decline, it is getting objectively harder for the Americans to impose their will, even have great influence, on the global order.
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?
What would we have to do to fix this after November, after the next president comes in?
Well, either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond. A depression would do that. Another global financial crisis could do this. God forbid, another 9 / 11 could do that.
Or, absent crisis, we need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges that are growing and growing in the United States, are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change, and that we have those voices.
Through our cell phones, individually, we have those voices to compel them to change.
There is, of course, a third choice, perhaps the most likely one, which is that we do neither of those things, and in four years time you invite me back, and I will give this speech yet again.
Thank you very, very much.
(Applause)
Half of the human workforce is expected to be replaced by software and robots in the next 20 years.
And many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits.
Machines are more efficient; humans are complicated and difficult to manage.
Well, I want our organizations to remain human.
In fact, I want them to become beautiful.
Because as machines take our jobs and do them more efficiently, soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work that must be done beautifully rather than efficiently.
To maintain our humanity in the this second Machine Age, we may have no other choice than to create beauty.
Beauty is an elusive concept.
For the writer Stendhal it was the promise of happiness.
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.
(Laughter)
So bear with me as I am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a beautiful organization.
First: do the unnecessary.
[Do the Unnecessary]
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya, the CEO and founder of the yogurt company Chobani, made headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his 2,000 employees.
Some called it a PR stunt, others -- a genuine act of giving back.
But there is something else that was remarkable about it. It came completely out of the blue.
There had been no market or stakeholder pressure, and employees were so surprised that they burst into tears when they heard the news.
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful because they catch us off guard.
They create something out of nothing because they're completely unnecessary.
I once worked at a company that was the result of a merger of a large IT outsourcing firm and a small design firm. We were merging 9,000 software engineers with 1,000 creative types.
And to unify these immensely different cultures, we were going to launch a third, new brand. And the new brand color was going to be orange.
And as we were going through the budget for the rollouts, we decided last minute to cut the purchase of 10,000 orange balloons, which we had meant to distribute to all staff worldwide.
They just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end.
I didn't know back then that our decision marked the beginning of the end -- that these two organizations would never become one.
And sure enough, the merger eventually failed.
Now, was it because there weren't any orange balloons?
No, of course not.
But the kill-the-orange-balloons mentality permeated everything else.
You might not always realize it, but when you cut the unnecessary, you cut everything.
Leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary.
So do not kill your orange balloons.
The second principle: create intimacy.
[Create Intimacy]
Studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers.
And what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions?
There are hundreds of these every day in our organizations that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one.
The marriage researcher John Gottman says that the secret of a healthy relationship is not the great gesture or the lofty promise, it's small moments of attachment. In other words, intimacy.
In our networked organizations, we tout the strength of weak ties but we underestimate the strength of strong ones.
We forget the words of the writer Richard Bach who once said, "Intimacy -- not connectedness -- intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."
So how do we design for organizational intimacy?
The humanitarian organization CARE wanted to launch a campaign on gender equality in villages in northern India.
But it realized quickly that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff.
So it invited all 36 team members and their partners to one of the Khajuraho Temples, known for their famous erotic sculptures.
And there they openly discussed their personal relationships -- their own experiences of gender equality with the coworkers and the partners.
It was eye-opening for the participants.
Not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve, it also broke down invisible barriers and created a lasting bond amongst themselves.
Not a single team member quit in the next four years.
So this is how you create intimacy.
No masks ... or lots of masks.
(Laughter)
When Danone, the food company, wanted to translate its new company manifesto into product initiatives, it gathered the management team and 100 employees from across different departments, seniority levels and regions for a three-day strategy retreat.
And it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting: wigs, crazy hats, feather boas, huge glasses and so on. And they left with concrete outcomes and full of enthusiasm.
And when I asked the woman who had designed this experience why it worked, she simply said, "Never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Because wigs erase hierarchy, and hierarchy kills intimacy -- both ways, for the CEO and the intern.
Wigs allow us to use the disguise of the false to show something true about ourselves.
And that's not easy in our everyday work lives, because the relationship with our organizations is often like that of a married couple that has grown apart, suffered betrayals and disappointments, and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again.
And for either of us the first step towards beauty involves a huge risk.
The risk to be ugly.
[Be Ugly]
So many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces that look like anything but work: vacation resorts, coffee shops, playgrounds or college campuses --
(Laughter)
Based on the promises of positive psychology, we speak of play and gamification, and one start-up even says that when someone gets fired, they have graduated.
(Laughter)
That kind of beautiful language only goes "skin deep, but ugly cuts clean to the bone," as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.
To be authentic is to be ugly.
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical, but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth.
Like this manufacturer that wanted to transform one of its struggling business units.
It identified, named and pinned on large boards all the issues -- and there were hundreds of them -- that had become obstacles to better performance.
They put them on boards, moved them all into one room, which they called "the ugly room." The ugly became visible for everyone to see -- it was celebrated.
And the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room -- a biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy.
The ugliest part of our body is our brain. Literally and neurologically. Our brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar ... modern art, atonal music, jazz, maybe -- VR goggles for that matter -- strange objects, sounds and people.
But we've all been ugly once.
We were a weird-looking baby, a new kid on the block, a foreigner.
And we will be ugly again when we don't belong.
The Center for Political Beauty, an activist collective in Berlin, recently staged an extreme artistic intervention.
With the permission of relatives, it exhumed the corpses of refugees who had drowned at Europe's borders, transported them all the way to Berlin, and then reburied them at the heart of the German capital.
The idea was to allow them to reach their desired destination, if only after their death.
Such acts of beautification may not be pretty, but they are much needed. Because things tend to get ugly when there's only one meaning, one truth, only answers and no questions.
Beautiful organizations keep asking questions. They remain incomplete, which is the fourth and the last of the principles.
[Remain Incomplete]
Recently I was in Paris, and a friend of mine took me to Nuit Debout, which stands for "up all night," the self-organized protest movement that had formed in response to the proposed labor laws in France.
Every night, hundreds gathered at the Place de la République. Every night they set up a small, temporary village to deliberate their own vision of the French Republic.
And at the core of this adhocracy was a general assembly where anybody could speak using a specially designed sign language.
Like Occupy Wall Street and other protest movements, Nuit Debout was born in the face of crisis.
It was messy -- full of controversies and contradictions.
But whether you agreed with the movement's goals or not, every gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.
And how fitting that Paris -- the city of ideals, the city of beauty -- was it's stage.
It reminds us that like great cities, the most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for -- even and especially when their outcome is uncertain.
They are movements; they are always imperfect, never fully organized, so they avoid ever becoming banal.
They have something but we don't know what it is.
They remain mysterious; we can't take our eyes off them.
We find them beautiful.
So to do the unnecessary, to create intimacy, to be ugly, to remain incomplete — these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations, these are inherently human characteristics.
And these are also the qualities of what we call home.
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted, the least we can do is to ensure that we still feel at home in our organizations, and that we use our organizations to create that feeling for others.
Beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles and design for them.
In the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we need a new radical humanism.
We must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education.
Because if we don't, we might end up feeling like aliens in organizations and societies that are full of smart machines that have no appreciation whatsoever for the unnecessary, the intimate, the incomplete and definitely not for the ugly.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. I want to talk about understanding, and the nature of understanding, and what the essence of understanding is, because understanding is something we aim for, everyone.
We want to understand things.
My claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
If you don't have that, you don't have understanding. So that is my claim. And I want to focus on mathematics.
Many of us think of mathematics as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, percent, geometry, algebra -- all that stuff.
But actually, I want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well.
And my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns.
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern, and this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles in a very particular way.
So my day-to-day definition of mathematics that I use every day is the following: First of all, it's about finding patterns.
And by "pattern," I mean a connection, a structure, some regularity, some rules that govern what we see.
Second of all, I think it is about representing these patterns with a language.
We make up language if we don't have it, and in mathematics, this is essential.
It's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens.
We're going to do that very soon.
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.
Mathematics enables us to do so many things. So let's have a look at these patterns. If you want to tie a tie knot, there are patterns.
Tie knots have names.
And you can also do the mathematics of tie knots.
This is a left-out, right-in, center-out and tie.
This is a left-in, right-out, left-in, center-out and tie.
This is a language we made up for the patterns of tie knots, and a half-Windsor is all that.
This is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at the university level, because there are patterns in shoelaces.
You can do it in so many different ways.
We can analyze it.
We can make up languages for it.
And representations are all over mathematics.
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.
He invented a language for patterns in nature.
When we throw something up in the air, it falls down. Why? We're not sure, but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern.
This is also a pattern.
This is also an invented language.
Can you guess for what?
It is actually a notation system for dancing, for tap dancing.
That enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff, to do new things, because he has represented it.
I want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is.
Here it says the word "mathematics." But actually, they're just dots, right?
So how in the world can these dots represent the word?
Well, they do. They represent the word "mathematics," and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to.
It sounds like this. (Beeps) Somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept.
How does this happen?
There's something amazing going on about representing stuff.
So I want to talk about that magic that happens when we actually represent something.
Here you see just lines with different widths.
They stand for numbers for a particular book.
And I can actually recommend this book, it's a very nice book. (Laughter) Just trust me.
OK, so let's just do an experiment, just to play around with some straight lines.
This is a straight line. Let's make another one. So every time we move, we move one down and one across, and we draw a new straight line, right?
We do this over and over and over, and we look for patterns.
So this pattern emerges, and it's a rather nice pattern.
It looks like a curve, right?
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.
Now I can change my perspective a little bit. I can rotate it.
Is it a part of a circle? It's actually not a part of a circle.
So I have to continue my investigation and look for the true pattern.
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art? Well, no. Perhaps I should extend the lines like this, and look for the pattern there.
Let's make more lines. We do this. And then let's zoom out and change our perspective again.
Then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola.
This is represented by a simple equation, and it's a beautiful pattern.
So this is the stuff that we do.
We find patterns, and we represent them.
And I think this is a nice day-to-day definition.
But today I want to go a little bit deeper, and think about what the nature of this is.
What makes it possible?
There's one thing that's a little bit deeper, and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
And I claim that when you change your perspective, and if you take another point of view, you learn something new about what you are watching or looking at or hearing.
And I think this is a really important thing that we do all the time.
So let's just look at this simple equation, x + x = 2 • x. This is a very nice pattern, and it's true, because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc. We've seen this over and over, and we represent it like this.
But think about it: this is an equation.
It says that something is equal to something else, and that's two different perspectives.
One perspective is, it's a sum.
It's something you plus together.
On the other hand, it's a multiplication, and those are two different perspectives.
And I would go as far as to say that every equation is like this, every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign is actually a metaphor.
It's an analogy between two things.
You're just viewing something and taking two different points of view, and you're expressing that in a language. Have a look at this equation. This is one of the most beautiful equations.
It simply says that, well, two things, they're both -1.
This thing on the left-hand side is -1, and the other one is.
And that, I think, is one of the essential parts of mathematics -- you take different points of view. So let's just play around. Let's take a number. We know four-thirds. We know what four-thirds is.
It's 1.333, but we have to have those three dots, otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.
But this is only in base 10.
You know, the number system, we use 10 digits.
If we change that around and only use two digits, that's called the binary system.
It's written like this.
So we're now talking about the number.
The number is four-thirds.
We can write it like this, and we can change the base, change the number of digits, and we can write it differently.
So these are all representations of the same number.
We can even write it simply, like 1.3 or 1.6.
It all depends on how many digits you have.
Or perhaps we just simplify and write it like this.
I like this one, because this says four divided by three.
And this number expresses a relation between two numbers.
You have four on the one hand and three on the other.
And you can visualize this in many ways. What I'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives.
We can take a grid. If it's four across and three up, this line equals five, always. It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.
Four and three and five.
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3, you've seen a lot of times.
This is your average computer screen.
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 is a television or a computer screen.
So these are all nice representations, but I want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number.
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.
Observe the upper-left one.
It goes a little bit faster, right?
You can see this.
It actually goes exactly four-thirds as fast.
That means that when it goes around four times, the other one goes around three times.
Now let's make two lines, and draw this dot where the lines meet.
(Laughter) We get this dot dancing around.
And this dot comes from that number. Right? Now we should trace it.
Let's trace it and see what happens.
This is what mathematics is all about.
It's about seeing what happens.
And this emerges from four-thirds.
I like to say that this is the image of four-thirds.
It's much nicer -- (Cheers) Thank you! (Applause) This is not new.
(Laughter) This has been known for a long time, but -- But this is four-thirds.
Let's do another experiment.
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep) This is a perfect A, 440Hz. Let's multiply it by two. We get this sound. (Beep)
When we play them together, it sounds like this.
This is an octave, right?
We can do this game. We can play a sound, play the same A. We can multiply it by three-halves. (Beep)
(Beep) They sound really nice together.
Let's multiply this sound by four-thirds. (Beep)
What happens? You get this sound. (Beep)
This is the perfect fourth.
If the first one is an A, this is a D. They sound like this together. (Beeps)
This is the sound of four-thirds.
What I'm doing now, I'm changing my perspective.
I'm just viewing a number from another perspective.
I can even do this with rhythms, right?
I can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time (Drumbeats) in a period of time, and I can play another sound four times in that same space. (Clanking sounds) Sounds kind of boring, but listen to them together.
(Laughter) (Drumbeats and clanking sounds)
(Drumbeats and cymbals) Can you hear this? So, this is the sound of four-thirds.
Again, this is as a rhythm. (Drumbeats and cowbell) And I can keep doing this and play games with this number.
Four-thirds is a really great number. I love four-thirds!
(Laughter) Truly -- it's an undervalued number.
So if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere, it's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder.
So four-thirds is in the sphere. It's the volume of the sphere.
OK, so why am I doing all this?
Well, I want to talk about what it means to understand something and what we mean by understanding something. That's my aim here.
How do you know that? Well, as a matter of fact, you've seen a bunch of R's, and you've generalized and abstracted all of these and found a pattern.
So you know that this is an R. So what I'm aiming for here is saying something about how understanding and changing your perspective are linked.
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer, and I can actually use this to teach something, because when I give someone else another story, a metaphor, an analogy, if I tell a story from a different point of view, I enable understanding.
I make understanding possible, because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear, and if I give you another perspective, that will become easier for you.
Let's do a simple example again.
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.
So this is also four-thirds, in a way. Let's just join them together. Now we're going to play a game; we're going to fold it up into a three-dimensional structure. I love this. This is a square pyramid.
And let's just take two of them and put them together.
So this is what is called an octahedron.
It's one of the five platonic solids.
Now we can quite literally change our perspective, because we can rotate it around all of the axes and view it from different perspectives.
And I can change the axis, and then I can view it from another point of view, but it's the same thing, but it looks a little different.
I can do it even one more time.
Every time I do this, something else appears, so I'm actually learning more about the object when I change my perspective.
I can use this as a tool for creating understanding.
I can take two of these and put them together like this and see what happens.
And it looks a little bit like the octahedron.
What happens? Have a look at it if I spin it around like this. Well, if you take two of these, join them together and spin it around, there's your octahedron again, a beautiful structure.
If you lay it out flat on the floor, this is the octahedron.
This is the graph structure of an octahedron.
And I can continue doing this.
You can draw three great circles around the octahedron, and you rotate around, so actually three great circles is related to the octahedron.
And if I take a bicycle pump and just pump it up, you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron.
Do you see what I'm doing here?
I am changing the perspective every time.
So let's now take a step back -- and that's actually a metaphor, stepping back -- and have a look at what we're doing.
I'm playing around with metaphors.
I'm playing around with perspectives and analogies.
I'm telling one story in different ways.
I'm telling stories.
I'm making a narrative; I'm making several narratives.
And I think all of these things make understanding possible.
I think this actually is the essence of understanding something.
I truly believe this.
So this thing about changing your perspective -- it's absolutely fundamental for humans.
Let's play around with the Earth.
Let's zoom into the ocean, have a look at the ocean.
We can do this with anything.
We can take the ocean and view it up close.
We can look at the waves. We can go to the beach. We can view the ocean from another perspective.
Every time we do this, we learn a little bit more about the ocean.
If we go to the shore, we can kind of smell it, right? We can hear the sound of the waves. We can feel salt on our tongues.
So all of these are different perspectives.
And this is the best one.
We can go into the water. We can see the water from the inside.
And you know what?
This is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science.
If you're able to view a structure from the inside, then you really learn something about it.
That's somehow the essence of something.
So when we do this, and we've taken this journey into the ocean, we use our imagination.
And I think this is one level deeper, and it's actually a requirement for changing your perspective.
We can do a little game.
You can imagine that you're sitting there.
You can imagine that you're up here, and that you're sitting here.
You can view yourselves from the outside.
That's really a strange thing.
You're changing your perspective.
You're using your imagination, and you're viewing yourself from the outside. That requires imagination.
Mathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever.
And this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar to you, because we do it every day.
And then it's called empathy.
When I view the world from your perspective, I have empathy with you.
That requires imagination. If I really, truly understand what the world looks like from your perspective, I am empathetic. And that is how we obtain understanding.
And this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science, and there's a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences.
So my conclusion is the following: understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
So my advice to you is: try to change your perspective.
You can study mathematics.
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.
Changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible. It makes you open to new things, and it makes you able to understand things.
Thank you! And to use yet another metaphor: have a mind like water. That's nice.
I feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that's generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in Iceland went on a strike.
They did no work that day, whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home.
They marched into the center of Reykjavík -- 90 percent of women participated -- and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality.
Nothing worked in Iceland that day, because nothing works when women are not at work.
(Applause)
Five years later, Icelanders had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman as their president.
I will never forget this day, that President Vigdís, as we know her by her first name, stepped out on the balcony of her own home, a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won.
(Applause)
This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time, including boys.
She frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked, "Can boys really grow up to be president?"
(Laughter)
Role models really matter, but even with such strong role models who I am so grateful for, when I was encouraged to run for president, my first reaction was, "Who am I to run for president?
Who am I to be president?"
It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men.
So a study done in the US in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office, but 45 percent of women.
That's gap of 16 percentage points, and it's the same gap that existed a decade earlier.
And it really is a shame, because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more principle-based leadership in general.
So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit, even if I had no political experience, to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids, and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be.
And it was the journey of my life. It was amazing. The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates.
It boiled down to nine candidates qualifying, and ultimately the race came down to four of us, three men and me.
(Applause)
But that's not all the drama yet.
You may think you have drama in the US, but I can --
(Laughter)
I can assure you we had our own drama in Iceland.
So our sitting president of 20 years announced initially that he was not going to run, which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running.
Then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous Panama Papers that implicated him and his family.
And there was a popular protest in Iceland, so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader.
A few days later, relations to his wife and her family's companies were also discovered in the Panama Papers, and so he withdrew from the race again.
Before doing so, he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office.
So on May 9, 45 days before election day, it was not looking too good for me.
I did not even make the graph in the newspaper.
The polls had me at 1 percent, but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned.
So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television, because the network decided that they would only include those with 2.5 percent or more in the polls in the first TV debate.
I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men, and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate.
(Applause)
So, challenges. The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media, muscle and money.
Let's start with media.
There are those who say gender doesn't matter when it comes to media and politics.
I can't say that I agree.
It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media.
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media 87 times in the months leading up to the elections, whereas I appeared 31 times.
And I am not saying media is doing this consciously.
I think largely this has to do with unconscious bias, because in media, much like everywhere else, we have both conscious and unconscious bias, and we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it.
When I finally got access to TV, the first question I got was, "Are you going to quit?" And that was a hard one.
But of course, with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls, maybe it's understandable.
But media really matters, and every time I appeared on TV, we saw and experienced a rise in the polls, so I know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it.
I was the only one out of the final four candidates that never got a front page interview.
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage about the elections.
So I did face this, but I will say this to compliment the Icelandic media. I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit.
(Applause)
So kudos to them. But there is another experience that's very important.
I ran as an independent candidate, not with any political party or muscle behind me.
That lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign, but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently.
We ran a positive campaign, and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that.
It may be the reason why I had less airtime on TV, because I wanted to show other contenders respect.
When access to media proved to be so difficult, we ran our own media.
I ran live Facebook sessions where I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot.
And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establish trust.
And when reaching young voters proved to be challenging, I became a Snapchatter.
I got young people to teach me how to do that, and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign.
And I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility, as I was very bad at it.
But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that.
So it's possible to run a different type of campaign.
But unfortunately, one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money.
I am sad that it is that way, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than the other candidates.
This probably was partly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support.
And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less.
Some would call that very womanly of me. But even with one third the media, one third the financial resources, and only an entrepreneurial team, but an amazing team, we managed to surprise everyone on election night, when the first numbers came in.
I surprised myself, as you may see in that photo.
(Laughter)
So the first numbers, I came in neck to neck to the leading candidate.
(Cheers)
Well, too early, because I didn't quite pull that, but I came in second, and we went a long way from the one percent, with nearly a third of the vote, and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin, or 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at.
Some people call me the real winner of the election because of this, and there are many people who encouraged me to run again.
But what really makes me proud is to know that I earned proportionately higher percentage support from the young people, and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040.
She is 13, and she had never been on TV before.
And on election day, I observed her on TV repeatedly, and she was smart, she was self-confident, she was sincere, and she was supportive of her mother.
This was probably the highlight of my campaign.
(Applause)
But there was another one.
These are preschool girls out on a walk, and they found a poster of me on a bus stop, and they saw the need to kiss it.
Audience: Aw!
This picture was really enough of a win for me.
What we see, we can be.
So screw fear and challenges.
(Applause)
It matters that women run, and it's time for women to run for office, be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president.
I also managed to put an impression on your very own "New Yorker." I earned a new title, "A living emoji of sincerity."
(Cheers)
It is possibly my proudest title yet, and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what I call their emotional capital, but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that.
(Applause)
And we need more of that.
We celebrated as if we had won on election night, because that's how we felt.
So you don't necessarily have to reach that office.
You just have to go for it, and you, your family, your friends, everyone working with you, if you do it well, you will grow beyond anything you will experience before.
So we had a good time, and I learned a lot on this journey, probably more lessons than I can share here in the time we have today.
But rest assured, it was hard work.
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.
It took resilience and perseverance to not quit, but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day, and that is that you can only be good when you are truly, authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that.
As a good sister of mine sometimes says, you may cheat on your intuition, but your intuition never cheats on you.
I think it's also very important, and you all know this, that on any journey you go on, it's the team you take along.
It's having people around you who share your values, your vision, but are different in every other way.
That's the formula for success for me, and I am blessed with an amazing husband, here today, an incredible family --
(Applause)
and great friends, and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena, and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible.
As a matter of fact, the leading PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent.
I appreciated his perspective, because he was probably right, and he was basing it on valuable experience.
But on the one percent day, I decided here to show him that he was wrong.
It's very important to mention this, because I did lose a lot of sleep, and I worked hard, and so did the people with me. We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves.
And it's two things that I think are very important in that, in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you, but it's equally important, maybe even more important, to have the courage to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy, including the wonderful bloggers and commentators.
I took a lot of support from others in doing this, and I made the decision to go high when others went low, and that's partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this.
And when I lost my energy for a moment -- and I did from time to time, it wasn't easy -- I went back to why I decided to run, and how I had decided to run my own race.
I called it a 4G campaign, the G's representing the Icelandic words.
And the first one is called "Gagn." I ran to do good, to be of service, and I wanted servant leadership to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign.
Second one is "Gleði," or joy.
I decided to enjoy the journey.
There was a lot to be taken out of the journey, no matter if the destination was reached or not.
And I tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well.
Third is "Gagnsæi." I was open to any questions.
I kept no secrets, and it was all open, on Facebook and websites.
Because I think if you're choosing your president, you deserve answers to your questions.
Last but not least, I don't need to explain that in this room, we ran on the principle of Girlpower.
(Cheers)
I am incredibly glad that I had the courage to run, to risk failure but receive success on so many levels.
I can't tell you that it was easy, but I can tell you, and I think my entire team will agree with me, that it was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.
PM: I can't let you go without saying that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to Iceland and vote for you.
But of course we probably can't vote there, but one thing we can get from Iceland and have always gotten is inspiration.
I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975 when all the Icelandic women walked out, and that really was a very big factor in launching the women's movement.
You made a reference to it earlier.
I'd love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill.
And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it, the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday. Right?
HT: Yes, they did.
PM: Can you tell us about that?
HT: Yes, so 41 years after the original strike, we may be the best place in the world to be a woman, but our work isn't done.
So at 2: 38pm on Monday, women in Iceland left work, because that's when they had earned their day's salary.
(Applause)
What's really cool about this is that young women and men participated in greater numbers than before, because it is time that we close the pay gap.
PM: So I'm not going to ask Halla to commit right now to what she's doing next, but I will say that you'd have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again. Thank you Halla.
HT: Thank you all.
Last year, three of my family members were gruesomely murdered in a hate crime.
It goes without saying that it's really difficult for me to be here today, but my brother Deah, his wife Yusor, and her sister Razan don't give me much of a choice.
I'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice, and join me in standing up against hate.
It's December 27, 2014: the morning of my brother's wedding day.
He asks me to come over and comb his hair in preparation for his wedding photo shoot.
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball, particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --
(Laughter)
An American kid in dental school ready to take on the world.
When Deah and Yusor have their first dance, I see the love in his eyes, her reciprocated joy, and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.
I move to the back of the hall and burst into tears.
And the second the song finishes playing, he beelines towards me, buries me into his arms and rocks me back and forth.
Even in that moment, when everything was so distracting, he was attuned to me.
He cups my face and says, "Suzanne, I am who I am because of you. Thank you for everything.
I love you."
About a month later, I'm back home in North Carolina for a short visit, and on the last evening, I run upstairs to Deah's room, eager to find out how he's feeling being a newly married man.
With a big boyish smile he says, "I'm so happy. I love her. She's an amazing girl." And she is.
At just 21, she'd recently been accepted to join Deah at UNC dental school.
She shared his love for basketball, and at her urging, they started their honeymoon off attending their favorite team of the NBA, the LA Lakers. I mean, check out that form.
(Laughter)
I'll never forget that moment sitting there with him -- how free he was in his happiness.
My littler brother, a basketball-obsessed kid, had become and transformed into an accomplished young man.
He was at the top of his dental school class, and alongside Yusor and Razan, was involved in local and international community service projects dedicated to the homeless and refugees, including a dental relief trip they were planning for Syrian refugees in Turkey.
Razan, at just 19, used her creativity as an architectural engineering student to serve those around her, making care packages for the local homeless, among other projects.
That is who they were.
Standing there that night, I take a deep breath and look at Deah and tell him, "I have never been more proud of you than I am in this moment." He pulls me into his tall frame, hugs me goodnight, and I leave the next morning without waking him to go back to San Francisco.
That is the last time I ever hug him.
Ten days later, I'm on call at San Francisco General Hospital when I receive a barrage of vague text messages expressing condolences.
Confused, I call my father, who calmly intones, "There's been a shooting in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.
It's on lock-down.
That's all we know. "I hang up and quickly Google," shooting in Chapel Hill. "One hit comes up. Quote:" Three people were shot in the back of the head and confirmed dead on the scene. "Something in me just knows.
I fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor, wailing.
I take the first red-eye out of San Francisco, numb and disoriented.
I walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents' arms, sobbing.
I then run up to Deah's room as I did so many times before, just looking for him, only to find a void that will never be filled.
Investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events.
Deah had just gotten off the bus from class, Razan was visiting for dinner, already at home with Yusor.
As they began to eat, they heard a knock on the door.
When Deah opened it, their neighbor proceeded to fire multiple shots at him.
According to 911 calls, the girls were heard screaming.
The man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip, immobilizing her.
He then approached her from behind, pressed the barrel of his gun against her head, and with a single bullet, lacerated her midbrain.
He then turned towards Razan, who was screaming for her life, and, execution-style, with a single bullet to the back of the head, killed her.
On his way out, he shot Deah one last time -- a bullet in the mouth -- for a total of eight bullets: two lodged in the head, two in his chest and the rest in his extremities.
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed in a place that was meant to be safe: their home.
For months, this man had been harassing them: knocking on their door, brandishing his gun on a couple of occasions.
His Facebook was cluttered with anti-religion posts.
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.
As she was moving in, he told Yusor and her mom that he didn't like the way they looked.
In response, Yusor's mom told her to be kind to her neighbor, that as he got to know them, he'd see them for who they were.
I guess we've all become so numb to the hatred that we couldn't have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence.
The man who murdered my brother turned himself in to the police shortly after the murders, saying he killed three kids, execution-style, over a parking dispute.
The police issued a premature public statement that morning, echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further investigate.
It turns out there was no parking dispute.
There was no argument. No violation. But the damage was already done.
In a 24-hour media cycle, the words "parking dispute" had already become the go-to sound bite.
I am who I am because of you. I sit on my brother's bed and remember his words, the words he gave me so freely and with so much love, That's what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief and speak out.
I cannot let my family's deaths be diminished to a segment that is barely discussed on local news.
They were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith, because of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads, because they were visibly Muslim.
Some of the rage I felt at the time was that if roles were reversed, and an Arab, Muslim or Muslim-appearing person had killed three white American college students execution-style, in their home, what would we have called it? A terrorist attack. When white men commit acts of violence in the US, they're lone wolves, mentally ill or driven by a parking dispute.
I know that I have to give my family voice, and I do the only thing I know how: I send a Facebook message to everyone I know in media.
A couple of hours later, in the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family, our neighbor Neal comes over, sits down next to my parents and asks, "What can I do?" Neal had over two decades of experience in journalism, but he makes it clear that he's not there in his capacity as journalist, but as a neighbor who wants to help.
I ask him what he thinks we should do, given the bombardment of local media interview requests.
He offers to set up a press conference at a local community center.
Even now I don't have the words to thank him. "Just tell me when, and I'll have all the news channels present," he said.
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of devastation.
I delivered the press statement, still wearing scrubs from the previous night.
And in under 24 hours from the murders, I'm on CNN being interviewed by Anderson Cooper.
The following day, major newspapers -- including the New York Times, Chicago Tribune -- published stories about Deah, Yusor and Razan, allowing us to reclaim the narrative and call attention the mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hatred.
These days, it feels like Islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.
We just have to put up with it and smile.
The nasty stares, the palpable fear when boarding a plane, the random pat downs at airports that happen 99 percent of the time.
It doesn't stop there.
We have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs.
Here in the US, we have presidential candidates like Donald Trump, casually calling to register American Muslims, and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees from entering this country.
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise in parallel with election cycles.
Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara, a Lebanese-American Christian, was murdered in Oklahoma by his neighbor -- a man who called him a "filthy Arab." This man was previously jailed for a mere 8 months, after attempting run over Khalid's mother with his car.
Chances are you haven't heard Khalid's story, because it didn't make it to national news.
The least we can do is call it what it is: a hate crime.
The least we can do is talk about it, because violence and hatred doesn't just happen in a vacuum.
Not long after coming back to work, I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital, when one of my patients looks over at my colleague, gestures around her face and says, "San Bernardino," referencing a recent terrorist attack.
Here I am having just lost three family members to Islamophobia, having been a vocal advocate within my program on how to deal with such microaggressions, and yet -- silence. I was disheartened. Humiliated.
silence. Days later rounding on the same patient, she looks at me and says, "Your people are killing people in Los Angeles." I look around expectantly. Again: I realize that yet again, I have to speak up for myself.
I sit on her bed and gently ask her, "Have I ever done anything but treat you with respect and kindness?
Have I done anything but give you compassionate care?" She looks down and realizes what she said was wrong, and in front of the entire team, she apologizes and says, "I should know better. I'm Mexican-American. I receive this kind of treatment all the time."
Many of us experience microaggressions on a daily basis.
Odds are you may have experienced it, whether for your race, gender, sexuality or religious beliefs.
We've all been in situations where we've witnessed something wrong and didn't speak up.
Maybe we weren't equipped with the tools to respond in the moment.
Maybe we weren't even aware of our own implicit biases.
We can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable, but when we see it, we're silent, because it makes us uncomfortable.
But stepping right into that discomfort means you are also stepping into the ally zone.
There may be over three million Muslims in America.
That's still just one percent of the total population.
Martin Luther King once said, "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."
So what made my neighbor Neal's allyship so profound? A couple of things. He was there as a neighbor who cared, but he was also bringing in his professional expertise and resources when the moment called for it.
Others have done the same.
Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform as the first tenured African-American professor at Wheaton College to wear a hijab in solidarity with Muslim women who face discrimination every day.
As a result, she lost her job.
Within a month, she joined the faculty at the University of Virginia, where she now works on pluralism, race, faith and culture.
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian, demonstrated that not all active allyship needs to be so serious.
He stepped up to support a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission to introduce a hijab emoji.
(Laughter)
It's a simple gesture, but it has a significant subconscious impact on normalizing and humanizing Muslims, including the community as a part of an "us" instead of an "other." The editor in chief of Women's Running magazine just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a US fitness magazine.
These are all very different examples of people who drew upon their platforms and resources in academia, tech and media, to actively express their allyship.
What resources and expertise do you bring to the table?
Are you willing to step into your discomfort and speak up when you witness hateful bigotry? Will you be Neal?
Many neighbors appeared in this story.
And you, in your respective communities, all have a Muslim neighbor, colleague or friend your child plays with at school. Reach out to them. Let them know you stand with them in solidarity.
It may feel really small, but I promise you it makes a difference.
Nothing will ever bring back Deah, Yusor and Razan.
But when we raise our collective voices, that is when we stop the hate.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I design engineering projects for middle school and high school students, often using materials that are pretty unexpected.
My inspiration comes from problems in my daily life.
For example, one time I needed a costume to go to a comic convention, but I didn't want to spend too much money, so I made my own ... with a light-up crown and skirt.
(Laughter)
Another time, I was devastated because my favorite mobile game, Flappy Bird, was being taken off the app store.
(Laughter)
So I was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play Flappy Bird again.
(Laughter)
Unhappy with both options, I did the only thing that made sense to me.
I made a physical version of Flappy Bird that could never be taken off the app store.
(Laughter)
So a few of my friends were also pretty addicted to the game, and I invited them to play as well.
(Video) Friend: What the heck?
And they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game.
(Laughter)
So I uploaded a demo of this project online, and to my surprise it went viral.
It had over two million views in just a few days.
(Laughter)
And what's more interesting are people's comments.
A lot of people wanted to make it their own, or asked me how it was made.
So this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project, we can teach people about engineering.
With the money made from the viral video, we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own game in a box.
Although it was pretty challenging, they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming.
And they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well.
(Laughter)
So before Flappy Bird Box, I had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach students.
When I was teaching at a middle school, we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit.
And I noticed that a lot of them seemed bored.
Then a few of them started taking pieces of paper and decorating their robots.
And then more of them got into it, and they became more interested in the project.
So I started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students.
What I found was that most technology kits available in school look a little intimidating.
They're all made of plastic parts that you can't customize.
On top of that, they're all very expensive, costing hundreds of dollars per kit.
So that's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets.
Since I didn't find anything, I decided to make something on my own.
I started with paper and fabric.
After all, we all played with those since we were kids, and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house.
And I prototyped a project where students can create a light-up creature using fabric and googly eyes.
They were all helping each other in classrooms, and were laughing and discussing the project.
And most importantly, they were able to insert their own creativity into the project.
So because of the success of this project, I continued to create more engineering projects to challenge my students.
And I also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community.
And something really interesting happened.
I noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops.
And specifically, there were a lot more women and minorities than I expected, and that you wouldn't usually see at a traditional engineering workshop.
Now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in 2016.
Women make up only 19 percent of the technology workforce.
And underrepresented minorities make up only four percent.
This statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club, or a college engineering class.
Now, there's a wide variety of problems that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force.
Perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects.
I'm not saying that this could solve everything, but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn't be interested in it because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school.
So how do we start to change the perception of technology?
Most students think that it's boring or unwelcoming, so I have always designed projects following three principles.
First is having a low floor, and that means this project is easy to get started. So take a look at this tutorial. The first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper.
As you can see, it doesn't take very long to learn, and it's pretty easy even for beginners.
And having a low floor also means that we're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project.
So with paper, copper tape, lightbulb and a battery, people can complete this project for under a dollar.
So second principle is having a high ceiling.
This means that there's a lot of room to grow, and students are constantly being challenged.
At first it might just be a light-up creature, but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers, and start to program the creature to interact with its environment.
(Laughter)
And finally, the third principle is customization.
This means that we can make this project relevant to anyone.
That's the beauty of using everyday materials; it's very easy to customize using paper and fabric.
So even if you don't like Flappy Bird, you can still make your own game.
(Video) Student: So our game is about Justin Bieber, because he's been speeding, and the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the LAPD --
(Laughter)
(Video) Student: Yeah, but he's changing so -- we're a part of his posse.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Carlos, the Vietnam vet Marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one.
In 1971, he was medically retired because he had so much shrapnel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors.
For the next 42 years, he suffered from nightmares, extreme anxiety in public, isolation, depression.
He self-medicated with alcohol.
He was married and divorced three times.
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.
Now, I became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering, and for the past 10 years, my target has been the suffering caused by PTSD, as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
Until recently, the science of PTSD just wasn't there.
And so, we didn't know what to do.
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
Others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy, and others still we simply said to them, "Just go home and try to forget about your experiences." More recently, we've tried therapy dogs, wilderness retreats -- many things which may temporarily relieve stress, but which don't actually eliminate PTSD symptoms over the long term.
But things have changed. And I am here to tell you that we can now eliminate PTSD, not just manage the symptoms, and in huge numbers of veterans.
Because new scientific research has been able to show, objectively, repeatedly, which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not.
Now as it turns out, the best treatments for PTSD use many of the very same training principles that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war.
Now, making war -- this is something that we are good at.
We humans have been making war since before we were even fully human.
And since then, we have gone from using stone and sinew to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
And to enable our warriors to use these weapons, we employ the most cutting-edge training methods.
We are good at making war.
And we are good at training our warriors to fight.
Yet, when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat veteran, we begin to see that we have not been as good at preparing them to come home. Why is that? Well, our ancestors lived immersed in conflict, and they fought right where they lived.
So until only very recently in our evolutionary history, there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war, because we never really did.
But thankfully, today, most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies, and when there is conflict, we, especially in the United States, now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training, drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe and when they're done, jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like.
I've spoken with veterans who've told me that one day they're in a brutal firefight in Afghanistan where they saw carnage and death, and just three days later, they found themselves toting an ice chest to their kid's soccer game. "Mindfuck" is the most common term.
(Laughter)
It's the most common term I've heard to describe that experience.
And that's exactly what that is.
Because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war, we've only recently come to understand that many require training on how to return to civilian life.
Now, like any training, the best PTSD treatments require repetition.
In the military, we don't simply hand trainees Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers and say, "Here's the trigger, here's some ammo and good luck." No. We train them, on the range and in specific contexts, over and over and over until lifting their weapon and engaging their target is so engrained into muscle memory that it can be performed without even thinking, even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine.
Now, the same holds for training-based treatments.
The first of these treatments is cognitive therapy, and this is a kind of mental recalibration.
When veterans come home from war, their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated to an immensely more dangerous environment.
So when you try to overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment, you get problems.
You begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren't present.
You begin not trusting family or friends.
Which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life; there are. It's just that the probability of encountering them compared to combat is astronomically lower.
So we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely.
We do train them, however, to adjust caution according to where they are.
If you find yourself in a bad neighborhood, you turn it up.
Out to dinner with family?
You turn it way down.
We train veterans to be fiercely rational, to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering, say, an IED here in peacetime America.
With enough practice, those recalibrations stick.
The next of these treatments is exposure therapy, and this is a kind of field training, and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there.
You remember Carlos? This was the treatment that he chose.
And so we started off by giving him exercises, for him, challenging ones: going to a grocery store, going to a shopping mall, going to a restaurant, sitting with his back to the door.
And, critically -- staying in these environments.
Now, at first he was very anxious.
He wanted to sit where he could scan the room, where he could plan escape routes, where he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon.
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
He remembered his training in the Marine Corps, and he pushed through his discomfort.
And every time he did this, his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit, and then a little bit more and then a little bit more, until in the end, he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space and just enjoy himself.
over and over and over He also listened to recordings of his combat experiences,
He listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety.
He processed his memories so much that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences in his sleep.
And when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished, he told me, "Doc, this is the first time in 43 years that I haven't had nightmares."
Now, this is different than erasing a memory.
Veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences, but with enough practice, those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were.
They don't feel emotionally like they just happened yesterday, and that is an immensely better place to be.
But it's often difficult.
And, like any training, it may not work for everybody.
And there are trust issues.
Sometimes I'm asked, "If you haven't been there, Doc, how can you help me?" Which is understandable.
But at the point of returning to civilian life, you do not require somebody who's been there.
You don't require training for operations on the battlefield; you require training on how to come home.
For the past 10 years of my work, I have been exposed to detailed accounts of the worst experiences that you can imagine, daily.
And it hasn't always been easy.
There have been times where I have just felt my heart break or that I've absorbed too much.
But these training-based treatments work so well, that whatever this work takes out of me, it puts back even more, because I see people get better.
I see people's lives transform.
Carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren, which is something he couldn't even do with his own children.
And what's amazing to me is that after 43 years of suffering, it only took him 10 weeks of intense training to get his life back.
And when I spoke with him, he told me, "I know that I can't get those years back.
But at least now, whatever days that I have left on this Earth, I can live them in peace." He also said, "I hope that these younger veterans don't wait to get the help they need." And that's my hope, too.
Because... this life is short, and if you are fortunate enough to have survived war or any kind of traumatic experience, you owe it to yourself to live your life well.
And you shouldn't wait to get the training you need to make that happen.
Now, the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war.
But we are just not there yet as a species.
Until we are, the mental suffering that we create in our sons and in our daughters when we send them off to fight can be alleviated.
But we must ensure that the science, the energy level, the value that we place on sending them off to war is at the very least mirrored in how well we prepare them to come back home to us.
This much, we owe them.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.
CA: It feels like the world is in a place that we haven't seen for a long time.
People don't just disagree in the way that we're familiar with, on the left-right political divide.
There are much deeper differences afoot.
What on earth is going on, and how did we get here?
JH: This is different.
There's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling.
Survey research by Pew Research shows that the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just -- we don't just dislike them; we strongly dislike them, and we think that they are a threat to the nation.
Those numbers have been going up and up, and those are over 50 percent now on both sides.
People are scared, because it feels like this is different than before; it's much more intense.
Whenever I look at any sort of social puzzle, I always apply the three basic principles of moral psychology, and I think they'll help us here.
So the first thing that you have to always keep in mind when you're thinking about politics is that we're tribal.
We evolved for tribalism.
One of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature is the Bedouin proverb: "Me against my brother; me and my brother against our cousin; me and my brother and cousins against the stranger." And that tribalism allowed us to create large societies and to come together in order to compete with others.
That brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups, but it means that we have eternal conflict.
The question you have to look at is: What aspects of our society are making that more bitter, and what are calming them down?
CA: That's a very dark proverb.
You're saying that that's actually baked into most people's mental wiring at some level?
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just a basic aspect of human social cognition.
But we can also live together really peacefully, and we've invented all kinds of fun ways of, like, playing war.
I mean, sports, politics -- these are all ways that we get to exercise this tribal nature without actually hurting anyone.
We're also really good at trade and exploration and meeting new people.
So you have to see our tribalism as something that goes up or down -- it's not like we're doomed to always be fighting each other, but we'll never have world peace.
CA: The size of that tribe can shrink or expand.
JH: Right.
CA: The size of what we consider "us" and what we consider "other" or "them" can change.
And some people believed that process could continue indefinitely.
JH: That's right.
CA: And we were indeed expanding the sense of tribe for a while.
JH: So this is, I think, where we're getting at what's possibly the new left-right distinction.
I mean, the left-right as we've all inherited it, comes out of the labor versus capital distinction, and the working class, and Marx.
But I think what we're seeing now, increasingly, is a divide in all the Western democracies between the people who want to stop at nation, the people who are more parochial -- and I don't mean that in a bad way -- people who have much more of a sense of being rooted, they care about their town, their community and their nation.
And then those who are anti-parochial and who -- whenever I get confused, I just think of the John Lennon song "Imagine." "Imagine there's no countries, nothing to kill or die for." And so these are the people who want more global governance, they don't like nation states, they don't like borders.
You see this all over Europe as well.
There's a great metaphor guy -- actually, his name is Shakespeare -- writing ten years ago in Britain. He had a metaphor: "Are we drawbridge-uppers or drawbridge-downers?" And Britain is divided 52-48 on that point.
And America is divided on that point, too.
CA: And so, those of us who grew up with The Beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world -- it felt so idealistic and "how could anyone think badly about that?" And what you're saying is that, actually, millions of people today feel that that isn't just silly; it's actually dangerous and wrong, and they're scared of it.
JH: I think the big issue, especially in Europe but also here, is the issue of immigration.
And I think this is where we have to look very carefully at the social science about diversity and immigration.
Once something becomes politicized, once it becomes something that the left loves and the right -- then even the social scientists can't think straight about it.
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.
It clearly creates more innovation.
The American economy has grown enormously from it.
Diversity and immigration do a lot of good things.
But what the globalists, I think, don't see, what they don't want to see, is that ethnic diversity cuts social capital and trust.
There's a very important study by Robert Putnam, the author of "Bowling Alone," looking at social capital databases.
And basically, the more people feel that they are the same, the more they trust each other, the more they can have a redistribution ist welfare state.
Scandinavian countries are so wonderful because they have this legacy of being small, homogenous countries.
And that leads to a progressive welfare state, a set of progressive left-leaning values, which says, "Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.
People in Syria are suffering -- we must welcome them in." And it's a beautiful thing.
But if, and I was in Sweden this summer, if the discourse in Sweden is fairly politically correct and they can't talk about the downsides, you end up bringing a lot of people in.
That's going to cut social capital, it makes it hard to have a welfare state and they might end up, as we have in America, with a racially divided, visibly racially divided, society.
So this is all very uncomfortable to talk about.
But I think this is the thing, especially in Europe and for us, too, we need to be looking at.
CA: You're saying that people of reason, people who would consider themselves not racists, but moral, upstanding people, have a rationale that says humans are just too different; that we're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of, by mixing in people who are too different.
JH: Yes, but I can make it much more palatable by saying it's not necessarily about race.
It's about culture.
There's wonderful work by a political scientist named Karen Stenner, who shows that when people have a sense that we are all united, we're all the same, there are many people who have a predisposition to authoritarianism.
Those people aren't particularly racist when they feel as through there's not a threat to our social and moral order.
But if you prime them experimentally by thinking we're coming apart, people are getting more different, then they get more racist, homophobic, they want to kick out the deviants.
So it's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction.
The left, following through the Lennonist line -- the John Lennon line -- does things that create an authoritarian reaction.
We're certainly seeing that in America with the alt-right.
We saw it in Britain, we've seen it all over Europe.
But the more positive part of that is that I think the localists, or the nationalists, are actually right -- that, if you emphasize our cultural similarity, then race doesn't actually matter very much.
So an assimilationist approach to immigration removes a lot of these problems.
And if you value having a generous welfare state, you've got to emphasize that we're all the same.
CA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that are one of the causes of the current divide.
What are other causes?
JH: The next principle of moral psychology is that intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.
You've probably heard the term "motivated reasoning" or "confirmation bias." There's some really interesting work on how our high intelligence and our verbal abilities might have evolved not to help us find out the truth, but to help us manipulate each other, defend our reputation ... We're really, really good at justifying ourselves.
And when you bring group interests into account, so it's not just me, it's my team versus your team, whereas if you're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong, we just can't accept that.
So this is why you can't win a political argument.
If you're debating something, you can't persuade the person with reasons and evidence, because that's not the way reasoning works.
So now, give us the internet, give us Google: "I heard that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.
Let me Google that -- oh my God! 10 million hits! Look, he was!"
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people.
Social media has often been framed by techno-optimists as this great connecting force that would bring people together.
And there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that.
JH: That's right.
That's why I'm very enamored of yin-yang views of human nature and left-right -- that each side is right about certain things, but then it goes blind to other things.
And so the left generally believes that human nature is good: bring people together, knock down the walls and all will be well.
The right -- social conservatives, not libertarians -- social conservatives generally believe people can be greedy and sexual and selfish, and we need regulation, and we need restrictions.
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls, allow people to communicate all over the world, you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.
CA: So help us understand.
These principles of human nature have been with us forever.
What's changed that's deepened this feeling of division?
JH: You have to see six to ten different threads all coming together.
I'll just list a couple of them.
So in America, one of the big -- actually, America and Europe -- one of the biggest ones is World War II.
There's interesting research from Joe Henrich and others that says if your country was at war, especially when you were young, then we test you 30 years later in a commons dilemma or a prisoner's dilemma, you're more cooperative.
Because of our tribal nature, if you're -- my parents were teenagers during World War II, and they would go out looking for scraps of aluminum to help the war effort.
I mean, everybody pulled together.
And so then these people go on, they rise up through business and government, they take leadership positions.
They're really good at compromise and cooperation.
They all retire by the '90s.
So we're left with baby boomers by the end of the '90s.
And their youth was spent fighting each other within each country, in 1968 and afterwards.
The loss of the World War II generation, "The Greatest Generation," is huge.
So that's one.
Another, in America, is the purification of the two parties.
There used to be liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats.
So America had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan.
But because of a variety of factors that started things moving, by the 90's, we had a purified liberal party and conservative party.
So now, the people in either party really are different, and we really don't want our children to marry them, which, in the '60s, didn't matter very much.
So, the purification of the parties.
Third is the internet and, as I said, it's just the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.
CA: The tone of what's happening on the internet now is quite troubling.
I just did a quick search on Twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other.
One, against a picture of racist graffiti: "This is disgusting!
Ugliness in this country, brought to us by # Trump. "And then the next one is:" Crooked Hillary dedication page.
Disgusting! "So this idea of" disgust "is troubling to me.
Because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something, you can get angry at someone.
Disgust, I've heard you say, takes things to a much deeper level.
JH: That's right. Disgust is different. Anger — you know, I have kids.
They fight 10 times a day, and they love each other 30 times a day.
You just go back and forth: you get angry, you're not angry; you're angry, you're not angry.
But disgust is different.
Disgust paints the person as subhuman, monstrous, deformed, morally deformed.
Disgust is like indelible ink.
There's research from John Gottman on marital therapy.
If you look at the faces -- if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt, that's a predictor that they're going to get divorced soon, whereas if they show anger, that doesn't predict anything, because if you deal with anger well, it actually is good.
So this election is different. Donald Trump personally uses the word "disgust" a lot.
He's very germ-sensitive, so disgust does matter a lot -- more for him, that's something unique to him -- but as we demonize each other more, and again, through the Manichaean worldview, the idea that the world is a battle between good and evil as this has been ramping up, we're more likely not just to say they're wrong or I don't like them, but we say they're evil, they're satanic, they're disgusting, they're revolting.
And then we want nothing to do with them.
And that's why I think we're seeing it, for example, on campus now. We're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus, silence them, keep them away.
I'm afraid that this whole generation of young people, if their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust, they're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older.
CA: So how do we deal with that? Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?
JH: You can't do it with reasons.
I think ... I studied disgust for many years, and I think about emotions a lot.
And I think that the opposite of disgust is actually love.
Love is all about, like ... Disgust is closing off, borders.
Love is about dissolving walls.
So personal relationships, I think, are probably the most powerful means we have.
You can be disgusted by a group of people, but then you meet a particular person and you genuinely discover that they're lovely.
And then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well.
The tragedy is, Americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns by left-right or politics.
And now that it's become this great moral divide, there's a lot of evidence that we're moving to be near people who are like us politically.
It's harder to find somebody who's on the other side.
So they're over there, they're far away.
It's harder to get to know them.
CA: What would you say to someone or say to Americans, people generally, about what we should understand about each other that might help us rethink for a minute this "disgust" instinct?
JH: Yes. A really important thing to keep in mind -- there's research by political scientist Alan Abramowitz, showing that American democracy is increasingly governed by what's called "negative partisanship." That means you think, OK there's a candidate, you like the candidate, you vote for the candidate.
But with the rise of negative advertising and social media and all sorts of other trends, increasingly, the way elections are done is that each side tries to make the other side so horrible, so awful, that you'll vote for my guy by default.
And so as we more and more vote against the other side and not for our side, you have to keep in mind that if people are on the left, they think, "Well, I used to think that Republicans were bad, but now Donald Trump proves it.
And now every Republican, I can paint with all the things that I think about Trump. "And that's not necessarily true.
They're generally not very happy with their candidate.
This is the most negative partisanship election in American history.
So you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate from your feelings about the people who are given a choice.
And then you have to realize that, because we all live in a separate moral world -- the metaphor I use in the book is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix," or each moral community is a matrix, a consensual hallucination.
And so if you're within the blue matrix, everything's completely compelling that the other side -- they're troglodytes, they're racists, they're the worst people in the world, and you have all the facts to back that up.
But somebody in the next house from yours is living in a different moral matrix.
They live in a different video game, and they see a completely different set of facts.
And each one sees different threats to the country.
And what I've found from being in the middle and trying to understand both sides is: both sides are right.
There are a lot of threats to this country, and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all.
CA: So, are you saying that we almost need a new type of empathy?
Empathy is traditionally framed as: "Oh, I feel your pain.
I can put myself in your shoes. "And we apply it to the poor, the needy, the suffering.
We don't usually apply it to people who we feel as other, or we're disgusted by.
JH: No. That's right.
CA: What would it look like to build that type of empathy?
JH: Actually, I think ... Empathy is a very, very hot topic in psychology, and it's a very popular word on the left in particular.
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy for the preferred classes of victims.
So it's important to empathize with the groups that we on the left think are so important.
That's easy to do, because you get points for that.
But empathy really should get you points if you do it when it's hard to do.
And, I think ... You know, we had a long 50-year period of dealing with our race problems and legal discrimination, and that was our top priority for a long time and it still is important.
But I think this year, I'm hoping it will make people see that we have an existential threat on our hands.
Our left-right divide, I believe, is by far the most important divide we face.
We still have issues about race and gender and LGBT, but this is the urgent need of the next 50 years, and things aren't going to get better on their own.
So we're going to need to do a lot of institutional reforms, and we could talk about that, but that's like a whole long, wonky conversation.
But I think it starts with people realizing that this is a turning point.
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.
We need to realize: this is what our country needs, and this is what you need if you don't want to -- Raise your hand if you want to spend the next four years as angry and worried as you've been for the last year -- raise your hand.
So if you want to escape from this, read Buddha, read Jesus, read Marcus Aurelius.
They have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear, reframe things, stop seeing other people as your enemy.
There's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy.
CA: Here's my last question: Personally, what can people do to help heal?
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices.
And there's research showing that political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices in the country now.
So I think you have to make an effort — that's the main thing.
Make an effort to actually meet somebody.
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law, somebody who's on the other side.
So, after this election -- wait a week or two, because it's probably going to feel awful for one of you -- but wait a couple weeks, and then reach out and say you want to talk.
And before you do it, read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" --
(Laughter)
I'm totally serious. You'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging, if you start by saying, "You know, we don't agree on a lot, but one thing I really respect about you, Uncle Bob," or "... about you conservatives, is ... " And you can find something.
If you start with some appreciation, it's like magic.
This is one of the main things I've learned that I take into my human relationships.
I still make lots of stupid mistakes, but I'm incredibly good at apologizing now, and at acknowledging what somebody was right about.
And if you do that, then the conversation goes really well, and it's actually really fun.
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating speaking with you.
It really does feel like the ground that we're on is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature.
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.
Thank you so much for sharing this time with us.
JH: Thanks, Chris.
JH: Thanks, everyone.
Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value.
They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations, marketplaces.
But there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.
Now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this.
As humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.
Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the Nobel economist Douglass North.
He passed away at the end of 2015, but North pioneered what's called "new institutional economics." And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery.
These institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.
If we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure.
We had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions.
As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations.
These institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower.
Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.
We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.
As Douglass North saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.
And I believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.
So what is the blockchain?
Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network.
It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what.
The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured.
This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network.
This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.
It's not an app.
It's not a company.
I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia.
We can see everything on Wikipedia.
It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.
We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia, and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time.
On the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets.
It stores the history of custodianship, ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin, other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP.
It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information.
There are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at its core, that's how it works.
It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.
Which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways.
So uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but I want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role.
We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.
So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.
Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.
The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from.
Are they a power user?
Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.
But the problem is they're very fragmented.
Think about how many profiles you have.
Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.
This allows us to create a user-controlled portable identity.
More than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an ID, or that you're over 21, by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on.
Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.
So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with.
The second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions.
Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.
I want some degree of transparency.
I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me.
This is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we don't want tampered with.
The problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain.
All of these people that go into making a product, they don't have the same database.
They don't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.
Using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across nontrusting entities.
By this I mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves. Think back to Wikipedia. It's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth.
So we can create that using blockchains.
We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority.
So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies, can interact using the same database without trusting one another.
It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.
As a real-world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes.
This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.
So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.
The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging.
What if you don't send me the smartphone?
Can I get my money back?
Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer.
So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.
You are financing that phone, but you don't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met. You got the phone.
I think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement.
It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
I think what would probably floor Douglass North about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust.
So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.
Now, I don't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rainforest.
The truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy.
But there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start-ups and universities.
And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.
It's also an innovation in computer science.
in a totally new way. Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes,
So in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way.
It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.
So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
I think I understood that it's coming, it offers a lot of potential, and it's complex.
What is your estimate for the rate of adoption?
Bettina Warburg: I think that's a really good question.
My lab is pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first, because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
How many of you actually understand how the internet works?
But you use it every day, so I think we're sort of facing the same John Sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful, and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now, so it's better suited for either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around or for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.
BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.
Hi.
Thank you.
So, five years ago, this was me.
I was a PhD student at Harvard, and I loved to travel.
I had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life.
I was 28, and like so many of us when we are in good health, I felt like I was invincible.
Then one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees.
I probably should have gone to the doctor, but I'd never really been sick in my life, and I knew that usually, if you have a virus, you stay home and you make some chicken soup, and in a few days, everything will be fine.
But this time it wasn't fine.
After the fever broke, for three weeks I was so dizzy, I couldn't leave my house.
I would walk straight into door frames.
I had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom.
That spring I got infection after infection, and every time I went to the doctor, he said there was absolutely nothing wrong.
He had his laboratory tests, which always came back normal.
All I had were my symptoms, which I could describe, but no one else can see.
I know it sounds silly, but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself, and so I thought maybe I was just aging.
Maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25.
(Laughter)
Then the neurological symptoms started.
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't draw the right side of a circle.
Other times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all.
I saw every kind of specialist: infectious disease doctors, dermatologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists.
I even saw a psychiatrist.
My psychiatrist said, "It's clear you're really sick, but not with anything psychiatric.
I hope they can find out what's wrong with you. "
The next day, my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder.
He told me that everything -- the fevers, the sore throats, the sinus infection, all of the gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiac symptoms -- were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that I could not remember.
The symptoms were real, he said, but they had no biological cause.
I was training to be a social scientist. I had studied statistics, probability theory, mathematical modeling, experimental design.
I felt like I couldn't just reject my neurologist's diagnosis.
It didn't feel true, but I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive, so easily obscured by what we want to believe.
So I had to consider the possibility that he was right.
That day, I ran a small experiment.
I walked back the two miles from my neurologist's office to my house, my legs wrapped in this strange, almost electric kind of pain.
I meditated on that pain, contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this.
As soon as I walked through the door, I collapsed.
My brain and my spinal cord were burning.
My neck was so stiff I couldn't touch my chin to my chest, and the slightest sound -- the rustling of the sheets, my husband walking barefoot in the next room -- could cause excruciating pain.
I would spend most of the next two years in bed.
How could my doctor have gotten it so wrong?
I thought I had a rare disease, something doctors had never seen.
And then I went online and found thousands of people all over the world living with the same symptoms, similarly isolated, similarly disbelieved.
Some could still work, but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed, just so they could show up the next Monday.
On the other end of the spectrum, some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness, unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one.
I was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis.
You've probably heard it called "chronic fatigue syndrome." For decades, that's a name that's meant that this has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this.
The key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves -- physically, mentally -- we pay and we pay hard.
If my husband goes for a run, he might be sore for a couple of days.
If I try to walk half a block, I might be bedridden for a week.
It is a perfect custom prison.
I know ballet dancers who can't dance, accountants who can't add, medical students who never became doctors.
It doesn't matter what you once were; you can't do it anymore.
It's been four years, and I've still never been as well as I was the minute before I walked home from my neurologist's office.
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease.
In the US, where I'm from, it's about one million people.
That makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis.
Patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure.
Twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden, and 75 to 85 percent of us can't even work part-time.
Yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us.
How could a disease this common and this devastating have been forgotten by medicine?
When my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder, he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies that are over 2,500 years old.
The Roman physician Galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women.
The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture, pressing on internal organs -- yes -- causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis.
The cure was marriage and motherhood.
These ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s, when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria.
Sigmund Freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle.
It converted these emotions into physical symptoms.
This meant that men could now get hysteria, but of course women were still the most susceptible.
When I began investigating the history of my own disease, I was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run.
In 1934, 198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital became seriously ill.
They had muscle weakness, stiffness in the neck and back, fevers -- all of the same symptoms I had when I first got diagnosed.
Doctors thought it was a new form of polio.
Since then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented around the world, of a strikingly similar post-infectious disease.
All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women, and in time, when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease, they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria.
Why has this idea had such staying power?
I do think it has to do with sexism, but I also think that fundamentally, doctors want to help.
They want to know the answer, and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable, to explain illnesses that have no explanation.
The problem is that this can cause real harm.
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria.
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled.
Many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain tumors.
In 1980, hysteria was officially renamed "conversion disorder." When my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in 2012, he was echoing Freud's words verbatim, and even today, women are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive that diagnosis.
The problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven.
It is by definition the absence of evidence, and in the case of ME, psychological explanations have held back biological research.
All around the world, ME is one of the least funded diseases.
In the US, we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient, 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient.
This was not just lightning.
I was not just unlucky.
The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice, a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us.
We don't know why ME sometimes runs in families, why you can get it after almost any infection, from enteroviruses to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever, or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men.
This issue is much bigger than just my disease.
When I first got sick, old friends were reaching out to me.
I soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart.
What was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously.
I learned of one woman with scleroderma, an autoimmune connective tissue disease, who was told for years that it was all in her head.
Between the time of onset and diagnosis, her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged, she will never be able to eat again.
Another woman with ovarian cancer, who for years was told that it was just early menopause.
A friend from college, whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety.
Here's why this worries me: since the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled.
Forty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they're hypochondriacs.
Like the hysteria of old, this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe.
Seventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women, and in some diseases, it's as high as 90 percent.
Even though these diseases disproportionately affect women, they are not women's diseases.
ME affects children and ME affects millions of men.
And as one patient told me, we get it coming and going -- if you're a woman, you're told you're exaggerating your symptoms, but if you're a guy, you're told to be strong, to buck up.
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed.
My brain is not what it used to be.
Here's the good part: despite everything, I still have hope.
So many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms.
Patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the EEG was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the CAT scan and the MRI discovered brain lesions.
And recently, we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress, until we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit.
ME has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had, but that's starting to change.
In Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity, and in Japan, of brain inflammation.
In the US, scientists at Stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are 16 standard deviations away from normal.
And in Norway, researchers are running a phase-3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission.
What also gives me hope is the resilience of patients.
Online we came together, and we shared our stories.
We devoured what research there was.
We experimented on ourselves.
We became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be.
And slowly I added five percent here, five percent there, until eventually, on a good day, I was able to leave my home.
I still had to make ridiculous choices: Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes, or will I wash my hair today?
But it gave me hope that I could be treated.
I had a sick body; that was all.
And with the right kind of help, maybe one day I could get better.
I came together with patients around the world, and we started to fight.
We have filled the void with something wonderful, but it is not enough.
I still don't know if I will ever be able to run again, or walk at any distance, or do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams.
But I am so grateful for how far I have come.
Progress is slow, and it is up and it is down, but I am getting a little better each day.
I remember what it was like when I was stuck in that bedroom, when it had been months since I had seen the sun.
I thought that I would die there.
But here I am today, with you, and that is a miracle.
I don't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones, had I gotten sick before the internet, had I not found my community.
I probably would have already taken my own life, as so many others have done.
How many lives could we have saved, decades ago, if we had asked the right questions?
How many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start?
Even once the true cause of my disease is discovered, if we don't change our institutions and our culture, we will do this again to another disease.
Living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors.
Doctors, scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect all of us.
We need to think in more nuanced ways about women's health.
Our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies.
We need to listen to patients' stories, and we need to be willing to say, "I don't know." "I don't know" is a beautiful thing. "I don't know" is where discovery starts.
And if we can do that, if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know, and then, rather than fear uncertainty, maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I am so excited to be here.
Everything in America is so much bigger than in Europe.
Look at me -- I am huge!
(Laughter)
It's fantastic! And TED Talks -- TED Talks are where everybody has great ideas.
So the question is: Where do those great ideas come from?
Well, it's a little bit of debate, but it's generally reckoned that the average person -- that's me -- has about 50,000 thoughts a day.
Which is a lot, until you realize that 95 percent of them are the same ones you had the day before.
(Laughter)
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?
I think things like, "Oh!
I know — I must clean the floor. Oh! I forgot to walk the dog. "My most popular:" Don't eat that cookie. "
(Laughter)
So, 95 percent repetition.
That leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new.
And some of my new thoughts are useless.
The other day I was watching some sports on television, and I was trying to decide why I just don't engage with it.
Some of it I find curious. This is odd.
(Laughter)
Do you think it would be worth being that flexible just to be able to see your heel at that angle?
(Laughter)
And here's the thing: I'm never going to be able to relate to that, because I'm never going to be able to do it, OK?
Well, not twice, anyway.
(Laughter)
But I'll tell you the truth. The truth is I have never been any good at sport, OK?
I've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say, "Oh, I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18." And I always feel rather smug then.
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --
(Laughter)
I couldn't run then.
I'm certainly not going to do it now.
(Laughter)
So then I had my new idea: Why not engage people like me in sport?
I think what the world needs now is the Olympics for people with zero athletic ability.
(Laughter)
Oh, it would be so much more fun.
We'd have three basic rules, OK?
Obviously no drugs; no corruption, no skills.
(Laughter)
It would be -- No, it's a terrible idea.
And I also know why I don't engage with sport when I watch it on television.
It's because probably 97 percent of it is about men running and men kicking things, men trying to look neatly packaged in Lycra. There is --
(Laughter)
There is -- Not always successfully.
(Laughter)
There is so little female sport on television, that a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking, and how can I put this nicely, that the male member is the very lever you need to get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground.
(Laughter)
The inequalities in sport are breathtaking.
So this is what happens to me: I have a brand new idea, and immediately I come back to an old one.
The fact is, there is not now, nor has there ever been in the whole of history, a single country in the world where women have equality with men. Not one. 196 countries, it hasn't happened in the whole of evolution. So, here is a picture of evolution.
(Laughter)
We women are not even in it!
(Laughter)
It's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly. So --
(Laughter)
It bugs me, and I know I should do something about it.
But I'm busy, OK?
I have a full-on career, I've got three kids, I've got an elderly mom.
In fact, if I'm honest with you, one of the reasons I came out here is because TED Talks said I could have 15 minutes to myself, and I never have that much time --
So I'm busy. And anyway, I already had a go at changing the world.
Here's the thing, OK?
Everybody has inside themselves what I call an "activation button." It's the button that gets pressed when you think, "I must do something about this." It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.
Maybe you face some kind of inequality, or you've come across an injustice of some kind, sometimes an illness strikes, or you're born in some way disadvantaged, or perhaps underprivileged.
So I was born gay, OK?
I've always known, I don't think my family were the least bit surprised.
Here is a picture of me aged four.
I look cute, but inside I genuinely believed that I looked like Clint Eastwood.
(Laughter)
So my activation button was pressed when I had my kids — three wonderful kids, born to my then-partner.
Now here's the thing: I work on television in Britain.
By the time they were born, I was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye.
I love what I do, but I love my kids more.
And I didn't want them to grow up with a secret.
1994, when my son, my youngest was born, there was not, as far as I was aware, a single out, gay woman in British public life.
I don't think secrets are a good thing.
I think they are a cancer of the soul.
So I decided to come out.
Everybody warned me that I would never work again, but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk.
Well, it was hell.
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious section of the right-wing press, and they went nuts.
And their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society, and we got death threats -- enough death threats that I had to take the kids into hiding, and we had to have police protection.
And I promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when I was terrified by what I had done.
Eventually the dust settled. Against all expectation I carried on working, and my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic.
I remember when my son was six, he had a friend over to play.
They were in the next room; I could hear them chatting.
The friend said to my son, "What's it like having two mums?" I was a little anxious to hear, so I leant in to hear and my son said, "It's fantastic, because if one of them's sick, you've still got another one to cook for you."
(Laughter)
So my activation button for gay equality was pressed, and along with many, many others, I campaigned for years for gay rights, and in particular, the right to marry the person that I love.
In the end, we succeeded.
And in 2014, on the day that the law was changed, I married my wife, who I love very much, indeed.
(Applause)
We didn't do it in a quiet way -- we did it on the stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London. It was a great event. The hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people.
We invited 150 family and friends, then I let it be known to the public: anybody who wanted to come and celebrate, please come and join us.
It would be free to anybody who wanted to come.
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.
(Applause)
Every kind of person you can imagine: gays, straights, rabbis, nuns, married people, black, white -- the whole of humanity was there.
And I remember standing on that stage thinking, "How fantastic. Job done. Love triumphs. Law changed." And I --
(Applause)
And I genuinely thought my activation days were over, OK?
So every year in that same hall, I host a fantastic concert to celebrate International Women's Day.
We gather the world's only all-female orchestra, we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers, we have amazing conductors -- it's Marin Alsop there from Baltimore conducting, Petula Clark singing -- and I give a lecture on women's history.
I love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on.
Too often, I think history's what I call the Mount Rushmore model.
It looks majestic, but the women have been entirely left out of it.
And I was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes -- I'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard for the right for women in Britain to vote.
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words." And boy, they succeeded, because women did indeed get the vote in 1928.
So I'm giving this talk about this, and as I'm talking, what I realized is: this was not a history lecture I was giving; this was not something where the job was done.
This was something where there was so much left to do.
Nowhere in the world, for example, do women have equal representation in positions of power.
OK, let's take a very quick look at the top 100 companies in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.
Top 100 companies: How many women running them? Seven. OK. Seven. That's all right, I suppose.
Until you realize that 17 are run by men called "John."
(Laughter)
There are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies --
(Laughter)
than there are women. There are 14 run by men called "Dave."
(Laughter)
Now, I'm sure Dave and John are doing a bang-up job.
(Laughter)
OK. Why does it matter? Well, it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap.
Nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men.
And that is never going to change unless we have more women at the top in the boardroom.
We have plenty of laws; the Equal Pay Act in Britain was passed in 1975.
Nevertheless, there are still many, many women who, from early November until the end of the year, by comparison to their male colleagues, are effectively working for free.
In fact, the World Economic Forum estimates that women will finally get equal pay in ... 2133! Yay!
And here's the thing: the day before I came out to give my talk, the World Economic Forum revised it. So that's good, because that's a terrible -- 2133.
Do you know what they revised it to? 2186.
(Laughter)
Yeah, another 53 years, OK? We are not going to get equal pay in my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives under the current system.
And I have waited long enough.
I've waited long enough in my own business.
In 2016 I became the very first woman on British television to host a prime-time panel show.
Isn't that great?
Wonderful, I'm thrilled. But —
But 2016! The first! Television's been around for 80 years!
(Laughter)
It may be television's not so important, but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?
2016, the UN were looking for a brand new ambassador to represent women's empowerment and gender equality, and who did they choose? Wonder Woman. Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?
(Laughter)
Because no woman was up to the job.
The representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low.
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly true in the British Parliament.
In 2015, the number of men elected to the Parliament that year was greater than the total number of women who have ever been members of Parliament. And why does it matter? Here's the thing: if they're not at the table -- literally, in Britain, at that table helping to make the laws -- do not be surprised if the female perspective is overlooked.
It's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge.
In 2016, Britain got its second female Prime Minister; Theresa May came to power. The day she came to power she was challenged: just do one thing. Do one thing in the first 100 days that you're in office to try and improve lives for women in Britain.
And what did she do? Nothing. Nothing. Because she's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made.
Even having a female leader, they always find something better to do than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality.
So I keep talking about equality like it matters. Does it? Well, let's take a very quick look at the STEM industries, OK?
So science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Pretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives.
There is the thickest and most incredibly well-documented glass ceiling in the STEM industries.
What if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress?
So I thought all these things, and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words." And I spoke to my wonderful friend, brilliant journalist Catherine Mayer in Britain, and we rather foolishly — and I suspect there was wine involved —
(Laughter)
We decided to found a brand new political party.
Because here's the critical thing: the one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.
We had no idea what we were doing, we didn't know how complicated it was to start a political party.
I thought, "It can't be that difficult, men have been doing it for years."
So we started by calling it "The Women's Equality Party." And straightaway people said to me, "Why did you call it that?" I said, "I don't know, I just thought we'd be clear."
(Laughter)
I didn't want what we were doing to be a secret, you know? I just --
(Laughter)
Some people said, "You can't call it that!
It's much too feminist! "Ooh! Scary word! Ahh! I can't tell you how many times I've heard somebody say," I'm not a feminist, but... "And I always think if there's a" but "in the sentence, it can't all be roses in the garden.
And then I started getting asked the hilarious question, "Are you all going to burn your bras?" Yes! Because bras are famously made of flammable material.
(Laughter)
That's why all women spark when they walk.
(Laughter)
Here's quick history sidebar for you: no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.
It's a story made up by a journalist.
So -- Thank goodness journalism has improved since then.
(Laughter)
I announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview, and straightaway, the emails started coming.
First hundreds, then thousands and thousands, from every age group: from the very young to women in their '90s, to hundreds of wonderful men.
People wrote and said, "Please, can I help? Please, can I visit you at party headquarters?" We didn't have a headquarters -- we didn't have a party!
We didn't have anything.
All we had was a wonderful, tight group of fabulous friends trying to answer emails pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.
We were all busy. Many of us had careers, many of us had children, but we did what women do, and we shared the work.
And almost instantly, we agreed on certain fundamental things.
First thing: we want to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist. That's a fantastic idea. We wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning.
We wanted people from the left, from the right, from the middle, every age group.
Because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda: let's get equality in every aspect of our lives, and when we're finished, let's go home and get the other chores done.
(Laughter)
And we wanted to change how politics is conducted.
I don't know if you have this, but in Britain we have two major political parties.
They're the dinosaurs of politics.
And how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous.
I'm sure you've never had that kind of name-calling --
(Laughter)
And lying here. Wouldn't it be great if just one politician said, "Do you know, my opponent has a point.
Let's see if we can't work together and get the job done."
(Applause)
And let's get more women into politics, OK?
Let's immediately get more women into politics by being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates, so they can get out of the house and start campaigning.
(Applause)
Within 10 months, we had more than 70 branches of our party across the UK.
We stood candidates for election in London, Scotland and Wales in May 2016.
One in 20 people voted for our candidate for London Mayor.
And when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting, wonder of wonders, they began to talk about the need to tackle gender equality.
(Applause)
You know, I've been promised change since I was a child.
It was always coming: women were going to stand shoulder to shoulder with men.
All I got were empty promises and disappointment -- enough disappointment to found a political party.
But here is my new idea for today — this is my five percent, OK?
And this one is really good.
The fact is, this is not enough.
It is not enough to found one political party for equality in a single country.
What we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape.
And the wonderful thing about the model we have created is that it would work anywhere. It would work in America, it would work in Australia, it would work in India.
It's like we've made the perfect recipe: anybody can cook it, and it's good for everybody.
And we want to give it away.
If you want to know what we did, we're giving it away.
Can you imagine if we could mobilize millions of women across the world to say, "That's enough!" to the traditional battles of politics?
To say, "Stop the bickering, let's get the work done." We could literally change the world.
And I want that.
(Applause)
I want ...
I want that for our daughters, and I want it for our sons.
Because the fact is: equality is better for everyone.
Come on people, let's activate! Let's change the world! I know we can do it, and it wants doing!
I'd like to try something new.
Those of you who are able, please stand up.
OK, so I'm going to name some names.
When you hear a name that you don't recognize, you can't tell me anything about them, I'd like you to take a seat and stay seated.
The last person standing, we're going to see what they know. OK?
(Laughter)
All right. Eric Garner. Mike Brown. Tamir Rice. Freddie Gray.
So those of you who are still standing, I'd like you to turn around and take a look.
I'd say half to most of the people are still standing. So let's continue.
Michelle Cusseaux. Tanisha Anderson. Aura Rosser. Meagan Hockaday.
So if we look around again, there are about four people still standing, and actually I'm not going to put you on the spot.
I just say that to encourage transparency, so you can be seated.
(Laughter)
So those of you who recognized the first group of names know that these were African-Americans who have been killed by the police over the last two and a half years.
What you may not know is that the other list is also African-Americans who have been killed within the last two years.
Only one thing distinguishes the names that you know from the names that you don't know: gender.
So let me first let you know that there's nothing at all distinct about this audience that explains the pattern of recognition that we've just seen.
I've done this exercise dozens of times around the country. I've done it to women's rights organizations.
I've done it with sociologists. I've done it even with progressive members of Congress.
And everywhere, the awareness of the level of police violence that black women experience is exceedingly low.
Now, it is surprising, isn't it, that this would be the case.
I mean, there are two issues involved here.
There's police violence against African-Americans, and there's violence against women, two issues that have been talked about a lot lately.
But when we think about who is implicated by these problems, when we think about who is victimized by these problems, the names of these black women never come to mind.
Now, communications experts tell us that when facts do not fit with the available frames, people have a difficult time incorporating new facts into their way of thinking about a problem.
These women's names have slipped through our consciousness because there are no frames for us to see them, no frames for us to remember them, no frames for us to hold them.
As a consequence, reporters don't lead with them, policymakers don't think about them, and politicians aren't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them.
Now, you might ask, why does a frame matter?
I mean, after all, an issue that affects black people and an issue that affects women, wouldn't that necessarily include black people who are women and women who are black people?
Well, the simple answer is that this is a trickle-down approach to social justice, and many times it just doesn't work.
Without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members of a targeted group, many will fall through the cracks of our movements, left to suffer in virtual isolation.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
Many years ago, I began to use the term "intersectionality" to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping, creating multiple levels of social injustice.
Now, the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.
Emma DeGraffenreid was an African-American woman, a working wife and a mother.
I actually read about Emma's story from the pages of a legal opinion written by a judge who had dismissed Emma's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant.
Emma, like so many African-American women, sought better employment for her family and for others.
She wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family.
But she applied for a job, and she was not hired, and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman.
Now, the judge in question dismissed Emma's suit, and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire African-Americans and the employer hired women.
The real problem, though, that the judge was not willing to acknowledge was what Emma was actually trying to say, that the African-Americans that were hired, usually for industrial jobs, maintenance jobs, were all men.
And the women that were hired, usually for secretarial or front-office work, were all white.
Only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.
But the court refused to allow Emma to put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that, by allowing her to do that, she would be able to have preferential treatment.
She would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat, when African-American men and white women only had one swing at the bat.
But of course, neither African-American men or white women needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim to tell the story of the discrimination they were experiencing.
Why wasn't the real unfairness law's refusal to protect African-American women simply because their experiences weren't exactly the same as white women and African-American men?
Rather than broadening the frame to include African-American women, the court simply tossed their case completely out of court.
Now, as a student of antidiscrimination law, as a feminist, as an antiracist, I was struck by this case.
It felt to me like injustice squared.
So first of all, black women weren't allowed to work at the plant.
Second of all, the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential.
And to boot, there was no name for this problem.
And we all know that, where there's no name for a problem, you can't see a problem, and when you can't see a problem, you pretty much can't solve it.
Many years later, I had come to recognize that the problem that Emma was facing was a framing problem.
The frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination was partial, and it was distorting.
For me, the challenge that I faced was trying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative, a prism that would allow us to see Emma's dilemma, a prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law, that would allow judges to see her story.
So it occurred to me, maybe a simple analogy to an intersection might allow judges to better see Emma's dilemma.
So if we think about this intersection, the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender.
And then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring policies and the other practices that ran through those roads.
Now, because Emma was both black and female, she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped, experiencing the simultaneous impact of the company's gender and race traffic.
The law -- the law is like that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat Emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected.
So what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself?
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.
I would go on to learn that African-American women, like other women of color, like other socially marginalized people all over the world, were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of intersectionality, intersections of race and gender, of heterosexism, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, all of these social dynamics come together and create challenges that are sometimes quite unique.
But in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives, it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which African-American women die.
Police violence against black women is very real.
The level of violence that black women face is such that it's not surprising that some of them do not survive their encounters with police.
Black girls as young as seven, great grandmothers as old as 95 have been killed by the police.
They've been killed in their living rooms, in their bedrooms.
They've been killed in their cars.
They've been killed on the street.
They've been killed in front of their parents and they've been killed in front of their children.
They have been shot to death.
They have been stomped to death.
They have been suffocated to death.
They have been manhandled to death.
They have been tasered to death.
They've been killed when they've called for help.
They've been killed when they were alone, and they've been killed when they were with others.
They've been killed shopping while black, driving while black, having a mental disability while black, having a domestic disturbance while black.
They've even been killed being homeless while black.
They've been killed talking on the cell phone, laughing with friends, sitting in a car reported as stolen and making a U-turn in front of the White House with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car.
Why don't we know these stories?
Why is it that their lost lives don't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives of their fallen brothers?
It's time for a change.
So what can we do? In 2014, the African-American Policy Forum began to demand that we "say her name" at rallies, at protests, at conferences, at meetings, anywhere and everywhere that state violence against black bodies is being discussed.
But saying her name is not enough.
We have to be willing to do more.
We have to be willing to bear witness, to bear witness to the often painful realities that we would just rather not confront, the everyday violence and humiliation that many black women have had to face, black women across color, age, gender expression, sexuality and ability.
So we have the opportunity right now -- bearing in mind that some of the images that I'm about to share with you may be triggering for some -- to collectively bear witness to some of this violence.
We're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.
And as we sit with these women, some who have experienced violence and some who have not survived them, we have an opportunity to reverse what happened at the beginning of this talk, when we could not stand for these women because we did not know their names.
So at the end of this clip, there's going to be a roll call.
Several black women's names will come up.
I'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can, randomly, disorderly.
Let's create a cacophony of sound to represent our intention to hold these women up, to sit with them, to bear witness to them, to bring them into the light.
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say, say her name.
Say, say, say her name.
Say her name.
For all the names I'll never know,
say her name.
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones, Janisha Fonville, Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore, Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd, Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.
AD: Say her name.
KC: So I said at the beginning, if we can't see a problem, we can't fix a problem.
Together, we've come together to bear witness to these women's lost lives.
But the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation.
This is something that we can do.
It's up to us.
Thank you for joining us. Thank you.
(Music)
Roughly 43,000 years ago, a young cave bear died in the rolling hills on the northwest border of modern day Slovenia.
A thousand years later, a mammoth died in southern Germany.
A few centuries after that, a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity.
And we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths, but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate.
After their deaths, a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute.
Think about that for a second. Imagine you're a caveman, 40,000 years ago.
You've mastered fire.
You've built simple tools for hunting.
You've learned how to craft garments from animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter.
What would you choose to invent next?
It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute, a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules.
But that is exactly what our ancestors did.
Now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation.
Sometimes people invent things because they want to stay alive or feed their children or conquer the village next door.
But just as often, new ideas come into the world simply because they're fun.
And here's the really strange thing: many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparking momentous transformations in science, in politics and society.
Take what may be the most important invention of modern times: programmable computers.
Now, the standard story is that computers descend from military technology, since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories.
But in fact, the origins of the modern computer are much more playful, even musical, than you might imagine.
The idea behind the flute, of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound, was eventually modified to create the first organ more than 2,000 years ago.
Someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers, inventing the first musical keyboard.
Now, keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano, until the middle of the 19th century, when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters.
In fact, the very first typewriter was originally called "the writing harpsichord."
Flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs.
About a thousand years ago, at the height of the Islamic Renaissance, three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ.
They called it "the instrument that plays itself." Now, the instrument was basically a giant music box.
The organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder.
And if you wanted the machine to play a different song, you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it.
This instrument was the first of its kind. It was programmable.
Now, conceptually, this was a massive leap forward.
The whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention.
And that incredibly powerful concept didn't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest, or necessity at all.
It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music.
In fact, the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years.
In the 1700s, music-making machines became the playthings of the Parisian elite.
Showmen used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata, an early kind of robot.
One of the most famous of those robots was, you guessed it, an automated flute player designed by a brilliant French inventor named Jacques de Vaucanson.
And as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician, he had another idea.
If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds, why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth?
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes, they would represent threads with different colors.
If you wanted a new pattern for your fabric, you just programmed a new cylinder.
This was the first programmable loom.
Now, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make, but a half century later, another French inventor named Jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders.
Paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device.
That punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage to create his analytical engine, the first true programmable computer ever designed.
And punch cards were used by computer programmers as late as the 1970s.
So ask yourself this question: what really made the modern computer possible?
Yes, the military involvement is an important part of the story, but inventing a computer also required other building blocks: music boxes, toy robot flute players, harpsichord keyboards, colorful patterns woven into fabric, and that's just a small part of the story.
There's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies that came out of play: public museums, rubber, probability theory, the insurance business and many more.
Necessity isn't always the mother of invention.
The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory, seeking out new possibilities in the world around us.
And that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs.
Now, I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces, but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what's coming next.
Think about it: if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th, the 20th centuries, automated machines, computers, artificial intelligence, a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time.
It seemed like an amusement at best, not useful in any serious way, but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world.
You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.
Speaking up is hard to do.
I understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago, when my wife and I became new parents.
It was an amazing moment.
It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying.
And it got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital, and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding.
And we wanted to call our pediatrician, but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy, neurotic parent. So we worried. And we waited. When we got to the doctor's office the next day, she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated.
Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her.
But in that moment, I should've spoken up, but I didn't.
But sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't, and I learned that over 10 years ago when I let my twin brother down.
My twin brother is a document ary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer from a distribution company.
He was excited, and he was inclined to accept the offer.
But as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one.
And it was perfect -- it was perfectly insulting.
The company was so offended, they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing.
And I've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interests, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask.
And the range of stories are varied and diverse, but they also make up a universal tapestry.
Can I correct my boss when they make a mistake?
Can I confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes?
Can I challenge my friend's insensitive joke?
Can I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities?
And through these experiences, I've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior.
Now, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much. That's what happened with my brother.
Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior.
But sometimes we're too weak.
That's what happened with my wife and I. And this range of acceptable behaviors -- when we stay within our range, we're rewarded.
When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways.
We get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized.
Or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal.
Now, the first thing we need to know is: What is my range?
But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic.
It expands and it narrows based on the context.
And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else, and that's your power.
Your power determines your range. What is power? Power comes in lots of forms.
In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives.
So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power.
The company had lots of alternatives; they had power.
Sometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents.
Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate.
Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested than the other person.
And the key thing is that when we have lots of power, our range is very wide.
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.
But when we lack power, our range narrows.
We have very little leeway.
The problem is that when our range narrows, that produces something called the low-power double bind.
The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished.
Now, many of you have heard the phrase the "double bind" and connected it with one thing, and that's gender.
The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished.
And the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so.
But what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind.
And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise.
Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, "Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different about the sexes. "But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences is really power.
And so it's the low-power double bind.
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power.
We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large.
So we need to find ways to expand our range.
And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found two things really matter.
The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes.
The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others.
When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range.
When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range.
So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior.
And I'm going to give you a set of tools today.
Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up.
The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding.
On average, women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table.
But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious.
That's when they advocate for others.
When they advocate for others, they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind.
They become more assertive.
This is sometimes called "the mama bear effect." Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice.
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves. How do we do that? One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking.
And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person.
It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range.
When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want.
But here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do.
So let's do a little experiment.
I want you all to hold your hand just like this: your finger -- put it up.
And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible.
OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking.
I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead -- my former student, Erika Hall.
And you can see over here, that's the correct E. I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person.
That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point.
But this E over here is the self-focused E. We often get self-focused.
And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis.
I want to tell you about a particular crisis.
A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California.
And he says, "Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb." Now, the bank manager didn't give him the money.
She took a step back.
She took his perspective, and she noticed something really important.
He asked for a specific amount of money.
So she said, "Why did you ask for $2,000?"
And he said, "My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately."
And she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan."
(Laughter)
"Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you fill out the paperwork."
(Laughter)
Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation.
So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable.
Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility.
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car.
You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options.
Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty.
Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty.
My research shows that when you give people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely to accept your offer.
And this doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents.
When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything.
But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea. What if I gave my daughter a choice? This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.
How do we do that? She got dressed quickly and without resistance. When I've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: "When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies." So we want to get allies on our side. Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.
When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies.
Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice.
When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility.
And this really works to solve another double bind.
And that's the self-promotion double bind.
The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices. And if we do, we're not likable.
But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable.
And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming.
There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice.
I want you to notice three things about this: First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice.
Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice.
And three, it still worked!
I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them because they asked for advice.
Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up is when we have expertise.
Expertise gives us credibility.
When we have high power, we already have credibility.
We only need good evidence.
When we lack power, we don't have the credibility.
We need excellent evidence.
And one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion.
I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, "I want you to describe a passion of yours to me." I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, "What did you notice about the other person when they described their passion?" And the answers are always the same. "Their eyes lit up and got big." "They smiled a big beaming smile." "They used their hands all over -- I had to duck because their hands were coming at me." "They talk quickly with a little higher pitch."
(Laughter)
"They leaned in as if telling me a secret."
And then I said to them, "What happened to you as you listened to their passion?"
They said, "My eyes lit up. I smiled. I leaned in."
When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission from others to speak up.
Tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak.
Both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears.
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women.
I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding.
Here's a picture of us.
My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real passion was cinema, like my brother.
And so he wrote a speech for my brother's wedding about the roles we play in the human comedy.
And he said, "The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving and enriching your performance.
Those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow, change and expand the self.
Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful."
What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world.
But he was also saying the essence of this talk: those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving.
So when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker.
Have excellent evidence and strong allies.
Be a passionate perspective taker.
and your days will be mostly joyful." And if you use those tools -- and each and every one of you can use these tools -- you will expand your range of acceptable behavior,
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here's a question that matters.
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]
Because we're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves.
And we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants and we can evolve animals, and we're now reaching a point where we really have to ask, is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings?
And as you're thinking about that, let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics, prosthetics past, present, future.
So this is the iron hand that belonged to one of the German counts.
Loved to fight, lost his arm in one of these battles.
No problem, he just made a suit of armor, put it on, perfect prosthetic.
That's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from.
And of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful, more and more modern.
You can hold soft-boiled eggs.
You can have all types of controls, and as you're thinking about that, there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins will go out and say, how tall do I want to be tonight? Or Hugh will say what type of cliff do I want to climb? Or does somebody want to run a marathon, or does somebody want to ballroom dance? And as you adapt these things, the interesting thing about prosthetics is they've been coming inside the body.
So these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees. They've become artificial hips.
And then they've evolved further to become not just nice to have but essential to have.
So when you're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic, you're talking about something that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg," it's, "if I don't have this, I can die." And at that point, a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic relationship with the human body.
And four of the smartest people that I've ever met -- Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr, Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander -- are working on a Center for Extreme Bionics.
And the interesting thing of what you're seeing here is these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone. They get integrated into the skin. They get integrated into the muscle.
And one of the other sides of Ed is he's been thinking about how to connect the brain using light or other mechanisms directly to things like these prosthetics.
And if you can do that, then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity.
So how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve.
And of course, if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic, say with light or liquid metal, then you can increase that diameter and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where, as long as you could see the muzzle flash, you could step out of the way of a bullet.
Those are the order of magnitude of changes you're talking about.
This is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics.
These are Phonak hearing aids, and the reason why these are so interesting is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something for somebody who is "disabled" and they become something that somebody who is "normal" might want to actually have, because what this prosthetic does, which is really interesting, is not only does it help you hear, you can focus your hearing, so it can hear the conversation going on over there. You can have superhearing.
You can have white noise. You can record, and oh, by the way, they also put a phone into this.
So this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone.
And at that point, somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.
All of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together, and it's about time we ask the question, how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two?
And for that we turn to a great philosopher who was a very smart man despite being a Yankee fan.
(Laughter)
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course, that it's very tough to make predictions, especially about the future.
(Laughter)
So instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with, let's take what's happening in the present with people like Tony Atala, who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn't having something external, titanium. Maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code, remake your own body parts, because that's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic.
But while you're at it, then you can take the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.
And one of the things that we've been doing is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells.
And if you can reprogram a cell, then you can change the cells in those organs. So if you can change the cells in those organs, maybe you make those organs more radiation-resistant.
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen. Maybe you make them more efficient to filter out stuff that you don't want in your body.
And over the last few weeks, George Church has been in the news a lot because he's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells and inserting an entire human genome into that cell.
And once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell, then you begin to ask the question, would you want to enhance any of that genome?
Do you want to enhance a human body?
How would you want to enhance a human body?
Where is it ethical to enhance a human body and where is it not ethical to enhance a human body?
And all of a sudden, what we're doing is we've got this multidimensional chess board where we can change human genetics by using viruses to attack things like AIDS, or we can change the gene code through gene therapy to do away with some hereditary diseases, or we can change the environment, and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome and pass that on to the next generations.
And all of a sudden, it's not just one little bit, it's all these stacked little bits that allow you to take little portions of it until all the portions coming together lead you to something that's very different.
And a lot of people are very scared by this stuff.
And it does sound scary, and there are risks to this stuff.
So why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff?
Why would we really want to alter the human body in a fundamental way?
The answer lies in part with Lord Rees, astronomer royal of Great Britain.
And one of his favorite sayings is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.
So what does that mean?
It means if you take any one of your bodies at random, drop it anywhere in the universe, drop it in space, you die. Drop it on the Sun, you die. Drop it on the surface of Mercury, you die. Drop it near a supernova, you die.
But fortunately, it's only about 80 percent effective.
So as a great physicist once said, there's these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy.
So as the universe dissipates energy, there's these upstream eddies that create biological order.
Now, the problem with eddies is, they tend to disappear. They shift. They move in rivers.
And because of that, when an eddy shifts, when the Earth becomes a snowball, when the Earth becomes very hot, when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, when you have supervolcanoes, when you have solar flares, when you have potentially extinction-level events like the next election --
(Laughter)
then all of a sudden, you can have periodic extinctions.
And by the way, that's happened five times on Earth, and therefore it is very likely that the human species on Earth is going to go extinct someday.
Not next week, not next month, maybe in November, but maybe 10,000 years after that.
As you're thinking of the consequence of that, if you believe that extinctions are common and natural and normal and occur periodically, it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species.
And it becomes a moral imperative because it's going to be really hard to live on Mars if we don't fundamentally modify the human body. Right? You go from one cell, mom and dad coming together to make one cell, in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.
We don't know, if you change the gravity substantially, if the same thing will happen to create your body.
We do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are to a lot of radiation, we will die.
So as you're thinking of that, you have to really redesign things just to get to Mars.
Forget about the moons of Neptune or Jupiter.
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev, let's think about life in a series of scales.
So Life One civilization is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks.
And we've been doing that for thousands of years.
You've got tummy tucks and you've got this and you've got that.
You alter your looks, and I'm told that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons.
(Laughter)
Seems odd.
A Life Two civilization is a different civilization.
A Life Two civilization alters fundamental aspects of the body.
So you put human growth hormone in, the person grows taller, or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things, but you're altering the functions in a fundamental way.
To become an intrasolar civilization, we're going to have to create a Life Three civilization, and that looks very different from what we've got here.
Maybe you splice in Deinococcus radiodurans so that the cells can resplice after a lot of exposure to radiation.
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood instead of through your lungs.
But you're talking about really radical redesigns, and one of the interesting things that's happened in the last decade is we've discovered a whole lot of planets out there.
And some of them may be Earth-like.
The problem is, if we ever want to get to these planets, the fastest human objects -- Juno and Voyager and the rest of this stuff -- take tens of thousands of years to get from here to the nearest solar system.
So if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else, or you want to see two-sun sunsets, then you're talking about something that is very different, because you have to change the timescale and the body of humans in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable.
And that's a Life Four civilization.
Now, we can't even begin to imagine what that might look like, but we're beginning to get glimpses of instruments that might take us even that far.
And let me give you two examples.
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg, and one of the things that Floyd's been doing is he's been playing with the basic chemistry of life.
So all life on this planet is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.
All bacteria, all plants, all animals, all humans, all cows, everything else.
And what Floyd did is he changed out two of those base pairs, so it's ATXY.
And that means that you now have a parallel system to make life, to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve, that doesn't mate with most things on Earth or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.
Maybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria. Maybe you make plants that are immune to all viruses.
But why is that so interesting?
It means that we are not a unique solution.
It means you can create alternate chemistries to us that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet that could create life and heredity.
The second experiment, or the other implication of this experiment, is that all of you, all life is based on 20 amino acids.
If you don't substitute two amino acids, if you don't say ATXY, if you say ATCG + XY, then you go from 20 building blocks to 172, and all of a sudden you've got 172 building blocks of amino acids to build life-forms in very different shapes.
The second experiment to think about is a really weird experiment that's been taking place in China.
Right? So this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads. And why is that an interesting experiment?
Well, think of the first heart transplants.
One of the things they used to do is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor so the donee could tell the doctors, "Do you recognize this person? Do you love this person? Do you feel anything for this person?" We laugh about that today.
We laugh because we know the heart is a muscle, but for hundreds of thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years, "I gave her my heart. She took my heart.
She broke my heart. "We thought this was emotion and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart. Nope.
So how about the brain?
Two possible outcomes to this experiment.
If you can get a mouse that is functional, then you can see, is the new brain a blank slate?
And boy, does that have implications.
Second option: the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.
The new mouse remembers what it's afraid of, remembers how to navigate the maze, and if that is true, then you can transplant memory and consciousness.
And then the really interesting question is, if you can transplant this, is the only input-output mechanism this down here?
Or could you transplant that consciousness into something that would be very different, that would last in space, that would last tens of thousands of years, that would be a completely redesigned body that could hold consciousness for a long, long period of time?
And let's come back to the first question: Why would you ever want to do that?
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because this is the ultimate selfie.
(Laughter)
This is taken from six billion miles away, and that's Earth.
And that's all of us.
And if that little thing goes, all of humanity goes.
And the reason you want to alter the human body is because you eventually want a picture that says, that's us, and that's us, and that's us, because that's the way humanity survives long-term extinction.
And that's the reason why it turns out it's actually unethical not to evolve the human body even though it can be scary, even though it can be challenging, but it's what's going to allow us to explore, live and get to places we can't even dream of today, but which our great-great-great-great- grandchildren might someday.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's easy to forget that last night, one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity. One billion people. Two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels or clean heating fuels.
Those are the problems in the developing world.
And it's easy for us not to be empathetic with those people who seem so distanced from us.
But even in our own world, the developed world, we see the tension of stagnant economies impacting the lives of people around us.
We see it in whole pieces of the economy, where the people involved have lost hope about the future and despair about the present.
We see that in the Brexit vote.
We see that in the Sanders / Trump campaigns in my own country.
But even in countries as recently turning the corner towards being in the developed world, in China, we see the difficulty that President Xi has as he begins to un-employ so many people in his coal and mining industries who see no future for themselves.
As we as a society figure out how to manage the problems of the developed world and the problems of the developing world, we have to look at how we move forward and manage the environmental impact of those decisions.
We've been working on this problem for 25 years, since Rio, the Kyoto Protocols.
Our most recent move is the Paris treaty, and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world.
I think we can be very hopeful that those agreements, which are bottom-up agreements, where nations have said what they think they can do, are genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties.
The unfortunate thing is that now, as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield, the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear.
This is the United States Energy Information Agency's assessment of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments that they've made in Paris between now and 2040.
It shows basically CO2 emissions around the world over the next 30 years.
There are three things that you need to look at and appreciate.
One, CO2 emissions are expected to continue to grow for the next 30 years.
In order to control climate, CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero because it's the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet.
This should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels.
The second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries, from China, from India, from the rest of the world, which includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil, as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world.
The final thing that you should notice is that each year, about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet's atmosphere, and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land.
That's on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today.
At the end of 30 years, we will have put 850 gigatons of carbon into the air, and that probably goes a long way towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean surface temperatures, locking in ocean acidification and locking in sea level rise.
Now, this is a projection made by men by the actions of society, and it's ours to change, not to accept.
But the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate.
Different nations make different energy choices.
It's a function of their natural resources.
It's a function of their climate.
It's a function of the development path that they've followed as a society.
It's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are.
Are they where it's dark a lot of the time, or are they at the mid-latitudes?
Many, many, many things go into the choices of countries, and they each make a different choice.
The overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that China has made.
China has made the choice, and will make the choice, to run on coal.
The United States has an alternative.
It can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas, which we have here.
They provide an alternative.
The OECD Europe has a choice.
It has renewables that it can afford to deploy in Germany because it's rich enough to afford to do it.
The French and the British show interest in nuclear power.
Eastern Europe, still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal, and with natural gas that comes from Russia, with all of its entanglements.
China has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe.
If you look at China, and you ask yourself why has coal been important to it, you have to remember what China's done.
China brought people to power, not power to people.
It didn't do rural electrification. It urbanized. It urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy, creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth.
If we look at China's path, all of us know that prosperity in China has dramatically increased.
In 1980, 80 percent of China's population lived below the extreme poverty level, below the level of having $1.90 per person per day.
By the year 2000, only 20 percent of China's population lived below the extreme poverty level — a remarkable feat, admittedly, with some costs in civil liberties that would be tough to accept in the Western world.
But the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get massively better nutrition.
It allowed water pipes to be placed.
It allowed sewage pipes to be placed, dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases, at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.
But in 1980, and even today, the number one killer in China is indoor air pollution, because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels.
In fact, in 2040, it's still estimated that 200 million people in China will not have access to clean cooking fuels.
They have a remarkable path to follow.
India also needs to meet the needs of its own people, and it's going to do that by burning coal.
When we look at the EIA's projections of coal burning in India, India will supply nearly four times as much of its energy from coal as it will from renewables.
It's not because they don't know the alternatives; it's because rich countries can do what they choose, poor countries do what they must.
So what can we do to stop coal's emissions in time?
What can we do that changes this forecast that's in front of us?
Because it's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it.
First of all, we have to think about the magnitude of the problem.
Between now and 2040, 800 to 1,600 new coal plants are going to be built around the world.
This week, between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants are being turned on around the world.
That's happening regardless of what we want, because the people that rule their countries, assessing the interests of their citizens, have decided it's in the interest of their citizens to do that.
And that's going to happen unless they have a better alternative.
And every 100 of those plants will use up between one percent and three percent of the Earth's climate budget.
So every day that you go home thinking that you should do something about global warming, at the end of that week, remember: somebody fired up a coal plant that's going to run for 50 years and take away your ability to change it.
What we've forgotten is something that Vinod Khosla used to talk about, a man of Indian ethnicity but an American venture capitalist.
And he said, back in the early 2000s, that if you needed to get China and India off of fossil fuels, you had to create a technology that passed the "Chindia test," "Chindia" being the appending of the two words.
It had to be first of all viable, meaning that technically, they could implement it in their country, and that it would be accepted by the people in the country.
Two, it had to be a technology that was scalable, that it could deliver the same benefits on the same timetable as fossil fuels, so that they can enjoy the kind of life, again, that we take for granted.
And third, it had to be cost-effective without subsidy or without mandate.
It had to stand on its own two feet; it could not be maintained for that many people if in fact, those countries had to go begging or had some foreign country say, "I won't trade with you," in order to get the technology shift to occur.
If you look at the Chindia test, we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test.
That's what the EIA forecast tells us.
China's building 800 gigawatts of coal, 400 gigawatts of hydro, about 200 gigawatts of nuclear, and on an energy-equivalent basis, adjusting for intermittency, about 100 gigawatts of renewables.
800 gigawatts of coal.
They're doing that, knowing the costs better than any other country, knowing the need better than any other country.
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040 unless we give them a better choice.
To give them a better choice, it's going to have to meet the Chindia test.
If you look at all the alternatives that are out there, there are really two that come near to meeting it.
First is this area of new nuclear that I'll talk about in just a second.
It's a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards around the world, and the people who are developing these say we can get them in position to demo by 2025 and to scale by 2030, if you will just let us.
The second alternative that could be there in time is utility-scale solar backed up with natural gas, which we can use today, versus the batteries which are still under development.
So what's holding new nuclear back?
Outdated regulations and yesterday's mindsets.
We have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health to think how we communicate with the public and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors.
We have new scientific knowledge that we need to use in order to improve the way we regulate nuclear industry.
The second thing is we've got a mindset that it takes 25 years and 2 to 5 billion dollars to develop a nuclear power plant.
That comes from the historical, military mindset of the places nuclear power came from.
These new nuclear ventures are saying that they can deliver power for 5 cents a kilowatt hour; they can deliver it for 100 gigawatts a year; they can demo it by 2025; and they can deliver it in scale by 2030, if only we give them a chance.
Right now, we're basically waiting for a miracle.
What we need is a choice.
If they can't make it safe, if they can't make it cheap, it should not be deployed.
But what I want you to do is not carry an idea forward, but write your leaders, write the head of the NGOs you support, and tell them to give you the choice, not the past.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter important for the US right now and in the world?
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter is our call to action.
It is a tool to reimagine a world where black people are free to exist, free to live.
It is a tool for our allies to show up differently for us.
I grew up in a neighborhood that was heavily policed.
I witnessed my brothers and my siblings continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement.
I remember my home being raided.
And one of my questions as a child was, why? Why us? Black Lives Matter offers answers to the why.
It offers a new vision for young black girls around the world that we deserve to be fought for, that we deserve to call on local governments to show up for us.
Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism --
(Applause)
And antiblack racism is not only happening in the United States.
It's actually happening all across the globe.
And what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement that challenges systemic racism in every single context.
(Applause)
We need this because the global reality is that black people are subject to all sorts of disparities in most of our most challenging issues of our day.
I think about issues like climate change, and how six of the 10 worst impacted nations by climate change are actually on the continent of Africa.
People are reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters, displacing them from their ancestral homes and leaving them without a chance at making a decent living.
We also see disasters like Hurricane Matthew, which recently wreaked havoc in many different nations, but caused the most damage to Haiti.
Haiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere, and its inhabitants are black people.
And what we're seeing in Haiti is that they were actually facing a number of challenges that even preceded this hurricane.
They were reeling from the earthquake, they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by UN peacekeepers and still hasn't been eradicated. This is unconscionable. And this would not happen if this nation didn't have a population that was black, and we have to be real about that.
But what's most heartening right now is that despite these challenges, what we're seeing is that there's a network of Africans all across the continent who are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice.
MB: So Alicia, you've said that when black people are free, everyone is free.
Can you talk about what that means?
Alicia Garza: Sure. So I think race and racism is probably the most studied social, economic and political phenomenon in this country, but it's also the least understood.
The reality is that race in the United States operates on a spectrum from black to white.
Doesn't mean that people who are in between don't experience racism, but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum, the better off you are.
And the closer to black that you are on that spectrum the worse off your are.
When we think about how we address problems in this country, we often start from a place of trickle-down justice.
So using white folks as the control we say, well, if we make things better for white folks then everybody else is going to get free.
But actually it doesn't work that way.
We have to address problems at the root, and when you deal with what's happening in black communities, it creates an effervescence, right?
So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.
Let me give an example.
When we talk about the wage gap, we often say women make 78 cents to every dollar that a man makes.
You all have heard that before.
But those are the statistics for white women and white men.
The reality is that black women make something like 64 cents to every 78 cents that white women make.
When we talk about latinas, it goes down to about 58 cents.
If we were to talk about indigenous women, if we were to talk about trans women, it would even go further down.
So again, if you deal with those who are the most impacted, everybody has an opportunity to benefit from that, rather than dealing with the folks who are not as impacted, and expecting it to trickle down.
MB: So I love the effervescence, bubbling up.
AG: Effervescence -- like champagne.
MB: Who doesn't love a glass of champagne, right?
Champagne and freedom, right?
(Laughter)
What more could we want, y'all?
So you all have been doing this for a minute, and the last few years have been -- well, I can't even imagine, but I'm sure very transformative.
And I know that you all have learned a lot about leadership.
What do you want to share with these people about what you've learned about leadership?
Patrisse, let's start with you.
PC: Yeah, we have to invest in black leadership.
That's what I've learned the most in the last few years.
(Applause)
What we've seen is thousands of black people showing up for our lives with very little infrastructure and very little support.
I think our work as movement leaders isn't just about our own visibility but rather how do we make the whole visible.
How do we not just fight for our individual selves but fight for everybody?
And I also think leadership looks like everybody in this audience showing up for black lives.
It's not just about coming and watching people on a stage, right?
It's about how do you become that leader -- whether it's in your workplace, whether it's in your home -- and believe that the movement for black lives isn't just for us, but it's for everybody.
(Applause)
MB: What about you, Opal?
OT: So I've been learning a great deal about interdependence.
I've been learning about how to trust your team.
I've come up with this new mantra after coming back from a three-month sabbatical, which is rare for black women to take who are in leadership, but I felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team to also practice stepping back as well as also sometimes stepping in.
And what I learned in this process was that we need to acknowledge that different people contribute different strengths, and that in order for our entire team to flourish, we have to allow them to share and allow them to shine.
And so during my sabbatical with the organization that I also work with, I saw our team rise up in my absence.
They were able to launch new programs, fundraise.
And when I came back, I had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back and that they truly had their own backs.
You know, in this process of my sabbatical, I was really reminded of this Southern African philosophy of Ubuntu.
I am because you are; you are because I am.
And I realized that my own leadership, and the contributions that I'm able to make, is in large part due to the contributions that they make, right?
And I have to acknowledge that, and I have to see that, and so my new mantra is, "Keep calm and trust the team." And also, "Keep calm and thank the team."
MB: You know, one of the things I feel like I've heard in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement more than anywhere else is about being a leaderful movement, and that's such a beautiful concept, and I think that something that women often bring to the conversation about leadership is really the collective piece.
What about you, Alicia?
AG: Yeah ... How many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely?
I think that there is an element where leadership is lonely, but I also believe that it doesn't have to be like that.
And in order for us to get to that point, I think there's a few things that we need to be doing.
So one is we have to stop treating leaders like superheroes.
We are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things, and so we need to be supported in that way.
The other thing that I've learned about leadership is that there's a difference between leadership and celebrities, right?
And there's a way in which we've been kind of transformed into celebrities rather than people who are trying to solve a problem.
And the way that we treat celebrities is very fickle, right?
We like them one day, we don't like what they're wearing the next day, and all of a sudden we have issues, right?
So we need to stop deifying leaders so that more people will step into leadership.
Lots of people are terrified to step into leadership because of how much scrutiny they receive and how brutal we are with leaders.
And then the last thing that I've learned about leadership is that it's really easy to be a leader when everybody likes you.
But it's hard to be a leader when you have to make hard choices and when you have to do what's right, even though people are not going to like you for it.
And so in that way, I think another way that we can support leaders is to struggle with us, but struggle with us politically, not personally.
We can have disagreements without being disagreeable, but it's important for us to sharpen each other so that we all can rise.
MB: That's beautiful, thank you.
So you all are doing work that forces you to face some brutal, painful realities on a daily basis.
What gives you hope and inspires you in that context?
PC: I am hopeful for black futures.
And I say that because we live in a society that's so obsessed with black death.
We have images of our death on the TV screen, on our Twitter timelines, on our Facebook timelines, but what if instead we imagine black life?
We imagine black people living and thriving.
And that -- that inspires me.
OT: What inspires me these days are immigrants.
Immigrants all over the world who are doing the best that they can to make a living, to survive and also to thrive.
Right now there are over 244 million people who aren't living in their country of origin.
This is a 40 percent increase since the year 2000.
So what this tells me is that the disparities across the globe are only getting worse.
Yet there are people who are finding the strength and wherewithal to travel, to move, to eke out a better living for themselves and to provide for their families and their loved ones.
And some of these people who are immigrants are also undocumented. They're unauthorized. And they inspire me even more because although our society is telling them, you're not wanted, you're not needed here, and they're highly vulnerable and subject to abuse, to wage theft, to exploitation and xenophobic attacks, many of them are also beginning to organize in their communities.
And what I'm seeing is that there's also an emerging network of black, undocumented people who are resisting the framework, and resisting the criminalization of their existence.
And that to me is incredibly powerful and inspires me every singe day.
MB: Thank you. Alicia?
AG: So we know that young people are the present and the future, but what inspires me are older people who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement.
We all know that as you get older, you get a little more entrenched in your ways.
It's happening to me, I know that's right.
But I'm so inspired when I see people who have a way that they do things, have a way that they think about the world, and they're courageous enough to be open to listening to what the experiences are of so many of us who want to live in world that's just and want to live in a world that's equitable.
And I'm also inspired by the actions that I'm seeing older people taking in service of this movement.
I'm inspired by seeing older people step into their own power and leadership and say, "I'm not passing a torch, I'm helping you light the fire."
(Applause)
MB: I love that -- yes.
So in terms of action, I think that it is awesome to sit here and be able to listen to you all, and to have our minds open and shift, but that's not going to get black people free.
So if you had one thing you would like this audience and the folks who are watching around the world to actually do, what would that be?
AG: OK, two quick ones.
One, call the White House.
The water protectors are being forcibly removed from the camp that they have set up to defend what keeps us alive.
And that is intricately related to black lives.
So definitely call the White House and demand that they stop doing that.
There are tanks and police officers arresting every single person there as we speak.
(Applause)
The second thing that you can do is to join something.
Be a part of something.
There are groups, collectives -- doesn't have to be a non-profit, you know what I mean?
But there are groups that are doing work in our communities right now to make sure that black lives matter so all lives matter.
Get involved; don't sit on your couch and tell people what you think they should be doing.
Go do it with us.
MB: Do you guys want to add anything? That's good? All right. So -- And I think that the joining something, like if you feel like there's not something where you are, start it.
AG: Start it.
MB: These conversations that we're having, have those conversations with somebody else.
And then instead of just letting it be a talk that you had, actually decide to start something.
OT: That's right.
MB: I mean, that's what you all did. You started something, and look what's happened.
Thank you all so much for being here with us today.
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation was on Facebook, and it was three days long.
(Laughter)
We shared over 3,000 messages between us, and it was during those 72 hours that I knew she was going to be my wife.
We didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship; we told each other the vulnerable truths up front: I am a transgender man, which means the F on my birth certificate should have stood for "False," instead of "Female."
(Laughter)
Walking around as a woman in the world felt like walking with pebbles in my shoes.
It took the rhythm out of my swagger, it threw me off balance, it pained me with every step I took forward.
But today I'm a man of my own intention; a man of my own design.
Kim Katrin Milan: I am a cisgender queer woman.
Cisgender means the gender I was assigned at birth is still and has always been female.
This doesn't make me natural or normal, this is just one way of describing the many different ways that we exist in this world.
And queer is a cultural term, but in this case, it refers to the way that I'm not restricted by gender when it comes to choosing partners.
I've identified in a few different ways -- as a bisexual, as a lesbian -- but for me, queerness encompasses all of the layers of who I am and how I've loved.
I'm layers, and not fractions.
And for me, the fact that he was queer meant that I could trust his courtship from the very beginning.
As queer and trans people, we're so often excluded from institutions and traditions.
We create spaces outside of convention, including the conventions of time.
And in those 3,000 messages between us, we collapsed time; we queered it; we laid it all on the table.
(Laughter)
With no pretense at all. And this meant that we were able to commit to each other in a profoundly different way.
So often what we're told is this idea of the "Golden Rule," that we should treat other people the way we want to be treated.
But the problem with that is that it assumes that we are the standard for other people, and we're not.
We need to treat other people the way they want to be treated, which means we had to ask.
I couldn't assume that the kind of love that Tiq needed was the same kind of love that I needed.
So I asked him everything -- about his fears, his insecurities -- and we started from there.
TM: I didn't know what kind of love I needed.
I had just come out of a year-long fog of being rejected and utterly depleted.
I had someone look me in my eyes and tell me that I was unworthy of their love because I was trans.
And there's a culture of lovelessness that we've created around transgender people.
It's reasoned, justified and often signed into law.
And I was a heartbeat away from internalizing that message, that I wasn't worthy.
But Kim said that I was her ideal -- the heartbroken mess that I was.
KKM: He totally was my ideal.
(Laughter)
In more ways than one. Both poets, writers, creatives with a long history of community work behind us, and big, huge dreams of a family in front of us, we shared a lot of things in common, but we were also incredibly different.
I've been a lifelong traveler and a bit of an orphan, whereas he comes from a huge family, and definitely stays grounded.
I often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths by saying, "Keep me safe, and I'll keep you wild."
(Laughter)
TM: We have marginalized identities but we don't live marginalized lives.
Being queer and trans is about creating new ways of existing.
It's about loving people as they are, not as they're supposed to be.
Kim is unapologetically feminine in a world that is often cruel and violent to women who are too proud and too freeing.
And I didn't enter into this union under the auspices that she was going to be my helper or my rib, but a fully complex --
(Laughter)
KKM: Right? That's not right.
TM: But a fully complex human being whose femininity wasn't for me to rein in, control or critique.
It's her brilliance, the way she leads with compassion, and how she never loses sight of her empathy.
She has been my hero since day one.
(Applause)
KKM: Our relationship has always been about setting each other free.
One of the first questions I asked him was what dreams he had left to accomplish, and how would I help him get there.
His dreams to live as a poet, to adopt and raise a family together, to live a life that he was proud of, and one that would live up to his mother's incredible legacy.
And I really appreciated that we were able to start from that place, and not from a place that was around figuring out how to make each other work together.
And I think this really allowed us to grow into the people that we were in a way that was incredibly different.
I love him whole; pre-transition, now and in the future.
And it's this love that had us committed to each other before we'd even seen each other's faces.
TM: My mother's biggest concern when I transitioned was who was going to love me as I am.
Had being transgender somehow precluded me from love and monogamy because I was supposedly born in the wrong body?
But it's this type of structuring that has to be reframed in order to let love in.
My body never betrayed me, and my body was never wrong.
It's this restrictive, binary thinking on gender that said that I didn't exist.
But when we met, she loved me for exactly how I showed up.
She would trace her fingers along the numb keloid scars left by my top surgery.
Scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso.
She said that these were reminders of my strength and everything that I went through and nothing for me to be ashamed of.
So sprinting towards her hand in marriage was the queerest thing that I could do.
(Laughter)
It flew in the face of more conventional trajectories of love and relationships, because God was never supposed to bless a union for folks like us, and the law was never supposed to recognize it.
KKM: So on May 5, 2014, just about three months after meeting online, we were married on the steps of City Hall in Manhattan, and it was beautiful in every conceivable way.
It's safe to say that we reimagined some traditions, but we also kept some old ones that we worked in, and we created something that worked for us.
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled with wildflowers from Brooklyn -- also added in a little bit of lavender and sage to keep us grounded because we were so nervous.
And it was put together by a sweet sister healer friend of ours.
I never wanted a diamond ring, because conflict and convention are not my thing, so my ring is the deepest purple, like the color of my crown chakra, and set in place with my birthstones.
The gift of queerness is options.
I never had to choose his last name, it was never an exception, but I did because I am my father's bastard child, someone who has always been an apology, a secret, an imposition.
And it was incredibly freeing to choose the name of a man who chose me first.
(Applause)
TM: So we told some family and some close friends, many of whom were still in disbelief as we took our vows.
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding photos on Facebook, where we met -- and Instagram, of course.
And we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people, but was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are -- for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness.
KKM: And the thing is, absolutely we are marginalized because of our identities, but it also emboldens us to be the people that we are.
Queerness is our major key; blackness is our magic.
It's because of these things that we are able to be hopeful, open, receptive and shape-shifting.
These are the things that give us, and are such an incredible source of, our strength.
Our queerness is a source of that strength.
I think of the words of Ottawa-based poet Brandon Wint: "Not queer like gay; queer like escaping definition.
Queer like some sort of fluidity and limitlessness all at once.
Queer like a freedom too strange to be conquered.
Queer like the fearlessness to imagine what love can look like, and to pursue it."
TM: We are part of a community of folks -- Yeah, that's good right?
(Laughter)
We are part of a community of folks who are living their authentic selves all along the gender spectrum, despite the ubiquitous threat of violence, despite the undercurrent of anxiety that always is present for people who live on their own terms.
Globally, a transgender person is murdered every 21 hours.
And the United States has had more trans murders on record this year than any year to date.
However, our stories are much more than this rigid dichotomy of strength and resilience.
We are expanding the human complexity on these margins, and we are creating freedom on these margins.
KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.
We're creating a world that we have literally never seen before; organizing families based on love and not by blood, guiding by a compassion that so few of us have been shown ourselves.
So many of us have not received love from our families -- have been betrayed by the people that we trust most.
So what we do here is we create entirely new languages of love.
Ones that are about creating the space for us to be our authentic selves and not imposing this standard of what masculinity or femininity is supposed to be.
TM: We are interested in love and inclusion as a tool of revolutionary change, right?
And the idea is simply, if we drop all our preconceived notions about how somebody is supposed to be -- in their body, in their gender, in their skin -- if we take the intentional steps to unlearn these deep-seated biases and create space for people to be self-determined, and embrace who they are, then we will definitely create a better world than the one we were born into.
(Applause)
KKM: We want to mark this time in history by leaving evidence of the fact that we were here.
We open up little windows into our relationship for our community to bear witness, and we do this because we want to make maps to the future and not monuments to ourselves.
Our experience does not invalidate other peoples' experience, but it should and necessarily does complicate this idea of what love and marriage are supposed to be.
TM: OK, now for all the talking, and inspiring, and possibility-modeling we've done, we've been nowhere near perfect.
And we've had to hold a mirror up to ourselves.
And I saw that I wasn't always the best listener, and that my ego got in the way of our progress as a couple.
And I've had to really assess these deep-seated, sexist ideas that I've had about the value of a woman's experience in the world.
I've had to reevaluate what it means to be in allyship with my wife.
KKM: And I had to remind myself of a lot of things, too. What it means to be hard on the issues, but soft on the person.
While we were writing this, we got into a massive fight.
(Laughter)
For so many different reasons, but based on the content about our values and our lived experiences -- and we were really hurt, you know?
Because what we do and how we love puts ourselves entirely on the line.
But even though the fight lasted over the course of two days --
(Laughter)
We were able to come back together to each other, and recommit to ourselves, to each other and to our marriage.
And that really yielded some of the most passionate parts of what we share with you here today.
TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity, which I think doesn't happen enough.
I've had to interrogate masculinity; the toxic privileges that come with being a man don't define me, but I have to be accountable for how it shows up in my life every day.
I have allowed my wife to do all of the emotional labor of prying open the lines of communication when I'd rather clam up and run away.
(Laughter)
I've stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities, particularly around the heartbreaking miscarriage we suffered last year, and I'm sorry for that.
Sometimes as men, we get to take the easy way out.
And so my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity. About creating a manhood that isn't measured by the power it wields, by the entitlements afforded to it, or any simulacrum of control that it can muster, but works in tandem with femininity, and is guided by my spirit.
KKM: Y'all ...
(Applause)
And this has created the space for my femininity to flourish in a way I had never experienced before.
He never is threatened by my sexuality, he never polices what I wear or how I act.
I cook but he does way more of the cleaning than I do.
And when we're rushing to get out of the house and we have so much to handle, he handles everything, so I have time to do my hair and makeup.
(Laughter)
He understands that this is my armor, and he never treats femininity as though it is frivolous or superficial, and this, and him -- he grows my experience of gender every single day.
TM: I love to watch her get dressed in the morning.
Watching her in the closet, looking for something comfortable and colorful, and tight, and safe --
(Laughter)
But it's challenging to watch her negotiate her decisions looking for something that's going to get the least amount of attention, but at the same time be an expression of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.
And all I want to do is celebrate her for her beauty, and the things that make her beautiful and special and free, from her long acrylic nails, to her uncompromising black feminism.
(Applause)
KKM: I love you.
TM: I love you.
(Laughter)
KKM: There are so many queer and trans people who have come before us, whose stories we will never get to hear.
We constantly experience this retelling of history where we are conspicuously left out.
And it's really hard to not see ourselves there.
And so living out loud for us is about that representation.
It's about having possibility models, and having hope that love is part of our inheritance in this world, too.
TM: The possibility that we are practicing is about reinventing time, love and institutions.
We are creating a future of multiplicity.
We are expanding the spectrum of gender and sexuality, imagining ourselves into existence, imagining a world where gender is self-determined and not imposed, and where who we are is a kaleidoscope of possibility without the narrow-minded limitations masquerading as science or justice.
(Applause)
KKM: And I can't lie: it is really, really hard.
It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry with an open heart and a smile on my face.
It is really hard to face the injustice that exists in the world, while still believing in the ability of people to really change.
That takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication.
And beyond that, marriage is hard work.
(Laughter)
Piles of dirty socks on the floor, more boring sports shows than I ever thought possible --
(Laughter)
And fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we're not speaking the same language.
But there is not a day that goes by where I am not so grateful to be married to this man; where I'm not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds, and rewarding conversations, and creating a world where love belongs to us all.
I think about our acronym: LGBTQ2SIA.
A seemingly endless evolution of self and a community, but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind.
We've learned how to love each other, and we've committed to loving each other throughout changes to gender and changes in spirit.
And we learned this love in our chat rooms, in our clubs, in our bars and in our community centers.
We've learned how to love each other for the long haul.
TM & amp; KKM: Thank you.
(Applause)
This picture is from my metro card when I spent a year abroad in Paris in college in the mid- '90s.
My friend says I look like a French anarchist --
(Laughter)
But this is still what I see when I look in the mirror in the morning.
Within a month of living in Paris, I'd lost 15 pounds and I was in the best shape of my life because I was eating fresh food and I was walking wherever I went.
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta, a region built largely by highways and automobiles and with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl, Paris fundamentally changed the way I understood the construction of the world around me, and I got obsessed with the role of infrastructure -- that it's not just the way to move people from point A to point B, it's not just the way to convey water or sewage or energy, but it's the foundation for our economy.
It's the foundation for our social life and for our culture, and it really matters to the way that we live.
When I came home, I was instantly frustrated, stuck in traffic as I crossed the top end of our perimeter highway.
Not only was I not moving a muscle, I had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me, like me, with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring.
I wondered if this was an inevitable outcome, or could we do something about it.
Was it possible to transform this condition in Atlanta into the kind of place that I wanted to live in?
I went back to grad school in architecture and city planning, developed this interest in infrastructure, and in 1999 came up with an idea for my thesis project: the adaptation of an obsolete loop of old railroad circling downtown as a new infrastructure for urban revitalization.
It was just an idea.
I never thought we would actually build it.
But I went to work at an architecture firm, and eventually talked to my coworkers about it, and they loved the idea.
And as we started talking to more people about it, more people wanted to hear about it.
In the summer of 2001, we connected with Cathy Woolard, who was soon elected city council president.
And we built a citywide vision around this idea: the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop of transit and trails and transformation.
I was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years, and so was Cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers.
Together, we built this amazing movement of people and ideas.
It included community advocates who were used to fighting against things, but found the Atlanta BeltLine as something that they could fight for; developers who saw the opportunity to take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city; and dozens of nonprofit partners who saw their mission at least partly accomplished by the shared vision.
Now, usually these groups of people aren't at the same table wanting the same outcome.
But there we were, and it was kind of weird, but it was really, really powerful.
The people of Atlanta fell in love with a vision that was better than what they saw through their car windshields, and the people of Atlanta made it happen, and I guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise.
From the beginning, our coalition was diverse.
People of all stripes were part of our story.
People on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it, too.
They were just afraid they weren't going to be able to be there when it got built, that they'd be priced out.
And we've all heard that kind of story before, right?
But we promised that the Atlanta BeltLine would be different, and people took ownership of the idea, and they made it better than anything we ever imagined in the beginning, including significant subsidies for housing, new parks, art, an arboretum -- a list that continues to grow.
And we put in place the organizations and agencies that were required to make it happen.
And importantly, it is.
Now we're in the early stages of implementation, and it's working.
The first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012, and it's already generated over three billion dollars of private-sector investment.
But it's not only changing the physical form of the city, it's changing the way we think about the city, and what our expectations are for living there.
About a month ago, I had to take my kids with me to the grocery store and they were complaining about it, because they didn't want to get in the car.
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go, can we at least ride our bikes?" And I said, "Of course we can.
That's what people in Atlanta do.
We ride our bikes to the grocery store."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you, yeah.
Now, they don't know how ridiculous that is, but I do.
And I also understand that their expectations for Atlanta are really powerful.
This kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl in the last century, the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles fundamentally changed American life.
That wasn't some grand conspiracy.
There were conspiracies within it, of course.
But it was a cultural momentum.
It was millions of people making millions of decisions over an extended period of time, that fundamentally changed not only the way that we build cities, but it changed our expectations for our lives.
These changes were the foundations for urban sprawl.
We didn't call it sprawl at that time.
We called it the future. And it was. And we got all the highways and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.
It was a radical transformation, but it was built by a cultural momentum.
So it's important to not separate the physical construction of the places we live from other things that are happening at that time.
At that time, in the second half of the last century, science was curing disease and lifting us to the moon, and the sexual revolution was breaking down barriers, and the Civil Rights Movement began its march toward the fulfillment of our nation's promise.
Television, entertainment, food, travel, business -- everything was changing, and both the public and private sectors were colluding to give us the lives we wanted.
The Federal Highway Administration, for example, didn't exist before there were highways. Think about it.
(Laughter)
Of course, today it's important to understand and acknowledge that those benefits accrued to some groups of people and not to others.
It was not an equitable cultural momentum.
But when we look today in wonder and disgust, maybe, at the metropolis sprawl before us, we wonder if we're stuck.
Are we stuck with the legacy of that inequity?
Are we stuck with this dystopian traffic hellscape?
Are we stuck with rampant urban displacement, with environmental degradation?
Are we stuck with social isolation or political polarization?
Are these the inevitable and permanent outcomes?
Or are they the result of our collective cultural decisions that we've made for ourselves?
And if they are, can't we change them?
What I have learned from our experience in Atlanta is not an anomaly.
Similar stories are playing out everywhere, where people are reclaiming not only old railroads, but also degraded urban waterways and obsolete roadways, reinventing all of the infrastructure in their lives.
Whether here in New York or in Houston or Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto and Paris, cities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing this infrastructure for themselves, including the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects, the Los Angeles River, the revitalization effort for which similarly started as a grassroots movement, has developed into a cultural momentum, and is now in the early stages of being transformed into some kind of life-affirming infrastructure again, this one with trails and parks and fishing and boating and community revitalization, and of course, water quality and flood control.
It's already improving the lives of people.
It's already changing the way the rest of us think about Los Angeles.
This is more than just infrastructure.
We're building new lives for ourselves.
It's a movement that includes local food, urban agriculture, craft beer, the maker movement, tech and design -- all of these things, early indicators of a really radical shift in the way we build cities.
We're taking places like this and transforming them into this. And soon this.
And this is all exciting and good.
We're changing the world for the better. Good for us! And it is awesome -- I mean that.
But our history of sprawl, and from what we can already see with these catalyst projects today, we know and must remember that big changes like this don't usually benefit everyone.
The market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum often include the seemingly unstoppable and inevitable cycle of rising taxes, prices and rents.
This is urgent. If we care, we have to stand up and speak out.
This should be a call to action, because the answer can't be to not improve communities. The answer can't be to not build parks and transit and grocery stores.
The answer can't be to hold communities down just to keep them affordable.
But we do have to follow through and address the financial realities that we're facing.
This is hard, and it won't happen on its own.
We can do it, and I'm committed to this goal in Atlanta, to sticking up again for people who made it possible in the first place.
We can't call it a success without them.
I certainly can't, because the people I made commitments to all those years weren't abstract populations.
They're my friends and neighbors. They're people that I love.
So even though it started as my graduate thesis and I'm working hard for 16 years with thousands of people to help make this thing come to life, I know and believe that who the BeltLine is being built for is just as important as whether it's built at all.
Not just in Atlanta, but locally and globally, we have to understand this accountability to the people whose lives we are changing, because this is us.
We are the lives we're talking about.
These places aren't inevitable.
The places we live aren't inevitable, and if we want something different, we just need to speak up.
We have to ensure that change comes on our terms.
And to do that, we have to participate actively in the process of shaping change.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 1987, Tina Lord found herself in quite the pickle.
See, this gold digger made sure she married sweet Cord Roberts just before he inherited millions.
But when Cord found out Tina loved his money as much as she loved him, he dumped her.
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled until they hooked up again.
So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina and then made sure Cord didn't find out Tina was pregnant with his baby.
So Tina, still married but thinking Cord didn't love her flew to Argentina with Max.
Cord finally figured out what was going on and rushed after them, but he was too late.
Tina had already been kidnapped, strapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall.
She and her baby were presumed dead.
Cord was sad for a bit, but then he bounced right back with a supersmart archaeologist named Kate, and they had a gorgeous wedding until Tina, seemingly back from the dead, ran into the church holding a baby. "Stop!" she screamed. "Am I too late?
Cord, I've come so far.
This is your son."
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the soap opera "One Life to Live" introduced a love story that lasted 25 years.
(Laughter)
Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera, you know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated, larger than life, and if you're a fan, you find that exaggeration fun, and if you're not, maybe you find them melodramatic or unsophisticated.
Maybe you think watching soap operas is a waste of time, that their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent.
But I believe the opposite to be true.
Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.
So there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas, and those lessons are as big and adventurous as any soap opera storyline.
Now, I've been a fan since I ran home from the bus stop in second grade desperate to catch the end of Luke and Laura's wedding, the biggest moment in "General Hospital" history.
(Applause)
So you can imagine how much I loved my eight years as the assistant casting director on "As the World Turns." My job was watching soap operas, reading soap opera scripts and auditioning actors to be on soap operas.
So I know my stuff.
(Laughter)
And yes, soap operas are larger than life, drama on a grand scale, but our lives can be filled with as much intensity, and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.
We cycle through tragedy and joy just like these characters.
We cross thresholds, fight demons and find salvation unexpectedly, and we do it again and again and again, but just like soaps, we can flip the script, which means we can learn from these characters that move like bumblebees, looping and swerving through life.
And we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories.
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt and believe in our capacity for bravery, vulnerability, adaptability and resilience.
And most importantly, they show us it's never too late to change your story.
So with that, let's start with soap opera lesson one: surrender is not an option.
(Laughter)
"All My Children" 's Erica Kane was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara, a hyperbolically self-important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring.
Now, in her 41 years on TV, perhaps Erica's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.
She screamed at the bear, "You may not do this! Do you understand me? You may not come near me!
I am Erica Kane and you are a filthy beast!"
(Laughter)
And of course the bear left, so what that teaches us is obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight.
Pandora's Tim Westergren knows this better than most.
You might even call him the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.
Tim and his cofounders launched the company with two million dollars in funding.
They were out of cash the next year.
Now, lots of companies fold at that point, but Tim chose to fight.
He maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn't enough.
So every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees and he asked them to sacrifice their salaries, and it worked.
More than 50 people deferred two million dollars, and now, more than a decade later, Pandora is worth billions.
When you believe that there is a way around or through whatever is in front of you, that surrender is not an option, you can overcome enormous obstacles.
Which brings us to soap opera lesson two: sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex.
Now, this is scary. It's an acknowledgment of need or fallibility.
Maybe it's even an admission that we're not as special as we might like to think.
Stephanie Forrester of "The Bold and the Beautiful" thought she was pretty darn special.
She thought she was so special, she didn't need to mix with the riffraff from the valley, and she made sure valley girl Brooke knew it.
But after nearly 25 years of epic fighting, Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.
They made amends, archenemies became soul mates and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms, and here's our takeaway. Drop your ego. Life is not about you.
It's about us, and our ability to experience joy and love and to improve our reality comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable and we accept responsibility for our actions and our inactions, kind of like Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks.
Now, after a great run as CEO, Howard stepped down in 2000, and Starbucks quickly overextended itself and stock prices fell.
Howard rejoined the team in 2008, and one of the first things he did was apologize to all 180,000 employees. He apologized. And then he asked for help, honesty, and ideas in return.
And now, Starbucks has more than doubled its net revenue since Howard came back.
So sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time.
It's not helping anyone, least of all you. Sacrifice your ego.
Soap opera lesson three: evolution is real.
You're not meant to be static characters.
On television, static equals boring and boring equals fired.
Characters are supposed to grow and change.
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions, particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today.
Recasting happens all the time on soaps.
Over the last 20 years, four different actors have played the same key role of Carly Benson on "General Hospital." Each new face triggered a change in the character's life and personality.
Now, there was always an essential nugget of Carly in there, but the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her.
And here's what that means for us.
While we may not swap faces in our own lives, we can evolve too.
We can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot, or we can open ourselves to opportunities like Carly, who went from nursing student to hotel owner, or like Julia Child.
Julia was a World War II spy, and when the war ended, she got married, moved to France, and decided to give culinary school a shot.
Julia, her books and her TV shows revolutionized the way America cooks.
We all have the power to initiate change in our lives, to evolve and adapt.
We make the choice, but sometimes life chooses for us, and we don't get a heads up.
Surprise slams us in the face.
You're flat on the ground, the air is gone, and you need resuscitation.
So thank goodness for soap opera lesson four: resurrection is possible.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"' Stefano DiMera died of a stroke, but not really, because in 1984 he died when his car plunged into the harbor, and yet he was back in 1985 with a brain tumor.
(Laughter)
But before the tumor could kill him, Marlena shot him, and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death.
And so it went for 30 years.
(Laughter)
Even when we saw the body, we knew better.
And here's what that means for us. He's called the Phoenix for a reason.
As long as the show is still on the air, or you're still breathing, nothing is permanent. Resurrection is possible.
Now, of course, just like life, soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale.
CBS canceled my show, "As The World Turns," in December 2009, and we shot our final episode in June 2010.
It was six months of dying and I rode that train right into the mountain.
And even though we were in the middle of a huge recession and millions of people were struggling to find work, I somehow thought everything would be OK.
So I packed up the kids and the Brooklyn apartment, and we moved in with my in-laws in Alabama.
(Laughter)
Three months later, nothing was OK.
That was when I watched the final episode air, and I realized the show was not the only fatality.
I was one too.
I was unemployed and living on the second floor of my in-laws' home, and that's enough to make anyone feel dead inside.
(Laughter)
But I knew my story wasn't over, that it couldn't be over.
I just had to tap into everything I had ever learned about soap operas.
I had to be brave like Erica and refuse to surrender, so every day, I made a decision to fight.
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie and sacrifice my ego.
I had to ask for help a lot of times across many states.
I had to be adaptable like Carly and evolve my skills, my mindset, and my circumstances, and then I had to be resilient, like Stefano, and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes.
Eventually I got an interview.
After 15 years in news and entertainment, nine months of unemployment and this one interview, I had an offer for an entry level job.
I was 37 years old and I was back from the dead.
We will all experience what looks like an ending, and we can choose to make it a beginning.
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously survived that waterfall, and because I hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging, Tina and Cord did get divorced, but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in 2012.
it's never too late to change your story. So remember, as long as there is breath in your body,
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was six years old, I received my gifts.
My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea.
She wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other.
So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner.
And she said, "Why don't we just stand here and compliment each other?
If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down." What a wonderful idea, right?
What could go wrong?
(Laughter)
Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard someone's name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer.
And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... and three left.
And I was one of them.
And the compliments stopped.
Well, at that moment, I was crying.
And the teacher was freaking out.
She was like, "Hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?"
(Laughter)
"No one? OK, why don't you go get your gift and sit down.
So behave next year — someone might say something nice about you. "
(Laughter)
Well, as I'm describing this you, you probably know I remember this really well.
(Laughter)
But I don't know who felt worse that day.
Was it me or the teacher?
She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds.
And without the humor.
You know, when you see people get roasted on TV, it was funny.
There was nothing funny about that day.
So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid being in that situation again -- to get rejected in public again.
That's one version.
Then fast-forward eight years.
Bill Gates came to my hometown -- Beijing, China -- to speak, and I saw his message.
I fell in love with that guy.
I thought, wow, I know what I want to do now. That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: "By age 25, I will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft."
(Laughter)
I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world -- domination, right?
And I didn't make this up, I did write that letter. And here it is --
(Laughter)
You don't have to read this through --
(Laughter)
This is also bad handwriting, but I did highlight some key words.
You get the idea.
(Laughter)
So... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world.
Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States. I jumped on it, because that was where Bill Gates lived, right?
(Laughter)
I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey.
Then, fast-forward another 14 years. I was 30. Nope, I didn't build that company.
I didn't even start.
I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company.
And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. Why is that? Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter?
It's not because he didn't try.
It's because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work — I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old.
One wanted to conquer the world -- make a difference -- another was afraid of rejection.
And every time that six-year-old won.
And this fear even persisted after I started my own company.
I mean, I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start sooner or later, right?
When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented with an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down.
And that rejection hurt me.
It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there.
But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection? Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that? No way. And this is where it clicked for me.
OK, I can build a better company. I can build a better team or better product, but one thing for sure: I've got to be a better leader.
I've got to be a better person.
I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore.
I have to put him back in his place.
So this is where I went online and looked for help.
Google was my friend.
(Laughter)
I searched, "How do I overcome the fear of rejection?" I came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from.
Then I came up with a bunch of "rah-rah" inspirational articles about "Don't take it personally, just overcome it." Who doesn't know that?
(Laughter)
But why was I still so scared?
Then I found this website by luck. It's called rejectiontherapy.com.
"Rejection Therapy" was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.
His name is Jason Comely.
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain.
And I loved that idea.
(Laughter)
I said, "You know what? I'm going to do this. And I'll feel myself getting rejected 100 days." And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it.
And so here's what I did.
This is what the blog looked like. Day One ...
(Laughter)
Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.
So this is where I went to where I was working.
I came downstairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk.
He looked like a security guard.
So I just approached him.
And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life -- hair on the back of my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding.
And I got there and said, "Hey, sir, can I borrow 100 dollars from you?"
(Laughter)
And he looked up, he's like, "No." "Why?"
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry." Then I turned around, and I just ran.
(Laughter)
I felt so embarrassed. But because I filmed myself -- so that night I was watching myself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was.
I looked like this kid in "The Sixth Sense." I saw dead people.
(Laughter)
But then I saw this guy. You know, he wasn't that menacing.
He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, "Why?" In fact, he invited me to explain myself.
And I could've said many things.
I could've explained, I could've negotiated.
I didn't do any of that.
All I did was run.
I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could.
And you know what?
The next day, no matter what happens, I'm not going to run. I'll stay engaged.
Day Two: Request a "burger refill."
(Laughter)
It's when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch, and I went to the cashier and said, "Hi, can I get a burger refill?"
(Laughter)
He was all confused, like, "What's a burger refill?"
(Laughter)
I said, "Well, it's just like a drink refill but with a burger." And he said, "Sorry, we don't do burger refill, man."
(Laughter)
So this is where rejection happened and I could have run, but I stayed.
I said, "Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more."
(Laughter)
And he said, "Well, OK, I'll tell my manager about it, and maybe we'll do it, but sorry, we can't do this today." Then I left.
And by the way, I don't think they've ever done burger refill.
(Laughter)
I think they're still there.
But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged -- because I didn't run.
I said, "Wow, great, I'm already learning things. Great."
And then Day Three: Getting Olympic Doughnuts.
This is where my life was turned upside down.
I went to a Krispy Kreme.
It's a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States.
I'm sure they have some here, too.
And I went in, I said, "Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols?
Basically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... " I mean there's no way they could say yes, right?
The doughnut maker took me so seriously.
(Laughter)
So she put out paper, started jotting down the colors and the rings, and is like, "How can I make this?" And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings.
And I was so touched.
I just couldn't believe it.
And that video got over five million views on Youtube.
The world couldn't believe that either.
(Laughter)
You know, because of that I was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything.
And I became famous.
A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying, "What you're doing is awesome." But you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me.
What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself.
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project.
I wanted to see what I could learn.
And then I learned a lot of things.
I discovered so many secrets.
For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes," and the magic word is, "why."
So one day I went to a stranger's house, I had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, "Hey, can I plant this flower in your backyard?"
(Laughter)
And he said, "No." But before he could leave I said, "Hey, can I know why?" And he said, "Well, I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard.
I don't want to waste your flower.
If you want to do this, go across the street and talk to Connie.
She loves flowers." So that's what I did.
I went across and knocked on Connie's door.
And she was so happy to see me.
(Laughter)
And then half an hour later, there was this flower in Connie's backyard.
I'm sure it looks better now.
(Laughter)
But had I left after the initial rejection, I would've thought, well, it's because the guy didn't trust me, it's because I was crazy, because I didn't dress up well, I didn't look good. It was none of those.
It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted.
And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral, using a sales term.
I converted a referral.
Then one day -- and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes.
So for example, one day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager, "Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?" He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?" I said, "Do you know those Walmart greeters?
You know, those people who say 'hi' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you don't steal stuff, basically?
I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers."
(Laughter)
Well, I'm not sure that's a good thing, actually -- Actually, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing.
And he was like, "Oh" -- yeah, this is how he looked, his name is Eric -- and he was like, "I'm not sure." This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure." Then I ask him, "Is that weird?" He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man." But as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed.
It's as if he's putting all the doubt on the floor.
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this, just don't get too weird."
(Laughter)
So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter.
I said "hi" to every customer that walked in, and gave them holiday cheers.
By the way, I don't know what your career trajectory is, don't be a greeter.
(Laughter)
It was really boring. But then I found I could do this because I mentioned, "Is that weird?" I mentioned the doubt that he was having.
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?", that means I wasn't weird.
That means I was actually thinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing.
And again, and again, I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust.
People were more likely to say yes to me.
And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ... by asking.
You know, I came from four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, "Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it'd be great if you became a teacher."
(Laughter)
But I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I didn't.
But it has always been my dream to actually teach something.
So I said, "What if I just ask and teach a college class?" I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors' doors and said, "Can I teach your class?" I didn't get anywhere the first couple of times.
But because I didn't run — I kept doing it — and on the third try the professor was very impressed.
He was like, "No one has done this before." And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson.
He said, "Wow, I can use this.
Why don't you come back in two months?
I'll fit you in my curriculum. "And two months later I was teaching a class.
This is me -- you probably can't see, this is a bad picture.
You know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know?
(Laughter)
But wow -- when I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking.
I used to think I have to accomplish all these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur, or get a PhD to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach.
And in that picture, which you can't see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. Why? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world, who change the way we live and the way we think, are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections.
People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ.
These people did not let rejection define them.
They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves.
And they embraced rejection.
And we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman.
It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it.
Then I started embracing it.
I turned that into the biggest gift in my life.
I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities.
I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection.
When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. Don't run. If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Our lives depend on a world we can't see.
Think about your week so far.
Have you watched TV, used GPS, checked the weather or even ate a meal?
These many things that enable our daily lives rely either directly or indirectly on satellites.
And while we often take for granted the services that satellites provide us, the satellites themselves deserve our attention as they are leaving a lasting mark on the space they occupy.
People around the world rely on satellite infrastructure every day for information, entertainment and to communicate.
There's agricultural and environmental monitoring, Internet connectivity, navigation.
Satellites even play a role in the operation of our financial and energy markets.
But these satellites that we rely on day in and day out have a finite life.
They might run out of propellant, they could malfunction, or they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life.
At this point, these satellites effectively become space junk, cluttering the orbital environment.
So imagine you're driving down the highway on a beautiful, sunny day out running errands.
You've got your music cranked, your windows rolled down, with the cool breeze blowing through your hair.
Feels nice, right?
Everything is going smoothly until suddenly your car stutters and stalls right in the middle of the highway.
So now you have no choice but to abandon your car where it is on the highway.
Maybe you were lucky enough to be able to move it out of the way and into a shoulder lane so that it's out of the way of other traffic.
A couple of hours ago, your car was a useful machine that you relied on in your everyday life.
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal taking up space in a valuable transportation network.
And imagine international roadways all cluttered with broken down vehicles that are just getting in the way of other traffic.
And imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere if a collision actually happened, thousands of smaller pieces of debris becoming new obstacles.
This is the paradigm of the satellite industry.
Satellites that are no longer working are often left to deorbit over many, many years, or only moved out of the way as a temporary solution.
And there are no international laws in space to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I, was launched in 1957, and in that year, there were only a total of three launch attempts.
Decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit, and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future, especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900-plus satellite constellations being launched.
Now, we send satellites to different orbits depending on what they're needed for.
One of the most common places we send satellites is the low Earth orbit, possibly to image the surface of Earth at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.
Satellites there are naturally buffeted by Earth's atmosphere, so their orbits naturally decay, and they'll eventually burn up, probably within a couple of decades.
Another common place we send satellites is the geostationary orbit at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.
Satellites there remain in the same place above Earth as the Earth rotates, which enables things like communications or television broadcast, for example.
Satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries.
And then there's the orbit coined "the graveyard," the ominous junk or disposal orbits, where some satellites are intentionally placed at the end of their life so that they're out of the way of common operational orbits.
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites launched since the late 1950s, only about one in seven is currently operational, and in addition to the satellites that are no longer working, there's also hundreds of thousands of marble-sized debris and millions of paint chip-sized debris that are also orbiting around the Earth.
Space debris is a major risk to space missions, but also to the satellites that we rely on each and every day.
Now, because space debris and junk has become increasingly worrisome, there have been some national and international efforts to develop technical standards to help us limit the generation of additional debris.
So for example, there are recommendations for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft to be made to deorbit in under 25 years, but that's still a really long time, especially if a satellite hasn't been working for years.
There's also mandates for those dead geostationary spacecraft to be moved into a graveyard orbit.
But neither of these guidelines is binding under international law, and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms.
These guidelines are also not long-term, they're not proactive, nor do they address the debris that's already up there.
They're only in place to limit the future creation of debris.
Space junk is no one's responsibility.
Now, Mount Everest is actually an interesting comparison of a new approach to how we interact with our environments, as it's often given the dubious honor of being the world's highest garbage dump.
Decades after the first conquest of the world's highest peak, tons of rubbish left behind by climbers has started to raise concern, and you may have read in the news that there's speculation that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers with stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations.
The goal, of course, is to persuade climbers to clean up after themselves, so maybe local not-for-profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste, or expeditions might organize voluntary cleanup trips.
And yet still many climbers feel that independent groups should police themselves.
There's no simple or easy answer, and even well-intentioned efforts at conservation often run into problems.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on, and like Everest, the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem.
But we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump, one that's out of this world.
The reality of space is that if a component on a satellite breaks down, there really are limited opportunities for repairs, and only at great cost.
But what if we were smarter about how we designed satellites?
What if all satellites, regardless of what country they were built in, had to be standardized in some way for recycling, servicing or active deorbiting?
What if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end-of-life disposal of satellites instead of moving them out of the way as a temporary solution?
Or maybe satellite manufacturers need to be charged a deposit to even launch a satellite into orbit, and that deposit would only be returned if the satellite was disposed of properly or if they cleaned up some quota of debris.
Or maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board to help accelerate deorbit.
There are some encouraging signs.
The UK's TechDemoSat-1, launched in 2014, for example, was designed for end-of-life disposal via a small drag sail.
This works for the satellite because it's small, but satellites that are higher or in larger orbits or are larger altogether, like the size of school buses, will require other disposal options.
So maybe you get into things like high-powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers, as crazy as those sound in the short term.
And then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics.
Imagine if a robotic arm on some sort of space tow truck could fix the broken components on a satellite, making them usable again.
Or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical propulsion just like you or I would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars?
Robotic repair and maintenance could extend the lives of hundreds of satellites orbiting around the Earth.
Whatever the disposal or cleanup options we come up with, it's clearly not just a technical problem.
There's also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out.
Simply put, we haven't found a way to use space sustainably yet.
Exploring, innovating to change the way we live and work are what we as humans do, and in space exploration, we're literally moving beyond the boundaries of Earth.
But as we push thresholds in the name of learning and innovation, we must remember that accountability for our environments never goes away.
There is without doubt congestion in the low Earth and geostationary orbits, and we cannot keep launching new satellites to replace the ones that have broken down without doing something about them first, just like we would never leave a broken down car in the middle of the highway.
Next time you use your phone, check the weather or use your GPS, think about the satellite technologies that make those activities possible.
But also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth, and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact.
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration.
It's up to us to keep it that way.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Like many of us, I've had several careers in my life, and although they've been varied, my first job set the foundation for all of them.
I was a home-birth midwife throughout my 20s.
Delivering babies taught me valuable and sometimes surprising things, like how to start a car at 2am. when it's 10 degrees below zero.
(Laughter)
Or how to revive a father who's fainted at the sight of blood.
(Laughter)
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so, to make a beautiful belly button.
But those aren't the things that stuck with me or guided me when I stopped being a midwife and started other jobs.
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief that each one of us comes into this world with a unique worth.
When I looked into the face of a newborn, I caught a glimpse of that worthiness, that sense of unapologetic selfhood, that unique spark.
I use the word "soul" to describe that spark, because it's the only word in English that comes close to naming what each baby brought into the room.
Every newborn was as singular as a snowflake, a matchless mash-up of biology and ancestry and mystery.
And then that baby grows up, and in order to fit into the family, to conform to the culture, to the community, to the gender, that little one begins to cover its soul, layer by layer.
We're born this way, but --
(Laughter)
But as we grow, a lot of things happen to us that make us ... want to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity.
We've all done this.
Everyone in this room is a former baby --
(Laughter)
with a distinctive birthright. But as adults, we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin, like we have ADD: authenticity deficit disorder.
But not those babies -- not yet.
Their message to me was: uncover your soul and look for that soul-spark in everyone else.
It's still there.
And here's what I learned from laboring women.
Their message was about staying open, even when things are painful.
A woman's cervix normally looks like this.
It's a tight little muscle at the base of the uterus.
And during labor, it has to stretch from this to this. Ouch! If you fight against that pain, you just create more pain, and you block what wants to be born.
I'll never forget the magic that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain and opened.
It was as if the forces of the universe took notice and sent in a wave of help.
I never forgot that message, and now, when difficult or painful things happen to me in my life or my work, of course at first I resist them, but then I remember what I learned from the mothers: stay open. Stay curious. Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.
Something new wants to be born.
And there was one more big soulful lesson, and that one I learned from Albert Einstein.
He wasn't at any of the births, but —
(Laughter)
It was a lesson about time.
At the end of his life, Albert Einstein concluded that our normal, hamster-wheel experience of life is an illusion.
We run round and round, faster and faster, trying to get somewhere.
And all the while, underneath surface time is this whole other dimension where the past and the present and the future merge and become deep time.
And there's nowhere to get to.
Albert Einstein called this state, this dimension, "only being." And he said when he experienced it, he knew sacred awe.
When I was delivering babies, I was forced off the hamster wheel.
Sometimes I had to sit for days, hours and hours, just breathing with the parents; just being.
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.
So those are the three lessons I took with me from midwifery.
One: uncover your soul.
Two: when things get difficult or painful, try to stay open.
And three: every now and then, step off your hamster wheel into deep time.
Those lessons have served me throughout my life, but they really served me recently, when I took on the most important job of my life thus far.
Two years ago, my younger sister came out of remission from a rare blood cancer, and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant.
And against the odds, we found a match for her, who turned out to be me.
I come from a family of four girls, and when my sisters found out that I was my sister's perfect genetic match, their reaction was, "Really? You?"
(Laughter)
"A perfect match for her?" Which is pretty typical for siblings.
In a sibling society, there's lots of things. There's love and there's friendship and there's protection.
But there's also jealousy and competition and rejection and attack.
In siblinghood, that's where we start assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul.
When I discovered I was my sister's match, I went into research mode.
And I discovered that the premise of transplants is pretty straightforward.
You destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy, and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy marrow cells from a donor.
And then you do everything you can to make sure that those new cells engraft in the patient.
I also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger.
If my sister made it through the near-lethal chemotherapy, she still would face other challenges.
My cells might attack her body.
And her body might reject my cells.
They call this rejection or attack, and both could kill her.
Rejection. Attack. Those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings.
My sister and I had a long history of love, but we also had a long history of rejection and attack, from minor misunderstandings to bigger betrayals.
We didn't have the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff; but, like many siblings and like people in all kinds of relationships, we were hesitant to tell our truths, to reveal our wounds, to admit our wrongdoings.
But when I learned about the dangers of rejection or attack, I thought, it's time to change this.
What if we left the bone marrow transplant up to the doctors, but did something that we later came to call our "soul marrow transplant?" What if we faced any pain we had caused each other, and instead of rejection or attack, could we listen? Could we forgive? Could we merge? Would that teach our cells to do the same?
To woo my skeptical sister, I turned to my parents' holy text: the New Yorker Magazine.
(Laughter)
I sent her a cartoon from its pages as a way of explaining why we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvested and transplanted into her body. Here it is.
"I have never forgiven him for that thing I made up in my head."
(Laughter)
I told my sister we had probably been doing the same thing, carting around made-up stories in our heads that kept us separate.
And I told her that after the transplant, all of the blood flowing in her veins would be my blood, made from my marrow cells, and that inside the nucleus of each of those cells is a complete set of my DNA. "I will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life," I told my slightly horrified sister.
(Laughter)
"I think we better clean up our relationship."
A health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things, like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane and, in the case of my sister, saying "yes" to several therapy sessions, during which we got down to the marrow.
We looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other and blame and shame until all that was left was love.
People have said I was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest, but I don't think so.
What felt brave to me was that other kind of harvest and transplant, the soul marrow transplant, getting emotionally naked with another human being, putting aside pride and defensiveness, lifting the layers and sharing with each other our vulnerable souls.
uncover your soul I called on those midwife lessons: Open to what's scary and painful. Look for the sacred awe.
Here I am with my marrow cells after the harvest.
That's they call it -- "harvest," like it's some kind of bucolic farm-to-table event --
(Laughter)
Which I can assure you it is not.
And here is my brave, brave sister receiving my cells.
After the transplant, we began to spend more and more time together.
It was as if we were little girls again.
The past and the present merged.
We entered deep time.
I left the hamster wheel of work and life to join my sister on that lonely island of illness and healing.
We spent months together -- in the isolation unit, in the hospital and in her home.
Our fast-paced society does not support or even value this kind of work.
We see it as a disruption of real life and important work.
We worry about the emotional drain and the financial cost -- and, yes, there is a financial cost.
But I was paid in the kind of currency our culture seems to have forgotten all about.
I was paid in love.
I was paid in soul.
I was paid in my sister.
My sister said the year after transplant was the best year of her life, which was surprising.
She suffered so much.
But she said life never tasted as sweet, and that because of the soul-baring and the truth-telling we had done with each other, she became more unapologetically herself with everyone.
She said things she'd always needed to say.
She did things she always wanted to do.
The same happened for me.
I became braver about being authentic with the people in my life.
I said my truths, but more important than that, I sought the truth of others.
It wasn't until the final chapter of this story that I realized just how well midwifery had trained me.
After that best year of my sister's life, the cancer came roaring back, and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do.
They gave her just a couple of months to live.
The night before my sister died, I sat by her bedside.
She was so small and thin. I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.
It was my blood, her blood, our blood.
When she died, part of me would die, too.
I tried to make sense of it all, how becoming one with each other had made us more ourselves, our soul selves, and how by facing and opening to the pain of our past, we'd finally been delivered to each other, and how by stepping out of time, we would now be connected forever.
My sister left me with so many things, and I'm going to leave you now with just one of them.
You don't have to wait for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you, to offer the marrow of your soul and to seek it in another.
We can all do this.
We can be like a new kind of first responder, like the one to take the first courageous step toward the other, and to do something or try to do something other than rejection or attack.
We can do this with our siblings and our mates and our friends and our colleagues.
We can do this with the disconnection and the discord all around us.
We can do this for the soul of the world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What is a parent?
What is a parent?
It's not an easy question. Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, surrogate mothers.
Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions.
Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation?
If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as "biological fathers," but should we really be using the word "father?"
As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood.
But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children.
I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different.
I will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions.
But I will also show you the parents' uncertainties.
We interviewed couples who received fertility treatment at Ghent University Hospital, using sperm from a donor.
In this treatment timeline, you can see two points at which we conducted interviews.
We included heterosexual couples, where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm, and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere.
We also included children.
I wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family.
In fact, that is what I asked them, only not in that way.
I drew an apple tree instead.
This way, I could ask abstract, philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off.
So as you can see, the apple tree is empty.
And that illustrates my research approach.
By designing techniques like this, I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview, because I want to hear that from them.
I asked them: What would your family look like if it were an apple tree? And they could take a paper apple for everyone who, in their view, was a member of the family, write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted.
And I would ask questions.
Most children started with a parent or a sibling.
One started with "Boxer," the dead dog of his grandparents.
At this point, none of the children started mentioning the donor.
So, I asked them about their birth story.
I said, "Before you were born, it was just your mom and dad, or mom and mommy.
Can you tell me how you came into the family?" And they explained.
One said, "My parents did not have good seeds, but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds.
They bring them to the hospital, and they put them in a big jar.
My mommy went there, and she took two from the jar, one for me and one for my sister.
She put the seeds in her belly -- somehow -- and her belly grew really big, and there I was."
Hmm. So only when they started mentioning the donor, I asked questions about him, using their own words.
I said, "If this would be an apple for the friendly man with the seeds, what would you do with it?" And one boy was thinking out loud, holding the apple.
And he said, "I won't put this one up there with the others.
He's not part of my family.
But I will not put him on the ground.
That's too cold and too hard.
I think he should be in the trunk, because he made my family possible.
If he would not have done this, that would really be sad because my family would not be here, and I would not be here."
So also, parents constructed family tales -- tales to tell their children.
One couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows. And why not? It's their way of explaining; their do-it-yourself with family narratives. DIY. And we had another couple who made books -- a book for each child.
They were really works of art containing their thoughts and feelings throughout the treatment.
They even had the hospital parking tickets in there.
So it is DIY: finding ways, words and images to tell your family story to your child.
And these stories were highly diverse, but they all had one thing in common: it was a tale of longing for a child and a quest for that child.
It was about how special and how deeply loved their child was.
And research so far shows that these children are doing fine.
They do not have more problems than other kids.
Yet, these parents also wanted to justify their decisions through the tales they tell.
They hoped that their children would understand their reasons for making the family in this way.
Underlying was a fear that their children might disapprove and would reject the non-genetic parent.
And that fear is understandable, because we live in a very heteronormative and geneticized society -- a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom, one dad and their genetically related children.
Well. I want to tell you about a teenage boy.
He was donor-conceived but not part of our study.
One day, he had an argument with his father, and he yelled, "You're telling me what to do?
You're not even my father!" That was exactly what the parents in our study feared.
Now, the boy soon felt sorry, and they made up.
But it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting.
He said, "This outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link.
It was about puberty -- being difficult. It's what they do at that age. It will pass."
What this man shows us is that when something goes wrong, we should not immediately think it is because the family is a little different.
These things happen in all families.
And every now and then, all parents may wonder: Am I a good enough parent? These parents, too.
They, above all, wanted to do what's best for their child.
But they also sometimes wondered: Am I a real parent? And their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents.
At the start of treatment, when they first saw the counselor, they paid close attention to the counselor, because they wanted to do it right.
Even 10 years later, they still remember the advice they were given.
So when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given, we discussed that.
And we saw one lesbian couple who said, "When our son asks us, 'Do I have a dad?' we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.' But we will say nothing more, not unless he asks, because he might not be ready for that.
The counselor said so."
Well. I don't know; that's quite different from how we respond to children's questions.
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?" We will say, "No, it comes from cows," and we will talk about the farmer, and the way the milk ends up in the shop.
We will not say, "No, milk is not made in a factory." So something strange happened here, and of course these children noticed that.
One boy said, "I asked my parents loads of questions, but they acted really weird.
So, you know, I have a friend at school, and she's made in the same way.
When I have a question, I just go and ask her." Clever guy. Problem solved. But his parents did not notice, and it certainly was not what they had in mind, nor what the counselor had in mind when they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family.
And that's the strange thing about advice.
When we offer people pills, we gather evidence first.
We do tests, we do follow-up studies.
We want to know, and rightly so, what this pill is doing and how it affects people's lives. And advice? It is not enough for advice, or for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound, or well-meant.
It should be advice that there is evidence for -- evidence that it actually improves patients' lives.
So the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox: I advise you to stop following advice. But, yes.
(Applause)
I will not end here with what went wrong; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families.
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer?
When parents do things that work for them, they do brilliant things.
What I want you to remember as members of families, in no matter what form or shape, is that what families need are warm relationships.
And we do not need to be professionals to create those.
Most of us do just fine, although it may be hard work, and from time to time, we can do with some advice.
In that case, bear in mind three things.
Work with advice that works for your family.
Remember -- you're the expert, because you live your family life.
And finally, believe in your abilities and your creativity, because you can do it yourself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles. Maybe you remember. Every day, we heard devastating reports from the war in Iraq.
There were waves of terror rolling across the globe.
It seemed like humanity was spinning out of control.
I remember the night that I read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in Madrid, and I got up and I walked over to the crib where my six-month-old baby girl lay sleeping sweetly, and I heard the rhythm of her breath, and I felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body.
We were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies, in politics, in religion, in populations.
Everything felt so precarious.
And I remember thinking, "My God, what kind of world did we bring this child into?
And what was I as a mother and a religious leader willing to do about it?
Of course, I knew it was clear that religion would be a principle battlefield in this rapidly changing landscape, and it was already clear that religion was a significant part of the problem.
The question for me was, could religion also be part of the solution?
Now, throughout history, people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities in the name of religion.
And as we entered the 21st century, it was very clear that religious extremism was once again on the rise.
Our studies now show that over the course of the past 15, 20 years, hostilities and religion-related violence have been on the increase all over the world.
But we don't even need the studies to prove it, because I ask you, how many of us are surprised today when we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting, when we later find out that the last word that was uttered before the trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated is the name of God?
It barely raises an eyebrow today when we learn that yet another person has decided to show his love of God by taking the lives of God's children.
In America, religious extremism looks like a white, antiabortion Christian extremist walking into Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs and murdering three people.
It also looks like a couple inspired by the Islamic State walking into an office party in San Bernardino and killing 14.
And even when religion-related extremism does not lead to violence, it is still used as a political wedge issue, cynically leading people to justify the subordination of women, the stigmatization of LGBT people, racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
This ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion and the future of faith.
We need to call this what it is: a great failure of religion.
But the thing is, this isn't even the only challenge that religion faces today.
At the very same time that we need religion to be a strong force against extremism, it is suffering from a second pernicious trend, what I call religious routine-ism.
This is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory, devoid of life, devoid of vision and devoid of soul.
Let me explain what I mean like this.
One of the great blessings of being a rabbi is standing under the chuppah, under the wedding canopy, with a couple, and helping them proclaim publicly and make holy the love that they found for one another.
I want to ask you now, though, to think maybe from your own experience or maybe just imagine it about the difference between the intensity of the experience under the wedding canopy, and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary.
(Laughter)
And if you're lucky enough to make it 16 or 17 years, if you're like most people, you probably wake up in the morning realizing that you forgot to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant and you forgot so much as a card, and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot.
Well, religious ritual and rites were essentially designed to serve the function of the anniversary, to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants of that sacred, revelatory encounter that birthed the religion in the first place.
The problem is that after a few centuries, the date remains on the calendar, but the love affair is long dead.
That's when we find ourselves in endless, mindless repetitions of words that don't mean anything to us, rising and being seated because someone has asked us to, holding onto jealously guarded doctrine that's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality, engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that's the way things have always been done.
Religion is waning in the United States.
Across the board, churches and synagogues and mosques are all complaining about how hard it is to maintain relevance for a generation of young people who seem completely uninterested, not only in the institutions that stand at the heart of our traditions but even in religion itself.
And what they need to understand is that there is today a generation of people who are as disgusted by the violence of religious extremism as they are turned off by the lifelessness of religious routine-ism.
Of course there is a bright spot to this story.
Given the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life, about 12 or 13 years ago, I set out to try to determine if there was any way that I could reclaim the heart of my own Jewish tradition, to help make it meaningful and purposeful again in a world on fire.
I started to wonder, what if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation and think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again about what the next iteration of religious life would look like?
Now, we had no money, no space, no game plan, but we did have email.
So my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues.
It basically said this: "Before you bail on religion, why don't we come together this Friday night and see what we might make of our own Jewish inheritance?"
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up. It turned out 135 people came.
They were cynics and seekers, atheists and rabbis.
Many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives.
And so I set out to do the only rational thing that someone would do in such a circumstance: I quit my job and tried to build this audacious dream, a reinvented, rethought religious life which we called "IKAR," which means "the essence" or "the heart of the matter."
Now, IKAR is not alone out there in the religious landscape today.
There are Jewish and Christian and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders, many of them women, by the way, who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions, who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution.
We are going back into our sacred traditions and recognizing that all of our traditions contain the raw material to justify violence and extremism, and also contain the raw material to justify compassion, coexistence and kindness -- that when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance, we can choose to read those same texts as directives for love and for forgiveness.
I have found now in communities as varied as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts to a woman's mosque, to black churches in New York and in North Carolina, to a holy bus loaded with nuns that traverses this country with a message of justice and peace, that there is a shared religious ethos that is now emerging in the form of revitalized religion in this country.
And while the theologies and the practices vary very much between these independent communities, what we can see are some common, consistent threads between them.
I'm going to share with you four of those commitments now.
The first is wakefulness. We live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to information about every global tragedy that happens on every corner of this Earth.
Within 12 hours, 20 million people saw that image of Aylan Kurdi's little body washed up on the Turkish shore.
We all saw this picture.
We saw this picture of a five-year-old child pulled out of the rubble of his building in Aleppo.
And once we see these images, we are called to a certain kind of action.
My tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road when he sees a beautiful house on fire, and he says, "How can it be that something so beautiful would burn, and nobody seems to even care?" So too we learn that our world is on fire, and it is our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open, and to recognize that it's our responsibility to help put out the flames.
This is extremely difficult to do.
Psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what's broken in our world, the less likely we are to do anything.
It's called psychic numbing.
We just shut down at a certain point.
Well, somewhere along the way, our religious leaders forgot that it's our job to make people uncomfortable.
It's our job to wake people up, to pull them out of their apathy and into the anguish, and to insist that we do what we don't want to do and see what we do not want to see.
Because we know that social change only happens --
(Applause)
when we are awake enough to see that the house is on fire.
The second principle is hope, and I want to say this about hope.
Hope is not naive, and hope is not an opiate.
Hope may be the single greatest act of defiance against a politics of pessimism and against a culture of despair.
Because what hope does for us is it lifts us out of the container that holds us and constrains us from the outside, and says, "You can dream and think expansively again.
That they cannot control in you."
I saw hope made manifest in an African-American church in the South Side of Chicago this summer, where I brought my little girl, who is now 13 and a few inches taller than me, to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.
That summer, there had already been 3,000 people shot between January and July in Chicago.
We went into that church and heard Rev. Moss preach, and after he did, this choir of gorgeous women, 100 women strong, stood up and began to sing. "I need you. You need me. I love you. I need you to survive." And I realized in that moment that this is what religion is supposed to be about.
It's supposed to be about giving people back a sense of purpose, a sense of hope, a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world that tells them that they don't matter at all.
The third principle is the principle of mightiness.
There's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around with two slips of paper in our pockets.
One says, "I am but dust and ashes." It's not all about me.
I can't control everything, and I cannot do this on my own.
The other slip of paper says, "For my sake the world was created." Which is to say it's true that I can't do everything, but I can surely do something. I can forgive. I can love. I can show up. I can protest. I can be a part of this conversation.
We even now have a religious ritual, a posture, that holds the paradox between powerlessness and power.
In the Jewish community, the only time of year that we prostrate fully to the ground is during the high holy days.
It's a sign of total submission.
Now in our community, when we get up off the ground, we stand with our hands raised to the heavens, and we say, "I am strong, I am mighty, and I am worthy.
I can't do everything, but I can do something."
In a world that conspires to make us believe that we are invisible and that we are impotent, religious communities and religious ritual can remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this Earth, whatever gifts and blessings we were given, whatever resources we have, we can and we must use them to try to make the world a little bit more just and a little bit more loving.
The fourth and final is interconnectedness.
A few years ago, there was a man walking on the beach in Alaska, when he came across a soccer ball that had some Japanese letters written on it.
He took a picture of it and posted it up on social media, and a Japanese teenager contacted him.
He had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country, but he was able to retrieve that soccer ball after it had floated all the way across the Pacific.
How small our world has become.
It's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are as human beings.
And yet, we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism.
Let me tell you how this works.
I'm not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police, because my white-looking Jewish kids probably won't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black.
Well, not so, because this is also my problem. And guess what? Transphobia and Islamophobia and racism of all forms, those are also all of our problems.
And so too is anti-Semitism all of our problems.
Because Emma Lazarus was right.
(Applause)
Emma Lazarus was right when she said until all of us are free, we are none of us free. We are all in this together.
And now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends, of wakefulness and hope and mightiness and interconnectedness, there is a burgeoning, multifaith justice movement in this country that is staking a claim on a countertrend, saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world.
Our hearts hurt from the failed religion of extremism, and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine-ism.
It is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country and the world so desperately needs -- a shift toward love, toward justice, toward equality and toward dignity for all.
I believe that our children deserve no less than that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Science. The very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom in high school biology or physics class.
But let me assure that what you did there had very little to do with science.
That was really the "what" of science.
It was the history of what other people had discovered.
What I'm most interested in as a scientist is the "how" of science.
Because science is knowledge in process.
We make an observation, guess an explanation for that observation, and then make a prediction that we can test with an experiment or other observation.
A couple of examples. First of all, people noticed that the Earth was below, the sky above, and both the Sun and the Moon seemed to go around them.
Their guessed explanation was that the Earth must be the center of the universe.
The prediction: everything should circle around the Earth.
This was first really tested when Galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes, and as he gazed into the night sky, what he found there was a planet, Jupiter, with four moons circling around it.
He then used those moons to follow the path of Jupiter and found that Jupiter also was not going around the Earth but around the Sun.
So the prediction test failed.
And this led to the discarding of the theory that the Earth was the center of the universe.
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton noticed that things fall to the Earth.
The guessed explanation was gravity, the prediction that everything should fall to the Earth.
But of course, not everything does fall to the Earth.
So did we discard gravity? No. We revised the theory and said, gravity pulls things to the Earth unless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction.
This led us to learn something new.
We began to pay more attention to the bird and the bird's wings, and just think of all the discoveries that have flown from that line of thinking.
So the test failures, the exceptions, the outliers teach us what we don't know and lead us to something new.
This is how science moves forward.
This is how science learns.
Sometimes in the media, and even more rarely, but sometimes even scientists will say that something or other has been scientifically proven.
But I hope that you understand that science never proves anything definitively forever.
Hopefully science remains curious enough to look for and humble enough to recognize when we have found the next outlier, the next exception, which, like Jupiter's moons, teaches us what we don't actually know.
We're going to change gears here for a second.
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine, means a lot of different things to different people, but most of our public discourse on medicine really turns it into an engineering problem.
We have the hallways of Congress, and the boardrooms of insurance companies that try to figure out how to pay for it.
The ethicists and epidemiologists try to figure out how best to distribute medicine, and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed with their protocols and checklists, trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine.
These are all good things.
However, they also all assume at some level that the textbook of medicine is closed.
We start to measure the quality of our health care by how quickly we can access it.
It doesn't surprise me that in this climate, many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like Jiffy Lube.
(Laughter)
The only problem is that when I graduated from medical school, I didn't get one of those little doohickeys that your mechanic has to plug into your car and find out exactly what's wrong with it, because the textbook of medicine is not closed. Medicine is science. Medicine is knowledge in process.
We make an observation, we guess an explanation of that observation, and then we make a prediction that we can test.
Now, the testing ground of most predictions in medicine is populations.
And you may remember from those boring days in biology class that populations tend to distribute around a mean as a Gaussian or a normal curve.
Therefore, in medicine, after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation, we test it in a population.
That means that what we know in medicine, our knowledge and our know-how, comes from populations but extends only as far as the next outlier, the next exception, which, like Jupiter's moons, will teach us what we don't actually know.
Now, I am a surgeon who looks after patients with sarcoma.
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.
And I would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier, is an exception.
There is no surgery I have ever performed for a sarcoma patient that has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial, what we consider the best kind of population-based evidence in medicine.
People talk about thinking outside the box, but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.
What we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty and unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma is easy access to what I think are those two most important values for any science: humility and curiosity.
Because if I am humble and curious, when a patient asks me a question, and I don't know the answer, I'll ask a colleague who may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.
We'll even establish international collaborations.
Those patients will start to talk to each other through chat rooms and support groups.
It's through this kind of humbly curious communication that we begin to try and learn new things.
As an example, this is a patient of mine who had a cancer near his knee.
Because of humbly curious communication in international collaborations, we have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee when we have to remove the knee with the cancer.
He can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play.
This opportunity was available to him because of international collaborations.
It was desirable to him because he had contacted other patients who had experienced it.
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine teach us what we don't know, but also lead us to new thinking.
Now, very importantly, all the new thinking that outliers and exceptions lead us to in medicine does not only apply to the outliers and exceptions.
It is not that we only learn from sarcoma patients ways to manage sarcoma patients.
Sometimes, the outliers and the exceptions teach us things that matter quite a lot to the general population.
Like a tree standing outside a forest, the outliers and the exceptions draw our attention and lead us into a much greater sense of perhaps what a tree is.
We often talk about losing the forests for the trees, but one also loses a tree within a forest.
But the tree that stands out by itself makes those relationships that define a tree, the relationships between trunk and roots and branches, much more apparent.
Even if that tree is crooked or even if that tree has very unusual relationships between trunk and roots and branches, it nonetheless draws our attention and allows us to make observations that we can then test in the general population.
I told you that sarcomas are rare.
They make up about one percent of all cancers.
You also probably know that cancer is considered a genetic disease.
By genetic disease we mean that cancer is caused by oncogenes that are turned on in cancer and tumor suppressor genes that are turned off to cause cancer.
You might think that we learned about oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes from common cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer and lung cancer, but you'd be wrong.
We learned about oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes for the first time in that itty-bitty little one percent of cancers called sarcoma.
In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize for realizing that chickens had a transmissible form of sarcoma.
Thirty years later, Harold Varmus and Mike Bishop discovered what that transmissible element was.
It was a virus carrying a gene, the src oncogene.
Now, I will not tell you that src is the most important oncogene.
I will not tell you that src is the most frequently turned on oncogene in all of cancer.
But it was the first oncogene.
The exception, the outlier drew our attention and led us to something that taught us very important things about the rest of biology.
Now, TP53 is the most important tumor suppressor gene.
It is the most frequently turned off tumor suppressor gene in almost every kind of cancer.
But we didn't learn about it from common cancers. We learned about it when doctors Li and Fraumeni were looking at families, and they realized that these families had way too many sarcomas.
I told you that sarcoma is rare.
Remember that a one in a million diagnosis, if it happens twice in one family, is way too common in that family.
The very fact that these are rare draws our attention and leads us to new kinds of thinking.
Now, many of you may say, and may rightly say, that yeah, Kevin, that's great, but you're not talking about a bird's wing. You're not talking about moons floating around some planet Jupiter.
This is a person. This outlier, this exception, may lead to the advancement of science, but this is a person.
And all I can say is that I know that all too well.
I have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases.
I write about these conversations. These conversations are terribly fraught.
They're fraught with horrible phrases like "I have bad news" or "There's nothing more we can do." Sometimes these conversations turn on a single word: "terminal."
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.
Where the blanks are in medicine can be just as important as the words that we use in these conversations.
What are the unknowns?
What are the experiments that are being done?
Do this little exercise with me.
Up there on the screen, you see this phrase, "no where." Notice where the blank is.
If we move that blank one space over "no where" becomes "now here," the exact opposite meaning, just by shifting the blank one space over.
I'll never forget the night that I walked into one of my patients' rooms.
I had been operating long that day but I still wanted to come and see him.
He was a boy I had diagnosed with a bone cancer a few days before.
He and his mother had been meeting with the chemotherapy doctors earlier that day, and he had been admitted to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.
It was almost midnight when I got to his room.
He was asleep, but I found his mother reading by flashlight next to his bed.
She came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes.
It turned out that what she had been reading was the protocol that the chemotherapy doctors had given her that day.
She had memorized it.
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me that we don't always win with this type of cancer, but I've been studying this protocol, and I think I can do it.
I think I can comply with these very difficult treatments. I'm going to quit my job. I'm going to move in with my parents.
I'm going to keep my baby safe." I didn't tell her.
I didn't stop to correct her thinking.
She was trusting in a protocol that even if complied with, wouldn't necessarily save her son.
I didn't tell her.
I didn't fill in that blank.
But a year and a half later her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.
Should I have told her?
Now, many of you may say, "So what?
I don't have sarcoma.
No one in my family has sarcoma.
And this is all fine and well, but it probably doesn't matter in my life." And you're probably right.
Sarcoma may not matter a whole lot in your life.
But where the blanks are in medicine does matter in your life.
I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.
I told you that in medicine, we test predictions in populations, but I didn't tell you, and so often medicine never tells you that every time an individual encounters medicine, even if that individual is firmly embedded in the general population, neither the individual nor the physician knows where in that population the individual will land.
Therefore, every encounter with medicine is an experiment.
You will be a subject in an experiment.
And the outcome will be either a better or a worse result for you.
As long as medicine works well, we're fine with fast service, bravado, brimmingly confident conversations.
But when things don't work well, sometimes we want something different.
A colleague of mine removed a tumor from a patient's limb.
He was concerned about this tumor.
In our physician conferences, he talked about his concern that this was a type of tumor that had a high risk for coming back in the same limb.
But his conversations with the patient were exactly what a patient might want: brimming with confidence.
He said, "I got it all and you're good to go." She and her husband were thrilled.
They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner, opened a bottle of champagne.
The only problem was a few weeks later, she started to notice another nodule in the same area.
It turned out he hadn't gotten it all, and she wasn't good to go.
But what happened at this juncture absolutely fascinates me.
My colleague came to me and said, "Kevin, would you mind looking after this patient for me?" I said, "Why, you know the right thing to do as well as I do.
You haven't done anything wrong." He said, "Please, just look after this patient for me." He was embarrassed -- not by what he had done, but by the conversation that he had had, by the overconfidence.
So I performed a much more invasive surgery and had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards.
I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all and you're most likely good to go, but this is the experiment that we're doing.
This is what you're going to watch for.
This is what I'm going to watch for.
And we're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work to get rid of your cancer." I can guarantee you, she and her husband did not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me.
But she was now a scientist, not only a subject in her experiment.
And so I encourage you to seek humility and curiosity in your physicians.
Almost 20 billion times each year, a person walks into a doctor's office, and that person becomes a patient.
You or someone you love will be that patient sometime very soon.
How will you talk to your doctors? What will you tell them? What will they tell you? They cannot tell you what they do not know, but they can tell you when they don't know if only you'll ask.
So please, join the conversation.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk a little bit about where technology's going.
And often technology comes to us, we're surprised by what it brings.
But there's actually a large aspect of technology that's much more predictable, and that's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings, they have urgencies, they have tendencies.
And those tendencies are derived from the very nature of the physics, chemistry of wires and switches and electrons, and they will make reoccurring patterns again and again.
And so those patterns produce these tendencies, these leanings.
You can almost think of it as sort of like gravity.
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.
The actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley is unpredictable.
We cannot see where it's going, but the general direction is very inevitable: it's downward.
And so these baked-in tendencies and urgencies in technological systems give us a sense of where things are going at the large form.
So in a large sense, I would say that telephones were inevitable, but the iPhone was not.
The Internet was inevitable, but Twitter was not.
So we have many ongoing tendencies right now, and I think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things smarter and smarter.
I call it cognifying -- cognification -- also known as artificial intelligence, or AI.
And I think that's going to be one of the most influential developments and trends and directions and drives in our society in the next 20 years.
So, of course, it's already here.
We already have AI, and often it works in the background, in the back offices of hospitals, where it's used to diagnose X-rays better than a human doctor.
It's in legal offices, where it's used to go through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer.
It's used to fly the plane that you came here with.
Human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes, the rest of the time the AI was driving.
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon, it's in the background, making those recommendations.
That's what we have today.
And we have an example, of course, in a more front-facing aspect of it, with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat the world's greatest Go champion.
But it's more than that.
If you play a video game, you're playing against an AI.
But recently, Google taught their AI to actually learn how to play video games.
Again, teaching video games was already done, but learning how to play a video game is another step.
That's artificial smartness.
What we're doing is taking this artificial smartness and we're making it smarter and smarter.
There are three aspects to this general trend that I think are underappreciated; I think we would understand AI a lot better if we understood these three things.
I think these things also would help us embrace AI, because it's only by embracing it that we actually can steer it.
We can actually steer the specifics by embracing the larger trend.
So let me talk about those three different aspects.
The first one is: our own intelligence has a very poor understanding of what intelligence is.
We tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension, that it's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder.
It starts like with IQ measurement.
It starts with maybe a simple low IQ in a rat or mouse, and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee, and then maybe there's more in a stupid person, and then maybe an average person like myself, and then maybe a genius.
And this single IQ intelligence is getting greater and greater.
That's completely wrong.
That's not what intelligence is -- not what human intelligence is, anyway.
It's much more like a symphony of different notes, and each of these notes is played on a different instrument of cognition.
There are many types of intelligences in our own minds. We have deductive reasoning, we have emotional intelligence, we have spatial intelligence; we have maybe 100 different types that are all grouped together, and they vary in different strengths with different people.
And of course, if we go to animals, they also have another basket -- another symphony of different kinds of intelligences, and sometimes those same instruments are the same that we have.
They can think in the same way, but they may have a different arrangement, and maybe they're higher in some cases than humans, like long-term memory in a squirrel is actually phenomenal, so it can remember where it buried its nuts.
But in other cases they may be lower.
When we go to make machines, we're going to engineer them in the same way, where we'll make some of those types of smartness much greater than ours, and many of them won't be anywhere near ours, because they're not needed.
So we're going to take these things, these artificial clusters, and we'll be adding more varieties of artificial cognition to our AIs.
We're going to make them very, very specific.
So your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic already; your GPS is smarter than you are in spatial navigation; Google, Bing, are smarter than you are in long-term memory.
And we're going to take, again, these kinds of different types of thinking and we'll put them into, like, a car.
The reason why we want to put them in a car so the car drives, is because it's not driving like a human.
It's not thinking like us.
That's the whole feature of it. It's not being distracted, it's not worrying about whether it left the stove on, or whether it should have majored in finance. It's just driving.
(Laughter)
Just driving, OK? And we actually might even come to advertise these as "consciousness-free." They're without consciousness, they're not concerned about those things, they're not distracted.
So in general, what we're trying to do is make as many different types of thinking as we can.
We're going to populate the space of all the different possible types, or species, of thinking.
And there actually may be some problems that are so difficult in business and science that our own type of human thinking may not be able to solve them alone.
We may need a two-step program, which is to invent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems, say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.
What we're doing is making alien intelligences.
You might even think of this as, sort of, artificial aliens in some senses.
And they're going to help us think different, because thinking different is the engine of creation and wealth and new economy.
The second aspect of this is that we are going to use AI to basically make a second Industrial Revolution.
The first Industrial Revolution was based on the fact that we invented something I would call artificial power.
Previous to that, during the Agricultural Revolution, everything that was made had to be made with human muscle or animal power.
That was the only way to get anything done.
The great innovation during the Industrial Revolution was, we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels, to make this artificial power that we could use to do anything we wanted to do.
So today when you drive down the highway, you are, with a flick of the switch, commanding 250 horses -- 250 horsepower -- which we can use to build skyscrapers, to build cities, to build roads, to make factories that would churn out lines of chairs or refrigerators way beyond our own power.
And that artificial power can also be distributed on wires on a grid to every home, factory, farmstead, and anybody could buy that artificial power, just by plugging something in.
So this was a source of innovation as well, because a farmer could take a manual hand pump, and they could add this artificial power, this electricity, and he'd have an electric pump.
And you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times, and that formula was what brought us the Industrial Revolution.
All the things that we see, all this progress that we now enjoy, has come from the fact that we've done that.
We're going to do the same thing now with AI.
We're going to distribute that on a grid, and now you can take that electric pump. You can add some artificial intelligence, and now you have a smart pump.
And that, multiplied by a million times, is going to be this second Industrial Revolution.
So now the car is going down the highway, it's 250 horsepower, but in addition, it's 250 minds.
That's the auto-driven car. It's like a new commodity; it's a new utility.
The AI is going to flow across the grid -- the cloud -- in the same way electricity did.
So everything that we had electrified, we're now going to cognify.
And I would suggest, then, that the formula for the next 10,000 start-ups is very, very simple, which is to take x and add AI.
That is the formula, that's what we're going to be doing.
And that is the way in which we're going to make this second Industrial Revolution.
And by the way -- right now, this minute, you can log on to Google and you can purchase AI for six cents, 100 hits.
That's available right now.
So the third aspect of this is that when we take this AI and embody it, we get robots.
And robots are going to be bots, they're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done.
A job is just a bunch of tasks, so they're going to redefine our jobs because they're going to do some of those tasks.
But they're also going to create whole new categories, a whole new slew of tasks that we didn't know we wanted to do before.
They're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs, new kinds of tasks that we want done, just as automation made up a whole bunch of new things that we didn't know we needed before, and now we can't live without them.
So they're going to produce even more jobs than they take away, but it's important that a lot of the tasks that we're going to give them are tasks that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity.
If you can specify a task, either manual or conceptual, that can be specified in terms of efficiency or productivity, that goes to the bots.
Productivity is for robots.
What we're really good at is basically wasting time.
(Laughter)
We're really good at things that are inefficient.
Science is inherently inefficient.
It runs on that fact that you have one failure after another. It runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don't work, otherwise you're not learning.
It runs on the fact that there is not a lot of efficiency in it.
Innovation by definition is inefficient, because you make prototypes, because you try stuff that fails, that doesn't work.
Exploration is inherently inefficiency.
Art is not efficient.
Human relationships are not efficient.
These are all the kinds of things we're going to gravitate to, because they're not efficient.
Efficiency is for robots.
We're also going to learn that we're going to work with these AIs because they think differently than us.
When Deep Blue beat the world's best chess champion, people thought it was the end of chess.
But actually, it turns out that today, the best chess champion in the world is not an AI.
And it's not a human.
It's the team of a human and an AI.
The best medical diagnostician is not a doctor, it's not an AI, it's the team.
We're going to be working with these AIs, and I think you'll be paid in the future by how well you work with these bots.
So that's the third thing, is that they're different, they're utility and they are going to be something we work with rather than against.
We're working with these rather than against them.
So, the future: Where does that take us?
I think that 25 years from now, they'll look back and look at our understanding of AI and say, "You didn't have AI.
In fact, you didn't even have the Internet yet, compared to what we're going to have 25 years from now. "There are no AI experts right now.
There's a lot of money going to it, there are billions of dollars being spent on it; it's a huge business, but there are no experts, compared to what we'll know 20 years from now.
So we are just at the beginning of the beginning, we're in the first hour of all this.
We're in the first hour of the Internet. We're in the first hour of what's coming.
The most popular AI product in 20 years from now, that everybody uses, has not been invented yet.
That means that you're not late.
Thank you.
(Laughter)
So, my journey began in the Bronx, New York, in a one-bedroom apartment, with my two sisters and immigrant mother.
I loved our neighborhood. It was lively. There was all this merengue blasting, neighbors socializing on building stoops and animated conversations over domino playing.
It was home, and it was sweet.
But it wasn't simple.
In fact, everyone at school knew the block where we lived, because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs.
And with drug-dealing comes conflict, so we often went to sleep to the sound of gunshots.
I spent much of my childhood worried, worried about our safety.
And so did our mother.
She worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us.
Our entire life was in the Bronx, but my mother's anxiety spurred her into action, and soon we were driving so fast to Connecticut --
(Laughter)
to boarding school campuses, with full scholarships in tow.
Man, don't underestimate the power of a mother determined to keep her children safe.
(Cheers) (Applause)
At boarding school, for the first time, I was able to sleep without worry.
I could leave my dorm room unlocked, walk barefoot in the grass, and look up to see a night sky full of stars. Happy novelties.
But there were other novelties as well.
Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.
I learned that I didn't speak the right way, and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking, my teachers gave me frequent lessons, in public, on the appropriate way to enunciate certain words.
A teacher once instructed me in the hallway: "Aaaaaas-king." She said this loudly. "Dena, it's not 'axing,' like you're running around with an axe.
That's silly."
Now at this point, you can imagine the snickers of my classmates, but she continued: "Think about breaking the word into 'ass' and 'king,' and then put the two together to say it correctly -- 'Asking.'"
There were some other moments that reminded me that I didn't belong.
Once, I walked into a classmate's dorm room, and I watched her watch her valuables around me.
Like, why would she do that? I thought to myself. And then there was the time when another classmate walked into my dorm room, and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying hair grease to my scalp.
There is emotional damage done when young people can't be themselves, when they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable.
It's a kind of violence.
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential success story.
I attended boarding school and college in New England, studied abroad in Chile and returned to the Bronx to be a middle school teacher.
I received a Truman Scholarship, a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.
And I could list more.
(Laughter)
But I won't.
(Laughter)
I earned my doctorate at Columbia University.
(Cheers)
(Applause)
And then I landed a job at Yale.
(Applause)
I am proud of everything that I've been able to accomplish on my journey thus far.
I have eternal imposter syndrome.
Either I've been invited because I'm a token, which really isn't about me, but rather, about a box someone needed to check off.
Or, I am exceptional, which means I've had to leave the people I love behind.
It's the price that I and so many others pay for learning while black.
(Applause)
I police myself all the time.
Are my pants too tight?
Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?
Should I speak up for myself, or will the power of my words be reduced to: "She's angry?"
Why did I have to leave the Bronx to gain access to a better education?
And why, in the process of getting that better education, did I have to endure the trauma of erasing what made me, me -- a black girl from the Bronx, raised by an Antiguan mother?
So when I think about our current education reform initiatives, I can't help asking: What are our students of color learning about themselves?
Three -- three decades of research reveal that students of color are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students, and are punished in harsher ways for the same infractions.
They also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives in the curricula.
The Cooperative Children's Book Center did a review of nearly 4,000 books and found that only three percent were about African-Americans.
And they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them.
An analysis of data from the National Center for Education Statistics found that 45 percent of our nation's pre-K to high school students were people of color, while only 17 percent of our teachers are.
Our youth of color pay a profound price when their schooling sends them the message that they must be controlled, that they must leave their identities at home in order to be successful.
Every child deserves an education that guarantees the safety to learn in the comfort of one's own skin.
(Applause)
It is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically.
I know, because I did it in my classroom when I returned to teach in the Bronx.
So what did that look like?
I centered my instruction on the lives, histories and identities of my students.
And I did all of this because I wanted my students to know that everyone around them was supporting them to be their best self.
So while I could not control the instability of their homes, the uncertainty of their next meal, or the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep, I provided them with a loving classroom that made them feel proud of who they are, that made them know that they mattered.
You know, every time I hear or say the word "asking," I am in high school again.
I am thinking about "ass" and "king" and putting the two together so that I speak in a way where someone in power will want to listen.
There is a better way, one that doesn't force kids of color into a double bind; a way for them to preserve their ties to their families, homes and communities; a way that teaches them to trust their instincts and to have faith in their own creative genius. Thank you.
(Applause)
When people find out I write about time management, they assume two things.
One is that I'm always on time, and I'm not.
I have four small children, and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness, but sometimes it's just not their fault.
I was once late to my own speech on time management.
(Laughter)
We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony.
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there.
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines, generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.
And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities, add it up, and we'll have time for the good stuff.
I question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested in hearing what they've come up with before they call me.
Some of my favorites: doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns --
(Laughter)
Being extremely judicious in microwave usage: it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package, we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.
And my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level, is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.
That way, you save eight minutes every half hour, so in the course of two hours of watching TV, you find 32 minutes to exercise.
(Laughter)
Which is true. You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise?
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?
(Laughter)
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up, we will finally get to everything we want to do.
But after studying how successful people spend their time and looking at their schedules hour by hour, I think this idea has it completely backward.
We don't build the lives we want by saving time.
We build the lives we want, and then time saves itself.
Here's what I mean. I recently did a time diary project looking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women.
They had demanding jobs, sometimes their own businesses, kids to care for, maybe parents to care for, community commitments -- busy, busy people.
I had them keep track of their time for a week so I could add up how much they worked and slept, and I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book.
One of the women whose time log I studied goes out on a Wednesday night for something.
She comes home to find that her water heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement.
If you've ever had anything like this happen to you, you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess.
So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet.
All this is being recorded on her time log.
Winds up taking seven hours of her week. Seven hours. That's like finding an extra hour in the day.
But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week, "Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?" "Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?" I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said, which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?" Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement, she found seven hours.
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic.
We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.
And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater.
To get at this, I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed.
By busy, I mean she was running a small business with 12 people on the payroll, she had six children in her spare time.
I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.
I remember it was a Thursday morning, and she was not available to speak with me.
Of course, right?
But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike, because it was a beautiful spring morning, and she wanted to go for a hike.
So of course this makes me even more intrigued, and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this. She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do, every minute I spend, is my choice." And rather than say, "I don't have time to do x, y or z," she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority." "I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority." If you think about it, that's really more accurate language.
I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds, but that's not true.
If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds, I would get to it pretty quickly.
(Laughter)
Since that is not going to happen, I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time; it's that I don't want to do it.
Using this language reminds us that time is a choice.
And granted, there may be horrible consequences for making different choices, I will give you that.
But we are smart people, and certainly over the long run, we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there.
So how do we do that? How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater?
Well, first we need to figure out what they are.
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this.
The first, on the professional side: I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews.
You look back over your successes over the year, your "opportunities for growth." And this serves its purpose, but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.
So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.
You're giving yourself a performance review, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?
So you can write next year's performance review now.
And you can do this for your personal life, too.
I'm sure many of you, like me, come December, get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper, on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.
(Laughter)
Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really, going on about how amazing everyone in the household is, or even more scintillating, how busy everyone in the household is.
But these letters serve a purpose, which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year.
So this year's kind of done, but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about.
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?
So you can write next year's family holiday letter now.
Don't send it.
(Laughter)
Please, don't send it.
But you can write it.
And now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter, we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year.
And now we need to break these down into doable steps.
So maybe you want to write a family history.
First, you can read some other family histories, get a sense for the style.
Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives, set up appointments to interview them.
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.
So you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan, and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet.
And then — this is key — we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater, by putting them into our schedules first.
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them.
I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons.
Friday afternoon is what an economist might call a "low opportunity cost" time.
Most of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying, "I am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now."
(Laughter)
But we are willing to think about what those should be.
So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon, make yourself a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self.
Making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories.
Career, we think about; relationships, self -- not so much.
But anyway, just a short list, two to three items in each.
Then look out over the whole of the next week, and see where you can plan them in.
Where you plan them in is up to you.
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others.
I mean, some people's lives are just harder than others.
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own. I get that. And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle.
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering.
There are 168 hours in a week.
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.
That is a lot of time.
If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week -- that leaves 72 hours for other things.
That is a lot of time.
You say you're working 50 hours a week, maybe a main job and a side hustle.
Well, that leaves 62 hours for other things.
You say you're working 60 hours.
Well, that leaves 52 hours for other things.
You say you're working more than 60 hours.
Well, are you sure?
(Laughter)
There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks with time diaries.
They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours.
(Laughter)
You can guess in which direction, right?
Anyway, in 168 hours a week, I think we can find time for what matters to you.
If you want to spend more time with your kids, you want to study more for a test you're taking, you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two, you can.
And that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours.
So we have plenty of time, which is great, because guess what?
We don't even need that much time to do amazing things.
But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do?
Pull out the phone, right? Start deleting emails. Otherwise, we're puttering around the house or watching TV.
But small moments can have great power.
You can use your bits of time for bits of joy.
Maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work.
I know when I had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning, I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read.
It made the whole experience almost, almost, enjoyable.
Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying.
If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule, maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute.
It's about looking at the whole of one's time and seeing where the good stuff can go.
I truly believe this. There is time. Even if we are busy, we have time for what matters.
And when we focus on what matters, we can build the lives we want in the time we've got.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a tuberculosis ward, and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s, one in seven of all people died from tuberculosis.
We had no idea what was causing this disease.
The hypothesis was actually it was your constitution that made you susceptible.
And it was a highly romanticized disease.
It was also called consumption, and it was the disorder of poets and artists and intellectuals.
And some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative genius.
By the 1950s, we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection, which is slightly less romantic, but that had the upside of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it.
So doctors had discovered a new drug, iproniazid, that they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis, and they gave it to patients, and patients were elated.
They were more social, more energetic.
One medical report actually says they were "dancing in the halls." And unfortunately, this was not necessarily because they were getting better.
A lot of them were still dying.
Another medical report describes them as being "inappropriately happy." And that is how the first antidepressant was discovered.
So accidental discovery is not uncommon in science, but it requires more than just a happy accident.
You have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur.
As a neuroscientist, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about my firsthand experience with whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck -- let's call it smart luck.
But first, a bit more background.
Thankfully, since the 1950s, we've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.
And at least in the United States, though not necessarily in other countries, we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you are not too worried about TB.
But a lot of what was true in the early 1900s about infectious disease, we can say now about psychiatric disorders.
We are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
One in four of all adults in the United States suffers from mental illness, which means that if you haven't experienced it personally or someone in your family hasn't, it's still very likely that someone you know has, though they may not talk about it.
Depression has actually now surpassed HIV / AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war as the leading cause of disability worldwide.
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s, we don't know what causes it.
Once it's developed, it's chronic, lasts a lifetime, and there are no known cures.
The second antidepressant we discovered, also by accident, in the 1950s, from an antihistamine that was making people manic, imipramine.
And in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine, someone had to be able to recognize that a drug that was designed to do one thing -- treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies -- could be used to do something very different -- treat depression.
And this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging.
When doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid, they didn't really recognize what they saw.
They were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect, an adverse side effect.
As you can see here, a lot of these patients in 1954 are experiencing severe euphoria.
And they were worried that this might somehow interfere with their recovering from tuberculosis.
So they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme TB and in patients that were highly emotionally stable, which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant.
They were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease, they could not see the larger implications for another disease.
And to be fair, it's not entirely their fault.
Functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us.
It's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function.
And mental set is another thing. Right? That's sort of this preconceived framework with which we approach problems.
And that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us, which is, I guess, why they gave a TV show to the guy who was, like, really great at repurposing.
(Laughter)
So the effects in both the case of iproniazid and imipramine, they were so strong -- there was mania, or people dancing in the halls.
It's actually not that surprising they were caught.
But it does make you wonder what else we've missed.
So iproniazid and imipramine, they're more than just a case study in repurposing.
They have two other things in common that are really important.
One, they have terrible side effects.
That includes liver toxicity, weight gain of over 50 pounds, suicidality.
And two, they both increase levels of serotonin, which is a chemical signal in the brain, or a neurotransmitter.
And those two things together, right, one or the two, may not have been that important, but the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs, and that serotonin seemed like a pretty good place to start.
So we developed drugs to more specifically focus on serotonin, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs, the most famous of which is Prozac.
And that was 30 years ago, and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs.
And the SSRIs, they are better than the drugs that came before them, but they still have a lot of side effects, including weight gain, insomnia, suicidality -- and they take a really long time to work, something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients.
And that's in the patients where they do work.
There are a lot of patients where these drugs don't work.
And that means now, in 2016, we still have no cures for any mood disorders, just drugs that suppress symptoms, which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection versus an antibiotic.
A painkiller will make you feel better, but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease.
And it was this flexibility in our thinking that let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine could be repurposed in this way, which led us to the serotonin hypothesis, which we then, ironically, fixated on.
This is brain signaling, serotonin, from an SSRI commercial.
In case you're not clear, this is a dramatization.
And in science, we try and remove our bias, right, by running double-blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be.
But bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study and how we choose to study it.
So we've focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years, often to the exclusion of other things.
We still have no cures, and what if serotonin isn't all there is to depression?
What if it's not even the key part of it?
That means no matter how much time or money or effort we put into it, it will never lead to a cure.
In the past few years, doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs, Calypsol, and this drug works very quickly, within a few hours or a day, and it doesn't work on serotonin.
It works on glutamate, which is another neurotransmitter.
And it's also repurposed.
It was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery.
But unlike those other drugs, which were recognized pretty quickly, it took us 20 years to realize that Calypsol was an antidepressant, despite the fact that it's actually a better antidepressant, probably, than those other drugs.
It's actually probably because of the fact that it's a better antidepressant that it was harder for us to recognize.
There was no mania to signal its effects.
So in 2013, up at Columbia University, I was working with my colleague, Dr. Christine Ann Denny, and we were studying Calypsol as an antidepressant in mice.
And Calypsol has, like, a really short half-life, which means it's out of your body within a few hours.
And we were just piloting.
So we would give an injection to mice, and then we'd wait a week, and then we'd run another experiment to save money.
And one of the experiments I was running, we would stress the mice, and we used that as a model of depression.
And at first it kind of just looked like it didn't really work at all.
So we could have stopped there.
But I have run this model of depression for years, and the data just looked kind of weird.
It didn't really look right to me.
So I went back, and we reanalyzed it based on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of Calypsol a week beforehand.
And it looked kind of like this.
So if you look at the far left, if you put a mouse in a new space, this is the box, it's very exciting, a mouse will walk around and explore, and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking.
And we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup that it can decide to interact with.
This is also a dramatization, in case that's not clear.
And a normal mouse will explore. It will be social. Check out what's going on.
If you stress a mouse in this depression model, which is the middle box, they aren't social, they don't explore.
They mostly just kind of hide in that back corner, behind a cup.
Yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Calypsol, here on your right, they were exploring, they were social.
They looked like they had never been stressed at all, which is impossible.
So we could have just stopped there, but Christine had also used Calypsol before as anesthesia, and a few years ago she had seen that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells and some other behavior that also seemed to last long after the drug, maybe a few weeks.
So we were like, OK, maybe this is not completely impossible, but we were really skeptical.
So we did what you do in science when you're not sure, and we ran it again.
And I remember being in the animal room, moving mice from box to box to test them, and Christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap so the mice couldn't see her, and she was analyzing the data in real time.
And I remember us yelling, which you're not supposed to do in an animal room where you're testing, because it had worked.
It seemed like these mice were protected against stress, or they were inappropriately happy, however you want to call it.
And we were really excited.
And then we were really skeptical, because it was too good to be true.
So we ran it again.
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model, and we ran it again in a physiological model, where all we did was give stress hormones.
And we had our undergrads run it.
And then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in France run it.
And every time someone ran it, they confirmed the same thing.
It seemed like this one injection of Calypsol was somehow protecting against stress for weeks.
And we only published this a year ago, but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect.
So we don't know what causes depression, but we do know that stress is the initial trigger in 80 percent of cases, and depression and PTSD are different diseases, but this is something they share in common. Right? It is traumatic stress like active combat or natural disasters or community violence or sexual assault that causes post-traumatic stress disorder, and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder.
And this ability to experience stress and be resilient and bounce back and not develop depression or PTSD is known as stress resilience, and it varies between people.
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property.
It's the absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders.
But what if it were active?
Maybe we could enhance it, sort of akin to putting on armor.
We had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug.
And like I said, we only gave a tiny amount of the drug, and it lasted for weeks, and that's not like anything you see with antidepressants.
But it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines.
So in immune vaccines, you'll get your shots, and then weeks, months, years later, when you're actually exposed to bacteria, it's not the vaccine in your body that protects you.
It's your own immune system that's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off, and you actually never get the infection, which is very different from, say, our treatments. Right? In that case, you get the infection, you're exposed to the bacteria, you're sick, and then you take, say, an antibiotic which cures it, and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria.
Or similar to as I said before, with this palliative, you'll take something that will suppress the symptoms, but it won't treat the underlying infection, and you'll only feel better during the time in which you're taking it, which is why you have to keep taking it.
And in depression and PTSD -- here we have your stress exposure -- we only have palliative care.
Antidepressants only suppress symptoms, and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease, which is often the length of your own life.
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing drugs "paravaccines," which means vaccine-like, because it seems like they might have the potential to protect against stress and prevent mice from developing depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Also, not all antidepressants are also paravaccines.
We tried Prozac as well, and that had no effect.
So if this were to translate into humans, we might be able to protect people who are predictably at risk against stress-induced disorders like depression and PTSD.
So that's first responders and firefighters, refugees, prisoners and prison guards, soldiers, you name it.
And to give you a sense of the scale of these diseases, in 2010, the global burden of disease was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars, and since they are chronic, that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise up to six trillion dollars in just the next 15 years.
As I mentioned before, repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases.
Calypsol has another name, ketamine, which also goes by another name, Special K, which is a club drug and drug of abuse.
It's still used across the world as an anesthetic.
It's used in children. We use it on the battlefield.
It's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations, because it doesn't affect breathing.
It is on the World Health Organization list of most essential medicines.
If we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first, it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it, but as is, we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere.
Fortunately, it's not the only compound we have discovered that has these prophylactic, paravaccine qualities, but all of the other drugs we've discovered, or compounds if you will, they're totally new, they have to go through the entire FDA approval process -- if they make it before they can ever be used in humans.
And that will be years.
So if we wanted something sooner, ketamine is already FDA-approved.
It's generic, it's available.
We could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time.
But actually, beyond functional fixedness and mental set, there's a real other challenge to repurposing drugs, which is policy.
There are no incentives in place once a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive to encourage pharma companies to develop them, because they don't make money.
And that's not true for just ketamine. That is true for all drugs.
Regardless, the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry, to use drugs to prevent mental illness as opposed to just treat it.
It is possible that 20, 50, 100 years from now, we will look back now at depression and PTSD the way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums as a thing of the past.
This could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic.
But as a great scientist once said, "Only a fool is sure of anything.
A wise man keeps on guessing."
Thank you, guys.
Tell your daughters of this year, how we woke needing coffee but discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers, waterlogged facsimiles of our sisters, spouses, small children.
Say to your baby of this year when she asks, as she certainly should, tell her it was too late coming.
Admit even in the year we leased freedom, we didn't own it outright.
There were still laws for every way we used our privates while they pawed at the soft folds of us, grabbed with no concern for consent, no laws made for the men that enforced them.
We were trained to dodge, to wait, to cower and cover, to wait more, still, wait.
We were told to be silent.
But speak to your girls of this wartime, a year preceded by a score of the same, so as in two decades before, we wiped our eyes, laced caskets with flags, evacuated the crime scene of the club, caterwauled in the street, laid our bodies on the concrete against the outlines of our fallen, cried, "Of course we mattered," chanted for our disappeared.
The women wept this year. They did.
In the same year, we were ready.
The year we lost our inhibition and moved with courageous abandon was also the year we stared down barrels, sang of cranes in skies, ducked and parried, caught gold in hijab, collected death threats, knew ourselves as patriots, said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down and found a running mate," made road maps for infant joy, shamed nothing but fear, called ourselves fat and meant, of course, impeccable.
This year, we were women, not brides or trinkets, not an off-brand gender, not a concession, but women.
Instruct your babies. Remind them that the year has passed to be docile or small.
Some of us said for the first time that we were women, took this oath of solidarity seriously.
Some of us bore children and some of us did not, and none of us questioned whether that made us real or appropriate or true.
When she asks you of this year, your daughter, whether your offspring or heir to your triumph, from her comforted side of history teetering towards woman, she will wonder and ask voraciously, though she cannot fathom your sacrifice, she will hold your estimation of it holy, curiously probing, "Where were you? Did you fight? Were you fearful or fearsome?
What colored the walls of your regret?
What did you do for women in the year it was time?
This path you made for me which bones had to break?
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?
And are you a hero?" She will ask the difficult questions.
She will not care about the arc of your brow, the weight of your clutch.
She will not ask of your mentions.
Your daughter, for whom you have already carried so much, wants to know what you brought, what gift, what light did you keep from extinction?
When they came for victims in the night, did you sleep through it or were you roused?
What was the cost of staying woke?
What, in the year we said time's up, what did you do with your privilege?
Did you sup on others' squalor?
Did you look away or directly into the flame?
Did you know your skill or treat it like a liability?
Were you fooled by the epithets of "nasty" or "less than"?
Did you teach with an open heart or a clenched fist? Where were you?
Tell her the truth. Make it your life. Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there with the moment drawn on my face like a dagger, and flung it back at itself, slicing space for you." Tell her the truth, how you lived in spite of crooked odds.
Tell her you were brave, and always, always in the company of courage, mostly the days when you just had yourself.
Tell her she was born as you were, as your mothers before, and the sisters beside them, in the age of legends, like always.
Tell her she was born just in time, just in time to lead.
(Applause)
Let me ask you all a question.
How much weapons-grade nuclear material do you think it would take to level a city the size of San Francisco?
How many of you think it would be an amount about the size of this suitcase? OK. And how about this minibus?
All right. Well actually, under the right circumstances, an amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte would be enough to kill 100,000 people instantly.
Hundreds of thousands of others would become horribly ill, and parts of the city would be uninhabitable for years, if not for decades.
But you can forget that nuclear latte, because today's nuclear weapons are hundreds of times more powerful even than those we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
And even a limited nuclear war involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons, could lead to the end of all life on the planet.
So it's really important that you know that right now we have over 15,000 nuclear weapons in the hands of nine nations.
And if you live in a city or near a military facility, one is likely pointed right at you.
In fact, if you live in any of the rural areas where nuclear weapons are stored globally, one is likely pointed at you.
About 1,800 of these weapons are on high alert, which means they can be launched within 15 minutes of a presidential command.
So I know this is a bummer of an issue, and maybe you have that -- what was it? -- psychic fatigue that we heard about a little bit earlier.
So I'm going to switch gears for just a second, and I'm going to talk about my imaginary friend, who I like to think of as Jasmine, just for a moment.
Jasmine, at the age of 25, is part of a generation that is more politically and socially engaged than anything we've seen in 50 years.
She and her friends think of themselves as change agents and leaders and activists.
I think of them as Generation Possible.
They regularly protest about the issues they care about, but nuclear weapons are not one of them, which makes sense, because Jasmine was born in 1991, at the end of the Cold War. So she didn't grow up hearing a lot about nuclear weapons.
She never had to duck and cover under her desk at school.
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter is an app in the Android store.
Nuclear weapons help win games.
And that is really a shame, because right now, we need Generation Possible to help us make some really important decisions about nuclear weapons.
For instance, will we further reduce our nuclear arsenals globally, or will we spend billions, maybe a trillion dollars, to modernize them so they last throughout the 21st century, so that by the time Jasmine is my age, she's talking to her children and maybe even her grandchildren about the threat of nuclear holocaust?
And if you're paying any attention at all to cyberthreats, or, for instance, if you've read about the Stuxnet virus or, for God's sake, if you've ever had an email account or a Yahoo account or a phone hacked, you can imagine the whole new world of hurt that could be triggered by modernization in a period of cyberwarfare.
Now, if you're paying attention to the money, a trillion dollars could go a long way to feeding and educating and employing people, all of which could reduce the threat of nuclear war to begin with. So —
(Applause)
This is really crucial right now, because nuclear weapons -- they're vulnerable.
We have solid evidence that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them.
Just this last spring, when four retirees and two taxi drivers were arrested in the Republic of Georgia for trying to sell nuclear materials for 200 million dollars, they demonstrated that the black market for this stuff is alive and well.
And it's really important, because there have been dozens of accidents involving nuclear weapons, and I bet most of us have never heard anything about them.
Just here in the United States, we've dropped nuclear weapons on the Carolinas twice.
In one case, one of the bombs, which fell out of an Air Force plane, didn't detonate because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane.
In another case, the weapon did arm when it hit the ground, and five of the switches designed to keep it from detonating failed. Luckily, the sixth one didn't.
But if that's not enough to get your attention, there was the 1995 Black Brant incident. That's when Russian radar technicians saw what they thought was a US nuclear missile streaking towards Russian airspace.
It later turned out to be a Norwegian rocket collecting data about the northern lights.
But at that time, Russian President Boris Yeltsin came within five minutes of launching a full-scale retaliatory nuclear attack against the United States.
So, most of the world's nuclear nations have committed to getting rid of these weapons of mass destruction.
But consider this: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is the most widely adopted arms control treaty in history with 190 signatories, sets no specific date by which the world's nuclear-armed nations will get rid of their nuclear weapons.
Now, when John F. Kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back, or decided to do both those things, he didn't say, "Hey, whenever you guys get to it." He gave us a deadline.
He gave us a challenge that would have been incredible just a few years earlier.
And with that challenge, he inspired scientists and marketers, astronauts and schoolteachers.
He gave us a vision.
But along with that vision, he also tried to give us -- and most people don't know this, either -- he tried to give us a partner in the form of our fiercest Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.
Because part of Kennedy's vision for the Apollo program was that it be a cooperation, not a competition, with the Soviets.
And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier, agreed.
But before that cooperation could be realized, Kennedy was assassinated, and that part of the vision was deferred.
But the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers wasn't totally extinguished.
Because in 1991, which is the year that Jasmine was born and the Soviet Union fell, these two nations engaged in a project that genuinely does seem incredible today in the truest sense of that word, which is that the US sent cash to the Russians when they needed it most, to secure loose nuclear materials and to employ out-of-work nuclear scientists.
They worked alongside American scientists to convert weapons-grade uranium into the type of fuel that can be used for nuclear power instead.
They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts." So the result is that for over 20 years, our two nations had a program that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs in the United States was essentially fueled by former Russian warheads.
So, together these two nations did something truly audacious.
But the good news is, the global community has the chance to do something just as audacious today.
To get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them, some experts tell me would take 30 years.
It would take a renaissance of sorts, the kinds of innovation that, for better or worse, underpinned both the Manhattan Project, which gave rise to nuclear weapons, and the Megatons to Megawatts program.
It would take design constraints.
These are fundamental to creativity, things like a platform for international collaboration; a date certain, which is a forcing mechanism; and a positive vision that inspires action.
It would take us to 2045.
Now, 2045 happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert.
But it's also an important date for another reason.
It's predicted to be the advent of the singularity, a new moment in human development, where the lines between artificial intelligence and human intelligence blur, where computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable and advanced technologies help us solve the 21st century's greatest problems: hunger, energy, poverty, ushering in an era of abundance.
And we all get to go to space on our way to becoming a multi-planetary species.
Now, the people who really believe this vision are the first to say they don't yet know precisely how we're going to get there.
But the values behind their vision and the willingness to ask "How might we?" have inspired a generation of innovators.
They're working backward from the outcomes they want, using the creative problem-solving methods of collaborative design.
They're busting through obstacles.
They're redefining what we all consider possible.
But here's the thing: that vision of abundance isn't compatible with a world that still relies on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine called "mutually assured destruction." It has to be about building the foundations for the 22nd century.
It has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity or, at the very least, mutually assured survival.
Now, every day, I get to meet people who are real pioneers in the field of nuclear threats.
As you can see, many of them are young women, and they're doing fiercely interesting stuff, like Mareena Robinson Snowden here, who is developing new ways, better ways, to detect nuclear warheads, which will help us overcome a critical hurdle to international disarmament. Or Melissa Hanham, who is using satellite imaging to make sense of what's going on around far-flung nuclear sites.
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe, who has been campaigning to make nuclear weapons illegal in international courts of law, and just won a big victory at the UN last week.
(Applause)
And yet, and yet, with all of our talk in this culture about moon shots, too few members of Generation Possible and those of us who mentor them are taking on nuclear weapons.
It's as if there's a taboo.
But I remember something Kennedy said that has really stuck with me, and that is something to the effect that humans can be as big as the solutions to all the problems we've created.
No problem of human destiny, he said, is beyond human beings. I believe that. And I bet a lot of you here believe that, too.
And I know Generation Possible believes it.
So it's time to commit to a date.
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter on the 100th anniversary of its inception.
After all, by 2045, we will have held billions of people hostage to the threat of nuclear annihilation.
Surely, 100 years will have been enough.
Surely, a century of economic development and the development of military strategy will have given us better ways to manage global conflict.
Surely, if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting, this is it.
Now, in the face of real threats -- for instance, North Korea's recent nuclear weapons tests, which fly in the face of sanctions -- reasonable people disagree about whether we should maintain some number of nuclear weapons to deter aggression.
But the question is: What's the magic number? Is it a thousand? Is it a hundred? Ten? And then we have to ask: Who should be responsible for them?
I think we can agree, however, that having 15,000 of them represents a greater global threat to Jasmine's generation than a promise.
So it's time we make a promise of a world in which we've broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations; in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from the future we desperately want, rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it.
It's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum to work on this old problem in new ways, to ask, "How might we?" How might we make good on a promise of greater security for Jasmine's generation in a world beyond nuclear weapons?
I truly hope you will join us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So what if I could make for you a designer baby?
What if you as a parent-to-be and I as a scientist decided to go down that road together?
What if we didn't?
What if we thought, "That's a bad idea," but many of our family, friends and coworkers did make that decision?
Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.
Let's pretend it's the year 2030, and you're a parent.
You have your daughter, Marianne, next to you, and in 2030, she is what we call a natural because she has no genetic modifications.
And because you and your partner consciously made that decision, many in your social circle, they kind of look down on you.
They think you're, like, a Luddite or a technophobe.
Marianne's best friend Jenna, who lives right next door, is a very different story.
She was born a genetically modified designer baby with numerous upgrades. Yeah. Upgrades. And these enhancements were introduced using a new genetic modification technology that goes by the funny name CRISPR, you know, like something's crisp, this is CRISPR.
The scientist that Jenna's parents hired to do this for several million dollars introduced CRISPR into a whole panel of human embryos.
And then they used genetic testing, and they predicted that that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo, would be the best of the bunch.
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.
She's sitting on the carpet in your living room playing with your daughter Marianne.
And your families have known each other for years now, and it's become very clear to you that Jenna is extraordinary.
She's incredibly intelligent.
If you're honest with yourself, she's smarter than you, and she's five years old.
She's beautiful, tall, athletic, and the list goes on and on.
And in fact, there's a whole new generation of these GM kids like Jenna.
And so far it looks like they're healthier than their parents' generation, than your generation.
And they have lower health care costs.
They're immune to a host of health conditions, including HIV / AIDS and genetic diseases.
It all sounds so great, but you can't help but have this sort of unsettling feeling, a gut feeling, that there's something just not quite right about Jenna, and you've had the same feeling about other GM kids that you've met.
You were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week that a study of these children who were born as designer babies indicates they may have some issues, like increased aggressiveness and narcissism.
But more immediately on your mind is some news that you just got from Jenna's family.
She's so smart, she's now going to be going to a special school, a different school than your daughter Marianne, and this is kind of throwing your family into a disarray.
Marianne's been crying, and last night when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight, she said, "Daddy, will Jenna even be my friend anymore?"
So now, as I've been telling you this imagined 2030 story, I have a feeling that I may have put some of you into this sci-fi frame of reference. Right? You think you're reading a sci-fi book.
Or maybe, like, in Halloween mode of thinking.
But this is really a possible reality for us, just 15 years from now.
I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher and I can see this new CRISPR technology and its potential impact.
And we may find ourselves in that reality, and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today.
And if you're still kind of thinking in sci-fi mode, consider that the world of science had a huge shock earlier this year, and the public largely doesn't even know about it.
Researchers in China just a few months ago reported the creation of genetically modified human embryos.
This was the first time in history.
And they did it using this new CRISPR technology.
It didn't work perfectly, but I still think they sort of cracked the door ajar on a Pandora's box here.
And I think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies.
Now, before I go on, some of you may hold up your hands and say, "Stop, Paul, wait a minute.
Wouldn't that be illegal?
You can't just go off and create a designer baby. "And in fact, to some extent, you're right.
In some countries, you couldn't do that.
But in many other countries, including my country, the US, there's actually no law on this, so in theory, you could do it.
And there was another development this year that resonates in this area, and that happened not so far from here over in the UK.
And the UK traditionally has been the strictest country when it comes to human genetic modification.
It was illegal there, but just a few months ago, they carved out an exception to that rule.
They passed a new law allowing the creation of genetically modified humans with the noble goal of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.
But still I think in combination these events are pushing us further towards an acceptance of human genetic modification.
So I've been talking about this CRISPR technology.
What actually is CRISPR?
So if you think about the GMOs that we're all more familiar with, like GMO tomatoes and wheat and things like that, this technology is similar to the technologies that were used to make those, but it's dramatically better, cheaper and faster.
So what is it? It's actually like a genetic Swiss army knife.
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife with different tools in it, and one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass or a GPS for our DNA, so it can home in on a certain spot.
And the next tool is like scissors that can cut the DNA right in that spot.
And finally we have a pen where we can literally rewrite the genetic code in that location.
It's really that simple.
And this technology, which came on the scene just three years ago, has taken science by storm.
It's evolving so fast, and it's so freaking exciting to scientists, and I admit I'm fascinated by it and we use it in my own lab, that I think someone is going to go that extra step and continue the GM human embryo work and maybe make designer babies.
This is so ubiquitous now.
It just came on the scene three years ago.
Thousands of labs literally have this in hand today, and they're doing important research.
Most of them are not interested in designer babies.
They're studying human disease and other important elements of science.
So there's a lot of good research going on with CRISPR.
And the fact that we can now do genetic modifications that used to take years and cost millions of dollars in a few weeks for a couple thousand bucks, to me as a scientist that's fantastic, but again, at the same time, it opens the door to people going too far.
And I think for some people the focus is not going to be so much on science.
That's not what's going to be driving them.
It's going to be ideology or the chase for a profit.
And they're going to go for designer babies.
So why should we be concerned about this?
We know from Darwin, if we go back two centuries, that evolution and genetics profoundly have impacted humanity, who we are today.
And some think there's like a social Darwinism at work in our world, and maybe even a eugenics as well.
Imagine those trends, those forces, with a booster rocket of this CRISPR technology that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.
And in fact, we can just go back one century to the last century to see the power that eugenics can have.
So my father, Peter Knoepfler, was actually born right here in Vienna.
He was Viennese, and he was born here in 1929.
And when my grandparents had little baby Peter, the world was very different. Right? It was a different Vienna. The United States was different.
The world was different.
There was a eugenics rising, and my grandparents realized, pretty quickly I think, that they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation.
And so despite this being their home and their whole extended family's home, and this area being their family's home for generations, they decided because of eugenics that they had to leave.
And they survived, but they were heartbroken, and I'm not sure my dad ever really got over leaving Vienna.
He left when he was just eight years old in 1938.
So today, I see a new eugenics kind of bubbling to the surface.
It's supposed to be a kinder, gentler, positive eugenics, different than all that past stuff.
But I think even though it's focused on trying to improve people, it could have negative consequences, and it really worries me that some of the top proponents of this new eugenics, they think CRISPR is the ticket to make it happen.
So I have to admit, you know, eugenics, we talk about making better people.
It's a tough question.
What is better when we're talking about a human being?
But I admit I think maybe a lot of us could agree that human beings, maybe we could use a little betterment.
Look at our politicians here, you know, back in the US -- God forbid we go there right now.
Maybe even if we just look in the mirror, there might be ways we think we could be better.
I might wish, honestly, that I had more hair here, instead of baldness.
Some people might wish they were taller, have a different weight, a different face.
If we could do those things, we could make those things happen, or we could make them happen in our children, it would be very seductive.
And yet coming with it would be these risks.
I talked about eugenics, but there would be risks to individuals as well.
So if we forget about enhancing people and we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification, this technology is so new and so powerful, that by accident we could make them sicker.
That easily could happen.
And there's another risk, and that is that all of the legitimate, important genetic modification research going on just in the lab -- again, no interest in designer babies -- a few people going the designer baby route, things go badly, that entire field could be damaged.
I also think it's not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification.
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child who is healthier, if there's a generation that looks like they have lower health care costs, it's possible that governments may start trying to compel their citizens to go the GM route.
Look at China's one-child policy.
It's thought that that prevented the birth of 400 million human beings.
So it's not beyond the realm of possible that genetic modification could be something that governments push.
And if designer babies become popular, in our digital age -- viral videos, social media -- what if designer babies are thought to be fashionable, and they kind of become the new glitterati, the new Kardashians or something?
(Laughter)
You know, are those trends that we really could control?
I'm not convinced that we could.
So again, today it's Halloween and when we talk about genetic modification, there's one Halloween-associated character that is talked about or invoked more than anything else, and that is Frankenstein.
Mostly that's been Frankenfoods and all this other stuff.
But if we think about this now and we think about it in the human context on a day like Halloween, if parents can in essence costume their children genetically, are we going to be talking about a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?
I don't think so.
I don't think it's going to get to that extreme.
But when we are going about hacking the human code, I think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that.
There would still be dangers.
And we can look in the past to other elements of transformative science and see how they can basically go out of control and permeate society.
So I'll just give you one example, and that is in vitro fertilization.
Almost exactly 40 years ago, test tube baby number one Louise Brown was born, and that's a great thing, and I think since then five million IVF babies have been born, bringing immeasurable happiness.
A lot of parents now can love those kids.
But if you think about, it in four decades, five million babies being born from a new technology is pretty remarkable, and the same kind of thing could happen with human genetic modification and designer babies.
So depending on the decisions we make in the next few months, the next year or so, if designer baby number one is born, within a few decades, there could well be millions of genetically modified humans.
And there's a difference there too, because if we, you in the audience, or I, if we decide to have a designer baby, then their children will also be genetically modified, and so on, because it's heritable.
So that's a big difference.
So with all of this in mind, what should we do?
There's actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C. by the US National Academy of Sciences to tackle that exact question.
What is the right path forward with human genetic modification?
I believe at this time we need a moratorium.
We have to ban this.
We should not allow creating genetically modified people, because it's just too dangerous and too unpredictable.
But there's a lot of people --
(Applause)
Thanks.
And let me say, just as a scientist, it's a little bit scary for me to say that in public, because science generally doesn't like self-regulation and things like that.
So I think we need to put a hold on this, but there are many people who not only disagree with me, they feel the exact opposite.
They're like, step on the gas, full speed ahead, let's make designer babies.
And so in the meeting in December and other meetings that are likely to follow in the next few months, it's very possible there may be no moratorium.
And I think part of the problem that we have is that all of this trend, this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans, the public hasn't known about it.
Nobody has been saying, look, this is a big deal, this is a revolution, and this could affect you in very personal ways. And so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this.
And so I hope at these meetings that there will be a role for the public to bring their voice to bear as well.
So if we kind of circle back now to 2030 again, that imagined story, and depending on the decisions we make, again, today — literally we don't have a lot of time — in the next few months, the next year or so, because this technology is spreading like wildfire.
Let's pretend we're back in that reality.
We're at a park, and our kid is swinging on the swing.
Is that kid a regular old kid, or did we decide to have a designer baby?
And let's say we went the sort of traditional route, and there's our kid swinging on the swing, and frankly, they're kind of a mess.
Their hair is all over the place like mine.
They have a stuffy nose. They're not the best student in the world.
They're adorable, you love them, but there on the swing next to them, their best friend is a GM kid, and the two of them are kind of swinging like this, and you can't help but compare them, right?
And the GM kid is swinging higher, they look better, they're a better student, they don't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe.
How is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want you to look around the room for a minute and try to find the most paranoid person here --
(Laughter)
And then I want you to point at that person for me.
(Laughter)
OK, don't actually do it.
(Laughter)
But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere.
Paranoia is caused by people that I call "takers." Takers are self-serving in their interactions.
It's all about what can you do for me.
The opposite is a giver.
It's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking, "What can I do for you?"
I wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style.
We all have moments of giving and taking.
Your style is how you treat most of the people most of the time, your default.
I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more of a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now.
[The Narcissist Test]
This is the only thing I will say today that has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be that you're a taker.
(Laughter)
Of course, not all takers are narcissists.
Some are just givers who got burned one too many times.
Then there's another kind of taker that we won't be addressing today, and that's called a psychopath.
(Laughter)
I was curious, though, about how common these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000 people across industries around the world's cultures.
And I found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking.
They choose this third style called "matching." If you're a matcher, you try to keep an even balance of give and take: quid pro quo -- I'll do something for you if you do something for me.
And that seems like a safe way to live your life.
But is it the most effective and productive way to live your life?
The answer to that question is a very definitive ... maybe.
(Laughter)
I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people.
I had engineers measuring their productivity.
(Laughter)
I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue.
(Laughter)
And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers.
The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back.
They were so busy doing other people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed.
In medical school, the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like, "I love helping others," which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody.
(Laughter)
And then in sales, too, the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople.
I actually reached out to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score.
And I asked him, "Why do you suck at your job --" I didn't ask it that way, but --
(Laughter)
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?" And he said, "Well, I just care so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them one of our crappy products."
(Laughter)
So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more as givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more before we talked about these data.
But actually, it turns out there's a twist here, because givers are often sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better.
We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team or an organization -- and the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do on every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction, employee retention -- even lower operating expenses.
So givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately, they suffer along the way.
I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed.
So I wondered, then, if givers are the worst performers, who are the best performers?
Let me start with the good news: it's not the takers.
Takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs.
And they fall at the hands of matchers.
If you're a matcher, you believe in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.
And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell out of that person.
(Laughter)
And that way justice gets served.
Well, most people are matchers.
And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around.
And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers who are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization I've ever studied, the best results belong to the givers again.
Take a look at some data I gathered from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue.
What you can see is that the givers go to both extremes.
They make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue.
The same patterns were true for engineers' productivity and medical students' grades.
Givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track.
Which raises the question: How do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel?
I want to talk about how to do that, not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready?
(Cheers)
I was going to do it anyway, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
(Laughter)
The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers are your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out.
So you have to protect the givers in your midst.
And I learned a great lesson about this from Fortune's best networker.
It's the guy, not the cat.
(Laughter)
His name is Adam Rifkin.
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people.
And his secret weapon is the five-minute favor.
Adam said, "You don't have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver.
You just have to find small ways to add large value to other people's lives." That could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other.
It could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback.
Or It might be even something as basic as saying, "You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed." And those five-minute favors are really critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves.
The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture where givers succeed, is you actually need a culture where help-seeking is the norm; where people ask a lot.
This may hit a little too close to home for some of you.
[So in all your relationships, you always have to be the giver?]
What you see with successful givers is they recognize that it's OK to be a receiver, too.
If you run an organization, we can actually make this easier. We can make it easier for people to ask for help.
A couple colleagues and I studied hospitals.
We found that on certain floors, nurses did a lot of help-seeking, and on other floors, they did very little of it.
The factor that stood out on the floors where help-seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit.
When that role was available, nurses said, "It's not embarrassing, it's not vulnerable to ask for help -- it's actually encouraged."
Help-seeking isn't important just for protecting the success and the well-being of givers.
It's also critical to getting more people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of all giving in organizations starts with a request.
But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn, they don't want to burden others.
Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew who could benefit and how.
But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture of successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team.
I figured, you want a culture of productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers.
But I was surprised to discover, actually, that that was not right -- that the negative impact of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver.
Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg just does not make a dozen.
I don't know what that means --
(Laughter)
But I hope you do.
No -- let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers will stop helping.
They'll say, "I'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks.
Why should I contribute?" Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you don't get an explosion of generosity.
More often, people are like, "Great! That person can do all our work." So, effective hiring and screening and team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers.
If you can do that well, you'll be left with givers and matchers.
The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry about the consequences.
And the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm.
So how do you catch a taker before it's too late?
We're actually pretty bad at figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions.
There's a personality trait that throws us off. It's called agreeableness, one the major dimensions of personality across cultures.
Agreeable people are warm and friendly, they're nice, they're polite.
You find a lot of them in Canada --
(Laughter)
Where there was actually a national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan and fill in the blank, "As Canadian as ..." I thought the winning entry was going to be, "As Canadian as maple syrup," or, "... ice hockey." But no, Canadians voted for their new national slogan to be -- I kid you not -- "As Canadian as possible under the circumstances."
(Laughter)
Now for those of you who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away.
How could I ever say I'm any one thing when I'm constantly adapting to try to please other people?
Disagreeable people do less of it.
They're more critical, skeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers to go to law school.
(Laughter)
That's not a joke, that's actually an empirical fact.
(Laughter)
So I always assumed that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers.
But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find no correlation between those traits, because it turns out that agreeableness-disagreeableness is your outer veneer: How pleasant is it to interact with you?
Whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives: What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others?
If you really want to judge people accurately, you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two.
(Laughter)
The agreeable givers are easy to spot: they say yes to everything.
The disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly, although you might call them by a slightly different name.
(Laughter)
We forget about the other two combinations.
There are disagreeable givers in our organizations.
There are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others' best interests at heart.
Or as an engineer put it, "Oh, disagreeable givers -- like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system."
(Laughter)
If that helps you.
(Laughter)
Disagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in our organizations, because they're the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear.
We need to do a much better job valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker."
The other combination we forget about is the deadly one -- the agreeable taker, also known as the faker.
This is the person who's nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back.
(Laughter)
And my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question, "Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved?" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down.
Givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good.
And let's face it, you all know you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver.
So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers out of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way that people define success.
Instead of saying it's all about winning a competition, people will realize success is really more about contribution.
I believe that the most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed.
And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down.
There's a name for that.
It's called "pronoia." Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being.
(Laughter)
That they're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally glowing things about you.
The great thing about a culture of givers is that's not a delusion -- it's reality. I want to live in a world where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me create that world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Growing up in Kenya, I knew I always wanted to study biochemistry.
See, I had seen the impact of the high prevalence of diseases like malaria, and I wanted to make medicines that would cure the sick.
So I worked really hard, got a scholarship to the United States, where I became a cancer researcher, and I loved it.
For someone who wants to cure diseases, there is no higher calling.
Ten years later, I returned to Kenya to do just that.
A freshly minted PhD, ready to take on this horrific illness, which in Kenya was almost certainly a death sentence.
But instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company or a hospital, I found myself drawn to a different kind of lab, working with a different kind of patient -- a patient whose illness was so serious it impacted every single person in my country; a patient who needed to get healthy fast.
That patient was my government.
(Laughter)
See, many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today.
(Laughter)
And Kenya was no exception.
When I returned to Kenya in 2014, there was 17 percent youth unemployment.
And Nairobi, the major business hub, was rated 177th on the quality of living index. It was bad.
Now, an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up.
So when government -- one of its most vital entities -- is weak or unhealthy, everyone and everything suffers.
Sometimes you might put a Band-Aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain.
Maybe some of you here have participated in a Band-Aid operation to an African country -- setting up alternative schools, building hospitals, digging wells -- because governments there either weren't or couldn't provide the services to their citizens.
We all know this is a temporary solution.
There are just some things Band-Aids can't fix, like providing an environment where businesses feel secure that they'll have an equal opportunity to be able to run and start their businesses successfully.
Or there are systems in place that would protect the private property that they create.
I would argue, only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive.
Economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop.
Business owners create new sources of income for themselves, new jobs get added into the economy and then more taxes are paid to fund public projects.
New business is good for everyone.
And it's such an important measure of economic growth, the World Bank has a ranking called the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking," which measures how easy or difficult it is to start a business in any given country.
And as you can imagine, starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government -- almost impossible.
The President of Kenya knew this, which is why in 2014, he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him to be able to help Kenya to jump-start business growth.
He set an ambitious goal: he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50 in this World Bank ranking.
In 2014 when he came, Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.
We had our work cut out for us.
Fortunately, he came to the right place.
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.
We're a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers and a cancer researcher, who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as government, we needed to examine the whole body, and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs, into the tissues, all the way to single cells, so that we could properly make a diagnosis.
So with our marching orders from the President himself, we embarked on the purest of the scientific method: collecting data -- all the data we could get our hands on -- making hypotheses, creating solutions, one after the other.
So we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies, from the tax agency, the lands office, utilities company, the agency that's responsible for registering companies, and with each of them, we observed them as they served customers, we documented their processes -- most of them were manual.
We also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand; to try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred that lead to that 136th spot on the World Bank list.
What did we find? Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days for a business owner to register their property, compared to just one day in New Zealand, which was ranked second on the World Bank list.
It took 158 days to get a new electric connection.
In Korea it took 18 days.
If you wanted to get a construction permit so you could put up a building, in Kenya, it was going to take you 125 days.
In Singapore, which is ranked first, that would only take you 26 days.
God forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract, because that process alone would take you 465 days.
And if that wasn't bad enough, you would lose 40 percent of your claim in just fees -- legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.
Now, I know what you're thinking: for there to exist such inefficiencies in an African country, there must be corruption.
The very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone.
I thought so, too, actually.
When we started out, I thought I was going to find so much corruption, I was literally going to either die or get killed in the process.
(Laughter)
But when we dug deeper, we didn't find corruption in the classic sense: slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness, waiting to grease the palms of their friends.
What we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness.
Our government was sick, because government employees felt helpless.
They felt that they were not empowered to drive change.
And when people feel stuck and helpless, they stop seeing their role in a bigger system.
They start to think the work they do doesn't matter in driving change.
And when that happens, things slow down, fall through the cracks and inefficiencies flourish.
Now imagine with me, if you had a process you had to go through -- had no other alternative -- and this process was inefficient, complex and very, very slow. What would you do?
I think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to, so that they can just take care of that for you. If that doesn't work, maybe you'd consider paying somebody to just "unofficially" take care of it on your behalf -- especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you.
Not out of malice or greed, just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on.
Unfortunately, that is the beginning of corruption.
And if left to thrive and grow, it seeps into the whole system, and before you know it, the whole body is sick.
Knowing this, we had to start by making sure that every single stakeholder we worked with had a shared vision for what we wanted to do.
So we met with everyone, from the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples from application packets, to the legal drafters at the attorney general's office, to the clerks who are responsible for serving business owners when they came to access government services.
And with them, we made sure that they understood how their day-to-day actions were impacting our ability as a country to create new jobs and to attract investments.
No one's role was too small; everyone's role was vital.
Now, guess what we started to see?
A coalition of government employees who are excited and ready to drive change, began to grow and form.
And together we started to implement changes that impacted the service delivery of our country.
The result? In just two years, Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.
(Applause)
And in recognition of the significant reforms we've been able to implement in such a short time, Kenya was recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row.
(Applause)
Are we fully healthy? No. We have some serious work still to do.
I like to think about these two years like a weight-loss program.
(Laughter)
It's that time after months of hard, grueling work at the gym, and then you get your first time to weigh yourself, and you've lost 20 pounds.
You're feeling unstoppable.
Now, some of you may think this doesn't apply to you.
You're not from Kenya.
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.
But think with me for just a moment.
When is the last time you accessed a government service?
Maybe applied for your driver's license, tried to do your taxes on your own.
It's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government.
We can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient, too corrupt, unfixable.
We might even rarely get some key government responsibilities to other sectors, to Band-Aid solutions, or to just give up and feel helpless.
But just because a system is sick doesn't mean it's dying.
We cannot afford to give up when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments.
In the end, what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells -- that's you and I -- get to the ground, roll up our sleeves, refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes, all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There is something about physics that has been really bothering me since I was a little kid.
And it's related to a question that scientists have been asking for almost 100 years, with no answer.
How do the smallest things in nature, the particles of the quantum world, match up with the largest things in nature -- planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity?
As a kid, I would puzzle over questions just like this.
I would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets, and I would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and I would marvel at how well that description matched up to our observation.
Then I would look at the stars, and I would read about how well we understand gravity, and I would think surely, there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up.
But there's not.
And the books would say, yeah, we understand a lot about these two realms separately, but when we try to link them mathematically, everything breaks.
And for 100 years, none of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster, has ever been supported by evidence.
And to little old me -- little, curious, skeptical James -- this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.
Flash-forward now to December of 2015, when I found myself smack in the middle of the physics world being flipped on its head.
It all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data: a hint of a new particle, an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question.
So I'm still a skeptical little kid, I think, but I'm also now a particle hunter.
I am a physicist at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, the largest science experiment ever mounted.
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of France and Switzerland buried 100 meters underground.
And in this tunnel, we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second, collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new, undiscovered fundamental particles.
Its design and construction took decades of work by thousands of physicists from around the globe, and in the summer of 2015, we had been working tirelessly to switch on the LHC at the highest energy that humans have ever used in a collider experiment.
Now, higher energy is important because for particles, there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass, and mass is just a number put there by nature.
To discover new particles, we need to reach these bigger numbers.
And to do that, we have to build a bigger, higher energy collider, and the biggest, highest energy collider in the world is the Large Hadron Collider.
And then, we collide protons quadrillions of times, and we collect this data very slowly, over months and months.
And then new particles might show up in our data as bumps -- slight deviations from what you expect, little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth.
For example, this bump, after months of data-taking in 2012, led to the discovery of the Higgs particle -- the Higgs boson -- and to a Nobel Prize for the confirmation of its existence.
This jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles — new answers to these long-standing questions, because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the Higgs boson.
Many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment, and frankly, to little curious me, this was the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life.
So 2015 was go time.
So June 2015, the LHC is switched back on.
My colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails, and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever.
Applause, champagne, celebration.
This was a milestone for science, and we had no idea what we would find in this brand-new data.
And then a few weeks later, we found a bump.
It wasn't a very big bump, but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow.
But on a scale of one to 10 for eyebrow raises, if 10 indicates that you've discovered a new particle, this eyebrow raise is about a four.
(Laughter)
I spent hours, days, weeks in secret meetings, arguing with my colleagues over this little bump, poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks to see if it would withstand scrutiny.
But even after months of working feverishly -- sleeping in our offices and not going home, candy bars for dinner, coffee by the bucketful -- physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams --
(Laughter)
This little bump would not go away.
So after a few months, we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message: this little bump is interesting but it's not definitive, so let's keep an eye on it as we take more data.
So we were trying to be extremely cool about it.
And the world ran with it anyway.
The news loved it.
People said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the Higgs boson discovery.
Better than that, my theorist colleagues -- I love my theorist colleagues -- my theorist colleagues wrote 500 papers about this little bump.
(Laughter)
The world of particle physics had been flipped on its head.
But what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool?
This little bump was unique.
This little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions whose debris consisted of only two photons, two particles of light.
And that's rare.
Particle collisions are not like automobile collisions.
They have different rules.
When two particles collide at almost the speed of light, the quantum world takes over.
And in the quantum world, these two particles can briefly create a new particle that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particles that hit our detector.
Imagine a car collision where the two cars vanish upon impact, a bicycle appears in their place --
(Laughter)
And then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards, which hit our detector.
(Laughter)
Hopefully, not literally. They're very expensive.
Events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare.
And because of the special quantum properties of photons, there's a very small number of possible new particles -- these mythical bicycles -- that can give birth to only two photons.
But one of these options is huge, and it has to do with that long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid, about gravity.
Gravity may seem super strong to you, but it's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature.
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump, but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.
The strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature?
It's 10 to the minus 39.
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.
Worse than that, all of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described by this thing we call the Standard Model, which is our current best description of nature at its smallest scales, and quite frankly, one of the most successful achievements of humankind -- except for gravity, which is absent from the Standard Model. It's crazy. It's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing.
We feel a little bit of it, but where's the rest of it? No one knows.
But one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution.
You and I -- even you in the back -- we live in three dimensions of space.
I hope that's a non-controversial statement.
(Laughter)
All of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space.
In fact, a particle is just another name for an excitation in a three-dimensional field; a localized wobbling in space.
More importantly, all the math that we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are only three dimensions of space.
But math is math, and we can play around with our math however we want.
And people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time, but it's always been an abstract mathematical concept.
I mean, just look around you -- you at the back, look around -- there's clearly only three dimensions of space.
But what if that's not true?
What if the missing gravity is leaking into an extra-spatial dimension that's invisible to you and I?
What if gravity is just as strong as the other forces if you were to view it in this extra-spatial dimension, and what you and I experience is a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak?
If this were true, we would have to expand our Standard Model of particles to include an extra particle, a hyperdimensional particle of gravity, a special graviton that lives in extra-spatial dimensions.
I see the looks on your faces.
You should be asking me the question, "How in the world are we going to test this crazy, science fiction idea, stuck as we are in three dimensions?" The way we always do, by slamming together two protons --
(Laughter)
two particles of light. Hard enough that the collision reverberates into any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there, momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the LHC and spits off two photons,
And this hypothetical, extra-dimensional graviton is one of the only possible, hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little, two-photon bump.
So, the possibility of explaining the mysteries of gravity and of discovering extra dimensions of space -- perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool over our little, two-photon bump.
A discovery of this type would rewrite the textbooks.
But remember, the message from us experimentalists that actually were doing this work at the time, was very clear: we need more data.
With more data, the little bump will either turn into a nice, crisp Nobel Prize --
(Laughter)
Or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump and turn it into a nice, smooth line.
So we took more data, and with five times the data, several months later, our little bump turned into a smooth line.
The news reported on a "huge disappointment," on "faded hopes," and on particle physicists "being sad." Given the tone of the coverage, you'd think that we had decided to shut down the LHC and go home.
(Laughter)
But that's not what we did. But why not? I mean, if I didn't discover a particle -- and I didn't -- if I didn't discover a particle, why am I here talking to you?
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame and go home?
Particle physicists are explorers. And very much of what we do is cartography.
Let me put it this way: forget about the LHC for a second.
Imagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet, searching for aliens.
What is your first task?
To immediately orbit the planet, land, take a quick look around for any big, obvious signs of life, and report back to home base.
That's the stage we're at now.
We took a first look at the LHC for any new, big, obvious-to-spot particles, and we can report that there are none.
We saw a weird-looking alien bump on a distant mountain, but once we got closer, we saw it was a rock.
But then what do we do?
Do we just give up and fly away? Absolutely not; we would be terrible scientists if we did.
No, we spend the next couple of decades exploring, mapping out the territory, sifting through the sand with a fine instrument, peeking under every stone, drilling under the surface.
New particles can either show up immediately as big, obvious-to-spot bumps, or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking.
Humanity has just begun its exploration at the LHC at this big high energy, and we have much searching to do.
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years, we still find no new particles?
We build a bigger machine.
(Laughter)
We search at higher energies.
We search at higher energies.
Planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel that will collide particles at 10 times the energy of the LHC.
We don't decide where nature places new particles.
We only decide to keep exploring.
But what if, even after a 100-kilometer tunnel or a 500-kilometer tunnel or a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space between the Earth and the Moon, we still find no new particles?
Then perhaps we're doing particle physics wrong.
(Laughter)
Perhaps we need to rethink things.
Maybe we need more resources, technology, expertise than what we currently have.
We already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the LHC, but imagine designing a particle physics experiment using such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself to discover a hyperdimensional graviton.
But what if? What if the ultimate question: What if even artificial intelligence can't help us answer our questions?
What if these open questions, for centuries, are destined to be unanswered for the foreseeable future?
What if the stuff that's bothered me since I was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime?
Then that ... will be even more fascinating.
We will be forced to think in completely new ways.
We'll have to go back to our assumptions, and determine if there was a flaw somewhere.
And we'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need fresh eyes on these century-old problems.
I don't have the answers, and I'm still searching for them.
But someone -- maybe she's in school right now, maybe she's not even born yet -- could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way, and to point out that perhaps we're just asking the wrong questions.
Which would not be the end of physics, but a novel beginning.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here's a startling fact: in the 45 years since the introduction of the automated teller machine, those vending machines that dispense cash, the number of human bank tellers employed in the United States has roughly doubled, from about a quarter of a million to a half a million.
A quarter of a million in 1970 to about a half a million today, with 100,000 added since the year 2000.
These facts, revealed in a recent book by Boston University economist James Bessen, raise an intriguing question: what are all those tellers doing, and why hasn't automation eliminated their employment by now?
If you think about it, many of the great inventions of the last 200 years were designed to replace human labor.
Tractors were developed to substitute mechanical power for human physical toil.
Assembly lines were engineered to replace inconsistent human handiwork with machine perfection.
Computers were programmed to swap out error-prone, inconsistent human calculation with digital perfection.
These inventions have worked.
We no longer dig ditches by hand, pound tools out of wrought iron or do bookkeeping using actual books.
And yet, the fraction of US adults employed in the labor market is higher now in 2016 than it was 125 years ago, in 1890, and it's risen in just about every decade in the intervening 125 years.
This poses a paradox. Our machines increasingly do our work for us.
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete?
Why are there still so many jobs?
(Laughter)
I'm going to try to answer that question tonight, and along the way, I'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work and the challenges that automation does and does not pose for our society.
Why are there so many jobs?
There are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake.
One has to do with human genius and creativity.
The other has to do with human insatiability, or greed, if you like.
I'm going to call the first of these the O-ring principle, and it determines the type of work that we do.
The second principle is the never-get-enough principle, and it determines how many jobs there actually are.
Let's start with the O-ring.
ATMs, automated teller machines, had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment.
As you would expect, they replaced a lot of teller tasks.
The number of tellers per branch fell by about a third.
But banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches, and the number of bank branches increased by about 40 percent in the same time period.
The net result was more branches and more tellers.
But those tellers were doing somewhat different work.
As their routine, cash-handling tasks receded, they became less like checkout clerks and more like salespeople, forging relationships with customers, solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments: more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job.
There's a general principle here.
Most of the work that we do requires a multiplicity of skills, and brains and brawn, technical expertise and intuitive mastery, perspiration and inspiration in the words of Thomas Edison.
In general, automating some subset of those tasks doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.
In fact, it makes them more important.
It increases their economic value.
Let me give you a stark example.
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded and crashed back down to Earth less than two minutes after takeoff.
The cause of that crash, it turned out, was an inexpensive rubber O-ring in the booster rocket that had frozen on the launchpad the night before and failed catastrophically moments after takeoff.
In this multibillion dollar enterprise that simple rubber O-ring made the difference between mission success and the calamitous death of seven astronauts.
An ingenious metaphor for this tragic setting is the O-ring production function, named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer after the Challenger disaster.
The O-ring production function conceives of the work as a series of interlocking steps, links in a chain.
Every one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed.
If any of them fails, the mission, or the product or the service, comes crashing down.
This precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication, which is that improvements in the reliability of any one link in the chain increases the value of improving any of the other links.
Concretely, if most of the links are brittle and prone to breakage, the fact that your link is not that reliable is not that important.
Probably something else will break anyway.
But as all the other links become robust and reliable, the importance of your link becomes more essential.
In the limit, everything depends upon it.
The reason the O-ring was critical to space shuttle Challenger is because everything else worked perfectly.
If the Challenger were kind of the space era equivalent of Microsoft Windows 2000 --
(Laughter)
the reliability of the O-ring wouldn't have mattered because the machine would have crashed.
(Laughter)
Here's the broader point.
In much of the work that we do, we are the O-rings.
Yes, ATMs could do certain cash-handling tasks faster and better than tellers, but that didn't make tellers superfluous.
It increased the importance of their problem-solving skills and their relationships with customers.
The same principle applies if we're building a building, if we're diagnosing and caring for a patient, or if we are teaching a class to a roomful of high schoolers.
As our tools improve, technology magnifies our leverage and increases the importance of our expertise and our judgment and our creativity.
And that brings me to the second principle: never get enough.
You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it, that says the jobs that people do will be important.
They can't be done by machines, but they still need to be done.
But that doesn't tell me how many jobs there will need to be. If you think about it, isn't it kind of self-evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something, we've basically worked our way out of a job?
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment was on farms.
Today, it's less than two percent.
Why are there so few farmers today?
It's not because we're eating less.
(Laughter)
A century of productivity growth in farming means that now, a couple of million farmers can feed a nation of 320 million.
That's amazing progress, but it also means there are only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.
Farming is only one example.
There are many others like it.
But what's true about a single product or service or industry has never been true about the economy as a whole.
Many of the industries in which we now work -- health and medicine, finance and insurance, electronics and computing -- were tiny or barely existent a century ago.
Many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on -- air conditioners, sport utility vehicles, computers and mobile devices -- were unattainably expensive, or just hadn't been invented a century ago.
As automation frees our time, increases the scope of what is possible, we invent new products, new ideas, new services that command our attention, occupy our time and spur consumption.
You may think some of these things are frivolous -- extreme yoga, adventure tourism, Pokémon GO -- and I might agree with you.
But people desire these things, and they're willing to work hard for them.
The average worker in 2015 wanting to attain the average living standard in 1915 could do so by working just 17 weeks a year, one third of the time.
But most people don't choose to do that.
They are willing to work hard to harvest the technological bounty that is available to them.
Material abundance has never eliminated perceived scarcity.
In the words of economist Thorstein Veblen, invention is the mother of necessity.
Now... So if you accept these two principles, the O-ring principle and the never-get-enough principle, then you agree with me. There will be jobs.
Does that mean there's nothing to worry about?
Automation, employment, robots and jobs -- it'll all take care of itself? No. That is not my argument.
Automation creates wealth by allowing us to do more work in less time.
There is no economic law that says that we will use that wealth well, and that is worth worrying about.
Consider two countries, Norway and Saudi Arabia.
Both oil-rich nations, it's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground.
(Laughter)
But they haven't used that wealth equally well to foster human prosperity, human prospering.
Norway is a thriving democracy.
By and large, its citizens work and play well together.
It's typically numbered between first and fourth in rankings of national happiness.
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy in which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement.
It's typically ranked 35th among nations in happiness, which is low for such a wealthy nation.
Just by way of comparison, the US is typically ranked around 12th or 13th.
The difference between these two countries is not their wealth and it's not their technology.
It's their institutions.
Norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility.
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards while frustrating many other human strivings.
Two countries, both wealthy, not equally well off.
And this brings me to the challenge that we face today, the challenge that automation poses for us.
The challenge is not that we're running out of work.
The US has added 14 million jobs since the depths of the Great Recession.
The challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs, and many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs that are being created.
Employment growth in the United States and in much of the developed world looks something like a barbell with increasing poundage on either end of the bar.
On the one hand, you have high-education, high-wage jobs like doctors and nurses, programmers and engineers, marketing and sales managers.
Employment is robust in these jobs, employment growth.
Similarly, employment growth is robust in many low-skill, low-education jobs like food service, cleaning, security, home health aids.
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking in many middle-education, middle-wage, middle-class jobs, like blue-collar production and operative positions and white-collar clerical and sales positions.
The reasons behind this contracting middle are not mysterious.
Many of those middle-skill jobs use well-understood rules and procedures that can increasingly be codified in software and executed by computers.
The challenge that this phenomenon creates, what economists call employment polarization, is that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder, shrinks the size of the middle class and threatens to make us a more stratified society.
On the one hand, a set of highly paid, highly educated professionals doing interesting work, on the other, a large number of citizens in low-paid jobs whose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent.
That is not my vision of progress, and I doubt that it is yours.
But here is some encouraging news.
We have faced equally momentous economic transformations in the past, and we have come through them successfully.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, when automation was eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs -- remember that tractor? -- the farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment, a generation of youth no longer needed on the farm but not prepared for industry.
Rising to this challenge, they took the radical step of requiring that their entire youth population remain in school and continue their education to the ripe old age of 16.
This was called the high school movement, and it was a radically expensive thing to do.
Not only did they have to invest in the schools, but those kids couldn't work at their jobs.
It also turned out to be one of the best investments the US made in the 20th century.
It gave us the most skilled, the most flexible and the most productive workforce in the world.
To see how well this worked, imagine taking the labor force of 1899 and bringing them into the present.
Despite their strong backs and good characters, many of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills to do all but the most mundane jobs.
Many of them would be unemployable.
What this example highlights is the primacy of our institutions, most especially our schools, in allowing us to reap the harvest of our technological prosperity.
It's foolish to say there's nothing to worry about.
Clearly we can get this wrong.
If the US had not invested in its schools and in its skills a century ago with the high school movement, we would be a less prosperous, a less mobile and probably a lot less happy society.
But it's equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed.
That's not decided by the machines.
It's not even decided by the market.
It's decided by us and by our institutions.
Now, I started this talk with a paradox.
Our machines increasingly do our work for us. Why doesn't that make our labor superfluous, our skills redundant?
Isn't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell is paved with our own great inventions?
History has repeatedly offered an answer to that paradox.
The first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage, increases the importance, the added value of our expertise, our judgment and our creativity.
That's the O-ring.
The second part of the answer is our endless inventiveness and bottomless desires means that we never get enough, never get enough.
There's always new work to do.
Adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change creates real challenges, seen most clearly in our polarized labor market and the threat that it poses to economic mobility.
Rising to this challenge is not automatic. It's not costless. It's not easy. But it is feasible.
And here is some encouraging news.
Because of our amazing productivity, we're rich.
Of course we can afford to invest in ourselves and in our children as America did a hundred years ago with the high school movement.
Arguably, we can't afford not to.
Now, you may be thinking, Professor Autor has told us a heartwarming tale about the distant past, the recent past, maybe the present, but probably not the future.
Because everybody knows that this time is different. Right? Is this time different?
Of course this time is different.
Every time is different.
On numerous occasions in the last 200 years, scholars and activists have raised the alarm that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete: for example, the Luddites in the early 1800s; US Secretary of Labor James Davis in the mid-1920s; Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief in 1982; and of course, many scholars, pundits, technologists and media figures today.
These predictions strike me as arrogant.
These self-proclaimed oracles are in effect saying, "If I can't think of what people will do for work in the future, then you, me and our kids aren't going to think of it either." I don't have the guts to take that bet against human ingenuity.
Look, I can't tell you what people are going to do for work a hundred years from now.
But the future doesn't hinge on my imagination.
If I were a farmer in Iowa in the year 1900, and an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor, in the next hundred years, agricultural employment is going to fall from 40 percent of all jobs to two percent purely due to rising productivity.
What do you think the other 38 percent of workers are going to do?" I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.
We'll do app development, radiological medicine, yoga instruction, Bitmoji."
(Laughter)
I wouldn't have had a clue.
But I hope I would have had the wisdom to say, "Wow, a 95 percent reduction in farm employment with no shortage of food.
That's an amazing amount of progress.
I hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do with all of that prosperity."
And by and large, I would say that it has.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So when you look out at the stars at night, it's amazing what you can see. It's beautiful. But what's more amazing is what you can't see, because what we know now is that around every star or almost every star, there's a planet, or probably a few.
So what this picture isn't showing you are all the planets that we know about out there in space.
But when we think about planets, we tend to think of faraway things that are very different from our own.
But here we are on a planet, and there are so many things that are amazing about Earth that we're searching far and wide to find things that are like that.
And when we're searching, we're finding amazing things.
But I want to tell you about an amazing thing here on Earth.
And that is that every minute, 400 pounds of hydrogen and almost seven pounds of helium escape from Earth into space.
And this is gas that is going off and never coming back.
So hydrogen, helium and many other things make up what's known as the Earth's atmosphere.
The atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that's seen here from the International Space Station, a photograph that some astronauts took.
And this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish.
It protects our planet from too many impacts, from meteorites and the like.
And it's such an amazing phenomenon that the fact that it's disappearing should frighten you, at least a little bit.
So this process is something that I study and it's called atmospheric escape.
So atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth.
It's part of what it means to be a planet, if you ask me, because planets, not just here on Earth but throughout the universe, can undergo atmospheric escape.
And the way it happens actually tells us about planets themselves.
Because when you think about the solar system, you might think about this picture here.
And you would say, well, there are eight planets, maybe nine.
So for those of you who are stressed by this picture, I will add somebody for you.
(Laughter)
Courtesy of New Horizons, we're including Pluto.
And the thing here is, for the purposes of this talk and atmospheric escape, Pluto is a planet in my mind, in the same way that planets around other stars that we can't see are also planets.
So fundamental characteristics of planets include the fact that they are bodies that are bound together by gravity.
So it's a lot of material just stuck together with this attractive force.
And these bodies are so big and have so much gravity.
That's why they're round.
So when you look at all of these, including Pluto, they're round.
So you can see that gravity is really at play here.
But another fundamental characteristic about planets is what you don't see here, and that's the star, the Sun, that all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around.
And that's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape.
The reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets is because stars offer planets particles and light and heat that can cause the atmospheres to go away.
So if you think of a hot-air balloon, or you look at this picture of lanterns in Thailand at a festival, you can see that hot air can propel gasses upward.
And if you have enough energy and heating, which our Sun does, that gas, which is so light and only bound by gravity, it can escape into space.
And so this is what's actually causing atmospheric escape here on Earth and also on other planets -- that interplay between heating from the star and overcoming the force of gravity on the planet.
So I've told you that it happens at the rate of 400 pounds a minute for hydrogen and almost seven pounds for helium.
But what does that look like?
Well, even in the '80s, we took pictures of the Earth in the ultraviolet using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.
So these two images of the Earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen looks like, shown in red.
And you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen in that white glimmer in the circle showing you the auroras and also some wisps around the tropics.
So these are pictures that conclusively show us that our atmosphere isn't just tightly bound to us here on Earth but it's actually reaching out far into space, and at an alarming rate, I might add.
But the Earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape.
Mars, our nearest neighbor, is much smaller than Earth, so it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere.
And so even though Mars has an atmosphere, we can see it's much thinner than the Earth's. Just look at the surface. You see craters indicating that it didn't have an atmosphere that could stop those impacts.
Also, we see that it's the "red planet," and atmospheric escape plays a role in Mars being red.
That's because we think Mars used to have a wetter past, and when water had enough energy, it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen, and hydrogen being so light, it escaped into space, and the oxygen that was left oxidized or rusted the ground, making that familiar rusty red color that we see.
So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars and say that atmospheric escape probably happened, but NASA has a probe that's currently at Mars called the MAVEN satellite, and its actual job is to study atmospheric escape.
It's the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.
And results from it have already shown pictures very similar to what you've seen here on Earth.
We've long known that Mars was losing its atmosphere, but we have some stunning pictures.
Here, for example, you can see in the red circle is the size of Mars, and in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet.
So it's reaching out more than 10 times the size of the planet, far enough away that it's no longer bound to that planet.
It's escaping off into space.
And this helps us confirm ideas, like why Mars is red, from that lost hydrogen.
But hydrogen isn't the only gas that's lost.
I mentioned helium on Earth and some oxygen and nitrogen, and from MAVEN we can also look at the oxygen being lost from Mars.
And you can see that because oxygen is heavier, it can't get as far as the hydrogen, but it's still escaping away from the planet.
You don't see it all confined into that red circle.
So the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet but we can study it elsewhere and send spacecraft allows us to learn about the past of planets but also about planets in general and Earth's future.
So one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we can't see.
And I should just note though, before I go on to that, I'm not going to show you photos like this of Pluto, which might be disappointing, but that's because we don't have them yet.
But the New Horizons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape being lost from the planet.
So stay tuned and look out for that.
But the planets that I did want to talk about are known as transiting exoplanets.
So any planet orbiting a star that's not our Sun is called an exoplanet, or extrasolar planet.
And these planets that we call transiting have the special feature that if you look at that star in the middle, you'll see that actually it's blinking.
And the reason that it's blinking is because there are planets that are going past it all the time, and it's that special orientation where the planets are blocking the light from the star that allows us to see that light blinking.
And by surveying the stars in the night sky for this blinking motion, we are able to find planets.
This is how we've now been able to detect over 5,000 planets in our own Milky Way, and we know there are many more out there, like I mentioned.
So when we look at the light from these stars, what we see, like I said, is not the planet itself, but you actually see a dimming of the light that we can record in time.
So the light drops as the planet decreases in front of the star, and that's that blinking that you saw before.
So not only do we detect the planets but we can look at this light in different wavelengths.
So I mentioned looking at the Earth and Mars in ultraviolet light.
If we look at transiting exoplanets with the Hubble Space Telescope, we find that in the ultraviolet, you see much bigger blinking, much less light from the star, when the planet is passing in front.
And we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere of hydrogen all around the planet that's making it look puffier and thus blocking more of the light that you see.
So using this technique, we've actually been able to discover a few transiting exoplanets that are undergoing atmospheric escape.
And these planets can be called hot Jupiters, for some of the ones we've found.
And that's because they're gas planets like Jupiter, but they're so close to their star, about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.
And because there's all this lightweight gas that's ready to escape, and all this heating from the star, you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape.
So unlike our 400 pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on Earth, for these planets, you're losing 1.3 billion pounds of hydrogen every minute.
So you might think, well, does this make the planet cease to exist? And this is a question that people wondered when they looked at our solar system, because planets closer to the Sun are rocky, and planets further away are bigger and more gaseous.
Could you have started with something like Jupiter that was actually close to the Sun, and get rid of all the gas in it?
We now think that if you start with something like a hot Jupiter, you actually can't end up with Mercury or the Earth.
But if you started with something smaller, it's possible that enough gas would have gotten away that it would have significantly impacted it and left you with something very different than what you started with.
So all of this sounds sort of general, and we might think about the solar system, but what does this have to do with us here on Earth?
Well, in the far future, the Sun is going to get brighter.
And as that happens, the heating that we find from the Sun is going to become very intense.
In the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot Jupiter, gas is going to stream off from the Earth.
And so what we can look forward to, or at least prepare for, is the fact that in the far future, the Earth is going to look more like Mars.
Our hydrogen, from water that is broken down, is going to escape into space more rapidly, and we're going to be left with this dry, reddish planet.
So don't fear, it's not for a few billion years, so there's some time to prepare.
(Laughter)
But I wanted you to be aware of what's going on, not just in the future, but atmospheric escape is happening as we speak.
So there's a lot of amazing science that you hear about happening in space and planets that are far away, and we are studying these planets to learn about these worlds.
But as we learn about Mars or exoplanets like hot Jupiters, we find things like atmospheric escape that tell us a lot more about our planet here on Earth.
So consider that the next time you think that space is far away.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We're going to share a lot of secrets today, you and I, and in doing so, I hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex.
How many here have ever been catcalled by a stranger? Lots of women. For me, the time I remember best is when that stranger was a student of mine.
He came up to me after class that night and his words confirmed what I already knew: "I am so sorry, professor.
If I had known it was you, I would never have said those things. "(Laughter) I wasn't a person to him until I was his professor.
This concept, called objectification, is the foundation of sexism, and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives.
We see it in the government that refuses to punish men for raping women.
We see it in advertisements.
How many of you have seen an advertisement that uses a woman's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product?
Or movie after movie after movie that portrays women as only love interests?
These examples might seem inconsequential and harmless, but they're insidious, slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people.
We see this in the school that sends home a 10-year-old girl because her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn, or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women over and over, or the woman who is killed because she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the dance floor.
Media plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women.
Let's consider the classic romantic comedy.
We're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies, two kinds of desirable women, anyway.
The first is the sexy bombshell.
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body.
Our leading man has no trouble identifying her and even less trouble having sex with her.
The second is our leading lady, the beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with despite not noticing her at first or not liking her if he did.
The first is the slut.
She is to be consumed and forgotten.
She is much too available.
The second is desirable but modest, and therefore worthy of our leading man's future babies. Marriage material. We're actually told that women have two roles, but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman.
On the rare occasion that I share with a new acquaintance that I study sex, if they don't end the conversation right then, they're usually pretty intrigued. "Oh. Tell me more."
"Oh. Huh. Do pregnant people even have sex?
Have you thought about studying sexual desire or orgasms?
That would be interesting and sexy." Tell me. What are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman?
I asked this question in a survey of over 500 adults, and most responded with "belly" or "round" and "cute." This didn't surprise me too much.
(Laughter)
When we label an adult as cute, though, we take away a lot of their intelligence, their complexity.
We reduce them to childlike qualities.
I also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that they're partnered with is pregnant, and then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant, and then tell me the first words that come to mind when they imagine having sex.
(Laughter) Most of the responses were negative. "Gross." "Awkward." "Not sexy." "Odd." "Uncomfortable." "How?" "Not worth the trouble." "Not worth the risk." That last one really stuck with me.
We might think that because we divorce pregnant women and moms from sexuality, we are removing the constraints of sexual objectification.
They experience less sexism. Right? Not exactly. What happens instead is a different kind of objectification.
In my efforts to explain this to others, one conversation led to the Venus of Willendorf, a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty, hence the name Venus.
This theory was later revised, though, when scholars noted the sculptor's obvious focus on the figurine's reproductive features: large breasts, considered ideal for nursing; a round, possibly pregnant belly; the remnants of red dye, alluding to menstruation or birth.
They also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down because her tiny feet don't allow her to be freestanding.
She also had no face.
For this reason, it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a portrait of a person.
She was an object.
In the history of her interpretation, she went from object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction.
I think this transition speaks more about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose than the actual purpose of the figurine herself.
When a woman becomes pregnant, she leaves the realm of men's sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child-rearing role.
In doing so, she also becomes the property of the community, considered very important but only because she's pregnant. Right? I've taken to calling this the Willendorf effect, and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life.
(Laughter) Has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant?
Yeah. Lots of you, right?
So how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during pregnancy, maybe without even asking your permission first?
Or told what you can and cannot eat by somebody who is not your doctor, your medical care provider?
Or asked private questions about your birth plan?
And then told why those choices are all wrong?
Yeah, me too.
Or had a server refuse to bring you a glass of wine?
This one might give you pause, I know, but stay with me.
This is a huge secret.
It is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy.
Many of us don't know this because doctors don't trust pregnant women with this secret — (Laughter) especially if she's less educated or a woman of color.
What this tells us is, this Willendorf effect, it's also classist and racist.
It's present when the government reminds women with every new anti-choice bill that the contents of her uterus are not her own, or when an ob-gyn says, "While it's safe to have sex during pregnancy, sometimes you never know.
Better safe than sorry, right?" She's denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy under the guise of "be a good mother." We don't trust her to make her own decisions.
She's cute, remember?
When we tell women that sexual pleasure -- excuse me.
When we tell women that sex isn't worth the risk during pregnancy, what we're telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn't matter. So what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn't matter, even though the needs of her fetus are not at odds with her own needs.
So medical providers, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have the opportunity to educate about the safety of sex during pregnancy.
So what do the experts say?
ACOG actually has no public official statement about the safety of sex during pregnancy.
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic is generally positive but presented with a caveat: "Although most women can safely have sex throughout pregnancy, sometimes it's best to be cautious." Some women don't want to have sex during pregnancy, and that's OK.
Some women do want to have sex during pregnancy, and that's OK, too.
What needs to stop is society telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies. (Applause) Pregnant women are not faceless, identity-less vessels of reproduction who can't stand on their own two feet.
But the truth is, the real secret is, we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.
We refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women or women who don't want children even exist. "Oh, it's just a phase... she just needs the right man to come along." Every time a woman has sex simply because it feels good, it is revolutionary. She is revolutionary. She is pushing back against society's insistence that she exist simply for men's pleasure or for reproduction.
A woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary, because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself. (Applause) That is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal.
That is a woman who insists that you make room for her at the table of power, and that is the most terrifying of all because we can't make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold. (Applause) I have one last secret for you.
I am the mother of two boys and we could use your help.
Even though my boys hear me say regularly that it's important for men to recognize women as equals and they see their father modeling this, we need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home.
This is not a men's problem or a women's problem.
This is everyone's problem, and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality.
what they can and cannot do with their bodies. (Applause) For starters, we have got to stop telling women This includes not treating pregnant women like community property.
If you don't know her, don't even ask to touch her belly.
You wouldn't anybody else.
Don't tell her what she can and cannot eat.
Don't ask her private details about her medical decisions.
This also includes understanding that even if you are personally against abortion, you can still fight for a woman's right to choose.
When it comes to women's equality, the two need not oppose one another.
If you're somebody who has sex with women, prioritize her pleasure.
If you don't know how, ask.
If you have children — (Laughter) have conversations about sex as early as possible, because kids don't look up s-e-x in the dictionary anymore. They look it up on the internet.
And when you're having those conversations about sex, don't center them on reproduction only.
People have sex for many reasons, some because they want a baby, but most of us have sex because it feels good. Admit it. And regardless of whether you have children or not, support comprehensive sex education that doesn't shame our teenagers. (Applause) Nothing positive comes from shaming teens for their sexual desires, behaviors, other than positive STD and pregnancy tests.
Every single day, we are all given the opportunity to disrupt patterns of inequality.
I think we can all agree that it's worth the trouble to do so.
(Applause) Thank you.
I am a chef and a food policy guy, but I come from a whole family of teachers.
My sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago.
My father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade.
My aunt and uncle were professors.
My cousins all teach.
Everybody in my family, basically, teaches except for me.
They taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions.
So what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children?
There's obviously many important questions, but I think the following is a good place to start: What do we think the connection is between a child's growing mind and their growing body?
What can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients?
What can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally going hungry?
And with all the resources that we are pouring into schools, we should stop and ask ourselves: Are we really setting our kids up for success?
Now, a few years ago, I was a judge on a cooking competition called "Chopped." Four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes.
Except for this episode -- it was a very special one.
Instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight — something that I would know nothing about — (Laughter) these chefs were school chefs; you know, the women that you used to call "lunch ladies," but the ones I insist we call "school chefs." Now, these women — God bless these women — spend their day cooking for thousands of kids, breakfast and lunch, with only $2.68 per lunch, with only about a dollar of that actually going to the food.
In this episode, the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa.
Now, I know it's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch, and we've made a lot of progress on nutrition, but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias.
(Laughter)
So this was a challenge. But the dish that I will never forget was cooked by a woman named Cheryl Barbara.
Cheryl was the nutrition director at High School in the Community in Connecticut.
She cooked this delicious pasta. It was amazing. It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage, kale, Parmesan cheese.
It was delicious, like, restaurant-quality good, except -- she basically just threw the quinoa, pretty much uncooked, into the dish.
(Laughter) It was a strange choice, and it was super crunchy. So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing that you're supposed to do, and I asked her why she did that.
(Laughter) Cheryl responded, "Well, first, I don't know what quinoa is." "But I do know that it's a Monday, and that in my school, at High School in the Community, I always cook pasta."
See, Cheryl explained that for many of her kids, there were no meals on the weekends.
No meals on Saturday.
No meals on Sunday, either.
So she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat.
Something that would stick to their ribs, she said.
Something that would fill them up.
Cheryl talked about how, by the time Monday came, her kids' hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn't even begin to think about learning.
Food was the only thing on their mind. The only thing. And unfortunately, the stats -- they tell the same story.
So, let's put this into the context of a child.
And we're going to focus on the most important meal of the day, breakfast. Meet Allison. She's 12 years old, she's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up.
If Allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids, here's what's going to follow.
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal, one with fruit and milk, one lower in sugar and salt, dramatically increase. Allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid.
She'll have better behavior. She'll have better attendance, and she'll show up on time more often. Why? Well, because there's a good meal waiting for her at school.
Overall, Allison is in much better health than the average school kid.
So what about that kid who doesn't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for him? Well, meet Tommy. He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.
He wants to be a doctor.
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten, he's already underperforming in math.
By the time he's in third grade, he's got lower math and reading scores.
By the time he's 11, it's more likely that Tommy will have to have repeated a grade.
Research shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment, particularly at breakfast, have poor cognitive function overall.
So how widespread is this problem?
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.
Let me give you two stats that seem like they're on opposite ends of the issue, but are actually two sides of the same coin.
On the one hand, one in six Americans are food insecure, including 16 million children — almost 20 percent — are food insecure.
In this city alone, in New York City, 474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year. It's crazy. On the other hand, diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country, by far.
And fully a third of the kids that we've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime.
Now, what's hard to put together but is true is that, many times, these are the same children.
So they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford.
But then by the end of the month, food stamps run out or hours get cut at work, and they don't have the money to cover the basic cost of food.
But we should be able to solve this problem, right?
We know what the answers are.
As part of my work at the White House, we instituted a program that for all schools that had 40 percent more low-income kids, we could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school. For free.
This program has been incredibly successful, because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast.
And that was the barrier of stigma.
See, schools serve breakfast before school, and it was only available for the poor kids.
So everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help.
Now, all kids, no matter how much or how little their parents make, have a lot of pride. So what happened? Well, the schools that have implemented this program saw an increase in math and reading scores by 17.5 percent. 17.5 percent. And research shows that when kids have a consistent, nutritious breakfast, their chances of graduating increase by 20 percent. 20 percent. When we give our kids the nourishment they need, we give them the chance to thrive, both in the classroom and beyond.
Now, you don't have to trust me on this, but you should talk to Donna Martin.
I love Donna Martin.
Donna Martin is the school nutrition director at Burke County in Waynesboro, Georgia.
Burke County is one of the poorest districts in the fifth-poorest state in the country, and about 100 percent of Donna's students live at or below the poverty line.
A few years ago, Donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming, and overhaul her nutrition standards.
She improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains.
She served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids.
Why? And she implemented a dinner program. Well, many of her kids didn't have dinner when they went home.
So how did they respond? Well, the kids loved the food.
They loved the better nutrition, and they loved not being hungry.
But Donna's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place.
His name from Eric Parker, and he was the head football coach for the Burke County Bears.
Now, Coach Parker had coached mediocre teams for years.
The Bears often ended in the middle of the pack — a big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the Union.
But the year Donna changed the menus, the Bears not only won their division, they went on to win the state championship, beating the Peach County Trojans 28-14.
(Laughter)
And Coach Parker, he credited that championship to Donna Martin.
When we give our kids the basic nourishment, they're going to thrive.
And it's not just up to the Cheryl Barbaras and the Donna Martins of the world.
It's on all of us.
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point.
What I've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face.
If we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves, we could see a world that is more stable and secure; we could dramatically improve our economic productivity; we could transform our health care and we could go a long way in ensuring that the Earth can provide for generations to come.
Food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact.
So we have to ask ourselves: What is the right question?
What would happen if we fed ourselves more nutritious, more sustainably grown food?
What would be the impact?
Cheryl Barbara, Donna Martin, Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears -- I think they know the answer.
Thank you guys so very much.
(Applause)
Let's imagine a sculptor building a statue, just chipping away with his chisel.
Michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said, "Every block of stone has a statue inside of it, and it's the task of the sculptor to discover it." But what if he worked in the opposite direction?
Not from a solid block of stone, but from a pile of dust, somehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue.
I know that's an absurd notion.
It's probably impossible.
The only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself -- if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue.
Now, as odd as that sounds, that is almost exactly the problem I work on in my lab.
I don't build with stone, I build with nanomaterials.
They're these just impossibly small, fascinating little objects.
They're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle, a human hair would be the size of this entire room.
And they're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology, which I'm sure we've all heard about, and we've all heard how it is going to change everything.
When I was a graduate student, it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology.
There were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time.
The conferences were buzzing, there was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies.
And the reason is when objects get really small, they're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects, like the ones we interact with.
We call this physics quantum mechanics.
And what it tells you is that you can precisely tune their behavior just by making seemingly small changes to them, like adding or removing a handful of atoms, or twisting the material.
It's like this ultimate toolkit.
You really felt empowered; you felt like you could make anything.
And we were doing it -- and by we I mean my whole generation of graduate students.
We were trying to make blazing fast computers using nanomaterials.
We were constructing quantum dots that could one day go in your body and find and fight disease.
There were even groups trying to make an elevator to space using carbon nanotubes.
You can look that up, that's true.
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect all parts of science and technology, from computing to medicine.
And I have to admit, I drank all of the Kool-Aid. I mean, every last drop.
But that was 15 years ago, and -- fantastic science was done, really important work.
We've learned a lot.
We were never able to translate that science into new technologies -- into technologies that could actually impact people.
And the reason is, these nanomaterials — they're like a double-edged sword.
The same thing that makes them so interesting -- their small size -- also makes them impossible to work with.
It's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust.
And we just don't have the tools that are small enough to work with them.
But even if we did, it wouldn't really matter, because we couldn't one by one place millions of particles together to build a technology.
So because of that, all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that: promise and excitement.
We don't have any disease-fighting nanobots, there's no elevators to space, and the thing that I'm most interested in, no new types of computing.
Now that last one, that's a really important one.
We just have come to expect the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely.
We've built entire economies on this idea.
And this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip.
And as those devices get smaller, they get faster, they consume less power and they get cheaper.
And it's this convergence that gives us this incredible pace.
As an example: if I took the room-sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back and somehow compressed it -- compressed the world's greatest computer of its day, so it was the same size as your smartphone -- your actual smartphone, that thing you spent 300 bucks on and just toss out every two years, would blow this thing away.
You would not be impressed. It couldn't do anything that your smartphone does.
It would be slow, you couldn't put any of your stuff on it, you could possibly get through the first two minutes of a "Walking Dead" episode if you're lucky --
(Laughter)
The point is the progress -- it's not gradual.
The progress is relentless. It's exponential. It compounds on itself year after year, to the point where if you compare a technology from one generation to the next, they're almost unrecognizable.
And we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going.
We want to say the same thing 10, 20, 30 years from now: look what we've done over the last 30 years.
Yet we know this progress may not last forever.
In fact, the party's kind of winding down.
It's like "last call for alcohol," right?
If you look under the covers, by many metrics like speed and performance, the progress has already slowed to a halt.
So if we want to keep this party going, we have to do what we've always been able to do, and that is to innovate.
So our group's role and our group's mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes, because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace.
They are just like they sound.
They're tiny, hollow tubes of carbon atoms, and their nanoscale size, that small size, gives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties.
And the science tells us if we could employ them in computing, we could see up to a ten times improvement in performance.
It's like skipping through several technology generations in just one step.
So there we have it. We have this really important problem and we have what is basically the ideal solution.
The science is screaming at us, "This is what you should be doing to solve your problem." So, all right, let's get started, let's do this.
But you just run right back into that double-edged sword.
This "ideal solution" contains a material that's impossible to work with.
I'd have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip.
It's that same conundrum, it's like this undying problem.
At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.
Let's not go down that same road.
Let's just figure out what's missing.
What are we not dealing with?
What are we not doing that needs to be done? "It's like in" The Godfather, "right?
When Fredo betrays his brother Michael, we all know what needs to be done. Fredo's got to go.
(Laughter)
But Michael -- he puts it off. Fine, I get it. Their mother's still alive, it would make her upset.
What are we not dealing with? We just said, "What's the Fredo in our problem?"
What are we not doing, but needs to be done to make this a success?" And the answer is that the statue has to build itself.
We have to find a way, somehow, to compel, to convince billions of these particles to assemble themselves into the technology.
We can't do it for them. They have to do it for themselves.
And it's the hard way, and this is not trivial, but in this case, it's the only way.
Now, as it turns out, this is not that alien of a problem.
We just don't build anything this way.
People don't build anything this way.
But if you look around — and there's examples everywhere — Mother Nature builds everything this way.
Everything is built from the bottom up.
You can go to the beach, you'll find these simple organisms that use proteins -- basically molecules -- to template what is essentially sand, just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity.
And nature's not crude like us, just hacking away.
She's elegant and smart, building with what's available, molecule by molecule, making structures with a complexity and a diversity that we can't even approach.
And she's already at the nano.
She's been there for hundreds of millions of years.
We're the ones that are late to the party.
So we decided that we're going to use the same tool that nature uses, and that's chemistry.
Chemistry is the missing tool.
And chemistry works in this case because these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules, so we can use them to steer these objects around, much like a tool.
That's exactly what we've done in our lab.
We've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust, into the pile of nanoparticles, and pulls out exactly the ones we need.
Then we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles into the pattern we need to build circuits.
And because we can do that, we can build circuits that are many times faster than what anyone's been able to make using nanomaterials before.
Chemistry's the missing tool, and every day our tool gets sharper and gets more precise.
And eventually -- and we hope this is within a handful of years -- we can deliver on one of those original promises.
Now, computing is just one example.
It's the one that I'm interested in, that my group is really invested in, but there are others in renewable energy, in medicine, in structural materials, where the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano.
That's where the biggest benefit is.
But if we're going to do that, the scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools -- tools just like the ones I described.
And they will need chemistry.
That's the point.
The beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools, they're out there.
They're out there forever, and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them, and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology.
Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
OK, so today I want to talk about how we talk about love.
And specifically, I want to talk about what's wrong with how we talk about love.
Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives, and in the English language, this metaphor, falling, is really the main way that we talk about that experience.
I don't know about you, but when I conceptualize this metaphor, what I picture is straight out of a cartoon -- like there's a man, he's walking down the sidewalk, without realizing it, he crosses over an open manhole, and he just plummets into the sewer below.
And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping.
Falling is accidental, it's uncontrollable.
It's something that happens to us without our consent.
And this -- this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship.
I am a writer and I'm also an English teacher, which means I think about words for a living.
You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters, and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love -- maybe even most of them -- are a problem.
So, in love we fall. We're struck. We are crushed. We swoon. We burn with passion.
Love makes us crazy, and it makes us sick.
Our hearts ache, and then they break.
So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness. (Laughter)
They do. And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances.
My favorite one of these is "smitten," which is the past participle of the word "smite." And if you look this word up in the dictionary --
(Laughter) you will see that it can be defined as both "grievous affliction," and, "to be very much in love." I tend to associate the word "smite" with a very particular context, which is the Old Testament.
In the Book of Exodus alone, there are 16 references to smiting, which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God.
(Laughter) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts. (Laughter) Right?
So, how did this happen?
How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering?
And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims?
These are difficult questions, but I have some theories.
And to think this through, I want to focus on one metaphor in particular, which is the idea of love as madness.
When I first started researching romantic love, I found these madness metaphors everywhere.
The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness. These are just a few examples. William Shakespeare: "Love is merely a madness," from "As You Like It." Friedrich Nietzsche: "There is always some madness in love." "Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love —" (Laughter)
(Laughter) I fell in love for the first time when I was 20, and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start.
And it was long distance for the first couple of years, so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows.
I can remember one moment in particular.
I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America, and I was watching the person I love walk out the door.
And it was late, it was nearly midnight, we'd gotten into an argument over dinner, and when we got back to our room, he threw his things in the bag and stormed out.
While I can no longer remember what that argument was about, I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave.
I was 22, it was my first time in the developing world, and I was totally alone.
I had another week until my flight home, and I knew the name of the town that I was in, and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out, but I had no idea how to get around.
I had no guidebook and very little money, and I spoke no Spanish.
Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity, but I just froze.
I just sat there.
And then I burst into tears.
But despite my panic, some small voice in my head thought, "Wow. That was dramatic. I must really be doing this love thing right."
(Laughter) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love.
And it sounds so strange to me now, but at 22, I longed to have dramatic experiences, and in that moment, I was irrational and furious and devastated, and weirdly enough, I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me.
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy, because I thought that that was how loved worked.
This really should not be surprising, considering that according to Wikipedia, there are eight films, 14 songs, two albums and one novel with the title "Crazy Love."
About half an hour later, he came back to our room. We made up. We spent another mostly happy week traveling together.
And then, when I got home, I thought, "That was so terrible and so great.
This must be a real romance." I expected my first love to feel like madness, and of course, it met that expectation very well.
But loving someone like that -- as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back -- was not very good for me or for him.
But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual.
Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love.
In fact, there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal, because, neurochemically speaking, romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished. This is true. This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Laughter) Yes, and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression.
So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors.
And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way.
Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love, which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain.
And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love.
But the good news is, it doesn't always last that long -- usually from a few months to a couple of years.
When I got back from my trip to South America, I spent a lot of time alone in my room, checking my email, desperate to hear from the guy I loved.
I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction, then I did not need their friendship.
So I stopped hanging out with most of them.
And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life.
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable, because if I could be miserable, then I would prove how much I loved him.
And if I could prove it, then we would have to end up together eventually.
This is the real madness, because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward, but we talk about love as if this is true.
Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural.
Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain, and it tells us that love is painful when, after a fight or a breakup, that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.
And in fact — and maybe you've heard this — neurochemically speaking, going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal, which I find reassuring. (Laughter) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love.
In this case, we're talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness.
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.
Love is powerful and at times painful, and we express this in our words and stories, but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful.
What's interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy.
It seems like we want it both ways: we want love to feel like madness, and we want it to last an entire lifetime. That sounds terrible.
(Laughter) To reconcile this, we need to either change our culture or change our expectations.
So, imagine if we were all less passive in love.
If we were more assertive, more open-minded, more generous and instead of falling in love, we stepped into love.
I know that this is asking a lot, but I'm not actually the first person to suggest this.
In their book, "Metaphors We Live By," linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma, which is to change our metaphors.
They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world, and that they can even act as a guide for future actions, like self-fulfilling prophecies.
Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love: love as a collaborative work of art.
I really like this way of thinking about love.
Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments, which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of, or ideas contained within, a given metaphor.
And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails: effort, compromise, patience, shared goals.
These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment, but they also work well for other kinds of relationships -- short-term, casual, polyamorous, non-monogamous, asexual -- because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone.
So if love is a collaborative work of art, then love is an aesthetic experience.
Love is unpredictable, love is creative, love requires communication and discipline, it is frustrating and emotionally demanding.
And love involves both joy and pain.
Ultimately, each experience of love is different.
When I was younger, it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love, that I didn't have to just accept whatever love offered.
Right? When 14-year-old Juliet first meets -- or, when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo, whom she has met four days ago, she does not feel disappointed or angsty. Where is she? She wants to die. And just as a refresher, at this point in the play, act three of five, Romeo is not dead.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just been banished from the city.
I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America, and yet when I first read this play, also at age 14, Juliet's suffering made sense to me.
Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire, rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent, is empowering.
It's still hard.
Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days, and when I feel really frustrated, I have to remind myself: my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together.
This isn't easy, either.
But it's just so much better than the alternative, which is that thing that feels like madness.
This version of love is not about winning or losing someone's affection.
Instead, it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult, which sounds so simple, but is actually a kind of revolutionary, radical act.
This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you're gaining or losing in your relationship, and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer.
This version of love allows us to say things like, "Hey, we're not very good collaborators.
Maybe this isn't for us. "Or," That relationship was shorter than I had planned, but it was still kind of beautiful. "The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself.
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like.
Thank you. (Applause)
When I was a child, I knew I had superpowers. That's right.
(Laughter)
I thought I was absolutely amazing because I could understand and relate to the feelings of brown people, like my grandfather, a conservative Muslim guy.
And also, I could understand my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father, not so religious but laid-back, fairly liberal.
And of course, I could understand and relate to the feelings of white people. The white Norwegians of my country.
You know, white, brown, whatever — I loved them all.
I understood them all, even if they didn't always understand each other, they were all my people.
My father, though, was always really worried.
He kept saying that even with the best education, I was not going to get a fair shake.
I would still face discrimination, according to him. And that the only way to be accepted by white people would be to become famous.
Now, mind you, he had this conversation with me when I was seven years old.
So while I'm seven years old, he said, "Look, so it's either got to be sports, or it's got to be music." He didn't know anything about sports -- bless him -- so it was music.
So when I was seven years old, he gathered all my toys, all my dolls, and he threw them all away.
In exchange he gave me a crappy little Casio keyboard and --
(Laughter)
Yeah. And singing lessons. And he forced me, basically, to practice for hours and hours every single day.
Very quickly, he also had me performing for larger and larger audiences, and bizarrely, I became almost a kind of poster child for Norwegian multiculturalism.
I felt very proud, of course. Because even the newspapers at this point were starting to write nice things about brown people, so I could feel that my superpower was growing.
So when I was 12 years old, walking home from school, I took a little detour because I wanted to buy my favorite sweets called "salty feet." I know they sound kind of awful, but I absolutely love them.
They're basically these little salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.
And now that I say it out loud, I realize how terrible that sounds, but be that as it may, I absolutely love them.
So on my way into the store, there was this grown white guy in the doorway blocking my way.
So I tried to walk around him, and as I did that, he stopped me and he was staring at me, and he spit in my face, and he said, "Get out of my way you little black bitch, you little Paki bitch, go back home where you came from." I was absolutely horrified.
I was staring at him.
I was too afraid to wipe the spit off my face, even as it was mixing with my tears.
I remember looking around, hoping that any minute now, a grown-up is going to come and make this guy stop.
But instead, people kept hurrying past me and pretended not to see me.
I was very confused because I was thinking, well, "My white people, come on! Where are they? What's going on? How come they're not coming and rescuing me? So, needless to say, I didn't buy the sweets.
I just ran home as fast as I could.
Things were still OK, though, I thought.
As time went on, the more successful I became, I eventually started also attracting harassment from brown people.
Some men in my parent's community felt that it was unacceptable and dishonorable for a woman to be involved in music and to be so present in the media.
So very quickly, I was starting to become attacked at my own concerts.
I remember one of the concerts, I was onstage, I lean into the audience and the last thing I see is a young brown face and the next thing I know is some sort of chemical is thrown in my eyes and I remember I couldn't really see and my eyes were watering but I kept singing anyway.
I was spit in the face in the streets of Oslo, this time by brown men.
They even tried to kidnap me at one point.
The death threats were endless.
I remember one older bearded guy stopped me in the street one time, and he said, "The reason I hate you so much is because you make our daughters think they can do whatever they want." A younger guy warned me to watch my back.
He said music is un-Islamic and the job of whores, and if you keep this up, you are going to be raped and your stomach will be cut out so that another whore like you will not be born.
Again, I was so confused.
I couldn't understand what was going on.
My brown people now starting to treat me like this -- how come?
Instead of bridging the worlds, the two worlds, I felt like I was falling between my two worlds.
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.
So by the time I was 17 years old, the death threats were endless, and the harassment was constant.
It got so bad, at one point my mother sat me down and said, "Look, we can no longer protect you, we can no longer keep you safe, so you're going to have to go." So I bought a one-way ticket to London, I packed my suitcase and I left.
My biggest heartbreak at that point was that nobody said anything.
I had a very public exit from Norway.
My brown people, my white people -- nobody said anything.
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.
Support this girl, protect this girl, because she is one of us." Nobody said that.
Instead, I felt like -- you know at the airport, on the baggage carousel you have these different suitcases going around and around, and there's always that one suitcase left at the end, the one that nobody wants, the one that nobody comes to claim.
I felt like that.
I'd never felt so alone. I'd never felt so lost.
So, after coming to London, I did eventually resume my music career.
Different place, but unfortunately the same old story.
I remember a message sent to me saying that I was going to be killed and that rivers of blood were going to flow and that I was going to be raped many times before I died.
By this point, I have to say, I was actually getting used to messages like this, but what became different was that now they started threatening my family.
So once again, I packed my suitcase, I left music and I moved to the US.
I'd had enough.
I didn't want to have anything to do with this anymore.
And I was certainly not going to be killed for something that wasn't even my dream -- it was my father's choice.
So I kind of got lost. I kind of fell apart.
But I decided that what I wanted to do is spend the next however many years of my life supporting young people and to try to be there in some small way, whatever way that I could.
I started volunteering for various organizations that were working with young Muslims inside of Europe.
And, to my surprise, what I found was so many of these young people were suffering and struggling.
They were facing so many problems with their families and their communities who seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation than the happiness and the lives of their own kids.
I started feeling like maybe I wasn't so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.
Maybe there are more of my people out there.
The thing is, what most people don't understand is that there are so many of us growing up in Europe who are not free to be ourselves.
We're not allowed to be who we are.
We are not free to marry or to be in relationships with people that we choose.
We can't even pick our own career.
This is the norm in the Muslim heartlands of Europe.
Even in the freest societies in the world, we're not free.
Our lives, our dreams, our future does not belong to us, it belongs to our parents and their community.
I found endless stories of young people who are lost to all of us, who are invisible to all of us but who are suffering, and they are suffering alone. Kids we are losing to forced marriages, to honor-based violence and abuse.
Eventually, I realized after several years of working with these young people, that I will not be able to keep running. I can't spend the rest of my life being scared and hiding and that I'm actually going to have to do something.
And I also realized that my silence, our silence, allows abuse like this to continue.
So I decided that I wanted to put my childhood superpower to some use by trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand what it's like to be a young person stuck between your family and your country.
So I started making films, and I started telling these stories.
And I also wanted people to understand the deadly consequences of us not taking these problems seriously.
So the first film I made was about Banaz.
She was a 17-year-old Kurdish girl in London.
She was obedient, she did whatever her parents wanted.
She tried to do everything right.
She married some guy that her parents chose for her, even though he beat and raped her constantly.
And when she tried to go to her family for help, they said, "Well, you got to go back and be a better wife." Because they didn't want a divorced daughter on their hands because, of course, that would bring dishonor on the family.
She was beaten so badly her ears would bleed, and when she finally left and she found a young man that she chose and she fell in love with, the community and the family found out and she disappeared.
She was found three months later.
She'd been stuffed into a suitcase and buried underneath the house.
She had been strangled, she had been beaten to death by three men, three cousins, on the orders of her father and uncle.
The added tragedy of Banaz's story is that she had gone to the police in England five times asking for help, telling them that she was going to be killed by her family.
The police didn't believe her so they didn't do anything.
And the problem with this is that not only are so many of our kids facing these problems within their families and within their families' communities, but they're also meeting misunderstandings and apathy in the countries that they grow up in.
When their own families betray them, they look to the rest of us, and when we don't understand, we lose them.
So while I was making this film, several people said to me, "Well, Deeyah, you know, this is just their culture, this is just what those people do to their kids and we can't really interfere." I can assure you being murdered is not my culture. You know? And surely people who look like me, young women who come from backgrounds like me, should be subject to the same rights, the same protections as anybody else in our country, why not?
So, for my next film, I wanted to try and understand why some of our young Muslim kids in Europe are drawn to extremism and violence.
But with that topic, I also recognized that I was going to have to face my worst fear: the brown men with beards.
The same men, or similar men, to the ones that have hounded me for most of my life. Men that I've been afraid of most of my life. Men that I've also deeply disliked, for many, many years.
So I spent the next two years interviewing convicted terrorists, jihadis and former extremists.
What I already knew, what was very obvious already, was that religion, politics, Europe's colonial baggage, also Western foreign policy failures of recent years, were all a part of the picture.
But what I was more interested in finding out was what are the human, what are the personal reasons why some of our young people are susceptible to groups like this.
And what really surprised me was that I found wounded human beings.
Instead of the monsters that I was looking for, that I was hoping to find -- quite frankly because it would have been very satisfying -- I found broken people.
Just like Banaz, I found that these young men were torn apart from trying to bridge the gaps between their families and the countries that they were born in.
And what I also learned is that extremist groups, terrorist groups are taking advantage of these feelings of our young people and channeling that -- cynically -- channeling that toward violence. "Come to us," they say. "Reject both sides, your family and your country because they reject you.
For your family, their honor is more important than you and for your country, a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person will always be white and never you." They're also promising our young people the things that they crave: significance, heroism, a sense of belonging and purpose, a community that loves and accepts them.
They make the powerless feel powerful.
The invisible and the silent are finally seen and heard.
This is what they're doing for our young people.
Why are these groups doing this for our young people and not us?
The thing is, I'm not trying to justify or excuse any of the violence.
What I am trying to say is that we have to understand why some of our young people are attracted to this.
I would like to also show you, actually -- these are childhood photos of some of the guys in the film.
What really struck me is that so many of them -- I never would have thought this -- but so many of them have absent or abusive fathers.
And several of these young guys ended up finding caring and compassionate father figures within these extremist groups.
I also found men brutalized by racist violence, but who found a way to stop feeling like victims by becoming violent themselves.
In fact, I found something, to my horror, that I recognized.
I found the same feelings that I felt as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway. The same confusion, the same sorrow, the same feeling of being betrayed and not belonging to anyone.
The same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures.
Having said that, I did not choose destruction, I chose to pick up a camera instead of a gun.
And the reason I did that is because of my superpower.
I could see that understanding is the answer, instead of violence. Seeing human beings with all their virtues and all their flaws instead of continuing the caricatures: the us and them, the villains and victims.
I'd also finally come to terms with the fact that my two cultures didn't have to be on a collision course but instead became a space where I found my own voice.
I stopped feeling like I had to pick a side, but this took me many, many years.
There are so many of our young people today who are struggling with these same issues, and they're struggling with this alone.
And this leaves them open like wounds.
And for some, the worldview of radical Islam becomes the infection that festers in these open wounds.
There's an African proverb that says, "If the young are not initiated into the village, they will burn it down just to feel its warmth." I would like to ask -- to Muslim parents and Muslim communities, will you love and care for your children without forcing them to meet your expectations?
Can you choose them instead of your honor?
Can you understand why they're so angry and alienated when you put your honor before their happiness?
Can you try to be a friend to your child so that they can trust you and want to share with you their experiences, rather than having to seek it somewhere else?
And to our young people tempted by extremism, can you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain?
Will you find the strength to resist those cynical old men who want to use your blood for their own profits?
Can you find a way to live?
Can you see that the sweetest revenge is for you to live a happy, full and free life?
A life defined by you and nobody else.
Why do you want to become just another dead Muslim kid?
And for the rest of us, when will we start listening to our young people?
How can we support them in redirecting their pain into something more constructive?
They think we don't like them. They think we don't care what happens to them. They think we don't accept them.
Can we find a way to make them feel differently?
What will it take for us to see them and notice them before they become either the victims or the perpetrators of violence?
Can we make ourselves care about them and consider them to be our own?
And not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like ourselves?
Can we find a way to reject hatred and heal the divisions between us?
The thing is we cannot afford to give up on each other or on our kids, even if they've given up on us.
We are all in this together.
And in the long term, revenge and violence will not work against extremists.
Terrorists want us to huddle in our houses in fear, closing our doors and our hearts.
They want us to tear open more wounds in our societies so that they can use them to spread their infection more widely.
They want us to become like them: intolerant, hateful and cruel.
The day after the Paris attacks, a friend of mine sent this photo of her daughter.
This is a white girl and an Arab girl.
They're best friends.
This image is the kryptonite for extremists.
These two little girls with their superpowers are showing the way forward towards a society that we need to build together, a society that includes and supports, rather than rejects our kids.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
For the past few years, I've been spending my summers in the marine biological laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
And there, what I've been doing is essentially renting a boat.
What I would like to do is ask you to come on a boat ride with me tonight.
So, we ride off from Eel Pond into Vineyard Sound, right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, equipped with a drone to identify potential spots from which to peer into the Atlantic.
Earlier, I was going to say into the depths of the Atlantic, but we don't have to go too deep to reach the unknown.
Here, barely two miles away from what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world, we lower a simple plankton net into the water and bring up to the surface things that humanity rarely pays any attention to, and oftentimes has never seen before.
Here's one of the organisms that we caught in our net.
This is a jellyfish.
But look closely, and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science.
A complete new species.
Or how about this other transparent beauty with a beating heart, asexually growing on top of its head, progeny that will move on to reproduce sexually.
Let me say that again: this animal is growing asexually on top of its head, progeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation. A weird jellyfish? Not quite. This is an ascidian.
This is a group of animals that now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with, and it is perhaps the closest invertebrate species to our own.
Meet your cousin, Thalia democratica.
(Laughter)
I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot at your last family reunion for Thalia, but let me tell you, these animals are profoundly related to us in ways that we're just beginning to understand.
So, next time you hear anybody derisively telling you that this type of research is a simple fishing expedition, I hope that you'll remember the trip that we just took.
Today, many of the biological sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know -- in mapping already-discovered continents.
But some of us are much more interested in the unknown.
We want to discover completely new continents, and gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance.
We crave the experience of being completely baffled by something we've never seen before.
And yes, I agree there's a lot of little ego satisfaction in being able to say, "Hey, I was the first one to discover that." But this is not a self-aggrandizing enterprise, because in this type of discovery research, if you don't feel like a complete idiot most of the time, you're just not sciencing hard enough.
(Laughter)
So every summer I bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours more and more things that we know very little about.
I would like tonight to tell you a story about life that rarely gets told in an environment like this.
From the vantage point of our 21st-century biological laboratories, we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge.
We sense that after centuries of scientific research, we're beginning to make significant inroads into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life.
Our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe, striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases.
Things like cancer, aging, degenerative diseases; these are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame.
I often wonder: Why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer?
Is it that we're trying to solve the problem of cancer, and not trying to understand life?
Life on this planet shares a common origin, and I can summarize 3.5 billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide.
What you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet.
In this immensity of life and biodiversity, we occupy a rather unremarkable position.
(Laughter)
Homo sapiens. The last of our kind.
And though I don't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species, as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is, we are not the measure of all things.
We are, however, the measurers of many things.
We relentlessly quantify, analyze and compare, and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary.
But this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths.
We are measuring an astonishingly narrow sliver of life, and hoping that those numbers will save all of our lives.
How narrow do you ask?
Well, let me give you a number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently estimated that about 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored. Now let that sink in for a second. 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored.
I think it's very safe to say that we don't even know how much about life we do not know.
So, it's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life.
This one for example -- discovered earlier this summer, new to science, and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree.
What is even more tragic is that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there, but their biology remains sorely under-studied.
I'm sure some of you have heard about the fact that a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it's lost.
But some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish.
And there are animals out there that do truly astounding things.
I'm almost willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.
This little guy right here does things that essentially just blow my mind.
You can grab one of these animals and cut it into 18 different fragments, and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate a complete animal in under two weeks.
18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.
For the past decade and a half or so, I've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do, and how they pull this magic trick off.
But like all good magicians, they're not really releasing their secrets readily to me.
(Laughter)
So here we are, after 20 years of essentially studying these animals, genome mapping, chin scratching, and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations, we still don't fully understand how these animals do what they do.
Each planarian an ocean unto itself, full of unknowns.
One of the common characteristics of all of these animals I've been talking to you about is that they did not appear to have received the memo that they need to behave according to the rules that we have derived from a handful of randomly selected animals that currently populate the vast majority of biomedical laboratories across the world.
Meet our Nobel Prize winners.
Seven species, essentially, that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding of biological behavior today.
This little guy right here — three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.
And yet, after all the attention they have garnered, and all the knowledge they have generated, as well as the lion's share of the funding, here we are standing [before] the same litany of intractable problems and many new challenges.
And that's because, unfortunately, these seven animals essentially correspond to 0.0009 percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet.
So I'm beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best, and at worst, is leading us astray.
That's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers.
Life started on the face of this planet as single-cell organisms, swimming for millions of years in the ocean, until one of those creatures decided, "I'm going to do things differently today; today I would like to invent something called multicellularity, and I'm going to do this." And I'm sure it wasn't a popular decision at the time --
(Laughter)
but somehow, it managed to do it.
And then, multicellular organisms began to populate all these ancestral oceans, and they thrived.
And we have them here today.
Land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans, and another creature thought, "Hey, that looks like a really nice piece of real estate.
I'd like to move there." "Are you crazy?
You're going to desiccate out there.
Nothing can live out of water. "But life found a way, and there are organisms now that live on land.
Once on land, they may have looked up into the sky and said, "It would be nice to go to the clouds, I'm going to fly." "You can't break the law of gravity, there's no way you can fly." And yet, nature has invented -- multiple and independent times -- ways to fly.
I love to study these animals that break the rules, because every time they break a rule, they invent something new that made it possible for us to be able to be here today.
These animals did not get the memo.
They break the rules.
So if we're going to study animals that break the rules, shouldn't how we study them also break the rules?
I think we need to renew our spirit of exploration.
Rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there, we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature, and there, with our modern technological armamentarium, interrogate every new form of life we find, and any new biological attribute that we may find.
We actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again -- clueless [before] the immensity of the unknown.
Because after all, science is not really about knowledge.
Science is about ignorance.
That's what we do.
Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea ..." As a scientist and a teacher, I like to paraphrase this to read that we scientists need to teach our students to long for the endless immensity of the sea that is our ignorance.
We Homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry.
We, like all other species on this planet, are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet.
And I think I'm a little wrong when I say that life is a mystery, because I think that life is actually an open secret that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it.
So I ask you: Aren't we the best chance that life has to know itself?
And if so, what the heck are we waiting for?
Thank you.
(Applause)
How many of you have used an electronic spreadsheet, like Microsoft Excel? Very good. Now, how many of you have run a business with a spreadsheet by hand, like my dad did for his small printing business in Philadelphia? A lot less.
Well, that's the way it was done for hundreds of years.
In early 1978, I started working on an idea that eventually became VisiCalc.
And the next year it shipped running on something new called an Apple II personal computer.
You could tell that things had really changed when, six years later, the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial that assumed you knew what VisiCalc was and maybe even were using it.
Steve Jobs back in 1990 said that "spreadsheets propelled the industry forward." "VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple more than any other single event." On a more personal note, Steve said, "If VisiCalc had been written for some other computer, you'd be interviewing somebody else right now."
So, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks. How did it come about? What was it? What did I go through to make it be what it was?
Well, I first learned to program back in 1966, when I was 15 -- just a couple months after this photo was taken.
Few high schoolers had access to computers in those days.
But through luck and an awful lot of perseverance, I was able to get computer time around the city.
After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock, I went off to MIT to go to college, where to make money, I worked on the Multics Project.
Multics was a trailblazing interactive time-sharing system.
Have you heard of the Linux and Unix operating systems? They came from Multics.
I worked on the Multics versions of what are known as interpreted computer languages, that are used by people in noncomputer fields to do their calculations while seated at a computer terminal.
After I graduated from MIT, I went to work for Digital Equipment Corporation.
At DEC, I worked on software for the new area of computerized typesetting.
I helped newspapers replace their reporters' typewriters with computer terminals.
I'd write software and then I'd go out in the field to places like the Kansas City Star, where I would train users and get feedback.
This was real-world experience that is quite different than what I saw in the lab at MIT.
After that, I was project leader of the software for DEC's first word processor, again a new field.
Like with typesetting, the important thing was crafting a user interface that was both natural and efficient for noncomputer people to use.
After I was at DEC, I went to work for a small company that made microprocessor-based electronic cash registers for the fast-food industry.
But I had always wanted to start a company with my friend Bob Frankston that I met on the Multics project at MIT.
So I decided to go back to school to learn as much as I could about business.
And in the fall of 1977, I entered the MBA program at Harvard Business School.
I was one of the few percentage of students who had a background in computer programming.
There's a picture of me from the yearbook sitting in the front row.
(Laughter)
Now, at Harvard, we learned by the case method.
We'd do about three cases a day.
Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages describing particular business situations.
They often have exhibits, and exhibits often have words and numbers laid out in ways that make sense for the particular situation.
They're usually all somewhat different. Here's my homework. Again, numbers, words, laid out in ways that made sense.
Lots of calculations -- we got really close to our calculators.
In fact, here's my calculator.
For Halloween, I went dressed up as a calculator.
(Laughter)
At the beginning of each class, the professor would call on somebody to present the case.
What they would do is they would explain what was going on and then dictate information that the professor would transcribe onto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class, and then we'd have a discussion.
One of the really frustrating things is when you've done all your homework, you come in the next day only to find out that you made an error and all of the other numbers you did were wrong.
And you couldn't participate as well.
And we were marked by class participation.
So, sitting there with 87 other people in the class, I got to daydream a lot.
Most programmers in those days worked on mainframes, building things like inventory systems, payroll systems and bill-paying systems.
But I had worked on interactive word processing and on-demand personal computation.
Instead of thinking about paper printouts and punch cards, I imagined a magic blackboard that if you erased one number and wrote a new thing in, all of the other numbers would automatically change, like word processing with numbers.
I imagined that my calculator had mouse hardware on the bottom of it and a head-up display, like in a fighter plane.
And I could type some numbers in, and circle it, and press the sum button.
And right in the middle of a negotiation I'd be able to get the answer.
Now I just had to take my fantasy and turn it into reality.
My father taught me about prototyping.
He showed me mock-ups that he'd make to figure out the placement on the page for the things for brochures that he was printing.
And he'd use it to get feedback from customers and OKs before he sent the job off to the presses.
The act of making a simple, working version of what you're trying to build forces you to uncover key problems.
And it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively.
So I decided to build a prototype.
I went to a video terminal connected to Harvard's time-sharing system and got to work.
One of the first problems that I ran into was: How do you represent values in formulas?
Let me show you what I mean.
I thought that you would point somewhere, type in some words, then type in some somewhere else, put in some numbers and some more numbers, point where you want the answer. And then point to the first, press minus, point to the second, and get the result.
The problem was: What should I put in the formula?
It had to be something the computer knew what to put in.
And if you looked at the formula, you needed to know where on the screen it referred to.
The first thing I thought was the programmer way of doing it.
The first time you pointed to somewhere, the computer would ask you to type in a unique name.
It became pretty clear pretty fast that that was going to be too tedious.
The computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside.
So I thought, why not make it be the order in which you create them? I tried that. Value 1, value 2.
Pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you'd never remember on the screen where things were.
Then I said, why not instead of allowing you to put values anywhere, I'll restrict you to a grid?
Then when you pointed to a cell, the computer could put the row and column in as a name.
And, if I did it like a map and put ABC across the top and numbers along the side, if you saw B7 in a formula, you'd know exactly where it was on the screen.
And if you had to type the formula in yourself, you'd know what to do.
Restricting you to a grid helped solve my problem.
It also opened up new capabilities, like the ability to have ranges of cells.
But it wasn't too restrictive -- you could still put any value, any formula, in any cell.
And that's the way we do it to this day, almost 40 years later.
My friend Bob and I decided that we were going to build this product together.
I did more work figuring out exactly how the program was supposed to behave.
I wrote a reference card to act as documentation.
It also helped me ensure that the user interface I was defining could be explained concisely and clearly to regular people.
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.
This is the inside of the attic.
Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System to write computer code on a terminal like this.
And then he would download test versions to a borrowed Apple II over a phone line using an acoustic coupler, and then we would test.
For one of these tests I prepared for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.
Print wasn't working yet, so I had to copy everything down.
Save wasn't working, so every time it crashed, I had to type in all of the formulas again, over and over again.
The next day in class, I raised my hand; I got called on, and I presented the case.
I did five-year projections.
I did all sorts of different scenarios.
I aced the case.
VisiCalc was already useful.
The professor said, "How did you do it?" Well, I didn't want to tell him about our secret program.
(Laughter)
So I said, "I took this and added this and multiplied by this and subtracted that."
He said, "Well, why didn't you use a ratio?"
I said, "Hah!
A ratio — that wouldn't have been as exact! "What I didn't say was," Divide isn't working yet. "
(Laughter)
Eventually, though, we did finish enough of VisiCalc to be able to show it to the public.
My dad printed up a sample reference card that we could use as marketing material.
In June of 1979, our publisher announced VisiCalc to the world, in a small booth at the giant National Computer Conference in New York City.
The New York Times had a humorous article about the conference. "The machines perform what seem religious rites ... Even as the believers gather, the painters in the Coliseum sign room are adding to the pantheon, carefully lettering 'VISICALC' in giant black on yellow.
All hail VISICALC!" (Gasp) New York Times: "All hail VISICALC."
(Laughter)
That was the last mention of the electronic spreadsheet in the popular business press for about two years.
Most people didn't get it yet. But some did.
In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.
It came in packaging that looked like this.
And it looked like this running on the Apple II.
And the rest, as they say, is history.
Now, there's an awful lot more to this story, but that'll have to wait for another day.
One thing, though, Harvard remembers. Here's that classroom. They put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there.
(Applause)
But it also serves as a reminder that you, too, should take your unique backgrounds, skills and needs and build prototypes to discover and work out the key problems, and through that, change the world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So earlier this year, I was informed that I would be doing a TED Talk.
So I was excited, then I panicked, then I was excited, then I panicked, and in between the excitement and the panicking, I started to do my research, and my research primarily consisted of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.
(Laughter)
And interspersed with that, I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
How many of you know who that is?
(Cheers)
So I was Googling her because I always Google her because I'm just a fan, but also because she always has important and interesting things to say.
And the combination of those searches kept leading me to her talk on the dangers of a single story, on what happens when we have a solitary lens through which to understand certain groups of people, and it is the perfect talk.
It's the talk that I would have given if I had been famous first.
(Laughter)
You know, and you know, like, she's African and I'm African, and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist, and she's a storyteller and I'm a storyteller, so I really felt like it's my talk.
(Laughter)
So I decided that I was going to learn how to code, and then I was going to hack the internet and I would take down all the copies of that talk that existed, and then I would memorize it, and then I would come here and deliver it as if it was my own speech.
So that plan was going really well, except the coding part, and then one morning a few months ago, I woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate had given a speech that --
(Laughter) (Applause)
that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves, Michelle Obama.
(Cheers)
And so I decided that I should probably write my own TED Talk, and so that is what I am here to do.
I'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling.
I want to talk to you about the power of stories, of course, but I also want to talk about their limitations, particularly for those of us who are interested in social justice.
So since Adichie gave that talk seven years ago, there has been a boom in storytelling.
Stories are everywhere, and if there was a danger in the telling of one tired old tale, then I think there has got to be lots to celebrate about the flourishing of so many stories and so many voices.
Stories are the antidote to bias.
In fact, today, if you are middle class and connected via the internet, you can download stories at the touch of a button or the swipe of a screen.
You can listen to a podcast about what it's like to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.
You can hear an indigenous man in Australia talk about the trials and triumphs of raising his children in dignity and in pride.
Stories make us fall in love.
They heal rifts and they bridge divides.
Stories can even make it easier for us to talk about the deaths of people in our societies who don't matter, because they make us care. Right?
I'm not so sure, and I actually work for a place called the Centre for Stories.
And my job is to help to tell stories that challenge mainstream narratives about what it means to be black or a Muslim or a refugee or any of those other categories that we talk about all the time.
But I come to this work after a long history as a social justice activist, and so I'm really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it's about more than entertainment, as though it's about being a catalyst for social action.
It's not uncommon to hear people say that stories make the world a better place.
Increasingly, though, I worry that even the most poignant stories, particularly the stories about people who no one seems to care about, can often get in the way of action towards social justice.
Now, this is not because storytellers mean any harm. Quite the contrary. Storytellers are often do-gooders like me and, I suspect, yourselves.
And the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people.
Still, good intentions can have unintended consequences, and so I want to propose that stories are not as magical as they seem.
So three -- because it's always got to be three -- three reasons why I think that stories don't necessarily make the world a better place.
Firstly, stories can create an illusion of solidarity.
There is nothing like that feel-good factor you get from listening to a fantastic story where you feel like you climbed that mountain, right, or that you befriended that death row inmate.
But you didn't. You haven't done anything.
Listening is an important but insufficient step towards social action.
Secondly, I think often we are drawn towards characters and protagonists who are likable and human.
And this makes sense, of course, right?
Because if you like someone, then you care about them.
But the inverse is also true.
If you don't like someone, then you don't care about them.
And if you don't care about them, you don't have to see yourself as having a moral obligation to think about the circumstances that shaped their lives.
I learned this lesson when I was 14 years old.
I learned that actually, you don't have to like someone to recognize their wisdom, and you certainly don't have to like someone to take a stand by their side.
(Laughter) So my bike was stolen while I was riding it --
which is possible if you're riding slowly enough, which I was.
(Laughter)
So one minute I'm cutting across this field in the Nairobi neighborhood where I grew up, and it's like a very bumpy path, and so when you're riding a bike, you don't want to be like, you know --
And so I'm going like this, slowly pedaling, and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.
I'm on the ground, and I look up, and there's this kid peddling away in the getaway vehicle, which is my bike, and he's about 11 or 12 years old, and I'm on the floor, and I'm crying because I saved a lot of money for that bike, and I'm crying and I stand up and I start screaming.
Instinct steps in, and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!" which means "thief" in Swahili.
And out of the woodworks, all of these people come out and they start to give chase.
Right? This is Africa, so mob justice in action. And I round the corner, and they've captured him, they've caught him.
The suspect has been apprehended, and they make him give me my bike back, and they also make him apologize.
Again, you know, typical African justice, right?
And so they make him say sorry.
And so we stand there facing each other, and he looks at me, and he says sorry, but he looks at me with this unbridled fury.
He is very, very angry.
And it is the first time that I have been confronted with someone who doesn't like me simply because of what I represent.
He looks at me with this look as if to say, "You, with your shiny skin and your bike, you're angry at me?"
So it was a hard lesson that he didn't like me, but you know what, he was right.
I was a middle-class kid living in a poor country.
I had a bike, and he barely had food.
Sometimes, it's the messages that we don't want to hear, the ones that make us want to crawl out of ourselves, that we need to hear the most.
For every lovable storyteller who steals your heart, there are hundreds more whose voices are slurred and ragged, who don't get to stand up on a stage dressed in fine clothes like this.
There are a million angry-boy-on-a-bike stories and we can't afford to ignore them simply because we don't like their protagonists or because that's not the kid that we would bring home with us from the orphanage.
that stories don't necessarily make the world a better place. The third reason that I think is that too often we are so invested in the personal narrative that we forget to look at the bigger picture.
And so we applaud someone when they tell us about their feelings of shame, but we don't necessarily link that to oppression.
We nod understandingly when someone says they felt small, but we don't link that to discrimination.
The most important stories, especially for social justice, are those that do both, that are both personal and allow us to explore and understand the political.
But it's not just about the stories we like versus the stories we choose to ignore.
Increasingly, we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play, where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news. Yeah? We live in a time where we are witnessing the decline of facts, when emotions rule and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?
Where we value what we feel more than what we actually know.
A recent report by the Pew Center on trends in America indicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30 "place a lot of trust in the media." Now, this is significant.
It means that storytellers are gaining trust at precisely the same moment that many in the media are losing the confidence in the public.
This is not a good thing, because while stories are important and they help us to have insights in many ways, we need the media.
From my years as a social justice activist, I know very well that we need credible facts from media institutions combined with the powerful voices of storytellers.
That's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice.
In the final analysis, of course, it is justice that makes the world a better place, not stories. Right? And so if it is justice that we are after, then I think we mustn't focus on the media or on storytellers.
We must focus on audiences, on anyone who has ever turned on a radio or listened to a podcast, and that means all of us.
So a few concluding thoughts on what audiences can do to make the world a better place.
So firstly, the world would be a better place, I think, if audiences were more curious and more skeptical and asked more questions about the social context that created those stories that they love so much.
Secondly, the world would be a better place if audiences recognized that storytelling is intellectual work.
And I think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites, buttons for example that say, "If you liked this story, click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in." Or "click here to contribute to your storyteller's next big idea." Often, we are committed to the platforms, but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves.
And then lastly, I think that audiences can make the world a better place by switching off their phones, by stepping away from their screens and stepping out into the real world beyond what feels safe.
Alice Walker has said, "Look closely at the present you are constructing.
It should look like the future you are dreaming." Storytellers can help us to dream, but it's up to all of us to have a plan for justice. Thank you.
(Applause)
"You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."
"If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."
"I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death.
She is the absolute worst."
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie, I don't even want to rape it."
"Whatever you do, don't tell Ashley Judd.
She'll die alone with a dried out vagina. "
"If I had to fuck an older woman, oh my God, I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, that bitch is hot af.
The unforgivable shit I would do to her."
Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it is imperative that it ends.
Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging.
And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom.
I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats.
The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to.
(Laughter)
Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game.
(Laughter)
Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... I tweeted.
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]
It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you.
It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step.
My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game.
And I have responded to this with various strategies.
I've tried engaging people.
This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar.
I wrote him back and said ... "Is that your daughter?
I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way." And he surprised me by saying, "You know what? You're right. I apologize." Sometimes people want to be held accountable.
This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.
I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, "Cunt means many different things in different countries --
(Laughter)
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle.
What is seen goes in. It's traumatic. And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... true.
Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria --
(Laughter)
internalize the patriarchy. This is really critical.
Patriarchy is not boys and men. It is a system in which we all participate, including me.
On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a "cyber mob." This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats.
And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, "Loved one ... what is happening to you is not OK."
And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... that allowed me to take a stand for myself.
And I started to write.
I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes.
And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets.
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]
May your grace and mercy shine.
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, "Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."
(Laughter)
And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, "Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you." But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies.
It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse.
Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion — you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse.
It's clearly traumatizing. Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence.
The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work.
And let's talk about work. Our ability to work is constrained.
Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex.
Our ability to go to school is impaired.
96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... girls. Our girls. Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images.
And I want to say a word about revenge porn.
Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet.
We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom.
And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out.
But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is.
And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied.
It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us.
Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful.
And my expressing it does not pornography make.
(Applause)
So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not.
I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues.
I can often get a social media company's attention.
I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up.
Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. And guess what? I get hate speech for that. "Oh, you live in an echo chamber." Well, guess what?
Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they "can't wait to cum on my face," I have a right to set that boundary.
(Applause)
And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that.
But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it.
We're going to win this fight.
There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness.
I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own.
Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens.
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential.
Two... shall we talk about our friends in tech?
Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end.
(Applause)
(Cheers)
EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard.
And guess what, Silicon Valley?
If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. Enough excuses. Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change.
And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end.
I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. Basta! -- as the Italians would say. Enough.
(Applause)
Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence.
In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9 / 11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.
And it's not cool to say that, but it is true.
We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country.
That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them.
Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work.
The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, "What's Twitter?"
Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech.
In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph --
(Laughter)
The language must be technologically neutral.
So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice.
So, let's talk about our friends ... white men.
You have a role to play and a choice to make.
You can do something, or you can do nothing.
We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, "Oh my God, she's a reverse racist." That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk.
We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed.
We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening.
92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it.
72 percent of us have witnessed it.
We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding.
And lastly, believe her. Believe her.
(Applause)
This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction.
And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred.
Edith Wharton said, "The end is latent in the beginning," so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech.
Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies.
I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions.
It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff.
So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself.
I would like for you to reflect it back to me.
It might sound something like this --
(Laughter)
I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, "Yes, you are."
Audience: Yes, you are.
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.
A: Yes, she does.
AJ: I did a great job with my talk.
A: Yes, you did.
AJ: I have a right to be here.
A: Yes, you do.
AJ: I'm really cute.
(Laughter)
AJ: God does good work.
A: Yes, He does.
AJ: And I love you.
Thank you so much for letting me be of service.
If I asked you to picture the air, what do you imagine?
Most people think about either empty space or clear blue sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
And then I remember my high school chemistry teacher with really long socks at the blackboard, drawing diagrams of bubbles connected to other bubbles, and describing how they vibrate and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
But really, we tend not to think about the air that much at all.
We notice it mostly when there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it, like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist.
But it's always there.
It's touching all of us right now.
It's even inside us.
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
So what is the air?
It's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth, attracted by the Earth's gravitational pull.
And even though I'm a visual artist, I'm interested in the invisibility of the air.
I'm interested in how we imagine it, how we experience it and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality through breathing.
All life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange, and we're all doing it right now.
Actually, why don't we all right now together take one big, collective, deep breath in.
Ready? In. (Inhales) And out. (Exhales)
That air that you just exhaled, you enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide.
So roughly five liters of air per breath, 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year, comes to approximately 45 million liters of air, enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide, just for you.
Now, that's equivalent to about 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
For me, air is plural.
It's simultaneously as small as our breathing and as big as the planet.
And it's kind of hard to picture.
Maybe it's impossible, and maybe it doesn't matter.
Through my visual arts practice, I try to make air, not so much picture it, but to make it visceral and tactile and haptic.
I try to expand this notion of the aesthetic, how things look, so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin and in your lungs, and how your voice sounds as it passes through it.
I explore the weight, density and smell, but most importantly, I think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air.
This is a work I made in 2014.
It's called "Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary," where I was recreating the air from different eras in Earth's evolution, and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me.
And it's really surprising, so drastically different.
Now, I'm not a scientist, but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology, a bit like how rocks can oxidize, and they'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it, such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times.
Then I come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases.
I was particularly interested in moments of time that are examples of life changing the air, but also the air that can influence how life will evolve, like Carboniferous air.
It's from about 300 to 350 million years ago.
It's an era known as the time of the giants.
So for the first time in the history of life, lignin evolves.
That's the hard stuff that trees are made of.
So trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time, and they get really big, bigger and bigger, and pepper the Earth, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, such that the oxygen levels are about twice as high as what they are today.
And this rich air supports massive insects -- huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
To breathe, this air is really clean and really fresh.
It doesn't so much have a flavor, but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy.
It's really good for hangovers.
(Laughter)
Or there's the air of the Great Dying -- that's about 252.5 million years ago, just before the dinosaurs evolve.
It's a really short time period, geologically speaking, from about 20- to 200,000 years. Really quick. This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history, even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out.
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out, and simultaneous to that is a huge, dramatic spike in carbon dioxide, that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect.
Oxygen levels at this time go to below half of what they are today, so about 10 percent.
So this air would definitely not support human life, but it's OK to just have a breath.
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
It's really calming, it's quite warm and it has a flavor a little bit like soda water.
It has that kind of spritz, quite pleasant.
So with all this thinking about air of the past, it's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future.
And instead of being speculative with air and just making up what I think might be the future air, I discovered this human-synthesized air.
That means that it doesn't occur anywhere in nature, but it's made by humans in a laboratory for application in different industrial settings.
Why is it future air?
Well, this air is a really stable molecule that will literally be part of the air once it's released, for the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down.
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.
And this future air has some very sensual qualities.
It's very heavy. It's about eight times heavier than the air we're used to breathing.
It's so heavy, in fact, that when you breathe it in, whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well, so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor and soak into the cracks.
It's an air that operates quite a lot like a liquid.
Now, this air comes with an ethical dimension as well.
Humans made this air, but it's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested.
Its warming potential is 24,000 times that of carbon dioxide, and it has that longevity of 12 to 16 generations.
So this ethical confrontation is really central to my work. (In a lowered voice) It has another quite surprising quality.
It changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically.
(Laughter)
So when we start to think -- ooh! It's still there a bit.
(Laughter)
When we think about climate change, we probably don't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes or funny voices.
The images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs.
We think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
But perhaps it's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air.
Like air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule, the breath and the planet.
It's immediate, vital and intimate, as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
Climate change is the collective self-portrait of humanity.
It reflects our decisions as individuals, as governments and as industries.
And if there's anything I've learned from looking at air, it's that even though it's changing, it persists.
It may not support the kind of life that we'd recognize, but it will support something.
And if we humans are such a vital part of that change, I think it's important that we can feel the discussion.
Because even though it's invisible, humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air.
Thank you.
Cybercrime is out of control. It's everywhere. We hear about it every single day.
This year, over two billion records lost or stolen.
And last year, 100 million of us, mostly Americans, lost our health insurance data to thieves -- myself included.
What's particularly concerning about this is that in most cases, it was months before anyone even reported that these records were stolen.
So if you watch the evening news, you would think that most of this is espionage or nation-state activity.
And, well, some of it is.
Espionage, you see, is an accepted international practice.
But in this case, it is only a small portion of the problem that we're dealing with.
How often do we hear about a breach followed by, "... it was the result of a sophisticated nation-state attack?" Well, often that is companies not being willing to own up to their own lackluster security practices.
There is also a widely held belief that by blaming an attack on a nation-state, you are putting regulators at bay -- at least for a period of time.
So where is all of this coming from?
The United Nations estimates that 80 percent of it is from highly organized and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.
To date, this represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world, topping out at, now get this, 445 billion dollars.
Let me put that in perspective for all of you: 445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP of 160 nations, including Ireland, Finland, Denmark and Portugal, to name a few.
So how does this work? How do these criminals operate?
Well, let me tell you a little story.
About a year ago, our security researchers were tracking a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer via you clicking on a link in a phishing email that you probably shouldn't have. It would then sit and wait. It would wait until you logged into your bank account.
And when you did, the bad guys would reach in, steal your credentials, and then use that to steal your money.
This sounds terrible, but the reality is, in the security industry, this form of attack is somewhat commonplace.
However, the Dyre Wolf had two distinctly different personalities -- one for these small transactions, but it took on an entirely different persona if you were in the business of moving large-scale wire transfers.
Here's what would happen.
You start the process of issuing a wire transfer, and up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank, indicating that there's a problem with your account, and that you need to call the bank immediately, along with the number to the bank's fraud department.
So you pick up the phone and you call.
And after going through the normal voice prompts, you're met with an English-speaking operator. "Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.
How can I help you? "And you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank, of giving them your name and your account number, going through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are.
Most of us may not know this, but in many large-scale wire transfers, it requires two people to sign off on the wire transfer, so the operator then asks you to get the second person on the line, and goes through the same set of verifications and checks.
Sounds normal, right? Only one problem: you're not talking to the bank.
You're talking to the criminals.
They had built an English-speaking help desk, fake overlays to the banking website.
And this was so flawlessly executed that they were moving between a half a million and a million and a half dollars per attempt into their criminal coffers.
These criminal organizations operate like highly regimented, legitimate businesses.
Their employees work Monday through Friday.
They take the weekends off. How do we know this? We know this because our security researchers see repeated spikes of malware on a Friday afternoon.
The bad guys, after a long weekend with the wife and kids, come back in to see how well things went.
The Dark Web is where they spend their time.
That is a term used to describe the anonymous underbelly of the internet, where thieves can operate with anonymity and without detection.
Here they peddle their attack software and share information on new attack techniques.
You can buy everything there, from a base-level attack to a much more advanced version.
In fact, in many cases, you even see gold, silver and bronze levels of service.
You can check references.
You can even buy attacks that come with a money-back guarantee --
(Laughter)
if you're not successful.
Now, these environments, these marketplaces -- they look like an Amazon or an eBay.
You see products, prices, ratings and reviews.
Of course, if you're going to buy an attack, you're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings, right?
(Laughter)
This isn't any different than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor before going to a new restaurant. So, here is an example. This is an actual screenshot of a vendor selling malware.
Notice they're a vendor level four, they have a trust level of six.
They've had 400 positive reviews in the last year, and only two negative reviews in the last month.
We even see things like licensing terms.
Here's an example of a site you can go to if you want to change your identity.
They will sell you a fake ID, fake passports.
But note the legally binding terms for purchasing your fake ID. Give me a break. What are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them?
(Laughter)
This occurred a couple of months ago.
One of our security researchers was looking at a new Android malware application that we had discovered.
It was called Bilal Bot.
In a blog post, she positioned Bilal Bot as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative to the much more advanced GM Bot that was commonplace in the criminal underground.
This review did not sit well with the authors of Bilal Bot.
So they wrote her this very email, pleading their case and making the argument that they felt she had evaluated an older version.
They asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information and even offered to do an interview to describe to her in detail how their attack software was now far better than the competition.
So look, you don't have to like what they do, but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature of their endeavors.
(Laughter)
So how are we going to stop this?
It's not like we're going to be able to identify who's responsible -- remember, they operate with anonymity and outside the reach of the law.
We're certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders.
I would propose that we need a completely new approach.
And that approach needs to be centered on the idea that we need to change the economics for the bad guys.
And to give you a perspective on how this can work, let's think of the response we see to a healthcare pandemic: SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.
What is the top priority?
It's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading.
Now, governments, private institutions, hospitals, physicians -- everyone responds openly and quickly.
This is a collective and altruistic effort to stop the spread in its tracks and to inform anyone not infected how to protect or inoculate themselves.
Unfortunately, this is not at all what we see in response to a cyber attack.
Organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves. Why? Because they're worried about competitive advantage, litigation or regulation.
We need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data.
We need to get all of these organizations to open up and share what is in their private arsenal of information.
The bad guys are moving fast; we've got to move faster.
And the best way to do that is to open up and share data on what's happening.
Let's think about this in the construct of security professionals.
Remember, they're programmed right into their DNA to keep secrets.
We've got to turn that thinking on its head.
We've got to get governments, private institutions and security companies willing to share information at speed.
And here's why: because if you share the information, it's equivalent to inoculation.
And if you're not sharing, you're actually part of the problem, because you're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted by the same attack techniques.
But there's an even bigger benefit.
By destroying criminals' devices closer to real time, we break their plans.
We inform the people they aim to hurt far sooner than they had ever anticipated.
We ruin their reputations, we crush their ratings and reviews.
We make cybercrime not pay.
We change the economics for the bad guys.
But to do this, a first mover was required -- someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall.
About a year ago, my colleagues and I had a radical idea.
What if IBM were to take our data -- we had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world -- and open it up?
It had information not just on what had happened in the past, but what was happening in near-real time.
What if we were to publish it all openly on the internet?
As you can imagine, this got quite a reaction.
First came the lawyers: What are the legal implications of doing that?
Then came the business: What are the business implications of doing that?
And this was also met with a good dose of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.
But there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface in every dialogue that we would have: the realization that if we didn't do this, then we were part of the problem.
So we did something unheard of in the security industry. We started publishing. Over 700 terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data, including information on real-time attacks that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks.
And to date, over 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data, including half of the Fortune 100.
And our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations to join us in the fight, and do the same thing and share their information on when and how they're being attacked as well.
We all have the opportunity to stop it, and we already all know how.
All we have to do is look to the response that we see in the world of health care, and how they respond to a pandemic.
Simply put, we need to be open and collaborative.
Thank you.

So you probably have the sense, as most people do, that polarization is getting worse in our country, that the divide between the left and the right is as bad as it's been in really any of our lifetimes.
But you might also reasonably wonder if research backs up your intuition.
And in a nutshell, the answer is sadly yes.
In study after study, we find that liberals and conservatives have grown further apart.
They increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos, consuming different news, talking only to like-minded others and more and more choosing to live in different parts of the country.
And I think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides.
Liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, more and more they just don't like one another.
You see it in many different ways.
They don't want to befriend one another.
They don't want to date one another.
If they do, if they find out, they find each other less attractive, and they more and more don't want their children to marry someone who supports the other party, a particularly shocking statistic.
You know, in my lab, the students that I work with, we're talking about some sort of social pattern -- I'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like, what kind of movie are we in here with this pattern?
So what kind of movie are we in with political polarization?
Well, it could be a disaster movie.
It certainly seems like a disaster.
Could be a war movie. Also fits. But what I keep thinking is that we're in a zombie apocalypse movie.
(Laughter)
Right? You know the kind.
There's people wandering around in packs, not thinking for themselves, seized by this mob mentality trying to spread their disease and destroy society.
And you probably think, as I do, that you're the good guy in the zombie apocalypse movie, and all this hate and polarization, it's being propagated by the other people, because we're Brad Pitt, right?
Free-thinking, righteous, just trying to hold on to what we hold dear, you know, not foot soldiers in the army of the undead. Not that. Never that.
But here's the thing: what movie do you suppose they think they're in? Right? Well, they absolutely think that they're the good guys in the zombie apocalypse movie. Right? And you'd better believe that they think that they're Brad Pitt and that we, we are the zombies.
And who's to say that they're wrong?
I think that the truth is that we're all a part of this.
And the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution.
So what are we going to do?
What can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life?
What could we do to connect with and communicate with our political counterparts?
Well, these were exactly the questions that I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg, became fascinated with a few years ago, and we started doing research on this topic.
And one of the first things that we discovered that I think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide.
So one of the most robust findings in the history of political psychology is this pattern identified by Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham, psychologists, that liberals and conservatives tend to endorse different values to different degrees.
So for example, we find that liberals tend to endorse values like equality and fairness and care and protection from harm more than conservatives do.
And conservatives tend to endorse values like loyalty, patriotism, respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals do.
And Matt and I were thinking that maybe this moral divide might be helpful for understanding how it is that liberals and conservatives talk to one another and why they so often seem to talk past one another when they do.
So we conducted a study where we recruited liberals to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essay that would be compelling to a conservative in support of same-sex marriage.
And what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments in terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness.
So they said things like, "Everyone should have the right to love whoever they choose," and, "They" -- they being gay Americans -- "deserve the same equal rights as other Americans." Overall, we found that 69 percent of liberals invoked one of the more liberal moral values in constructing their essay, and only nine percent invoked one of the more conservative moral values, even though they were supposed to be trying to persuade conservatives.
And when we studied conservatives and had them make persuasive arguments in support of making English the official language of the US, a classically conservative political position, we found that they weren't much better at this.
59 percent of them made arguments in terms of one of the more conservative moral values, and just eight percent invoked a liberal moral value, even though they were supposed to be targeting liberals for persuasion.
Now, you can see right away why we're in trouble here. Right? People's moral values, they're their most deeply held beliefs.
People are willing to fight and die for their values.
Why are they going to give that up just to agree with you on something that they don't particularly want to agree with you on anyway?
If that persuasive appeal that you're making to your Republican uncle means that he doesn't just have to change his view, he's got to change his underlying values, too, that's not going to go very far.
So what would work better?
Well, we believe it's a technique that we call moral reframing, and we've studied it in a series of experiments.
In one of these experiments, we recruited liberals and conservatives to a study where they read one of three essays before having their environmental attitudes surveyed.
And the first of these essays was a relatively conventional pro-environmental essay that invoked the liberal values of care and protection from harm.
It said things like, "In many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in," and, "It is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our Earth." Another group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity.
It was a pro-environmental essay as well, and it said things like, "Keeping our forests, drinking water, and skies pure is of vital importance." "We should regard the pollution of the places we live in to be disgusting." And, "Reducing pollution can help us preserve what is pure and beautiful about the places we live." And then we had a third group that were assigned to read just a nonpolitical essay.
It was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline.
And what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards, we found that liberals, it didn't matter what essay they read. They tended to have highly pro-environmental attitudes regardless. Liberals are on board for environmental protection.
Conservatives, however, were significantly more supportive of progressive environmental policies and environmental protection if they had read the moral purity essay than if they read one of the other two essays.
We even found that conservatives who read the moral purity essay were significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming and were concerned about global warming, even though this essay didn't even mention global warming.
That's just a related environmental issue.
But that's how robust this moral reframing effect was.
And we've studied this on a whole slew of different political issues.
So if you want to move conservatives on issues like same-sex marriage or national health insurance, it helps to tie these liberal political issues to conservative values like patriotism and moral purity.
And we studied it the other way, too.
If you want to move liberals to the right on conservative policy issues like military spending and making English the official language of the US, you're going to be more persuasive if you tie those conservative policy issues to liberal moral values like equality and fairness.
All these studies have the same clear message: if you want to persuade someone on some policy, it's helpful to connect that policy to their underlying moral values.
And when you say it like that it seems really obvious. Right? Like, why did we come here tonight? Why —
(Laughter)
It's incredibly intuitive. And even though it is, it's something we really struggle to do.
You know, it turns out that when we go to persuade somebody on a political issue, we talk like we're speaking into a mirror.
We don't persuade so much as we rehearse our own reasons for why we believe some sort of political position.
We kept saying when we were designing these reframed moral arguments, "Empathy and respect, empathy and respect." If you can tap into that, you can connect and you might be able to persuade somebody in this country.
So thinking again about what movie we're in, maybe I got carried away before. Maybe it's not a zombie apocalypse movie. Maybe instead it's a buddy cop movie.
(Laughter)
Just roll with it, just go with it please.
(Laughter)
You know the kind: there's a white cop and a black cop, or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop.
Whatever it is, they don't get along because of this difference.
But in the end, when they have to come together and they cooperate, the solidarity that they feel, it's greater because of that gulf that they had to cross. Right? And remember that in these movies, it's usually worst in the second act when our leads are further apart than ever before.
And so maybe that's where we are in this country, late in the second act of a buddy cop movie --
(Laughter)
torn apart but about to come back together.
It sounds good, but if we want it to happen, I think the responsibility is going to start with us.
So this is my call to you: let's put this country back together.
Let's do it despite the politicians and the media and Facebook and Twitter and Congressional redistricting and all of it, all the things that divide us.
Let's do it because it's right.
And let's do it because this hate and contempt that flows through all of us every day makes us ugly and it corrupts us, and it threatens the very fabric of our society.
We owe it to one another and our country to reach out and try to connect.
We can't afford to hate them any longer, and we can't afford to let them hate us either. Empathy and respect. Empathy and respect. If you think about it, it's the very least that we owe our fellow citizens.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a relationship builder.
When you think of a relationship builder, don't you just automatically think "architect?" Probably not. That's because most people think architects design buildings and cities, but what we really design are relationships, because cities are about people.
They're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange.
And besides, skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects, plants and animals, and even their own weather.
But today, urban habitats are out of balance.
Climate change, together with political and economic troubles, are having an impact; they're adding up and stressing out cities and us, the people who live in them.
For me, the field of ecology has provided important insight, because ecologists don't just look at individual species on their own, they look at the relationships between living things and their environment.
They look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected, and it's actually this balance, this web of life, that sustains life.
My team and I have been applying insights from ecology to architecture to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships.
The projects I'm going to show you today use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design.
Here's an example of what I mean.
Recently, we were asked to design a center for social justice leadership called the Arcus Center.
They asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and in doing so, create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice.
The students wanted a place for cultural exchange.
They thought a place for preparing food together could do that.
And they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community.
They thought a fireplace could draw people in and help start conversations.
And everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world.
There really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space, so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses.
Community meeting houses are places where there's very specific relationships between people, like this one in Mali, where the elders gather.
The low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye level.
It's very egalitarian.
I mean, you can't stand up and take over the meeting.
You'd actually bump your head.
(Laughter)
In meeting houses, there's always a central space where you can sit around a circle and see each other.
So we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the Arcus Center, and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen.
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes, but it was so important to the concept, we got it done.
And now the central space works for big social gatherings and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time.
It's almost like this three-way intersection that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation.
Now you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on.
You can sit by the fireplace and share stories.
You can study together in big groups or in small ones, because the architecture sets up these opportunities.
Even the construction is about building relationships.
It's made of cordwood masonry, which is using logs the way you would use bricks.
It's super low-tech and easy to do and anyone can do it -- and that's the entire point.
The act of making is a social activity.
And it's good for the planet, too: the trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up, and they gave off oxygen, and now that carbon is trapped inside the walls and it's not being released into the atmosphere.
So making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road.
We chose the building method because it connects people to each other and to the environment.
But is it working? Is it creating relationships and nurturing them?
How can we know? Well, more and more people are coming here, for one, and as a result of the fireside chats and a full calendar of programming, people are applying for the Arcus Fellowships.
In fact, applications have increased tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship since the building opened. It's working. It's bringing people together.
So I've shown how architecture can connect people on this kind of horizontal campus scale.
But we wondered if social relationships could be scaled up -- or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings.
They can seem isolating and inward.
You might only see people in those awkward elevator rides.
But in several major cities, I've been designing tall buildings that are based on creating relationships between people.
This is Aqua. It's a residential high-rise in Chicago aimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters, many of them new to the city.
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see if we could use architecture to help people get to know their neighbors, even when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension.
So we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors.
The shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower.
The result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony.
The balconies are misregistered.
You can lean over your balcony and say, "Hey!" just like you would across the backyard.
To make the balconies more comfortable for a longer period of time during the year, we studied the wind with digital simulations, so the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind and confuses the wind and makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy.
Now, just by being able to go outside on your balcony or on the third floor roof terrace, you can be connected to the outdoors, even when you're way above the ground plane.
So the building acts to create community within the building and the city at the same time. It's working. And people are starting to meet each other on the building surface and we've heard — (Laughter) they've even starting getting together as couples.
But besides romantic relationships, the building has a positive social effect on the community, as evidenced by people starting groups together and starting big projects together, like this organic community garden on the building's roof terrace.
So I've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors, but what about public architecture?
How can we create better social cohesion in public buildings and civic spaces, and why is it important?
Public architecture is just not as successful if it comes from the top down.
About 15 years ago in Chicago, they started to replace old police stations, and they built this identical model all over the city.
And even though they had good intentions of treating all neighborhoods equally, the communities didn't feel invested in the process or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings.
It was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station, but it wasn't equity in the sense of responding to each community's individual needs.
And equity is the key issue here.
You know, in my field, there's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships.
But I believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit to improve these relationships.
In the US, policy reforms have been recommended in order to rebuild trust.
But my team and I wondered if design and a more inclusive design process could help add something positive to this policy conversation.
We asked ourselves simply: Can design help rebuild trust?
So we reached out to community members and police officers in North Lawndale; it's a neighborhood in Chicago where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress surrounded by a parking lot.
In North Lawndale, people are afraid of police and of going anywhere near the police station, even to report a crime.
So we organized this brainstorming session with both groups participating, and we came up with this whole new idea for the police station.
It's called "Polis Station." "Polis" is a Greek word that means a place with a sense of community.
It's based on the idea that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members, you can rebuild that relationship and activate the neighborhood at the same time.
Instead of the police station as a scary fortress, you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station — places that spark conversation, like a barbershop, a coffee shop or sports courts as well.
Both cops and kids said they love sports.
These insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves, and as designers, our role was just to connect the dots and suggest the first step.
So with the help of the city and the parks, we were able to raise funds and design and build a half-court, right on the police station parking lot.
It's a start. But is it rebuilding trust?
The people in North Lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here, and once in a while an officer joins in.
But now, they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow.
And recently they've asked us to expand the courts and build a park on the site.
And parents report something astonishing.
Before, there was fear of going anywhere the station, and now they say there's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby, and they prefer their kids to play here.
So maybe in the future, on the public side of the station, you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver's license or get money out of an ATM.
It can be a place for neighbors to meet each other and to get to know the officers, and vice versa.
This is not a utopian fantasy.
It's about how do you design to rebuild trust, trusting relationships?
You know, every city has parks, libraries, schools and other public buildings that have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors.
But reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require engaging the people who live there.
Engaging the public can be intimidating, and I've felt that, too.
But maybe that's because in architecture school, we don't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design.
We're taught to defend our design against criticism.
But I think that can change, too.
So if we can focus the design mind on creating positive, reinforcing relationships in architecture and through architecture, I believe we can do much more than create individual buildings.
We can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats.
We can create relationships.
We can help steady this planet we all share.
See? Architects really are relationship builders.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
How many of you are creatives, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists, or maybe you just have a really big imagination?
Show of hands? (Cheers)
That's most of you.
I have some news for us creatives.
Over the course of the next 20 years, more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last 2,000.
In fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.
Now, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.
The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years.
And then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years.
The Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries.
And now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades.
And now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.
Welcome to the Augmented Age.
In this new era, your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented by computational systems that help you think, robotic systems that help you make, and a digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?
(Laughter)
I would actually argue that we're already augmented.
Imagine you're at a party, and somebody asks you a question that you don't know the answer to.
If you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.
But this is just a primitive beginning.
Even Siri is just a passive tool.
In fact, for the last three-and-a-half million years, the tools that we've had have been completely passive.
They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.
Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.
In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me, we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools -- like, manual, literally using our hands, even with computers.
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."
(Laughter)
I want to have a conversation with a computer.
I want to say, "Computer, let's design a car," and the computer shows me a car.
And I say, "No, more fast-looking, and less German," and bang, the computer shows me an option.
(Laughter)
That conversation might be a little ways off, probably less than many of us think, but right now, we're working on it.
Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative.
Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs all by themselves.
All it needs are your goals and your constraints.
I'll give you an example.
In the case of this aerial drone chassis, all you would need to do is tell it something like, it has four propellers, you want it to be as lightweight as possible, and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.
Then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space: every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria -- millions of them.
It takes big computers to do this.
But it comes back to us with designs that we, by ourselves, never could've imagined.
And the computer's coming up with this stuff all by itself -- no one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch.
And by the way, it's no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.
(Laughter)
It's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way evolution does.
What's exciting is we're starting to see this technology out in the real world.
We've been working with Airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future.
It's a ways out still.
But just recently we used a generative-design AI to come up with this.
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.
It's stronger than the original yet half the weight, and it will be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.
So computers can now generate; they can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.
But they're not intuitive.
They still have to start from scratch every single time, and that's because they never learn. Unlike Maggie.
(Laughter)
Maggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools. What do I mean by that? If her owner picks up that leash, Maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty it's time to go for a walk. And how did she learn?
Well, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk. And Maggie did three things: she had to pay attention, she had to remember what happened and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.
Interestingly, that's exactly what computer scientists have been trying to get AIs to do for the last 60 or so years.
Back in 1952, they built this computer that could play Tic-Tac-Toe. Big deal. Then 45 years later, in 1997, Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.
2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy, which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.
In fact, rather than working from predefined recipes, Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.
And then a couple of weeks ago, DeepMind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go, which is the most difficult game that we have.
In fact, in Go, there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe.
So in order to win, what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.
And in fact, at some points, AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.
And things are moving really fast.
I mean, consider -- in the space of a human lifetime, computers have gone from a child's game to what's recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought.
What's basically happening is computers are going from being like Spock to being a lot more like Kirk.
(Laughter)
Right? From pure logic to intuition.
Would you cross this bridge?
Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!"
(Laughter)
And you arrived at that decision in a split second.
You just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe.
And that's exactly the kind of intuition that our deep-learning systems are starting to develop right now.
Very soon, you'll literally be able to show something you've made, you've designed, to a computer, and it will look at it and say, "Sorry, homie, that'll never work.
You have to try again. "Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song, or your next flavor of ice cream.
Or, much more importantly, you could work with a computer to solve a problem that we've never faced before.
For instance, climate change.
We're not doing a very good job on our own, we could certainly use all the help we can get.
That's what I'm talking about, technology amplifying our cognitive abilities so we can imagine and design things that were simply out of our reach as plain old un-augmented humans.
So what about making all of this crazy new stuff that we're going to invent and design?
I think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual, intellectual realm.
How will technology augment us?
In the physical world, robotic systems.
OK, there's certainly a fear that robots are going to take jobs away from humans, and that is true in certain sectors.
But I'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other, and start to inhabit a new space.
This is our applied research lab in San Francisco, where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics, specifically, human-robot collaboration.
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.
As an experiment, we set it up to help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks -- tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall.
(Laughter)
So, Bishop's human partner can tell what to do in plain English and with simple gestures, kind of like talking to a dog, and then Bishop executes on those instructions with perfect precision.
We're using the human for what the human is good at: awareness, perception and decision making.
And we're using the robot for what it's good at: precision and repetitiveness.
Here's another cool project that Bishop worked on.
The goal of this project, which we called the HIVE, was to prototype the experience of humans, computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem.
The humans acted as labor. They cruised around the construction site, they manipulated the bamboo -- which, by the way, because it's a non-isomorphic material, is super hard for robots to deal with.
But then the robots did this fiber winding, which was almost impossible for a human to do.
And then we had an AI that was controlling everything.
It was telling the humans what to do, telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components.
What's interesting is, building this pavilion was simply not possible without human, robot and AI augmenting each other.
OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy.
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D to generatively design and robotically print the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.
So, Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now, as we speak, in Amsterdam.
And when they're done, we're going to hit "Go," and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel, and then they're going to keep printing, without human intervention, until the bridge is finished.
So, as computers are going to augment our ability to imagine and design new stuff, robotic systems are going to help us build and make things that we've never been able to make before.
But what about our ability to sense and control these things?
What about a nervous system for the things that we make?
Our nervous system, the human nervous system, tells us everything that's going on around us.
But the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best.
For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway and Morrison.
A building doesn't tell its designers whether or not the people inside like being there, and the toy manufacturer doesn't know if a toy is actually being played with -- how and where and whether or not it's any fun.
Look, I'm sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for Barbie when they designed her.
(Laughter)
But what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?
(Laughter)
If the designers had known what was really happening in the real world with their designs -- the road, the building, Barbie -- they could've used that knowledge to create an experience that was better for the user.
What's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design, make and use.
What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you from the things you create in the real world?
With all of the stuff we make, we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy -- in fact, last year, about two trillion dollars -- convincing people to buy the things we've made.
But if you had this connection to the things that you design and create after they're out in the real world, after they've been sold or launched or whatever, we could actually change that, and go from making people want our stuff, to just making stuff that people want in the first place.
The good news is, we're working on digital nervous systems that connect us to the things we design.
We're working on one project with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers and their team.
And one of the things these guys do is build insane cars that do absolutely insane things. These guys are crazy --
(Laughter)
in the best way. And what we're doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system.
So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors, put a world-class driver behind the wheel, took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.
And the car's nervous system captured everything that was happening to the car.
We captured four billion data points; all of the forces that it was subjected to.
And then we did something crazy.
We took all of that data, and plugged it into a generative-design AI we call "Dreamcatcher." So what do get when you give a design tool a nervous system, and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis? You get this. This is something that a human could never have designed.
Except a human did design this, but it was a human that was augmented by a generative-design AI, a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fabricate something like this.
So if this is the future, the Augmented Age, and we're going to be augmented cognitively, physically and perceptually, what will that look like?
What is this wonderland going to be like?
I think we're going to see a world where we're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed.
Where we're moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown.
We're going to move from being isolated to being connected.
And we'll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation.
I also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things to valuing autonomy.
Thanks to our augmented capabilities, our world is going to change dramatically.
We're going to have a world with more variety, more connectedness, more dynamism, more complexity, more adaptability and, of course, more beauty.
The shape of things to come will be unlike anything we've ever seen before. Why? Because what will be shaping those things is this new partnership between technology, nature and humanity.
That, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.
Thank you all so much.
(Applause)
Every summer, my family and I travel across the world, 3,000 miles away to the culturally diverse country of India.
Now, India is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity.
For me, the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water.
Now, while in India, my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water, because unlike here in America, where I can just turn on a tap and easily get clean, potable water, in India, the water is often contaminated.
So my parents have to make sure that the water we drink is safe.
However, I soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did.
Outside my grandparents' house in the busy streets of India, I saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun filling buckets with water from a tap.
I even saw children, who looked the same age as me, filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside.
Watching these kids forced to drink water that I felt was too dirty to touch changed my perspective on the world.
This unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find a solution to our world's clean water problem.
I wanted to know why these kids lacked water, a substance that is essential for life.
And I learned that we are facing a global water crisis.
Now, this may seem surprising, as 75 percent of our planet is covered in water, but only 2.5 percent of that is freshwater, and less than one percent of Earth's freshwater supply is available for human consumption.
With rising populations, industrial development and economic growth, our demand for clean water is increasing, yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting.
According to the World Health Organization, 660 million people in our world lack access to a clean water source.
Lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in developing countries, and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children die every day from a water-related disease.
So after returning home one summer in eighth grade, I decided that I wanted to combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in science.
So I decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory.
(Laughter)
Actually, at first I converted my kitchen into a laboratory, but my parents didn't really approve and kicked me out.
I also read a lot of journal papers on water-related research, and I learned that currently in developing countries, something called solar disinfection, or SODIS, is used to purify water.
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours.
The UV radiation from the sun destroys the DNA of these harmful pathogens and decontaminates the water.
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use and energy-efficient, as it only uses solar energy, it's really slow, as it can take up to two days when it's cloudy.
So in order to make the SODIS process faster, this new method called photocatalysis has recently been used.
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?
Let's break it down: "photo" means from the sun, and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction.
So what photocatalysis is doing is it's just speeding up this solar disinfection process.
When sunlight comes in and strikes a photocatalyst, like TiO2, or titanium dioxide, it creates these really reactive oxygen species, like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals.
These reactive oxygen species are able to remove bacteria and organics and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water.
But unfortunately, there are several disadvantages to the way photocatalytic SODIS is currently deployed.
See, what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this photocatalytic coating.
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block UV radiation.
So when they're coated on the inside of these bottles, they're actually blocking some of the UV radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process.
Also, these photocatalytic coatings are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle, which means they wash off, and people end up drinking the catalyst.
While TiO2 is safe and inert, it's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst, because then you have to continue to replenish it, even after a few uses.
So my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe, sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water.
What started off as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification.
The composite combines titanium dioxide with cement.
The cement-like composite can be formed into several different shapes, which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods.
For example, you could create a rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families.
You can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time.
Now, over the course of this, my journey hasn't really been easy.
You know, I didn't have access to a sophisticated laboratory.
I was 14 years old when I started, but I didn't let my age deter me in my interest in pursuing scientific research and wanting to solve the global water crisis.
See, water isn't just the universal solvent.
Water is a universal human right.
And for that reason, I'm continuing to work on this science fair project from 2012 to bring it from the laboratory into the real world.
And this summer, I founded Catalyst for World Water, a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis.
(Applause)
Alone, a single drop of water can't do much, but when many drops come together, they can sustain life on our planet.
Just as water drops come together to form oceans, I believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
As an archaeologist, I'm most often asked what my favorite discovery is.
The answer's easy: my husband, Greg.
(Laughter)
We met in Egypt on my first dig.
It was my first lesson in finding unexpected, wonderful things.
This began an incredible archaeological partnership.
Years later, I proposed to him in front of our favorite pair statue of the Prince and Princess Rahotep and Nofret, in the Cairo Museum, dating to 4,600 years ago.
I thought if I was going to ask Greg to spend the rest of this life with me, then I should ask him in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity.
These symbols endure because when we look at them, we're looking at mirrors.
They are powerful reminders that our common humanity has not changed.
The thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love, because ancient history is the most seductive mistress imaginable.
Many archaeologists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the past under hot suns and Arctic winds and in dense rainforests. Many seek. Some discover. All worship at the temple of possibility that one discovery might change history.
On my first day in Egypt, I worked at a site in the Northeast Egyptian Delta called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago, in a cemetery.
That's a picture of me -- I'm just in my bliss.
On the dig, surrounded by emerald green rice paddies, I discovered an intact pot.
Flipping it over, I discovered a human thumbprint left by whoever made the vessel.
For a moment, time stood still.
I didn't know where I was.
It was because at that moment I realized, when we dig, we're digging for people, not things.
Never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past.
I can't tell you how many times I've stood in front of the Pyramids of Giza, and they leave me speechless.
I feel like the luckiest person in the world.
They're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible.
Many cannot process their brilliance as human -- they think aliens built them.
But this is ridiculous.
All you need to do is get up close and personal, and see the hidden hand of man in the chisel marks left by the tools that built them.
The Great Pyramid of Giza was built one stone at a time with 2.3 million blocks, with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.
It is not the pyramids that stand the test of time; it is human ingenuity.
That is our shared human brilliance.
History may be cyclical, but we are singular.
I love what I do, because I learn that we haven't changed.
I get to read about mother-in-law jokes from Mesopotamia from 3,500 years ago.
(Laughter)
I get to hear about neighbors cursing each other from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.
And my absolute favorite, from 3,300 years ago in Luxor: an inscription that describes schoolboys who cut class to go drinking.
(Laughter)
Kids these days.
(Laughter)
I get to see the most incredible architecture, see stunning sculptures -- I mean, this is basically a selfie in stone -- and see that we've always rocked serious bling.
And also, we've been posting on walls and obsessing about cats --
(Laughter)
for thousands of years.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Archaeologists are the cultural memory preservers and the spokespeople for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures that came before us.
Good science, imagination and a leap of faith are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.
In the last year, archaeologists have made incredible discoveries, including: new human ancestors from South Africa; tools from 3.3 million years ago -- these are the oldest tools ever discovered -- in Kenya.
And this, from a series of medical implements found from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.
What you're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis. Ouch!
(Laughter)
For each of these, there are thousands of other incredibly important discoveries made by my colleagues, that do not make headlines.
However, I believe that the most important thing we do as archaeologists is acknowledge that past people existed and lived lives worth learning about.
Can you even imagine what the world would be like today if we acknowledged all human beings in this way?
So, on a dig, we have a challenge: it often looks like this.
You can't see anything.
Where are we going to start digging?
This is from a site south of Cairo.
Let's have a look from space.
Again, you can't really see much.
What you're looking at is a WorldView-3 satellite image, which has a .3 meter resolution. That's 10 inches.
(Applause)
Thank you.
This means I use satellite images and process them using algorithms, and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum that indicate buried things under the ground that I get to go excavate and survey.
By the way -- NASA has a Space Archaeology program, so it's a real job.
(Laughter)
So, let's have a look again.
We're back at the site just south of Cairo.
You can't see anything.
Keep your eye on the red rectangle.
When we process the image using algorithms -- think like a space-based CAT scan -- this is what you see.
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated, and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years.
(Applause)
I believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what's left to discover.
In the Egyptian Delta alone, we've excavated less than one-1000th of one percent of the total volume of Egyptian sites.
When you add to that the thousands of other sites my team and I have discovered, what we thought we knew pales in comparison to what we have left to discover.
When you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they're finding, I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find.
Discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential of our existence.
But we have a challenge.
Over the last year, we've seen horrible headlines of incredible destruction going on to archaeological sites, and massive looting by people like ISIL.
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.
Who blows up a temple?
They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.
And we've seen looting at sites so rampant, it looks like craters of the moon.
Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy modern human lives, it's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well.
Countless invading armies have done the same throughout history.
We know that ISIL is profiting from the looting of sites, but we don't know the scale.
This means that any object purchased on the market today from the Middle East could potentially be funding terrorism.
When a site is looted, it's as if a puzzle already missing 90 percent of it pieces has had the rest obscured beyond recognition.
This is ancient identity theft writ large.
We know that there are two kinds of looting going on: looting by criminal elements like ISIL, and then more local looting by those that are desperate for money.
We would all do the same to feed our families; I don't blame the local looters.
I blame the middlemen, the unethical traffickers and an international art market that exploits often ambiguous or even completely nonexistent laws.
We know looting is going on on a global scale and it's increasing, but presently we don't have any tools to stop it.
This is beginning to change.
My team and I have just completed a study looking at looting in Egypt.
We looked at open-source data and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt from 2002 to 2013.
We found evidence of looting and site destruction at 267 sites, and mapped over 200,000 looting pits. It's astonishing. And putting that data together -- you can see the looting pits marked here.
At one site, the looting got bad from 2009, 2011, 2012 -- hundreds and hundreds of pits.
Putting all the data together, what we found is that, contrary to popular opinion, looting did not start to get worse in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring, but in 2009, after the global recession.
Thus, we've shown with big data that looting is fundamentally an economic issue.
If we do nothing to stop the problem, all of Egypt's sites will be affected by looting by 2040.
Thus, we are at a tipping point.
We are the generation with all the tools and all the technologies to stop looting, but we're not working fast enough.
Sometimes an archaeological site can surprise you with its resilience.
I am just back from the field, where I co-led a joint mission with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities at a site called Lisht.
This site dates to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.
The Middle Kingdom was Ancient Egypt's Renaissance period.
After a time of intense internal strife and environmental challenges, Egypt rebounded with an incredible resurgence of art, architecture and literature.
It's a favorite period of time to study in Egypt, because it teaches us so much about how we can survive and thrive after great disasters.
Now at this site, we had already mapped countless looting pits.
Lisht is a royal site; there would have been thousands of people buried there who lived and worked at the court of Pharaoh.
You can see this before and after; you see dozens of looting pits. North Lisht. This is in South Lisht, before and after.
When we first visited the site, we could see the tombs of many high-ranking officials that had been looted.
Let me put into perspective for you what was taken.
Imagine a two meter by two meter area full of coffins, jewelry and incredible statuary.
Multiply that times over a thousand.
That's what was taken.
So, when we started work, my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef, approached me and said, "We must work at this one particular tomb.
It's been attacked by looters.
If we don't do anything, they'll be back." Of course I agreed, but I didn't think we'd find anything.
I thought the looters had stolen everything.
What we started to find were the most incredible reliefs.
Look at this painting -- it's just stunning.
We started finding engraved inscriptions.
And even the titles of the tomb owner -- he had titles like, "Overseer of the Army," "Overseer of the Treasury." I began to have hope.
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.
For the ancient Egyptians, having their name last for eternity was their goal.
And then one day, this appeared.
This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.
You can see it written out here, in hieroglyphs.
Working together with my Egyptian team, we had restored someone's name from 3,900 years ago.
(Applause)
Working together with my Egyptian colleagues, we celebrated this moment of shared discovery.
What we were doing together was right and true.
We found this incredible false door, mostly intact.
On it we read about Intef and his inscriptions.
You can actually even see him seated here.
What I realized is that everything I had assumed about looted sites had been proven wrong.
Every day on site we worked together with 70 Egyptians as colleagues and friends.
In the face of so much hatred and ignorance against those in the Middle East, every moment on site felt like a protest for peace.
When you work with those that don't look like you, or think like you, or speak like you, your shared mission of archaeological discovery erases all superficial differences.
What I learned this season is that archaeology isn't about what you find. It's about what you can prove possible.
Sometimes when you travel, you end up finding long-lost family -- not those with whom you share genes, but a shared entry in the book of life.
This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.
Omer's a Gufti from a village just North of Luxor, called Guft.
Guftis are part of a celebrated tradition in Egyptology.
They help with digging and work crew organization.
Omer is my COO and CFO.
I simply couldn't do work without him.
One day many years ago, when I was a young graduate student and Omer was a young Gufti who couldn't speak much English, we learned, completely randomly, that we were born in the same year, the same month and the same day, six hours apart. Twins.
(Laughter)
Separated by an ocean, but forever connected for Ancient Egypt is our mother.
I knew then we'd always work together -- not in my brain, but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained.
(Arabic) Omer by brother, I will always love you.
(English) Omer my brother, I will always love you.
So, just before my first dig in Egypt, my mentor, the very famous Egyptologist Professor William Kelly Simpson, called me into his office.
He handed me a check for $2,000, and said, "This is to cover your expenses.
Have a glorious adventure this summer.
Someday you will do this for someone else." Thus, my TED Prize wish is partial payback, plus interest --
(Laughter)
for a great human being's generosity and kindness.
So, my wish. I wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites around the world.
By creating a 21st-century army of global explorers, we'll find and protect the world's hidden heritage, which contains clues to humankind's collective resilience and creativity.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
So how are we going to do this? We are going to build with the TED Prize money an online, crowdsource, citizen science platform to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering archaeological sites.
There are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world.
It is my dream to engage the world with helping to find sites and protect them.
What you'll do is sign in, create a username -- note that this particular username is already taken.
(Laughter)
You'll take a tutorial and you'll start work.
I want to note at the outset that in no way will be sharing GPS data or mapping data for sites.
We want to treat them like human patient data, and not reveal their locations.
You'll then be dealt a card from a deck -- 20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters, and you'll be looking for features.
My team and I will have batch-processed large amounts of satellite data using algorithms in order for you to find things, so you'll be doing really good science. You'll then be starting to look.
Do you see a pyramid? Do you see any potential site damage or site looting?
You'll then begin to mark what's there. And off to the side are always going to be rich examples of exactly what you're seeing, to help guide you.
All the data that you help us collect will be shared with vetted authorities, and will help create a new global alarm system to help protect sites.
But it's not just going to stop there.
All the archaeologists with whom we share your discoveries will take you with them as they begin to excavate them, by using Periscope, Google Plus and social media.
A hundred years ago, archaeology was for the rich.
Fifty years ago, it was for men.
Now it's primarily for academics.
Our goal is to democratize the process of archaeological discovery, and allow anyone to participate.
Ninety-four years ago, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of King Tut.
Who is the next Howard Carter? It might be you.
that came before us. By creating this platform, we will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people
If we want to answer the big questions about who we are and where we've come from, the answers to those questions do not lie in pyramids or palaces, but in the cities and villages of those that came before us.
If we want to learn about the past, it's time we inverted the pyramids.
Acknowledging that the past is worth saving means so much more.
It means that we're worth saving, too.
And the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey.
But the only way we're going to be able to write it is if we do it together. Come with me.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Back in 2003, the UK government carried out a survey.
And it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy in the population.
And they were shocked to find out that for every 100 working age adults in the country, 47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills -- that's low-end GCSE score.
It's the ability to deal with fractions, percentages and decimals.
So this figure prompted a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.
Policies were changed, investments were made, and then they ran the survey again in 2011.
So can you guess what happened to this number? It went up to 49.
(Laughter) But I preferred, actually, the reaction of a schoolchild when I presented at a school this information, who raised their hand and said, "How do we know that the person who made that number isn't one of the 49 percent either?" (Laughter) So clearly, there's a numeracy issue, because these are important skills for life, and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers.
Now, it's not just an English problem.
OECD this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people, and leading the way, the USA -- nearly 40 percent of young people in the US have low numeracy.
Now, England is there too, but there are seven OECD countries with figures above 20 percent.
That is a problem, because it doesn't have to be that way.
If you look at the far end of this graph, you can see the Netherlands and Korea are in single figures.
So there's definitely a numeracy problem that we want to address.
Now, as useful as studies like these are, I think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories; that there are two kinds of people: those people that are comfortable with numbers, that can do numbers, and the people who can't.
And what I'm trying to talk about here today is to say that I believe that is a false dichotomy.
It's not an immutable pairing.
I think you don't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy to be inspired by numbers, and that should be the starting point to the journey ahead.
And one of the ways in which we can begin that journey, for me, is looking at statistics. Now, I am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem.
(Laughter) It's the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don't particularly like, because whereas the rest of maths is all about precision and certainty, statistics is almost the reverse of that.
But actually, I was a late convert to the world of statistics myself.
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors what two subjects would I be least likely to excel in after university, they'd have told you statistics and computer programming, and yet here I am, about to show you some statistical graphics that I programmed.
So what inspired that change in me?
What made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing?
It's really because statistics are about us.
If you look at the etymology of the word statistics, it's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in.
So statistics are about us as a group, not us as individuals.
And I think as social animals, we share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups, to our peers.
And statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us. And there's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.
They did a survey of over 1,000 adults in the UK, and said, for every 100 people in England and Wales, how many of them are Muslim? Now the average answer from this survey, which was supposed to be representative of the total population, was 24.
That's what people thought.
British people think 24 out of every 100 people in the country are Muslim.
Now, official figures reveal that figure to be about five.
So there's this big variation between what we think, our perception, and the reality as given by statistics.
And I think that's interesting.
What could possibly be causing that misperception?
And I was so thrilled with this study, I started to take questions out in presentations.
I was referring to it. Now, I did a presentation at St. Paul's School for Girls in Hammersmith, and I had an audience rather like this, except it was comprised entirely of sixth-form girls.
And I said, "Girls, how many teenage girls do you think the British public think get pregnant every year?" And the girls were apoplectic when I said the British public think that 15 out of every 100 teenage girls get pregnant in the year.
And they had every right to be angry, because in fact, I'd have to have closer to 200 dots before I could color one in, in terms of what the official figures tell us.
And rather like numeracy, this is not just an English problem.
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey in recent years to go across the world.
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians, for every 100 adults in your country, how many of them are overweight or obese? And the average answer from the Saudis was just over a quarter.
That's what they thought. Just over a quarter of adults are overweight or obese.
(Laughter) The official figures show, actually, it's nearer to three-quarters. So again, a big variation.
And I love this one: they asked in Japan, they asked the Japanese, for every 100 Japanese people, how many of them live in rural areas? The average was about a 50-50 split, just over halfway.
They thought 56 out of every 100 Japanese people lived in rural areas.
The official figure is seven.
So extraordinary variations, and surprising to some, but not surprising to people who have read the work of Daniel Kahneman, for example, the Nobel-winning economist.
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky, spent years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality, the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians.
And there are many reasons for this.
Individual experiences, certainly, can influence our perceptions, but so, too, can things like the media reporting things by exception, rather than what's normal.
Kahneman had a nice way of referring to that. He said, "We can be blind to the obvious" -- so we've got the numbers wrong -- "but we can be blind to our blindness about it." And that has enormous repercussions for decision making.
So at the statistics office while this was all going on, I thought this was really interesting.
I said, this is clearly a global problem, but maybe geography is the issue here.
These were questions that were all about, how well do you know your country?
So in this case, it's how well do you know 64 million people?
Not very well, it turns out.
I can't do that.
So I had an idea, which was to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense. Is this a local? If we reframe the questions and say, how well do you know your local area, would your answers be any more accurate?
So I devised a quiz: How well do you know your area?
It's a simple Web app.
You put in a post code and then it will ask you questions based on census data for your local area.
And I was very conscious in designing this.
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people, not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers. I wanted everyone to engage with it.
So for the design of the quiz, I was inspired by the isotypes of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.
Now, these are methods for representing numbers using repeating icons.
And the numbers are there, but they sit in the background.
So it's a great way of representing quantity without resorting to using terms like "percentage," "fractions" and "ratios." So here's the quiz. The layout of the quiz is, you have your repeating icons on the left-hand side there, and a map showing you the area we're asking you questions about on the right-hand side.
There are seven questions.
Each question, there's a possible answer between zero and a hundred, and at the end of the quiz, you get an overall score between zero and a hundred.
And so because this is TEDxExeter, I thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions of Exeter.
And so the first question is: For every 100 people, how many are aged under 16?
Now, I don't know Exeter very well at all, so I had a guess at this, but it gives you an idea of how this quiz works.
You drag the slider to highlight your icons, and then just click "Submit" to answer, and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality.
And it turns out, I was a pretty terrible guess: five.
How about the next question?
This is asking about what the average age is, so the age at which half the population are younger and half the population are older.
And I thought 35 — that sounds middle-aged to me. (Laughter) Actually, in Exeter, it's incredibly young, and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area.
The questions get harder as you go through.
So this one's now asking about homeownership: For every 100 households, how many are owned with a mortgage or loan?
And I hedged my bets here, because I didn't want to be more than 50 out on the answer. (Laughter) And actually, these get harder, these questions, because when you're in an area, when you're in a community, things like age — there are clues to whether a population is old or young.
Just by looking around the area, you can see it.
Something like homeownership is much more difficult to see, so we revert to our own heuristics, our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes.
Now the truth is, when we published this quiz, the census data that it's based on was already a few years old.
We've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years.
So in some senses, this was all a little bit old and not necessarily new.
But I was interested to see what reaction we might get by gamifying the data in the way that we have, by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions.
It turns out, the reaction was, um ... was more than I could have hoped for. It was a long-held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand.
(Laughter) This URL contains the words "statistics," "gov" and "UK," which are three of people's least favorite words in a URL.
And the amazing thing about this was that the website came down at quarter to 10 at night, because people were actually engaging with this data of their own free will, using their own personal time.
I was very interested to see that we got something like a quarter of a million people playing the quiz within the space of 48 hours of launching it.
And it sparked an enormous discussion online, on social media, which was largely dominated by people having fun with their misconceptions, which is something that I couldn't have hoped for any better, in some respects.
I also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians.
How well do you know the area you claim to represent?
(Laughter) And then just to finish, going back to the two kinds of people, I thought it would be really interesting to see how people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz.
The national statistician of England and Wales, John Pullinger, you would expect he would be pretty good.
(Laughter) He got 44 for his own area. Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly, after a glass of wine -- 36. Even worse. It just shows you that the numbers can inspire us all. They can surprise us all.
So very often, we talk about statistics as being the science of uncertainty.
My parting thought for today is: actually, statistics is the science of us.
And that's why we should be fascinated by numbers.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
One summer afternoon in 2013, DC police detained, questioned and searched a man who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous.
This wasn't what I was wearing the day of the detention, to be fair, but I have a picture of that as well.
I know it's very frightening -- try to remain calm.
(Laughter)
At this time, I was interning at the Public Defender Service in Washington DC, and I was visiting a police station for work.
I was on my way out, and before I could make it to my car, two police cars pulled up to block my exit, and an officer approached me from behind.
He told me to stop, take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us.
About a dozen officers then gathered near us.
All of them had handguns, some had assault rifles.
They rifled through my backpack. They patted me down.
They took pictures of me spread on the police car, and they laughed.
And as all this was happening -- as I was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs, trying to think clearly about what I should do -- something stuck out to me as odd.
When I look at myself in this photo, if I were to describe myself, I think I'd say something like, "19-year-old Indian male, bright T-shirt, wearing glasses." But they weren't including any of these details.
Into their police radios as they described me, they kept saying, "Middle Eastern male with a backpack.
Middle Eastern male with a backpack." And this description carried on into their police reports.
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms: "lurking," "nefarious," "terrorist." And the detention dragged on like this.
They sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area I'd been in.
They called the federal government to see if I was on any watch lists.
They sent a couple of detectives to cross-examine me on why, if I claimed I had nothing to hide, I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.
And I could see they weren't happy with me, but I felt I had no way of knowing what they'd want to do next.
At one point, the officer who patted me down scanned the side of the police station to see where the security camera was to see how much of this was being recorded.
And when he did that, it really sank in how completely I was at their mercy.
I think we're all normalized from a young age to the idea of police officers and arrests and handcuffs, so it's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive a thing it is to seize control over another person's body.
I know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated I was because of my race -- and yes, I don't think I would've been detained if I were white.
But actually, what I have in mind today is something else.
What I have in mind is how much worse things might've been if I weren't affluent.
I mean, they thought I might be trying to plant an explosive, and they investigated that possibility for an hour and a half, but I was never put in handcuffs, I was never taken to a jail cell.
I think if I were from one of Washington DC's poor communities of color, and they thought I was endangering officers' lives, things might've ended differently.
And in fact, in our system, I think it's better to be an affluent person suspected of trying to blow up a police station than it is to be a poor person who's suspected of much, much less than this.
I want to give you an example from my current work.
Right now, I'm working at a civil rights organization in DC, called Equal Justice Under Law.
Let me start by asking you all a question.
How many of you have ever gotten a parking ticket in your life? Raise your hand. Yeah. So have I. And when I had to pay it, it felt annoying and it felt bad, but I paid it and I moved on.
I'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well.
But what would happen if you couldn't afford the amount on the ticket and your family doesn't have the money either, what happens then?
Well, one thing that's not supposed to happen under the law is, you're not supposed to be arrested and jailed simply because you can't afford to pay.
That's illegal under federal law.
But that's what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor.
And so many of our lawsuits at Equal Justice Under Law target these modern-day debtors' prisons.
One of our cases is against Ferguson, Missouri.
And I know when I say Ferguson, many of you will think of police violence.
But today I want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens.
Ferguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants, per person, per year, mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.
When I imagine what that would feel like if, every time I left my house, there was a chance a police officer would run my license plate, see a warrant for unpaid debt, seize my body they way the did in DC and then take me to a jail cell, I feel a little sick.
I've met many of the people in Ferguson who have experienced this, and I've heard some of their stories.
In Ferguson's jail, in each small cell, there's a bunk bed and a toilet, but they'd pack four people into each cell.
So there'd be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor, one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet, which was never cleaned.
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned, so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus.
No water to drink, except coming out of a spigot connected to the toilet.
The water looked and tasted dirty, there was never enough food, never any showers, women menstruating without any hygiene products, no medical attention whatsoever.
When I asked a woman about medical attention, she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.
The only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual."
So, they'd take the debtors to this place and they'd say, "We're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt." And if you could -- if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money, then maybe you were out.
If it was enough money, you were out.
But if it wasn't, you'd stay there for days or weeks, and every day the guards would come down to the cells and haggle with the debtors about the price of release that day.
You'd stay until, at some point, the jail would be booked to capacity, and they'd want to book someone new in.
And at that point, they'd think, "OK, it's unlikely this person can come up with the money, it's more likely this new person will." You're out, they're in, and the machine kept moving like that.
I met a man who, nine years ago, was arrested for panhandling in a Walgreens.
He couldn't afford his fines and his court fees from that case.
When he was young he survived a house fire, only because he jumped out of the third-story window to escape.
But that fall left him with damage to his brain and several parts of this body, including his leg.
So he can't work, and he relies on social security payments to survive.
When I met him in his apartment, he had nothing of value there -- not even food in his fridge.
He's chronically hungry.
He had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard on which he'd written the names of his children.
He cherished this a lot. He was happy to show it to me.
But he can't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give.
In the last nine years, he's been arrested 13 times, and jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case. One of those stretches lasted 45 days.
Just imagine spending from right now until sometime in June in the place that I described to you a few moments ago.
He told me about all the suicide attempts he's seen in Ferguson's jail; about the time a man found a way to hang himself out of reach of the other inmates, so all they could do was yell and yell and yell, trying to get the guards' attention so they could come down and cut him down.
And he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond, and when they came, the man was unconscious.
So they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell.
They said, "He'll be OK," so they just left him there on the floor.
I heard many stories like this and they shouldn't have surprised me, because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails.
This is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails.
I met a woman, single mother of three, making seven dollars an hour.
She relies on food stamps to feed herself and her children.
About a decade ago, she got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge, and she can't afford her fines and fees on those cases.
Since then, she's been jailed about 10 times on those cases, but she has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and she needs medication every day.
She doesn't have access to those medications in Ferguson's jail, because no one has access to their medications.
She told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage, hallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices, begging for the medication that would make it all stop, only to be ignored.
And this isn't anomalous, either: thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs just like hers, but only one in six receives any mental health care while in jail.
And so, I heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon that Ferguson was operating for its debtors, and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go visit Ferguson's jail, I'm not sure what I was expecting to see, but I wasn't expecting this.
It's an ordinary government building.
It could be a post office or a school.
It reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes aren't being run somewhere in the shadows, they're being run out in the open by our public officials.
They're a matter of public policy.
And this reminded me that poverty jailing in general, even outside the debtors' prison context, plays a very visible and central role in our justice system.
What I have in mind is our policy of bail.
In our system, whether you're detained or free, pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose. It's a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail amount.
So Bill Cosby, whose bail was set at a million dollars, immediately writes the check, and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail, was only there because her family was unable to come up with 500 dollars.
In fact, there are half a million Sandra Blands across the country -- 500,000 people who are in jail right now, only because they can't afford their bail amount.
We're told that our jails are places for criminals, but statistically that's not the case: three out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial.
They haven't been convicted of any crime; they haven't pled guilty to any offense.
Right here in San Francisco, 85 percent of the inmates in our jail in San Francisco are pretrial detainees.
This means San Francisco is spending something like 80 million dollars every year to fund pretrial detention.
Many of these people who are in jail only because they can't post bail are facing allegations so minor that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial is longer than the sentence they would receive if convicted, which means they're guaranteed to get out faster if they just plead guilty.
So now the choice is: Should I stay here in this horrible place, away from my family and my dependents, almost guaranteed to lose my job, and then fight the charges?
Or should I just plead guilty to whatever the prosecutor wants and get out?
And at this point, they're pretrial detainees, not criminals.
But once they take that plea deal, we'll call them criminals, even though an affluent person would never have been in this situation, because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out.
At this point you might be wondering, "This guy's in the inspiration section, what is he doing --
(Laughter)
"This is extremely depressing.
I want my money back. "
(Laughter)
But in actuality, I find talking about jailing much less depressing than the alternative, because I think if we don't talk about these issues and collectively change how we think about jailing, at the end of all of our lives, we'll still have jails full of poor people who don't belong there.
That really is depressing to me.
But what's exciting to me is the thought that these stories can move us to think about jailing in different terms.
Not in sterile policy terms like "mass incarceration," or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders," but in human terms.
When we put a human being in a cage for days or weeks or months or even years, what are we doing to that person's mind and body?
Under what conditions are we really willing to do that?
And so if starting with a few hundred of us in this room, we can commit to thinking about jailing in this different light, then we can undo that normalization I was referring to earlier.
If I leave you with anything today, I hope it's with the thought that if we want anything to fundamentally change -- not just to reform our policies on bail and fines and fees -- but also to make sure that whatever new policies replace those don't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way.
If we want that kind of change, then this shift in thinking is required of each of us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So many of you have probably seen the movie "The Martian." But for those of you who did not, it's a movie about an astronaut who is stranded on Mars, and his efforts to stay alive until the Earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to Earth.
Gladly, they do re-establish communication with the character, astronaut Watney, at some point so that he's not as alone on Mars until he can be rescued.
So while you're watching the movie, or even if you haven't, when you think about Mars, you're probably thinking about how far away it is and how distant.
And, what might not have occurred to you is, what are the logistics really like of working on another planet -- of living on two planets when there are people on the Earth and there are rovers or people on Mars?
So think about when you have friends, families and co-workers in California, on the West Coast or in other parts of the world.
When you're trying to communicate with them, one of the things you probably first think about is: wait, what time is it in California?
Will I wake them up?
Is it OK to call?
So even if you're interacting with colleagues who are in Europe, you're immediately thinking about: What does it take to coordinate communication when people are far away? So we don't have people on Mars right now, but we do have rovers.
And actually right now, on Curiosity, it is 6: 10 in the morning.
So, 6: 10 in the morning on Mars.
We have four rovers on Mars.
The United States has put four rovers on Mars since the mid-1990s, and I have been privileged enough to work on three of them.
So, I am a spacecraft engineer, a spacecraft operations engineer, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Los Angeles, California.
And these rovers are our robotic emissaries.
So, they are our eyes and our ears, and they see the planet for us until we can send people.
So we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers.
So before we send people, we send robots.
So the reason there's a time difference on Mars right now, from the time that we're at is because the Martian day is longer than the Earth day.
Our Earth day is 24 hours, because that's how long it takes the Earth to rotate, how long it takes to go around once.
So our day is 24 hours.
It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately 40 minutes to rotate once.
So that means that the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.
So teams of people who are operating the rovers on Mars, like this one, what we are doing is we are living on Earth, but working on Mars.
So we have to think as if we are actually on Mars with the rover.
Our job, the job of this team, of which I'm a part of is to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day.
To tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.
So while she's sleeping -- and the rover does sleep at night because she needs to recharge her batteries and she needs to weather the cold Martian night.
And so she sleeps.
So while she sleeps, we work on her program for the next day.
So I work the Martian night shift. (Laughter) So in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars — like, let's say I need to be at work at 5: 00 p.m., this team needs to be at work at 5: 00 p.m. Mars time every day, then we have to come to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day, in order to stay in sync with Mars.
That's like moving a time zone every day.
So one day you come in at 8: 00, the next day 40 minutes later at 8: 40, the next day 40 minutes later at 9: 20, the next day at 10: 00.
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day, until soon you're coming to work in the middle of the night -- the middle of the Earth night. Right? So you can imagine how confusing that is.
Hence, the Mars watch. (Laughter) This weights in this watch have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly. Right? And we didn't start out — I got this watch in 2004 when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then.
We didn't start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches. Right? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers and on the mission control screens, and that would be enough.
Yeah, not so much.
Because we weren't just working on Mars time, we were actually living on Mars time.
And we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was.
So you really needed something on your wrist to tell you: What time is it on the Earth?
What time is it on Mars?
And it wasn't just the time on Mars that was confusing; we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it.
So a "sol" is a Martian day -- again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.
So when we're talking about something that's happening on the Earth, we will say, today.
(Laughter) So, for Mars, we say, "tosol." Yesterday became "yestersol" ' for Mars.
Again, we didn't start out thinking, "Oh, let's invent a language." It was just very confusing.
I remember somebody walked up to me and said, "I would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover." And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, or Mars, tomorrow?" We started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other. (Laughter) Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow." Because people have different preferences for the words they use.
Some of you might say "soda" and some of you might say "pop." So we have people who say "nextersol" or "solorrow." And then something that I noticed after a few years of working on these missions, was that the people who work on the rovers, we say "tosol." The people who work on the landed missions that don't rove around, they say "tosoul." So I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent. (Laughter) So we have the watches and the language, and you're detecting a theme here, right?
So that we don't get confused.
But even the Earth daylight could confuse us.
If you think that right now, you've come to work and it's the middle of the Martian night and there's light streaming in from the windows that's going to be confusing as well.
So you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down.
So that there's no light to distract us.
The blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing, and they didn't go up until we went off Mars time.
So this also works for the house, for at home.
I've been on Mars time three times, and my husband is like, OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.
And so he'll put foil all over the windows and dark curtains and shades because it also affects your families.
And so here I was living in kind of this darkened environment, but so was he.
And he'd gotten used to it.
But then I would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work.
Should I come home? Are you awake? What time is it on Mars?
And I decided, OK, so he needs a Mars watch. (Laughter) But of course, it's 2016, so there's an app for that. (Laughter) So now instead of the watches, we can also use our phones.
But the impact on families was just across the board; it wasn't just those of us who were working on the rovers but our families as well.
This is David Oh, one of our flight directors, and he's at the beach in Los Angeles with his family at 1: 00 in the morning. (Laughter) So because we landed in August and his kids didn't have to go back to school until September, they actually went on to Mars time with him for one month.
They got up 40 minutes later every day.
And they were on dad's work schedule.
So they lived on Mars time for a month and had these great adventures, like going bowling in the middle of the night or going to the beach.
And one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles at 3: 00 in the morning when there's no traffic.
(Laughter)
So we would get off work, and we didn't want to go home and bother our families, and we were hungry, so instead of going locally to eat something, we'd go, "Wait, there's this great all-night deli in Long Beach, and we can get there in 10 minutes!" So we would drive down -- it was like the 60s, no traffic.
We would drive down there, and the restaurant owners would go, "Who are you people?
And why are you at my restaurant at 3: 00 in the morning? "So they came to realize that there were these packs of Martians, roaming the LA freeways, in the middle of the night — in the middle of the Earth night.
And we did actually start calling ourselves Martians.
So those of us who were on Mars time would refer to ourselves as Martians, and everyone else as Earthlings.
(Laughter)
And that's because when you're moving a time-zone every day, you start to really feel separated from everyone else.
You're literally in your own world.
So I have this button on that says, "I survived Mars time.
Sol 0-90. "And there's a picture of it up on the screen.
So the reason we got these buttons is because we work on Mars time in order to be as efficient as possible with the rover on Mars, to make the best use of our time.
But we don't stay on Mars time for more than three to four months.
Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars time, which is what we're working now.
And that's because it's hard on your bodies, it's hard on your families.
In fact, there were sleep researchers who actually were studying us because it was so unusual for humans to try to extend their day.
And they had about 30 of us that they would do sleep deprivation experiments on.
So I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one.
And that was because, again, this eventually becomes hard on your body.
Even though it was a blast.
It was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team, but it is difficult to sustain.
So these rover missions are our first steps out into the solar system.
We are learning how to live on more than one planet.
We are changing our perspective to become multi-planetary.
So the next time you see a Star Wars movie, and there are people going from the Dagobah system to Tatooine, think about what it really means to have people spread out so far. What it means in terms of the distances between them, how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time.
We have not sent people to Mars yet, but we hope to.
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA and all of the international space agencies of the world, we hope to do that in the next few decades.
So soon we will have people on Mars, and we truly will be multi-planetary.
And the young boy or the young girl who will be going to Mars could be in this audience or listening today.
I have wanted to work at JPL on these missions since I was 14 years old and I am privileged to be a part of it.
And this is a remarkable time in the space program, and we are all in this journey together.
So the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day, just remember, it's all a matter of your Earthly perspective.
Thank you. (Applause)
Tom Stranger: In 1996, when I was 18 years old, I had the golden opportunity to go on an international exchange program.
Ironically, I'm an Australian who prefers proper icy cold weather, so I was both excited and tearful when I got on a plane to Iceland, after just having farewelled my parents and brothers goodbye.
I was welcomed into the home of a beautiful Icelandic family who took me hiking, and helped me get a grasp of the melodic Icelandic language.
I struggled a bit with the initial period of homesickness.
I snowboarded after school, and I slept a lot.
Two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don't yet fully understand can be a pretty good sedative.
(Laughter)
My teacher recommended I try out for the school play, just to get me a bit more socially active.
It turns out I didn't end up being part of the play, but through it I met Thordis.
We shared a lovely teenage romance, and we'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.
I met her welcoming family, and she met my friends.
We'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month when our school's Christmas Ball was held.
Thordis Elva: I was 16 and in love for the first time.
Going together to the Christmas dance was a public confirmation of our relationship, and I felt like the luckiest girl in the world.
No longer a child, but a young woman.
High on my newfound maturity, I felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night, too.
That was a bad idea.
I became very ill, drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.
The security guards wanted to call me an ambulance, but Tom acted as my knight in shining armor, and told them he'd take me home.
It was like a fairy tale, his strong arms around me, laying me in the safety of my bed.
But the gratitude that I felt towards him soon turned to horror as he proceeded to take off my clothes and get on top of me.
My head had cleared up, but my body was still too weak to fight back, and the pain was blinding.
I thought I'd be severed in two.
In order to stay sane, I silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock.
And ever since that night, I've known that there are 7,200 seconds in two hours.
Despite limping for days and crying for weeks, this incident didn't fit my ideas about rape like I'd seen on TV.
Tom wasn't an armed lunatic; he was my boyfriend.
And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway, it happened in my own bed.
By the time I could identify what had happened to me as rape, he had completed his exchange program and left for Australia.
So I told myself it was pointless to address what had happened.
And besides, it had to have been my fault, somehow.
I was raised in a world where girls are taught that they get raped for a reason.
Their skirt was too short, their smile was too wide, their breath smelled of alcohol.
And I was guilty of all of those things, so the shame had to be mine.
It took me years to realize that only one thing could have stopped me from being raped that night, and it wasn't my skirt, it wasn't my smile, it wasn't my childish trust.
The only thing that could've stopped me from being raped that night is the man who raped me -- had he stopped himself.
TS: I have vague memories of the next day: the after effects of drinking, a certain hollowness that I tried to stifle. Nothing more. But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.
It is important to now state that I didn't see my deed for what it was.
The word "rape" didn't echo around my mind as it should've, and I wasn't crucifying myself with memories of the night before.
It wasn't so much a conscious refusal, it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden.
My definition of my actions completely refuted any recognition of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.
To be honest, I repudiated the entire act in the days afterwards and when I was committing it.
I disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape.
And this is a lie I've felt spine-bending guilt for.
I broke up with Thordis a couple of days later, and then saw her a number of times during the remainder of my year in Iceland, feeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time.
Deep down, I knew I'd done something immeasurably wrong.
But without planning it, I sunk the memories deep, and then I tied a rock to them.
What followed is a nine-year period that can best be titled as "Denial and Running." When I got a chance to identify the real torment that I caused, I didn't stand still long enough to do so.
Whether it be via distraction, substance use, thrill-seeking or the scrupulous policing of my inner speak, I refused to be static and silent.
And with this noise, I also drew heavily upon other parts of my life to construct a picture of who I was.
I was a surfer, a social science student, a friend to good people, a loved brother and son, an outdoor recreation guide, and eventually, a youth worker.
I gripped tight to the simple notion that I wasn't a bad person.
I didn't think I had this in my bones.
I thought I was made up of something else.
In my nurtured upbringing, my loving extended family and role models, people close to me were warm and genuine in their respect shown towards women.
It took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself, and to ask it questions.
TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance, I was 25 years old, and headed straight for a nervous breakdown.
My self-worth was buried under a soul-crushing load of silence that isolated me from everyone that I cared about, and I was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger that I took out on myself.
One day, I stormed out of the door in tears after a fight with a loved one, and I wandered into a café, where I asked the waitress for a pen.
I always had a notebook with me, claiming that it was to jot down ideas in moments of inspiration, but the truth was that I needed to be constantly fidgeting, because in moments of stillness, I found myself counting seconds again.
But that day, I watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen, forming the most pivotal letter I've ever written, addressed to Tom.
Along with an account of the violence that he subjected me to, the words, "I want to find forgiveness" stared back at me, surprising nobody more than myself.
But deep down I realized that this was my way out of my suffering, because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness, I deserved peace.
My era of shame was over.
Before sending the letter, I prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses, or what I found likeliest: no response whatsoever.
The only outcome that I didn't prepare myself for was the one that I then got -- a typed confession from Tom, full of disarming regret.
As it turns out, he, too, had been imprisoned by silence.
And this marked the start of an eight-year-long correspondence that God knows was never easy, but always honest.
I relieved myself of the burdens that I'd wrongfully shouldered, and he, in turn, wholeheartedly owned up to what he'd done.
Our written exchanges became a platform to dissect the consequences of that night, and they were everything from gut-wrenching to healing beyond words.
And yet, it didn't bring about closure for me.
Perhaps because the email format didn't feel personal enough, perhaps because it's easy to be brave when you're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet.
But we'd begun a dialogue that I felt was necessary to explore to its fullest.
So, after eight years of writing, and nearly 16 years after that dire night, I mustered the courage to propose a wild idea: that we'd meet up in person and face our past once and for all.
TS: Iceland and Australia are geographically like this.
In the middle of the two is South Africa.
We decided upon the city of Cape Town, and there we met for one week.
The city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness.
Nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested like it has in South Africa.
As a nation, South Africa sought to sit within the truth of its past, and to listen to the details of its history.
Knowing this only magnified the effect that Cape Town had on us.
Over the course of this week, we literally spoke our life stories to each other, from start to finish.
And this was about analyzing our own history.
We followed a strict policy of being honest, and this also came with a certain exposure, an open-chested vulnerability.
There were gutting confessions, and moments where we just absolutely couldn't fathom the other person's experience.
The seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt, face to face.
At other times, though, we found a soaring clarity, and even some totally unexpected but liberating laughter.
When it came down to it, we did out best to listen to each other intently.
And our individual realities were aired with an unfiltered purity that couldn't do any less than lighten the soul.
TE: Wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion -- instinctual, even.
And all I wanted to do for years was to hurt Tom back as deeply as he had hurt me.
But had I not found a way out of the hatred and anger, I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.
That isn't to say that I didn't have my doubts along the way.
When the plane bounced on that landing strip in Cape Town, I remember thinking, "Why did I not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka like a normal person would do?"
(Laughter)
At times, our search for understanding in Cape Town felt like an impossible quest, and all I wanted to do was to give up and go home to my loving husband, Vidir, and our son.
But despite our difficulties, this journey did result in a victorious feeling that light had triumphed over darkness, that something constructive could be built out of the ruins.
I read somewhere that you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger.
And back when I was a teenager, I would have needed to know that the shame wasn't mine, that there's hope after rape, that you can even find happiness, like I share with my husband today.
Which is why I started writing feverishly upon my return from Cape Town, resulting in a book co-authored by Tom, that we hope can be of use to people from both ends of the perpetrator-survivor scale.
If nothing else, it's a story that we would've needed to hear when we were younger.
Given the nature of our story, I know the words that inevitably accompany it -- victim, rapist -- and labels are a way to organize concepts, but they can also be dehumanizing in their connotations.
Once someone's been deemed a victim, it's that much easier to file them away as someone damaged, dishonored, less than.
And likewise, once someone has been branded a rapist, it's that much easier to call him a monster -- inhuman.
But how will we understand what it is in human societies that produces violence if we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it? And how --
(Applause)
And how can we empower survivors if we're making them feel less than?
How can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world, if the very words we use are part of the problem?
TS: From what I've now learnt, my actions that night in 1996 were a self-centered taking.
I felt deserving of Thordis's body.
I've had primarily positive social influences and examples of equitable behavior around me.
But on that occasion, I chose to draw upon the negative ones.
The ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth, and of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies.
These influences I speak of are external to me, though.
And it was only me in that room making choices, nobody else.
When you own something and really square up to your culpability, I do think a surprising thing can happen.
It's what I call a paradox of ownership.
I thought I'd buckle under the weight of responsibility.
I thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt.
Instead, I was offered to really own what I did, and found that it didn't possess the entirety of who I am.
Put simply, something you've done doesn't have to constitute the sum of who you are.
The noise in my head abated.
The indulgent self-pity was starved of oxygen, and it was replaced with the clean air of acceptance -- an acceptance that I did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me; an acceptance that I am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men who have been sexually violent toward their partners.
Don't underestimate the power of words.
Saying to Thordis that I raped her changed my accord with myself, as well as with her.
But most importantly, the blame transferred from Thordis to me.
Far too often, the responsibility is attributed to female survivors of sexual violence, and not to the males who enact it.
Far too often, the denial and running leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth.
There's definitely a public conversation happening now, and like a lot of people, we're heartened that there's less retreating from this difficult but important discussion.
I feel a real responsibility to add our voices to it.
TE: What we did is not a formula that we're prescribing for others.
Nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain or their greatest error.
Breaking your silence is never easy, and depending on where you are in the world, it can even be deadly to speak out about rape.
I realize that even the most traumatic event of my life is still a testament to my privilege, because I can talk about it without getting ostracized, or even killed.
But with that privilege of having a voice comes the responsibility of using it.
That's the least I owe my fellow survivors who can't.
The story we've just relayed is unique, and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
One of the things that I found useful on my own healing journey is educating myself about sexual violence.
And as a result, I've been reading, writing and speaking about this issue for over a decade now, going to conferences around the world.
And in my experience, the attendees of such events are almost exclusively women.
But it's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women's issue.
(Applause)
A majority of sexual violence against women and men is perpetrated by men.
And yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion.
But all of us are needed here.
Just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate if we dared to face this issue together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Most of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do, whether it's our job, family, school or anything else. I feel that way. I try my best.
But some time ago, I came to a realization that I wasn't getting much better at the things I cared most about, whether it was being a husband or a friend or a professional or teammate, and I wasn't improving much at those things even though I was spending a lot of time working hard at them.
I've since realized from conversations I've had and from research that this stagnation, despite hard work, turns out to be pretty common.
So I'd like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it.
What I've learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate.
They go through life deliberately alternating between two zones: the learning zone and the performance zone.
The learning zone is when our goal is to improve.
Then we do activities designed for improvement, concentrating on what we haven't mastered yet, which means we have to expect to make mistakes, knowing that we will learn from them.
That is very different from what we do when we're in our performance zone, which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can, to execute.
Then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes.
Both of these zones should be part of our lives, but being clear about when we want to be in each of them, with what goal, focus and expectations, helps us better perform and better improve.
The performance zone maximizes our immediate performance, while the learning zone maximizes our growth and our future performance.
The reason many of us don't improve much despite our hard work is that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone.
This hinders our growth, and ironically, over the long term, also our performance.
So what does the learning zone look like?
Take Demosthenes, a political leader and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient Greece.
To become great, he didn't spend all his time just being an orator or a lawyer, which would be his performance zone.
But instead, he did activities designed for improvement. Of course, he studied a lot. He studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors, but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people, so he also studied great speeches and acting.
To get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder, he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror, and he suspended a sword from the ceiling so that if he raised his shoulder, it would hurt.
(Laughter)
To speak more clearly despite a lisp, he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth.
He built an underground room where he could practice without interruptions and not disturb other people.
And since courts at the time were very noisy, he also practiced by the ocean, projecting his voice above the roar of the waves.
His activities in the learning zone were very different from his activities in court, his performance zone.
In the learning zone, he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice. This involves breaking down abilities into component skills, being clear about what subskill we're working to improve, like keeping our shoulders down, giving full concentration to a high level of challenge outside our comfort zone, just beyond what we can currently do, using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments, and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach, because activities designed for improvement are domain-specific, and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are and can also give us expert feedback.
It is this type of practice in the learning zone which leads to substantial improvement, not just time on task performing.
For example, research shows that after the first couple of years working in a profession, performance usually plateaus.
This has been shown to be true in teaching, general medicine, nursing and other fields, and it happens because once we think we have become good enough, adequate, then we stop spending time in the learning zone.
We focus all our time on just doing our job, performing, which turns out not to be a great way to improve.
But the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone do continue to always improve.
The best salespeople at least once a week do activities with the goal of improvement.
They read to extend their knowledge, consult with colleagues or domain experts, try out new strategies, solicit feedback and reflect.
The best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess, which would be their performance zone, but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them.
Each of us has probably spent many, many, many hours typing on a computer without getting faster, but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day fully concentrating on typing 10 to 20 percent faster than our current reliable speed, we would get faster, especially if we also identified what mistakes we're making and practiced typing those words.
That's deliberate practice.
In what other parts of our lives, perhaps that we care more about, are we working hard but not improving much because we're always in the performance zone?
Now, this is not to say that the performance zone has no value.
It very much does.
When I needed a knee surgery, I didn't tell the surgeon, "Poke around in there and focus on what you don't know."
(Laughter)
"We'll learn from your mistakes!" I looked for a surgeon who I felt would do a good job, and I wanted her to do a good job.
Being in the performance zone allows us to get things done as best as we can.
It can also be motivating, and it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next when we go back to the learning zone.
So the way to high performance is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone, purposefully building our skills in the learning zone, then applying those skills in the performance zone.
When Beyoncé is on tour, during the concert, she's in her performance zone, but every night when she gets back to the hotel room, she goes right back into her learning zone.
She watches a video of the show that just ended.
She identifies opportunities for improvement, for herself, her dancers and her camera staff.
And the next morning, everyone receives pages of notes with what to adjust, which they then work on during the day before the next performance.
It's a spiral to ever-increasing capabilities, but we need to know when we seek to learn, and when we seek to perform, and while we want to spend time doing both, the more time we spend in the learning zone, the more we'll improve.
So how can we spend more time in the learning zone?
First, we must believe and understand that we can improve, what we call a growth mindset.
Second, we must want to improve at that particular skill.
There has to be a purpose we care about, because it takes time and effort.
Third, we must have an idea about how to improve, what we can do to improve, not how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager, performing songs over and over again, but doing deliberate practice.
And fourth, we must be in a low-stakes situation, because if mistakes are to be expected, then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic, or even very significant.
A tightrope walker doesn't practice new tricks without a net underneath, and an athlete wouldn't set out to first try a new move during a championship match.
One reason that in our lives we spend so much time in the performance zone is that our environments often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.
We create social risks for one another, even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning, and I'm not talking about standardized tests.
I mean that every minute of every day, many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake, others will think less of them.
No wonder they're always stressed out and not taking the risks necessary for learning.
But they learn that mistakes are undesirable inadvertently when teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers and reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them to learn from them, or when we look for narrow responses rather than encourage more exploratory thinking that we can all learn from.
When all homework or student work has a number or a letter on it, and counts towards a final grade, rather than being used for practice, mistakes, feedback and revision, we send the message that school is a performance zone.
The same is true in our workplaces.
In the companies I consult with, I often see flawless execution cultures which leaders foster to encourage great work.
But that leads employees to stay within what they know and not try new things, so companies struggle to innovate and improve, and they fall behind.
We can create more spaces for growth by starting conversations with one another about when we want to be in each zone.
What do we want to get better at and how?
And when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes?
That way, we gain clarity about what success is, when, and how to best support one another.
But what if we find ourselves in a chronic high-stakes setting and we feel we can't start those conversations yet?
Then here are three things that we can still do as individuals.
First, we can create low-stakes islands in an otherwise high-stakes sea.
These are spaces where mistakes have little consequence.
For example, we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations or even role-play.
Or we can ask for feedback-oriented meetings as projects progress.
Or we can set aside time to read or watch videos or take online courses.
Those are just some examples.
Second, we can execute and perform as we're expected, but then reflect on what we could do better next time, like Beyoncé does, and we can observe and emulate experts.
The observation, reflection and adjustment is a learning zone.
And finally, we can lead and lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at, by asking questions about what we don't know, by soliciting feedback and by sharing our mistakes and what we've learned from them, so that others can feel safe to do the same.
Real confidence is about modeling ongoing learning.
What if, instead of spending our lives doing, doing, doing, performing, performing, performing, we spent more time exploring, asking, listening, experimenting, reflecting, striving and becoming?
What if we each always had something we were working to improve?
What if we created more low-stakes islands and waters?
And what if we got clear, within ourselves and with our teammates, about when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform, so that our efforts can become more consequential, our improvement never-ending and our best even better?
Thank you.
"You have cancer." Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime, and half will not survive.
This means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives will be diagnosed with some form of cancer, and one will die.
Beyond the physical hardships, roughly one-third of cancer survivors here in the US will go into debt from treatment.
And they're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy than those without cancer.
This disease is pervasive.
It's emotionally draining and, for many, financially destructive.
But a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.
Finding cancer early, closer its genesis, is one of the critical factors to improving treatment options, reducing its emotional impact and minimizing financial burdens.
Most importantly, finding cancer early -- which is one of the primary aims of my research -- greatly enhances your odds of survival.
If we just look at the case of breast cancer for example, we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one have a five-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent -- odds that decrease to just 22 percent if treated at stage four.
And similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer.
Now, we're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate is critical for survival.
The problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive, costly, often inaccurate and they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back.
Still worse, when it comes to some forms of cancer, such as ovarian, liver or pancreatic cancer, good screening methods simply don't exist, meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface, which are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression.
Like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system, there is no alarm to warn, for the danger is already at your doorstep when your odds of survival are greatly reduced.
Having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are affordable, noninvasive and could provide results much sooner, would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer.
An early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake.
And this is exactly what I've been doing.
For the past three years, I've been developing technologies that could ultimately aid clinicians with rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics.
And I've been fueled by a deep scientific curiosity, and a passion to change these statistics.
Last year however, this fight became much more personal when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.
It was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension to these efforts.
I know firsthand how life-altering treatment can be, and I'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc that cancer can wreak on a family, which in our case included our two young daughters.
Because we found it early during a routine mammogram, we were able to focus primarily on treatment options for the localized tumor, reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is.
Unlike other forms of cancer, mammograms do offer an early-stage screening option for breast cancer.
Still, not everyone has this done, or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram.
So, there's still a lot of room for improvement, even for cancers that do have screening options, and, of course, considerable benefits for those that don't.
A key challenge then for cancer researchers is to develop methods that make regular screening for many types of cancers much more accessible.
Imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup, your doctor can take a simple, noninvasive urine sample, or other liquid biopsy, and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor's office.
Such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people who slip through the net of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.
My research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge.
We're working on ways to frequently activate an early-stage cancer alarm by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy so that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges, and before it can progress beyond its infancy.
The silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles, little escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes.
Exosomes are important biomarkers that provide an early-warning system for the development of cancer.
And because they're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid, including blood, urine and saliva, they're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies.
There's just one problem.
An automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available.
We've created a technology that we call nano-DLD that is capable of precisely this: automated exosome isolation to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.
Exosomes are the newest early-warning weapon, if you will, to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.
And they're really, really small.
They measure just 30 to 150 nanometers in diameter.
This is so tiny that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell.
That's roughly the difference between a golf ball and a fine grain piece of sand.
Once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste, it has been found that cells actually communicate by producing and absorbing these exosomes which contain surface receptors, proteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin.
When absorbed by a neighboring cell, exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell, and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression -- some good, and this is where cancer comes in, some bad.
Because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell, and contain a sample of its environment, they provide a genetic snapshot of that cell's health and its origin.
All of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers that potentially allow physicians to eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level.
To catch cancer early, however, you have to frequently intercept these messages to determine when cancer-causing troublemakers within your body decide to start staging a coup, which is why regular screening is so critical and why we're developing technologies to make this possible.
While the first exosome-based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year, they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options.
In addition to their recent emergence, another factor that's limiting their widespread adoption is that currently, no automated exosome isolation system exists to make regular screening economically accessible.
The current gold standard for exosome isolation includes ultracentrifugation, a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment, a trained lab tech and about 30 hours of time to process a sample.
We've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation from a sample such as urine.
We use a chip-based, continuous flow separation technique called deterministic lateral displacement.
And we have done with it what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past 50 years.
